fake markets and return of the â plunge protection teamâ it s amazing what passes as a market these days stocks rallied during the christmas week and the mainstream financial press would like you to believe bargain hunters swooped in after the weeks of heavy selling to grab some deals the truth is there are very few actual people still evaluating the merits of publicly traded companies the markets are driven by programmed trading and central planning the artificial nature of markets was on full display last week let s walk through the series of events steve mnuchin called the ceo s of the six largest banks in america on sunday december 23rd the next day christmas eve mnuchin held a conference call with the working group on financial markets aka the plunge protection team perhaps most of these people were away from their desks because the dow promptly plunged 650 points it appears they were back in the office and ready to go by wednesday the dow rallied almost 1 100 points when trading resumed after the christmas holiday it was the largest single day point gain in history there are currently 505 stocks in the s p 500 index 504 of them closed higher on wednesday so which stock was the one that fell it was newmont mining nyse nem the only precious metals miner included in the index that kind of movement in markets is not driven by swarms of unique investors evaluating the merits of several hundred individual firms and making independent buy and sell decisions it looks more like what you get when a tiny group of wall street bank ceos and the plunge protection team get urgent phone calls from the treasury secretary with serious concerns about falling stock prices given the prevalence of algorithmic trading and the mandate fed bankers have claimed to constantly intervene u s markets may be just as artificial as those in russia at the height of communist control soviet bureaucrats set the price of wheat back then u s bureaucrats and bankers control the prices of stocks and futures market contracts now retail american investors are being deliberately trained the lesson is that stocks have a limited downside and unlimited upside they should always buy certain favored assets and buy more on every dip central bankers and wall street ceos are working together to keep the bubble growing in stock prices and they have given up being discreet about it last week s moves were intended to inspire confidence for those of us who still care about free markets they had the opposite effect by clint siegner moneymetals com clint siegner is a director at money metals exchange perhaps the nation s fastest growing dealer of low premium precious metals coins rounds and bars siegner a graduate of linfield college in oregon puts his experience in business management along with his passion for personal liberty limited government and honest money into the development of money metals brand and reach this includes writing extensively on the bullion markets and their intersection with policy and world affairs 2019 clint siegner all rights reserved disclaimer the above is a matter of opinion provided for general information purposes only and is not intended as investment advice information and analysis above are derived from sources and utilising methods believed to be reliable but we cannot accept responsibility for any losses you may incur as a result of this analysis individuals should consult with their personal financial advisors 2005 2022 the market oracle is a free daily financial markets analysis forecasting online publication
at a conference last month to commemorate the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up president xi jinping underscored the tension between the continuation of that process and the imperative of protecting national security xi recognized that china cannot develop itself in isolation from the world and the world needs china for global prosperity yet he also emphasized that no one is in a position to dictate to the chinese people what should or should not be done there is no doubt the world especially the united states has lately been trying hard to pressure china to make changes the white house triggering the trade conflict and justifying it in national security terms is the most potent example worse on dec 1 the same day that xi and us president donald trump struck a 90 day trade truce meng wanzhou chief financial officer of chinese tech giant huawei was detained in canada at the behest of the us while the us justice department has not clarified the reason for asking the canadian authorities to detain meng it appears to relate to us suspicions that huawei has violated us sanctions against iran but it also likely reflects the technological dimension of the escalating economic and geopolitical competition between the us and china chilling us signal to financial markets in any case the possibility of unexpected restrictions or sanctions on businesses or individuals imposed in the name of national security sharply increases the risks faced by chinese american and other businesses this sends a chilling signal to financial markets there is good reason to hope that china can weather the challenges ahead after all it has endured serious internal and external shocks including the high domestic inflation in the 1980s the asian financial crisis of the 1990s and the 2008 global financial crisis in fact china turned these crises into opportunities the result has been an average annual gdp growth of 9 5 percent compared to a 2 9 percent global average since 1978 which raised china s share of global gdp from 1 8 percent to 18 2 percent and lifted more than 740 million people in china out of poverty as xi emphasized in his speech this success reflects the hard work of the chinese people the innovative practices of chinese businesses and the leadership of the communist party of china the risk today is that the us increasingly hardline america first approach will strengthen china s own hardliners leading to a chain reaction that would be bad for all fear of downward trend increasing such a chain reaction would include a negative downward spiral in global trade and investment dynamics rising trade tensions are already increasing the chances of a synchronized global recession with slower growth in the us china and europe in 2019 besides resistance to china s belt and road initiative which has also been demonized by some us national security hawks could choke off one of the world s few sources of finance for much needed infrastructure and public goods particularly in developing countries china now faces a dilemma to minimize china s vulnerability to external hostility the authorities may need to rethink some elements of their domestic reform agenda from a national security and public goods perspective maintaining a strong state sector emphasizing debt financing and strengthening the cpc s leadership make more sense but to ensure quality growth china must continue working to boost private businesses expand equity financing and advance decentralization thereby spurring competition innovation and job creation xi hopes to balance these imperatives by doubling down on china s growth model with chinese characteristics incorporating lessons from chinese philosophy and history this means consolidating the party s leadership contrary to the us wish in order to maintain a pragmatic flexible and strategic approach to manage systemic risks and address internal concerns and external threats domestically the chinese government will aim to support development that emphasizes boosting productivity and thus delivering innovative coordinated green open and inclusive growth on the international front xi plans to maintain a responsible foreign policy aimed at inclusive global development and resisting hegemony by any single actor in short xi will uphold china s tried and tested deeply pragmatic approach to modernization like so many of his predecessors but unlike many in the west xi understands that there is no simple onetime solution to the challenges ahead as he put it at the 40th anniversary conference we must resolutely

natixis investment managers surveyed 500 global institutional investors including managers of corporate and public pension funds insurance funds and sovereign wealth funds in north america latin america the uk continental europe asia and the middle east the survey revealed that institutional investors are concerned by the impact passive instruments have on market risk and asset pricing two thirds 62 per cent think the popularity of passive investments has increased systemic risk with 61 per cent highlighting that flows into passive strategies have artificially supressed volatility more than half 52 per cent of institutional investors also think passive investing has distorted relative stock prices and risk return trade offs institutional investors are also expressing a preference for active management ahead of anticipated market volatility in 2019 with four in five 80 per cent expecting to see increased market volatility over the next year the same proportion 79 per cent suggest the current market environment will favour active portfolio management a similar response 78 per cent in 2018 investors remain optimistic about returns but have slightly lowered the average return assumption for the year to 6 7 per cent this compares with 7 2 per cent in 2017 louise watson managing director of natixis investment managers in australia said the survey highlights that some of the trends the company has seen on the ground in australia mirror the priorities of institutions globally institutional investors will continue to prioritise active management and investments in private assets to generate sustainable returns in more turbulent times this is coupled with investors concern over the impact passive investments could have on market infrastructure and investment returns we believe that over time passive investments will pose concentration risk which could lead to systemic risk and see them truly tested when the next market downturn occurs she said at the same time greater transparency will show investors the difference between real active management and the closet index trackers imitations looking at 2019 and beyond expected increased market volatility and a more challenging environment for generating yield means there will be a widening distinction between managers who can generate alpha and those who can t
talented people are the driving force behind any effective economic strategy as 2019 begins one of northwest arkansas leading development officials believes attracting and retaining those individuals remains the defining assignment for the region s continued success we re really focused on talent that our companies need here to continue to grow said nelson peacock president and ceo of the northwest arkansas council peacock said as long as northwest arkansas can continue to be attractive and appealing population growth will continue the council estimated a little more than 551 000 residents in mid november lived in the fayetteville springdale rogers metropolitan statistical area msa the region collectively referred to as northwest arkansas while northwest arkansas is not yet among the top 100 msas in the country its rate of growth from july 2016 to july 2017 was faster than 96 of the nation s 100 largest msas along with population growth job growth and wage growth are three top indicators all of those are looking good right now and have been for the past five plus years peacock said based on the projections that we ve seen they all look good going forward peacock said providing necessary training and education opportunities will also be important to stay competitive the council has long identified workforce development programs and career awareness as vital to increasing skilled labor in northwest arkansas in october a grant from the walton family foundation in bentonville allowed the council to hire joe rollins for a newly created position focused on expanding business education partnerships in the region related to that strategy is increasing the university of arkansas economic impact on the region in terms of innovation and commercialization in the 2017 milken institute report concept to commercialization that examined which american research universities were best at technology transfer through licensing and startup activity the ua was ranked no 119 the study was led by ross devol who was recruited and hired last year by the walton foundation to be its chief research officer expenditures and how that relates to the commercialization of technology is an area where and the ua would admit this they have underperformed in recent years peacock said how can we really amp up the economic development capacity at the ua that s going to help us not only develop and attract entrepreneurs and creatives it will also help us diversify our economy in some core areas the walton family charitable support foundation made a 27 3 million gift to the ua in november to recruit researchers and bulk up commercialization efforts according to the most recent data from the national science foundation the ua ranked no 128 in research expenditures with 157 79 million in fiscal year 2017 we ve got a long way to go but i think if you went and talked with the chancellor and others you will see they are excited about the potential there peacock said i think it s a sleeping giant and i think everyone here is excited about the prospects of really cranking that up peacock also said the work will continue in 2019 on engagenwa a four year strategy unveiled in july by the council to foster a multicultural environment ensuring a diverse community is essential to the region s long term economic success demographics are changing nationwide and right here and regions that embrace change and create an environment where everyone can contribute to the highest and best possibility are going to be the ones that succeed he said we have a lot of work we re doing to make sure northwest arkansas does that it s part of our strategy of embracing the change in diversity and really taking advantage of it peacock said the continued effort to recruit a low cost carrier to northwest arkansas regional airport xna is important for the region in 2019 the high cost of airline fares continue to have a downward drag on the economy and quality of life peacock said it s something we have focused on we just haven t had a lot of success he said but we continue to work at it as for policy discussions peacock said he is keeping an eye on any progress in the debate over comprehensive immigration reform unfortunately it really gets political he said we have gaps in our workforce at the highest level through the lowest level in addition to our efforts for workforce training we would like for congress to find a way to get a good smart policy on immigration reform so that we could address some of those shortages here s what leaders in a handful of other sectors had to say about the coming year retail consumers are the key to a strong retail showing predicted for 2019 according to moody s analytics senior economist scott hoyt he expects retailers will enjoy brisk economic tailwinds in 2019 behind a strong labor market that inspires liberal spending and a robust business climate to fuel higher corporate profits the coming 12 months should be a good year for retailers hoyt said core retail sales are expected to grow a healthy 4 7 in 2019 he said consumers appear to be euphoric and happy shoppers will support higher retail sales the fiscal stimulus in the form of tax cuts as well as the tight job market mean there are very few negatives when it comes to consumer fundamentals hoyt said he said the tight labor market has started to positively impact wages and shoppers have a little more cash to spend hoyt said wealthier consumers will support higher price tags in the months ahead hoyt also said retailers will continue to try to increase revenues by boosting prices rather than moving more merchandise in an effort to keep inventory costs down following a trend that began in 2017 the nation s largest retailer walmart inc is expected to grow its total revenues to 526 53 billion next year a gain of 2 6 its u s segment sales are expected to reach 340 billion up from 330 billion this year statista projects u s retail sales of 5 32 trillion in 2019 while the industry expects somewhere between 4 and 4 7 growth some conservative economists believe expansion is poised to slow a bit as 2019 progresses and the economy navigates more interest rate hikes and trade friction with china construction the construction industry in northwest arkansas is expected to remain strong in 2019 said bill roachell president of trade group associated builders contractors of arkansas it s unbelievable the amount of work going on up there roachell said all the members i ve talked to seem to have a good backlog of work i look for the next couple of years honestly for work in northwest arkansas to be extremely strong contractors are seeing their northwest arkansas offices outperform their central arkansas offices as they have more work there than in central arkansas he said one of the key metrics roachell follows is the backlog indicator released by nationwide trade organization associated builders contractors abc and it shows the amount of work being formed by contractors in the south the backlog is 11 18 months about 10 of the work under contract is commercial and institutional work and infrastructure accounts for another 10 of the work roachell expects to see more infrastructure work in 2019 and the trade group is part of a coalition looking to work with the governor on a highway funding bill for the next legislative session nationwide the industry is experiencing a workforce shortage of nearly 500 000 positions leading wages to rise also rising interest rates have increased materials prices rose 7 9 in october from the same month in 2017 and the workforce shortage is expected to continue in 2019 said anirban basu abc chief economist in arkansas the construction unemployment rate was 5 6 in october and was tied with kentucky for the third highest rate in the united states but the october rate hasn t been lower since 2006 when it was 5 transportation the industry has been strong over the past several years and looks to be leveling off said john kent clinical associate professor in the department of supply chain management in the sam m walton college of business at the university of arkansas the number of new truck orders is a key metric kent follows to show how the industry is doing and north american orders of class 8 trucks the largest truck class declined 15 to 27 900 trucks in november from the same month in 2017 according to analyst act research based on the stock market based on the confusion in the marketplace global trade there s a lot of uncertainty kent said and uncertainty would be another reason for tapping the break on placing new truck orders besides just we re going into the first quarter and that typically is a slower quarter kent explained the transportation industry is a leading indicator of how the economy is doing and other metrics he follows include consumer buying and retail and the institute for supply management s manufacturing purchasing managers index which offers an upstream view of the supply chain as it relates to manufacturing the capacity to haul freight has been tight in 2018 and he said it s starting to loosen he expects the driver shortage to remain an issue in 2019 but as capacity becomes less tight the number of trucks falls and fewer drivers are needed driver demand likely won t be as high also rates aren t expected to continue to rise as they have been over the past several years with the economy potentially cooling off a bit i think rates will level out kent said and the shippers will have a little more leverage residential real estate home sales are expected to drop 2 nationally next year according to a 2019 housing forecast released in late november by realtor com the group says rising interest rates 5 5 30 year fixed by year s end and home prices will make it more difficult to buy or sell a home a separate housing survey released by fannie mae also determined that only one in five americans think it is a good time to buy a home as for northwest arkansas the market is poised for another year of gains largely for one reason population growth as long as we continue to have people move to northwest arkansas that creates a real estate market said jonathan moore outgoing board president of the northwest arkansas board of realtors it s still going to be a seller s market at least in the beginning of the year because of our inventory that may ease somewhat as more construction is done but i really expect a good market moore a realtor with lindsey associates in rogers for the past 23 years said the overall average sales price of a home in benton county is up about 5 5 this year in washington county the growth is about 7 5 it s a basic economic principle when supply is low prices go up he said it s the nature of real estate moore noted the housing inventory in the market is about three or four months a six month inventory is a good steady market and we re under that he said banking a steady uptick in interest rates to keep the economy on a normalized pace has bankers closely watching moves by the federal reserve with four fed fund rate hikes in 2018 federal officials have hinted that more may be on the way in 2019 while the feds suggest it may be as few as two bofa merrill lynch predicts up to four interest rate hikes could be coming as regulators do their part to balance steady gdp growth low unemployment and inflationary pressures against a slowing national housing market financial institutions have had consistently strong earnings growth especially in the past two years as regulatory relief and a stimulus from corporate tax cuts have helped bottom line growth but that may dissipate next year consumers are doing their part with spending thanks to low unemployment that has added to incomes rising interest rates however could cool spending for bigger ticket items such as homes cars or major appliances with consumer spending accounting for nearly two thirds of all economic activity bankers will be watching monthly reports on the spending front as well as consumer confidence additionally factors far beyond the control of local banks may make or break some institutions profitability margins tariff and trade concerns have produced a series of new winners and losers in the u s economy for instance agriculture and manufacturing two areas of utmost importance in arkansas have been roiled by the international tariff wars the steel industry is seeing a boon from the change in trade policy but that has also inflated costs for construction that residential and commercial builders contend will curtail activity in the near future lastly disruptive technologies continue to challenge banks as fintech companies create new ways to conduct commerce banks that can t adapt will see some small erosion in market share for interest and non interest income streams that have been the bread and butter of the industry editor s note with reporting from roby brock jeff della rosa paul gatling and kim souza

2 asx s 2018 the asx200 fared slightly better on the surface although that may have in some way been supported by a much weaker australian dollar the asx200 was off 6 90 per cent in local currency terms but when adjusted for currency fluctuations and denominated in us dollars the local index lost 15 93 per cent for the year furthermore in what comes as little surprise given the geopolitical backdrop chinese equities were among the worst performing finishing well in bear market territory with a 25 31 per cent loss for the year 1 the final day of the year the final trading day of the year ended in a generally positive return for global stocks but it was on low volumes little material difference in the market narrative and capped off global equity s worst month since the gfc the year of 2018 belonged to the bears it now seems even despite the numerous records that fell on wall street across the major indices the s p500 found itself 6 24 per cent lower for the year the ftse100 was down 12 48 per cent and the dax closed 18 26 in the red the first trading day of the new year looks to be a gloomy one with the asx poised to continue on its end of 2018 swoon futures are pointing to a 46 point drop at the open somewhat unlike our us counterparts asx growth sectors remained the best performing for the local market the healthcare sector led by biotech giants like csl held onto 17 33 per cent returns in 2018 while the smaller information technology sector registered a more modest 5 50 per cent gain tellingly for the asx200 the heavy weighted materials and financials sector were off with the latter shedding 14 78 per cent for the year 3 the return of volatility if the year had to be summed up in a neat phrase perhaps in the spirit of a b grade straight to dvd horror movie sequel it might be the return of volatility the trend has been pointing this way for several years however last year exhibited arguably the first signs of how markets will from now on behave in the post easy money era the vix closed on monday at a more subdued 25 42 having pulled back from the 36 mark earlier on in the week some peace and quiet or at least as much as we could possibly get from the twitterer in chief helped settled some nerves especially as it relates institutional instability in washington however with less liquidity in the system choppy trade like we saw in 2018 will likely remain the norm 4 the fed s us economy it s because of the us federal reserve that all of this is so and any big picture predictions for 2019 as futile as they often can be must be rooted in an assessment of fed policy the fed hiked 4 times last year as a red hot us economy galvanized by tax cuts and end of cycle activity delivered to the central bank the fundamental data they long craved the labour market in the us is still incredibly tight with the unemployment rate holding strong at 3 7 per cent annualised growth above trend at 3 per cent and inflation finally hitting the 2 per cent mark supported by a long awaited lift in wage growth with these number the us economy diverging from the rest of the global economy was as strong as its been for a decade

a question i am repeatedly asked is should i buy shares when a company floats on the stock exchange to be frank the risks of investing in an initial public offering ipo are very high when you buy into an ipo you may as well flip a coin because you have a 50 50 chance that your investment will be worth less than what you paid within the first 12 months and some stocks will never recover back to their list price no matter how much you hope and pray a 50 chance of success in a trade is not even close to the probability you need before you invest i always recommend that you only ever enter a trade where your probability of success is 70 or greater but how you determine this is the topic of a future article many companies trade sharply higher when they initially list as speculators buy in to make quick gains before selling out the same day or within a few weeks of the company listing this often drives the price swiftly lower which is the sort of volatility most investors are not prepared for putting your money into a company that hasn t been tested on the market is an unnecessary risk to add to your portfolio not only are you risking your capital you risk losing any solid gains you have generated from quality companies in your portfolio that have demonstrated a track record in the market it s not easy even for a savvy investor to pick the stocks that are likely to be successful as the marketing material you receive prior to the float is just that marketing when a company floats on the stock exchange they are required to disclose all relevant information in a prospectus for investors to understand the offer this includes information about the business an overview of the listing its operations financials dividend policies key risks investment and industry overviews and much more it is then the australian securities and investments commission s asic responsibility to review the prospectuses to assess whether it is legal asic states that it doesn t endorse approve or verify the content of prospectuses and if a company fails to disclose information that may hinder the offer asic is not responsible it also states that investing in an ipo can be risky so you need to ensure you do plenty of research so it doesn t matter what you read and how good the marketing looks or whether a broker believes that the company has great prospects for growth the proof is in the pudding once the stock trades on the market it is for this reason i always recommend that it is better to test the company s worth by seeing how it trades on the market for a year or two that way if there are any skeletons in the closet they ll come out when a company lists on the stock exchange the business gains access to much needed capital to expand and grow earnings and in some cases to pay down debt history demonstrates that for many companies the decision to list on the stock exchange eventually proves lucrative although there are many companies that are left battered and bruised or disappear altogether years after listing the major risk for companies that do list is there s no hiding from the sharks companies that fail to achieve forecasts for growth are at the mercy of the market and the consequence of disappointing the market can be brutal given that a lot of companies that list are not highly liquid so it doesn t take a large amount of shares to be sold to cause the price to fall i suggest that investors be patient and not get drawn into a get rich quick mindset which occurs with ipos instead you are better off investing your hard earned savings in bigger more liquid companies that said if you insist on investing in an ipo remember one of my golden rules is to never invest more than 10 of your total portfolio in any high risk investment more importantly before you put your money at risk you need to decide on your rules as to when to take profits you also need to be clear on the maximum amount you are prepared to risk before you sell the shares to protect your capital if the stock falls below the list price now let s take a look at a number of australian ipo s that had their debut in 2018 top performing ipos in 2018 adriatic metals plc adt adriatic metals listed in may at 0 20 per share and was one of the biggest miners to list this year adt traded down by around 15 in the first month however since the low the stock has risen over 260 and is still looking strong adt is a uk based exploration and development company with a market cap of 61 million the company operates predominately in mineral exploration in bosnia and herzegovina and has discovered minerals such as zinc lead silver gold barium sulphate and copper just because a stock has risen strongly doesn t mean it will continue to rise however adt is a stock to watch clearvue technologies cpv clearvue technologies predominant business is in renewable energy via industrial products one of the company s most successful ventures has been in developing windows that are able to generate commercial solar power clearvue technologies listed in june after a successful 10 million capital raising the company initially listed at 0 245 but in the first month the stock fell heavily by 46 however news of technological breakthroughs in solar energy resulted in the price rising by more than 640 to 0 83 although it fell quickly by more than 60 and is currently trading at around 0 32 this is a really good example of how volatile new listings can be you may be hoping the price will recover to the recent high however it may not either way the most important thing investors can do is have a plan to exit elixinol global exl elixinol global is a manufacturer of industrial hemp and early stage medical cannabis with the company involved in the importation cultivation manufacture and distribution of these products after listing at 1 00 in january elixinol first traded on the asx at 1 75 since that first trade it rose to a high of 2 57 in december before closing at 2 50 for the year for a 42 69 gain therefore shareholders have justification to hold for now

on dec 18th it was agreed that donald trump s charitable foundation would be dissolved the decision was reached as a result of findings that donald trump and his family abused the tax exempt status and abused campaign finance laws the lawsuit is not over a decision on 2 8 million in restitution and penalties as well as possible permanent ban against trump and three of his children serving on nonprofits in new york still needs to be reached given what was described by the state s attorney general office as a shocking pattern of illegality involving the trump foundation including unlawful coordination with the trump presidential campaign repeated and willful self dealing and much more this amounted to the trump foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve mr trump s business and political interests one hopes they are prevented from betraying the public s trust in the future one might ask what does this mean trump is selfish and willing do whatever it takes to get what he wants for himself his favorite tool is dishonesty it is all purpose he lies all the time in his version of winning the public s loss is his gain and we ve been big league losing reflecting on the dissolution of his corrupt trump foundation as with so much of his storied career of dishonesty reveals an ingenious ability to deceive unfettered by any moral decorum his absolute willingness to betray he is proof in financial terms that in this broken system cheaters do win and he publicly brags that he doesn t pay his debts because he is smart on dec 21st his nearsightedness emerges with even greater clarity in order to secure 5 billion in funding for a completely unnecessary border wall trump is willing to shut down the government just in time for christmas forget the fact people don t want it and that it cannot get the votes to pass the cost to taxpayers for a government shutdown is 6 5 billion per week it is a repetition of his coercive practice trump has regularly used this terrorist tactic earlier this year in an effort to block funding for the children s health insurance program is one example but what if it is all much much worse trump is making everyone pay a huge price his nuclear bomb on the economy could very well be another stunt he has called himself a debt master so i wouldn t doubt that he has plans he seems to have learned that destruction is easier than creation decades ago he stole fortunes and left people in ruins by not paying his own bills his echo chamber continues to get scarier sect of defense mattis has just resigned in protest to what is ultimately trump s complete refusal to acknowledge expertise as he makes supreme mistakes in policy decisions putin and assad are celebrating the victory trump has gifted them this week is it his ego does he fill his emptiness by seeing that his lies on twitter can make a complete rollercoaster out of the stock market when he bragged about accomplishments in china a couple weeks ago investors were optimistic but when his lies were revealed for what they were the market plummeted or is it revenge the reality that he is not above the law is likely setting in trump and kids are threatened with serving jail time for their corruption and other crimes is this just his way of lashing out against the people he sees as having done this to him he has ushered in the worst december since the great depression i honestly don t know his intentions i d guess with the first that he is fully prepared to devastate the nation in securing greater personal fortune but that is only because he has lived his whole life with complete disregard for others i am scared because he has truly mastered the craft of selfishness and at least for the office of the president he is running out of time this all begs the question does donald trump wield too much power ought we rethink the destructive force of a single individual trump s singular focus appears to be wealth and his administration shows a willingness to break and bend rules to achieve goals but it could be worse foreign emoluments are a big deal because they suggest conflicts of interest in making decisions as head of the state but what about flat out selfishness it is time that we face the ugly truth that selfish interest and military power are deadly combination we may never know how many soldiers have been killed or terrorists recruited as a direct result of trump s self serving tweets his lies have consequences the worst of which are experienced by others what if he decided to support his base and bomb the caravan like many of them request about his make believe invasion we also never thought a president would tell 6 420 lies and misstatements in 649 days in office it just seems unthinkable that such a corrupt individual could wield so much power and maybe it is more power than a single person should have ever held do we really trust trump to resist deploying the military if he thinks it will be good for his investments it isn t just a matter of convincing ourselves that a serial liar will live up to the oath of office every indication suggests the only work he has done as president has been to serve himself he s only ever been faithful to himself dedicated public servants like mattis with four decades of service cannot do it and it is time to consider the horrific possibility that a single trump mistake could end life as we know it it wasn t good democracy but at least we thought there were adults in the room to restrain a tantrum but they re all disappearing we have a corrupt administration and we should seriously limit the disastrous potential of such an administration or any other if we survive we should take the steps to protect future generations it is just too much that life and death are abused in pursuit of selfish interests what if he thinks starting a war could help him win an election or protect him from investigation what if he decided to go out with a

rio de janeiro just over four months ago jair bolsonaro was fighting for his life after being stabbed in the gut during a presidential campaign rally on tuesday after a quick recovery and an unlikely victory he was sworn in as brazil s president steering latin america s largest nation far to the right in a political shift that was evident even during his inauguration as he addressed a crowd from the presidential palace amid unusually tight security that underscored his worry about a new assassination attempt mr bolsonaro waved a brazilian flag and proclaimed that on that day brazilians were being freed from socialism the country s flag would never be red again he said alluding to the rival workers party as he stood next to his wife and vice president hamilton mourão even if it takes our blood to keep it green and yellow the workers party which had won the last four presidential elections was crushed in the october vote after the country slipped into recession violence soared and corruption scandals tarred much of the elite it boycotted the swearing in ceremony reflecting the lingering bitterness of a presidential race that polarized brazilians like none other in recent history
secular catalysts should help this chipmaker beat the broad market downturn for semiconductor stocks 2018 turned out to be a forgettable year thanks to headwinds such as weak chip demand and the u s china trade war as of this writing the philadelphia semiconductor sector index has lost around 4 of its value in 2018 and it looks as if the market won t be picking up a lot of momentum in 2019 either ihs markit predicts that semiconductor sales will increase just 4 in 2019 down from 2018 s estimated growth rate of nearly 15 however analog devices adi 0 49 has weathered the chip industry slowdown with its stock flat so far this year which showcases its resilience in the face of the broad market weakness but it won t be surprising if analog breaks out in the new year as it is going after markets with a lot of growth potential and also pays a nice dividend that it has been raising consistently for the past 14 years let s see why this underrated chipmaker should be on your new year s shopping list all set to level up analog devices is coming off a solid year the company s revenue shot up 19 in fiscal year 2018 which ended on nov 3 while net income more than doubled on the back of impressive growth in its margins analog s 15 billion acquisition of linear technology completed in march 2017 was the biggest catalyst behind this attractive financial growth analog spent handsomely on linear because the latter complements its existing businesses in fact the combined company achieved 150 million in cost synergies in fiscal 2018 and it is now looking to save another 100 million in costs going forward by reducing its manufacturing footprint but that s not the only upside that analog is looking to achieve according to ceo vincent roche given the complementarity of our combined product portfolio and customer relationships we re increasingly confident in our objective to double ltc s revenue growth over the next few years we exit 2018 in a stronger position than we ve ever been and are extremely well prepared strategically and operationally to grow and take market share in 2019 and indeed beyond for instance analog is now in a stronger position to tap the growing demand for semiconductors in the industrial sector ihs markit points out that after the linear technology acquisition analog became the second largest industrial semiconductor provider after texas instruments that s a nice position to be in as industrial semiconductor sales increased nearly 12 in 2017 and the industry is expected to keep growing at a compound annual growth rate of 7 1 through 2022 not surprisingly analog devices is going aggressively after this opportunity it recently announced a range of solutions aimed at helping industrial equipment oems original equipment manufacturers move toward automation faster for instance analog s condition based monitoring system aims to improve machine productivity by reducing downtime in industrial and transport equipment the chipmaker uses its sensor technology to monitor early signs of failure or fatigue helping factory managers carry out preventive maintenance and boost productivity these solutions will help analog tap into fast growing niches of the industrial semiconductor market such as factory automation which is expected to grow at 8 8 a year through 2025 this bodes well for analog as it gets half of its revenue from the industrial business at the same time its bottom line is on track to improve thanks to the higher margin profile since the linear technology acquisition analog devices exited 2018 with a gross margin of 68 3 which is a massive jump from the prior year period s 59 9 looking ahead analog s margin performance will improve further on the realization of more cost synergies a stronger dividend i have already mentioned that analog has a solid dividend payout history which is unlikely to change because the catalysts analog enjoys should boost its bottom line more importantly the company is committed to returning all of its free cash flow to shareholders after debt repayments and that s an important reason its dividend payments have increased over the past year looking ahead analog s earnings are expected to get better as evident from the chart below it won t be surprising to see the company s free cash flow profile improving this should allow it to sustain its dividend hikes and boost the yield that already sits at an impressive 2 22 ahead of the tech sector s average yield of just 1 08 finally the stock trades at just 15 times next year s earnings which is half of the company s five year average price to earnings ratio so investors looking for a nice dividend paying tech stock that will help them take advantage of secular growth trends in the semiconductor industry should definitely take a look at analog devices check out the latest analog devices earnings call transcript

top comments turns out i received quality over quantity so instead of doing a list of top 10 comments like i did for 2017 i decided to make it a list of 15 this time because i still think it is important to validate those comments that come through to either challenge enhance or re echo your thinking and we ll do that today by celebrating my readers with this list of my top 15 comments of 2018 15 ayo on this year do the one thing at the end of my first article of last year i posed a question to readers what is the one thing you can pursue from today such that seeking after it for the rest of your life would cause all other things on your list to be added unto you and ayo s response was just great here it is hmm well written seek the kingdom of god the only one thing that will add other things to you thank you akanna for this timely reminder 14 graceofgod on 4 steps to personal growth i personally love reading responses from this particular reader because of the blessings always directed my way here s one with even more than that here s one with self realization and a willingness to change akanna okeke good afternoon sir i really want to say thank you for the effort you put to write such instructive articles may god continue to bless you so that you can share the knowledges with us thank you from the bottom of my heart for this great piece i need to focus on one area from now on and i want to start with my no nonsense attitude do not get me wrong i do not offend others just like that i do not look for trouble but if you look for my trouble i just give it to you double double even though i knew i reacted wrongly to provocations i never really tried to adjust by responding to provocations i am a child of god even though not perfect and i must make my heavenly father proud of me by responding the right way without being disrespectful even if they hurt me first god you know i cannot do it without you i have the will please grant me the strength to achieve this goal i apologize in advance for my story thanks again and let us try to stay polite when we do not share the same opinion after all nobody knows or has it all may god bless and protect all of you in jesus name i prayed amen 13 frida on don t be the exception be the example part 2 great article i hardly get anything on a platter of gold i used to envy people who seemingly got things effortlessly but i ve come to realize that if handled well failure can be an advantage and can actually make one stronger good take away from frida on this one and my response was thanks frida seems you re more like biodun in the story while aityspecial with the comment above yours is more like alex in this story yes your failures will make you stronger as long as you re willing to rise again after evaluating your fall evaluation makes the difference it would be foolhardy to rise after a devastating fall only to get knocked down again but once you evaluate you can rise up in a different position with a different mindset and obtain excellent results keep growing stronger 12 weezy on lessons from beth moore s book so long insecurity in general i agree about the message to become secure in your own self but i get really uncomfortable with people writing about all women like all are the same so i have to give a side eye to both the preacher on the tv and beth moore s liberal use of we akanna would you agree that the following men might want different things from the woman in his life 35 year old member of the saudi royal family donald trump prince harry a 27 year old mckinsey consultant in lagos your mechanic your grandfather for instance prince harry did not insist on meghan saying she will obey him in her wedding vows but donald might like that no one can speak for all or even most women to say what we like or what our experience is no matter how many books they may sell there are billions of us in different cultures and different economies different races and levels of education and different ages a 23 year old and a 60 year old are both women recently i heard a pastor reference the saying the way to a man s heart is through his stomach and the pastor said that is not the way to my own heart if i want a good meal i can go to a restaurant his point was that while he appreciates good food that is not the most important thing that got him his own wife me personally i want to be seen as beautiful but that is not the most important thing i want to be seen as wise resilient loyal fascinating and kind feminism is the radical idea that women are people too as long as both women and men treat us like a monolith with the same nature s and desires we will always have feminism this comment got a response from another reader called elle before i could get to give my response so i ll highlight both responses here here s elle s response but you will agree that there are certain traits shared by majority of women and generally there are commonalities in both genders so yes not every woman is the same but there are many common shared traits and my response was elle is right weezy if i were to consider every woman i would be writing about 3 billion articles per topic since that s not humanly possible those who need to convey strong points look for the general characteristics of a group and address them while not trivializing the individual differences statistics exists as a discipline today because of this possibility and we all know how useful stats are in helping us make crucial decisions the message is actually not to be secure in your own self because you too are human and can therefore disappoint yourself but to be secure in your maker god has created you to be individually unique as well as collectively useful he has made us to understand that everyone is equal in value and different in roles once we understand that truth and play the specific roles that he wants us to both as groups and as individuals there would be no need for any one group to radically have to prove that they are as valuable too because everything would be working better and in a more orderly fashion and this once again will be reflected in the statistics the general numbers that generally don t lie 11 mz_daniels on don t be the exception be the example part 1 our relationship with our siblings is sometimes an indication of the kind of parent spouse we will be you re a popular elder bro and your popularity couldn t rub off on your younger one big bro should have just taken younger one under his wings everywhere he went found his younger brother s strength and highlighted it used his popularity to get people to say positive things about his bro some things are caught not taught this guy shouldn t be surprised he s a bad parent comes across as someone who is all about himself and shining alone he lacks the generous spirit required to be a good parent my apprentice psychology for the day has ended and my response to this was very good points you ve made mz_danielz a generous spirit is actually required to be a good parent it requires thinking less about yourself and more about those under your care and life prepares us for that or not 10 stacy_kema on what love language do you speak i definitely know that my love language is receiving gifts no matter how small i also love giving gifts but my bf hmm i don t know what his love language is the last time i sent a surprise birthday gift all the way from nigeria to india my guy received it and said they were inferior before saying thank you those words pierced my heart i was so hurt so i decided no more gifts stacy_kema s comment got a response from another reader called wonder and i thought it was a good enough response to highlight aww e hugs dear he should ve known to say thank you first and keep his thoughts on the quality to himself in addition to what the poster wrote whatever love language your significant other speaks appreciate it even if it s not your primary love language then in a loving way let them know how you would like to be loved 9 frida on my top 10 books so far two books that changed my life 1 the 7 habits of highly effective people i read this book at the age of 13 yrs it shaped my life 2 how to stop worrying and start living by dale carnegie read this book while in my early twenties during this period i had to make a lot of life changing decisions and was sick with worry and anxiety that i d make a mistake there you go two books for you to read this year 8 ephi on the groomsmen i like this because it re echoes an important point from the article one of the marks of a personally grown well adjusted individual is their ability to get along with all manner of people with different values personalities and backgrounds while still holding on to their own values and beliefs and not being easily swayed great article akanna i only just learnt this lesson recently very hard lesson to learn but necessary also the book recommendations you provided in the top 10 books article have been immensely helpful thank you can we have an updated list sometime later please 7 lola on show me your friends what i love the most about this topic is that you could share the word of god with one another as friends i mean do we still have such reasonable intentional positive worthwhile people who would come together to do such and not feel it s boring or outdated or gather to gossip and talk about boyfriends or how a party went hmmm am in awe i love your friends already i wish i could be jealous but it s your blessing please keep them close and keep it up we live in a time where as a christian sometimes you feel like wait a minute am i the only one left in this world that will not compromise because the wrong things and abnormal lifestyles is becoming a norm 6 funmilola on 10 wise sayings you can t read the books of proverbs and not be changed or inspired the saying by mum when she taught me about sex nkan ti o ni je fa fi ru mu do not smell what you re not ready to eat and the saying by aunt when i was going through depressing moments and i was trying to compare myself with others ma wo ago alago sise i shouldn t set my time by other s clock our destines and journeys in life are different these wise sayings are ingrained in my memory i can t forget them 5 marian on so this is my love language in this article i asked my readers for advice on how to navigate my long distance relationship i got quite a handful of helpful words marian s advice was very practical you have to first love and accept each other the way you are i say that because after i do over familiarity kicks in and it s so much harder to put in the work and speak the other persons love language that s why communication is important if one party feels like their love tank is low he she has to speak up she is also the best person to help you out pay attention to what she nags complains about and ask her to always speak up if there is something she wants you to do more of as per the physical touch send her one of your t shirt sprayed with your cologne and she can turn it into a sleepwear if she wears the same size as you maybe throw in a boxer too send her random pictures you eating lunch doing something at work during the day to share a part of your day with her whatsapp lets you record videos now 4 kike on the 3 things you need to thrive well done akanna i would say a good atmosphere i e staying around positive people is good but most importantly everyone should know that having jesus christ inside of you is enough to make you thrive anywhere because you are a power house now and as a christian no environment positive or negative can change your mindset because your mental stamina and motivation comes from within as my pastor once said we change our environment it doesn t change us that is if you know your new identity in christ jesus so most importantly let your power come from within i e christ in you we are not like others who run from darkness we are there to change it but having christian friends as you are a christian is not negotiable i once thought i was never going to set my foot in america because i believe they are way too rotten and decayed a country but i sat myself down with the word of god and changed that mindset now i change things because i carry an agent of change which is the holy spirit so it doesn t matter how stock prices go or if there s a fall in dollar i always stay on top and my response to this was very beautiful kike thanks for sharing i like that you know that having christian friends is still non negotiable because evil communication still corrupts good manners keep on being the change agent that you are 3 lamzie on don t be street smart be wise i like this comment because it was written in somewhat disagreement but was very cordial at the same time i had mixed feelings when i read this because for the best part of my life i m 38 i intentionally took the position that wisdom excludes street smartness and i had to learn the hard way that being street smart is actually a big part of being wise so like ex illiterate mentioned above i strongly agree that it is actually wisdom to be street smart guess what even jesus taught his disciples to be street wise they had been with him for sometime and he had brought them up to take the nature of sheep but as soon as it was time for them to go into the world on their own the advice he gave them was simple be wise as a serpent behold i send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves matthew 10 16 kjv the niv says shrewd as snakes and as innocent as doves the serpent is street wise jesus was saying in order for his disciples to make it in the world of wolves they as sheep must take on the wisdom of a serpent while ensuring they do not lose themselves in the process this is what wisdom is urban dictionary is on point with the definition your family is right jesus is most definitely right wisdom is profitable for direction i didn t get the chance to respond to this comment because it came long after the article was published if i had the chance to respond now i would say something like being wise trumps being smart god s kind of wisdom gives us the discernment to know even how to act on the streets without having to go through the rough experiences that teach street smarts and that is what jesus was passing on to his disciples wisdom 2 susi cho on don t be street smart be wise this one kind of buttresses and amplifies my response to 3 above so i definitely like it akanna xie xie i want to say really it takes lots of courage to write the truth especially in times like this when the abnormal has become the normal i pray god gives you more wisdom to keep writing words that will change people just like francine rivers but in your own unique way when we talk about god s wisdom it s only those with the spirit of god that can understand my friend who is an accountant recently was asked by her boss to change the original amount of money meant to be entered to a lesser amount here the street wisdom will say ohh it s your boss do it so you don t get fired but i told my friend she shouldn t and she should rather get fired with honour trust me not everyone will understand this so it s a choice and i have heard of people who actually chose the god wisdom and suffered severely this experience would make them think they should have chosen the former lols it is well 1 arcturus on 3 sources of insecurity and now for the number one i chose this one because of the openness and sincerity it conveys it s definitely a good first step in becoming your better self because i ve been treated badly by people i ve truly cared for and shown love i m insecure about people s intentions and act ruthless and uncaring i find it hard expressing feeling because of the risk that it wouldn t be received well having an extra year while my mates and close friends graduated makes me insecure about my smarts i tend to overcompensate and over show my intelligence i m also cynical when i m at a high knowledge position i also relate to not feeling cool enough and that reflects on how i m quick to judge people as dead or razz growing up in a family that doesn t express love it s always weird saying i love you even when i truly feel it also growing up with constant harsh criticisms makes me over critical of people this comes of me hating or resenting people i care about pheeew that felt good and my response to this was wow arcturus you re so in touch with your inner self i think you re in such a good place because you re able to identify your insecurities their sources and comfortable enough to discuss them what s left is to root them out if you haven t started that process already the book helps it s helping me see how to respond appropriately to insecurities and i m almost at the point where she lays out how to root them out i think you should read the book way to go feeling good hope you enjoyed reading these comments and learnt a lot from them just like i did this year 2019 i encourage you to read more study more and engage in more personal development then come on here and bless me with your well thought out comments wishing you a happy new year

by rfa by michael lelyveld have foreign investors lost interest in china based on the latest official figures it appears that investors may be holding back until the outcome of the trade war with the united states becomes known as with much of the official data in china the evidence is clouded fragmented and inconclusive yet despite the uncertainties over chinese statistics it seems clear that foreign investment growth has fallen far below the double digit rates of a decade ago some reports have been quick to cite a sharp deterioration in business confidence among china investors following a steep drop in november s foreign direct investment fdi reported by the ministry of commerce moc fdi for the month plunged 26 3 percent from a year earlier to 92 1 billion yuan the moc said in december the november decline looked even worse in dollar terms as u s 13 6 billion of fdi fell 27 6 percent year on year the official xinhua news agency said investors in china were spooked by fears of more tariff increases at a time of high uncertainty about the impact the dispute was having on china s economy the south china morning post reported on dec 13 given the prospect of additional tariffs foreign companies are afraid to invest in china now the paper quoted shen jianguang chief economist at jd finance in beijing as saying as evidence of the cooling trend the report cited a recent decision by california based camera maker gopro inc to move some production out of china and a reported plan by south korea s samsung group to close a smartphone factory in the northeastern city of tianjin base effect argument the fdi results were perhaps the worst of the economic figures released for the month which was generally marked by a slowdown of growth rather than absolute declines the moc had a ready explanation for the poor monthly showing on fdi noting the high base of comparison with a surge of investment recorded in november 2017 a check of the record appears to support the base effect argument since the moc reported a 90 7 percent jump in fdi a year earlier although there has been no explanation for the sudden increase fdi for the full year rose at a much milder 7 9 percent rate in yuan terms boosting the total to a record high but 11 month fdi numbers for 2018 are significantly lower dropping 1 3 percent from a year earlier to 793 3 billion yuan and rising only 1 1 percent in dollar terms to u s 121 3 billion the moc said xinhua called the fdi inflows for the 11 month period basically stable loss of confidence in china may be one explanation for the falloff investors may also be waiting to see what new opportunities emerge from negotiations with the united states before making commitments if that is the case fdi growth could rebound in 2019 reasons for caution derek scissors an asia economist and resident scholar at the american enterprise institute in washington noted several likely causes of the apparent slump but also reasons for caution in drawing conclusions changes in monthly fdi numbers can be driven by a single disbursal no repeat a year later and there s a crash he said by email warning against over interpreting the results fdi numbers are often a product of chinese money sent overseas coming back said scissors in that case there may be variable effects from government policies and capital controls the moc report suggests that fdi totals are the result of many smaller investments rather than big headline deals in the 11 month period the agency recorded 54 703 new overseas funded ventures an increase of 77 5 percent but scissors believes that true foreign money is declining faster than 1 1 percent why because china s economy has been slowing he said official statements from the government and the chinese communist party ccp have stressed resilience in the face of economic pressures but growth rates were already on a steady decline before the trade war with washington accelerated the slide many economists say the slowdown is the worst since the global financial crisis a decade ago the new york times reported on dec 14 it may be too soon to see an impact from shifts in u s tariff policy or the mild market access concessions that china has announced so far said scissors my guess is that new or existing potential investors are inactive and waiting for clarity he said over the past year china has outlined plans to ease investment curbs for a limited number of sectors last april the government took the first step in the auto sector ending foreign share limits for manufacturers of new energy vehicles nevs and gradually allowing majority ownership of joint ventures for other car makers in the next several years in june the government announced more opening up measures with a long awaited revision of its negative list trimming the number of sectors off limits to foreign investors from 63 to 48 the new list offered 22 measures to phase out prohibitions in finance transportation professional services infrastructure energy resources and agriculture state media said the government has promised that more access for foreign investment is on the way on dec 23 an moc official told xinhua that the negative list is likely to be shortened further in 2019 in the past week the standing committee of the national people s congress took steps to unify china s legislation on foreign investment which is currently covered by three separate laws under the new draft law foreign companies would receive pre established national treatment and have equal rights to participate in activities including issuing stock and government procurement xinhua said on dec 23 and in an apparent scramble to signal concessions before expected tariff talks in january the government announced new deletions from its separate market access negative list on dec 25 the new list for market access would cut 177 items leaving 151 restrictions and eliminate 288 specific rules while 581 remain in place xinhua said response from investors but the response from investors until now has been underwhelming there have been few takers for the breaks in the automotive sector so far despite initial enthusiasm most foreign automakers have decided to stand pat with their local partners after investing heavily in their existing arrangements in any case the changes for passenger car joint ventures would not be allowed until 2022 a further complication is that the investment break comes just in time for a downturn in the auto market some recently opened factories are already standing idle the wall street journal reported this week the government also plans to open the financial sector with eased limits for banks asset managers investment firms and insurers under new rules announced in may this week the official english language china daily reported that international firms are rushing to apply for business licenses to take advantage of the asset management opportunities one reported investment in financial services follows the recent approval for swiss based ubs group ag to raise its share in its chinese brokerage joint venture from 24 99 percent to 51 percent the decision is notable in light of the company s reported warning in october to some of its bankers not to travel to china after a singapore based employee was detained and prevented from leaving the country ubs has not commented on the matter according to news agencies in a statement carried by xinhua on dec 1 ceo sergio ermotti stressed the company s long term commitment to the chinese market the further opening up of china s financial sector represents great opportunities for our wealth management investment bank and asset management businesses ermotti said risk will continue while the attractions for foreign investment are likely to continue so will the risks china s tit for tat detentions of three canadian citizens followed the detention of huawei technologies cfo meng wanzhou in vancouver at the request of u s prosecutors further complicating prospects for international business scissors said it is too soon to tell whether the cases will affect investment decisions there s not enough of a detention pattern for it to matter yet he said economic growth rates and opportunities may be the biggest factors for fdi recovery in the coming year but far more significant market opening may be needed to reverse long term trends a look back at fdi data shows that growth has been falling steadily for well over a decade after hitting an average annual rate of over 26 percent in 2004 2008 according to world bank statistics china last recorded double digit fdi growth in 2010 scissors said that if trade war tensions continue in the coming year the effect on foreign investment may not show up in the official reporting the signal of a major downward move will not be official numbers of course but multinationals independently reporting disinvestment he said

analysts at natixis point out that the deterioration seen in financial markets in the us and the eurozone is compatible with a recession scenario and not with a cyclical slowdown scenario they believe that the right scenario for 2019 is one of a cyclical slowdown and they consider that once investors turn to the mentioned scenario risk premia in all financial markets will fall sharply and the markets will rally key quotes we look at financial markets in the united states and the euro zone their very depressed level currently is compatible with the assumption of a recession in 2019 however we believe there will be a cyclical slowdown and not a recession this is first due to the fact that financial markets are overestimating the risks brexit trade war italy declining liquidity leverage and also the fact that financial markets believe that some countries italy may pull out of the euro which is impossible is also due to the fact that financial markets fail to take into account a number of factors supporting activity low interest rates expansionary fiscal policies lack of inflation rising corporate profitability solidity of companies financial situation once investors switch from a crisis scenario to a cyclical slowdown scenario there will be rally in financial markets with a major decline in all risk premia the deterioration in the euro zone markets is due to the return of expectations of a break up of the euro we have to keep in mind that the huge size of the euro zone countries gross external debt mainly in euros makes an exit from the euro impossible the trade war between the united states and china will perhaps not take place and if it takes place it will have a very limited impact on the economies yet we believe there will be a cyclical slowdown a soft landing and not a recession in the united states and the euro zone

so ten months after i joined the company i walked into the office for day one of a completely new role ceo it was an exciting thrilling opportunity something i had perhaps been unknowingly preparing for since childhood and something i had definitely put at the top of my goal list thinking back to my first day as ceo i realize it wasn t that much different than my experience in the previous ten months as vp of sales i knew my team i knew my way around the office and i knew a bit more of what i was getting myself into versus starting a new role at a completely new company advertisement but it was this ten month introduction to cumulus along with an entire lifetime preparing for the ceo role that showed me i was more than ready to take on this new chapter i was 100 ready to be ceo on my very first day preparing for ceo since childhood my earliest memories of the software business were as a young child my dad had converted one of our bedrooms to a home office and on the weekends he d be in there on the phone talking shop it was the first time i heard my dad swear that s a bunch of bullshit he would say followed shortly by screw those guys it was kind of shock to hear but after that shock wore off i was simply fascinated by the grit and the pace of business and watching my dad doing deals my dad is mark leslie he was the ceo of veritas software and built the company nearly from inception at its height veritas was a fortune 1000 company with annual revenue exceeding 1 5b advertisement my dad was revered by veritas employees and widely respected in silicon valley he left the company in 2001 to advise startups invest and teach at stanford in short he knows pretty much everyone in tech and he casts a pretty long shadow when i was nine i didn t think about what it would be like to follow in his footsteps i wasn t one of those kids who started some amazing business at a young age and i wasn t writing code but i did know that i had an intense interest in the business world as i grew older i still listened in on those phone calls perused my dad s open emails when he wasn t around and had dinner table conversations about oem licensing deals stock options and unix file systems i didn t realize it then but looking back now i realize i was training to be a ceo sort of it wasn t like i was waking up at 6 a m to work on spreadsheets and cap tables but i was surrounded by my dad s work eventually i grew up went to college and started my career in sales this was my dad s influence again salespeople he said are the ones that know what s really going on in a company salespeople know how to solve problems build the product or sell the product he told me advertisement it only took my one semester in college to learn i wasn t smart enough to build the product so i began my sales career when i was 30 i told my manager at vmware that i wanted to be a ceo by the time i was 40 he laughed and said fifty was a more reasonable goal if anything eventually i left vmware and i became a vp of sales at a small series a startup i worked harder than i ever had but the company and the job did not turn out the way i hoped i took another vp sales job at another early stage startup after a few years at startup number two and i was approaching 40 ceo was nowhere in sight and my career seemed to be on a distinct sideways trajectory i had a great family by most measures a very good career but when i measured myself against my dad or against my peers and i measured my wins or lack thereof and i was unhappy with the score advertisement but then i had an epiphany i remember as a young parent seeing one of my children display some startling ability or at least i was impressed i thought perhaps i will be most remembered as the parent of one of my children and not for any of my own accomplishments it was a big change in perspective for me for the first time i realized perhaps i won t be a ceo perhaps i won t be a serial entrepreneur with multiple successful exists and maybe i don t care that much it was about the journey not the destination for the first time in my career i started to focus on the journey not the destination i will simply be the best vp of sales i can be i will treat customers with care and employees with respect i will spend my time on the things i know i m good at building trust with customers and get help where i m weak process advertisement so that was it i was going to be a great vp of sales and let the chips fall where they may i left start up number two and joined cumulus networks for the first time in my career i did not seriously negotiate my compensation my title or organization vp of sales sure i thought that works for me there were many questions of organizational ownership but i had come to understand that all of those things would eventually get sorted out correctly if we focused on the right priorities and built trust with the team i had truly stopped thinking about the next job about the size of my team or about perception of my accomplishments it was the first time i was leading ten months later i became the ceo josh is a seasoned technology executive and currently serves as ceo of cumulus networks prior to cumulus josh spent time at instart logic vmware and commvalut systems holding various leadership roles in both sales and business development a bay area native josh received a ba from the university of california berkeley and an mba from columbia business school when hes not in the office josh enjoys spending time with his wife two kids and his poodle peggy advertisement see also see also i run a 1 000 person company but it s not all that different from my first day as ceo when i gave myself a title rolled out of bed and got to work see also i ve been a ceo for 7 years and here s the best advice i can give you about running a company advertisement

profits stocks climbed to new highs early shook off a sudden steep drop by spring and rode a wave of tax cut juiced corporate earnings growth to another all time high by september then the jitters set in investors grew worried that the testy u s china trade dispute and higher interest rates would slow the economy hurting corporate profits a slowing u s housing market and forecasts of weaker global growth in 2019 stoked traders unease in october the market s gyrations grew more volatile the autumn sell off knocked the benchmark s p 500 index into a correction or a drop of 10 per cent from its all time high for the second time in nine months a christmas eve plunge brought it briefly into bear market territory or a drop of 20 per cent from its peak before closing just short of the threshold that would have meant the end of the market s nearly 10 year bull market run for markets to move higher next year we re going to have to resolve those issues kravetz said the risks confronting

it has been a little bit of a lonely effort ashoka mody an economics professor at princeton university and the former deputy director of the international monetary fund s european department is talking about eurotragedy a drama in nine acts his brilliant magisterial history of the eu and the development of the eurozone the vast majority of the european establishment mody continues has either tried to ignore or to contest what it seems to me are very basic economic principles and facts one can see why the european establishment might be inclined to do so eurotragedy is an indictment of the whole postwar european project a meticulous excoriating takedown of that which the european establishment holds dear and it is also an attack on the european establishment itself on its members groupthink their delusion their technocratic arrogance what s more it comes from the imf s chief representative to ireland during its bailout from the post 2008 banking crisis someone that is with an inside track on the eu s fiscal workings spiked spoke to mody to find out more about his critical overview of the european project the fatal flaws of the eurozone and why integration is driving european peoples apart spiked do you think you found working on eurotragedy a lonely effort because after brexit and the other populist movements the eu establishment is very defensive at the moment ashoka mody i m sure it plays a role but i think that the nature of the entire project is very defensive think back to robert schuman s declaration on 9 may 1950 which laid the ground for the european coal and steel community two years later he said that a common source of economic development must become the foundation of a european federation this idea of the european federation was discredited very quickly but european leaders have continued to flirt with it in different guises ever closer union unity in diversity and this particularly meaningless phrase that french president emmanuel macron uses called european sovereignty the whole language is problematic and mystifying but most serious of all is the notion of common economic development as a basis for europe it was briefly true after the treaty of rome in 1957 which opened up the borders but the momentum ran out within two decades you open borders but once they re open there s not a lot more you can do even the gains from the so called single market are very limited beyond a certain point every economist understands that on the euro there was never any question that it was a bad idea nicholas kaldor an economist at cambridge university wrote in march 1971 that a single currency was a terrible idea both as economics and as politics and kaldor has been proven right time and again but the entire european establishment just ignores every subsequent warning from well regarded economists and produces defensive counternarratives for example i often hear that europe needs fixed exchange rates in order to have a single market why germany is trading a lot with poland hungary and the czech republic which are in the single market but have different currencies these fluctuate but the trade continues apace you don t need a single currency for a single market spiked when did your critique of the european project emerge was it during your involvement in the irish bailout mody when i finished at the imf i planned to write a book on the euro crisis and i began writing it as an imf economist would what happened before the crash the bubble the bubble bursting the panic the fact it wasn t well managed and so on but i soon realised that something wasn t right here and so i spent two years tracing the history of the euro and asking the question what brought the euro into existence in its current form you see it is not just that there is a euro there is a euro which is a single currency in an incomplete monetary union with a set of fiscal rules that are evidently economically illiterate and nobody questions the fact that they are economically illiterate that they lack a necessary fiscal backstop and the necessary fiscal union so why does it exist that is when i started writing what is in effect a postwar european history a companion if you will to tony judt s postwar a history of europe since 1945 that is when i realised the euro was not only a bad economic idea it was also a bad political idea not only was it clear it would cause political divisions there was also no plan on how to heal those divisions to counteract them so these mythologies grew around the euro transfiguring it as an instrument for peace a means to bring europeans together a necessity for the single market all these strands of mythology grew up and around the european project to sustain what is effectively a mindless idea spiked you talk about it almost as a triumph of political delusion what drove its architects on what allowed them to push forward with a project that many economists deemed a folly mody i learnt two things about history from doing the book one that there are critical moments in history when an individual becomes unusually powerful and acquires an executive power disproportionate to his or her abilities and two such an individual has within his or her power an ability to create a narrative a story a mythology and it is the combination of the two that created the euro this is why helmut kohl is so important not only because he shepherded this project to the end he left us with a legacy of language that justifies it even to this day i think if kohl hadn t existed or hadn t survived as chancellor in the 1990s it wouldn t have happened there would have been no euro spiked what s striking is that rarely during this decades long process of integration did those leading the charge engage with national electorates if they did engage they would just ignore the answer given as they did as far back as 1992 with the danish and french referenda on the maastricht treaty do you think that this is one of the fatal flaws of european project that it goes onwards in spite of citizens mody it is absolutely a fatal flaw up until 1992 and the maastricht treaty there was this concept of permissive consensus this idea said that european leaders were to take benign decisions on behalf of the peoples of europe who cannot possibly understand the complexities of governing they trust the leaders because they know the right way to move forward and ultimately they will be validated and legitimised by the fruits they will deliver yet this permissive consensus was breaking down even as the maastricht treaty was being signed as you say we had the danish referendum and especially the french referendum in 1992 the french referendum in particular is an historically important one because the people 49 per cent who voted against maastricht are the same as those protesting in the yellow vest movement today just think about it for a period of about 30 years a consistent group of people have been calling out saying there is a problem over here they are saying that the real problems lie at home that we are being left behind and you the government seem to have no clue what we want the question of whether european citizens want more europe has never been really deliberated in any meaningful way it was never clear what the point of the euro was it certainly didn t deliver more prosperity and the lack of consultation with the people has created a simmering anxiety of opposing kinds in different nations in germany that anxiety plays on the possibility that germans may have to pay the bills for other countries in much of southern europe people are anxious that germany has become too dominant and that in periods of crisis the german chancellor may become de facto european chancellor there is no electoral mechanism for accountability and legitimacy so the whole process is inherently undemocratic the people who are affected by decisions cannot vote out those making the decisions spiked there are some who claim the eurozone has created a degree of prosperity certainly from the late 1990s until the mid 2000s do you think this was an illusion of prosperity sustained by in europe s case the banking bubble mody yes absolutely it is very unfortunate because that whole decade was completely misinterpreted in two ways one is that when the yields on government bonds came down that was still celebrated as financial integration whereas it was in fact a problem because the countries that were benefiting from these very low interest rates were allowing a debt bubble to form
two nonprofits in dubuque say giving was up in 2018 despite concerns that a new tax law might scare away donors the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 doubled the amount of tax deductions for most people leading nonprofits to be worried people wouldn t make itemized deductions for charitable donations however resources unite and compass to care two nonprofits with very different missions say donations came in as usual or even more in 2018 is all about connecting people to resources and volunteer opportunities while helps kids get to cancer treatment josh jasper director of ru said he and other nonprofit leaders weren t sure how 2018 would go we all myself included have been fearful of how that new tax law might impact donors he said he said at least for his organization 2018 was a great year we have a lot of individuals that have been coming in really supporting the mission of our organization financially but then also then trying to figure out what can i do as someone to be able to give of my time as well he explained that money and time has helped stock their emergency food pantry gather baby items and more jasper said he s seeing more families getting involved he said people are wanting more family friendly volunteer opportunities you know people are busy and they re saying you know we still want to get involved in the community but we want to include our children at compass to care project manager christine rapp said they had a record breaking year for the first time ever we raised over 400 000 rapp said excitedly the organization didn t let up their fundraising efforts at the end of 2018 in fact rapp said they really pushed for donations reminding people to take advantage of tax deductions she said we make sure we point that out to people there s always a greater push at the last two or three days of the year when people are realizing oh i need to get this in let s figure out who we can give it to both rapp and jasper say people gave in 2018 just a little more selectively i think maybe people are more conscience of where they re donating their money keeping things local rapp said if anything i think donors have just become a little bit more educated and are just becoming more informed jasper said they re asking harder questions they re asking so you know if i give you 100 how much of that is going to go to your overhead versus the people that you serve

three topics sure to grab headlines in 2019 are the city s rail project as construction moves through the congested downtown corridor the housing crisis as policy makers wrestle with vacation rental laws and monster home rules and the federal investigations involving honolulu s former police chief his ex prosecutor wife and the city prosecutor here s a preview of what to expect on these key issues 1 rail project faces crucial tests this will probably be the year motorists and businesses in honolulu s urban core finally feel major on the ground rail construction impacts as crews tear up pavement to widen roads bury power lines and relocate sewer and water lines to prepare the way for the overhead rail guideway from middle street to ala moana this will also be another year of intense scrutiny for the 9 2 billion project as the hawaii state auditor releases a series of reports on cost overruns and other aspects of rail and the federal transit administration mulls whether to accept the latest recovery plan for rail submitted by the honolulu authority for rapid transportation hart staff this year must also navigate the complexities of a new development strategy called a public private partnership that new approach will be used to build the last 4 16 miles of the rail line along with eight rail stations along a path through the urban core the cost of construction alone under that so called p3 agreement is expected to be about 1 4 billion and billions of dollars more will be paid out under the contract in the decades ahead for maintenance and operations of the entire 20 mile rail line it will likely be the largest contract in city history and is supposed to be awarded late this year for the general public the greatest impact from rail this year will likely stem from a 400 million contract awarded to nan inc last year to relocate utilities along the last segment of the rail line from middle street to ala moana preliminary work under that contract has already begun and hart spokesman bill brennan has described the utility relocation effort as some of the most disruptive work that s going to happen on the project the infrastructure that needs to be moved out of the way of the rail line includes about 4 000 linear feet of drainage 6 000 feet of sewer line 9 000 feet of water pipes and 67 000 feet of electrical lines according to hart that work will follow the rail path along the dillingham boulevard corridor past the kalihi kapalama and iwilei stations and then along nimitz highway to the chinatown and downtown stations from there it will veer onto halekauwila street through the civic center and ward center stations and then follow kona street to the final station at ala moana the utility work in the kakaako area is supposed to be finished by october 2020 and work in the dillingham area is scheduled to be complete by august 2021 according to hart 2 kealoha saga entangles another the broad ranging federal investigation into public corruption that led to the indictments of former police chief louis kealoha and his wife former deputy prosecutor katherine kealoha has now reached the doorstep of prosecutor keith kaneshiro and the intrigue and drama involving both the kealohas and kaneshiro are expected to continue through 2019 kaneshiro is believed to have received a target letter from the u s department of justice informing him that he may be under investigation kaneshiro has been noticeably silent on the issue and declined to say even if he received a target letter businessman tracy yoshimura is leading an impeachment effort against kaneshiro in light of the allegations charging that the situation has cast a legal cloud over the prosecutor s office as well as recent court decisions involving the agency the petition also said kaneshiro should be ousted for failing to take action against former deputy katherine kealoha after it became known that the fbi was investigating her for potential criminal wrongdoing katherine kealoha had been on unpaid voluntary leave until october 2017 when she was formally placed on unpaid leave she resigned from her position this past september more than 900 people signed the online petition the kealohas were indicted on charges they conspired to frame katherine kealoha s uncle for stealing the kealohas mailbox as part of a family dispute over money they are also charged with bank fraud for allegedly lying on loan applications to secure mortgages on their home the trial against the kealohas and four former members of the honolulu police department s elite criminal investigations unit is scheduled for march 19 the kealohas bank fraud trial was scheduled to begin in december but u s magistrate judge richard l puglisi pushed back that date in october after determining that katherine kealoha will not be able to stand trial in december or assist in her defense because of a medical issue that trial is now slated to begin june 18 3 vacation rentals and monster houses the twin issues of vacation rentals and monster houses and the city s attempts to place regulations on both to improve oahu s housing crunch will generate news in 2019 a dizzying seven bills related to bed and breakfast establishments and transient vacation units were given the first of three required approvals from the city council on dec 5 and are headed back to the zoning and housing committee the city stopped issuing certificates for vacation rentals in 1989 dpp estimates there are only 816 legal units outside of resort zones but between 6 000 and 8 000 illegal units on oahu bill 89 is mayor kirk caldwell s omnibus proposal that would allow permits to be issued for possibly up to 4 000 b bs and tvus islandwide by capping the number at no more than 1 percent of all dwelling units in each of the island s eight development plan districts but it would also impose higher taxes and stiffer fines for violations generally supporters of vacation rentals oppose capping the number of permitted units and increasing the tax opponents of vacation rentals don t want any new laws but want the city to ramp up enforcement of existing laws a comprehensive bill aimed at halting the growth of monster houses is moving about one step ahead of vacation rental legislation the dpp and council members have struggled to deal with the proliferation of monster houses mostly in older residential oahu neighborhoods in recent years neighbors say they are out of scale and character with their communities and are used as illegal rentals boarding houses vacation units or other businesses typically not allowed in residential zones critics also argue that they overburden sewer lines street parking and other infrastructure and could result in higher property assessments but the strong reaction to large scale houses has in turn caused a backlash from builders and others who think going too far in regulations would make it more difficult to obtain already often stalled building permits and in the long term limit the island s housing stock during a housing shortage at the end of november the zoning and housing committee gave preliminary approval to councilman trevor ozawa s latest draft of bill 79 which bars a builder or homeowner from putting up a house with a floor area greater than 60 percent of a lot s size current law does not use floor area to determine how big a house can be in a residential zone but instead requires that the footprint of a home cover no more than 50 percent of the lot the latest draft also calls for limits on wet bars laundry rooms and bathrooms capping how much concrete or other impervious surface can be installed on a lot as well as on site parking requirements
gold traded highly bearish during 2018 however when looking from perspective of financial year gold is currently in neutral state despite a year filled with high impact news driven trading activity much of which was owing to major geo political and economical issues gold failed to see any bullish price action as the yellow metal lost its status as preferred safe haven asset among investors to us greenback us greenback was highly bearish for first three quarters supported by multiple rate hikes from us federal reserve which greatly boosted its value in broad market and painted a positive long term outlook scenario which combined with us treasury yield spiking to multi year high s caused investors to view usd as a safe haven asset greatly changing the fund flow in market on unprecedented scale us political economic woes hurt dollar boosting demand for yellow metal despite majority of geo political and economical issues being initiated by usa the us dollar basked in all its glory as a safe haven asset backed by strong fundamentals in form of positive us macro data multiple fed rate hikes and positive price action in us bond market the major issues which created high demand for safe haven assets during first three quarters are listed below brexit italian budget crisis german political proceedings which saw chancellor merkel lose influence french yellow vest protests nafta death of saudi journalist resulting tensions between usa saudi sino u s trade war us tariff on european markets with main focus on automotive products crude oil price decline following us tariff on iranian crude while few other issues that inspired safe haven demand are not mentioned in the list above mentioned events had greater long term impact on price action of yellow metal since yellow metal traded in international market and us markets are denominated in us dollar investing in bullion was deemed as a costly act with no possible profit owing to gold being non interest yielding asset price action surrounding gold was further hampered as broad based firm dollar which continued to grow made it costly investment owing to higher exchange rate leading to lesser participating from china india and other emerging markets which was were majority of action surrounding yellow metal came from owing to said markets viewing gold as a back up against inflation alt at close of third quarter of fy 2018 19 gold is viewed to be in neutral level as political and economic issues in us market greatly affected greenback s value in broad market this combined with unfavorable proceedings in geo political issues and concerns of slowdown in global economy helped yellow metal reclaim losses from first two quarters ending december 2018 on neutral levels gold started regaining upper hand when us mid term elections saw democrats take control of the house divided results in election weakened outlook of greenback as president trump was expected to face difficulties moving ahead with his plans on divided congress following this first week of december saw gold move range bound owing to positive headlines from g 20 summit which saw us president trump chinese premier xi jing ping agree to delay tariff s by 90 days greatly boosting risk appetite story continues however gold retained gains from previous month on investors worries over economic slowdown in global markets and us treasury yield curve inversion the remaining three week s of december saw gold price climb steadily second week saw gold price climb on increased safe haven demand owing to french yellow vest protest causing damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars and brexit deal being pulled out of parliamentary approval which resulted in eu initiating no deal scenario proceedings across major markets this was further supported by concerns of global economic slowdown which caused bearish rout in equity market the third week saw gold gain further on back of subdued usd over weak us macro data and fed forward guidance which was highly in contrast to investors expectations with fed signalling two rate hikes in 2019 despite signs of slowdown in us economy while analysts and traders believed fed would put a pause to rate hike gold to remain fundamentally supported across january this move caused greenback to fall so hard resulting in exchange rate falling significantly in emerging markets bringing in flood of cash flow from china india other emerging markets the gains made were further supported by spike in demand for bullion on last week of december amid increased uncertainties and volatility in holiday season which combined with falling demand for greenback owing to partial shutdown of us government on trump tantrums over finance for border wall and investors seeking protection of safe haven asset amid thin trading volumes helped gold gain significantly with proper fundamental support moving forward market is set to resume normal trading activity post holiday season and gold is expected to remain supported across the month much of issues mentioned above remain unresolved and this is expected to keep safe haven assets in significant demand across january us greenback is expected to continue trading bearish owing to ongoing political crisis in usa which will help boost participation from emerging markets gold will also see increased demand owing to brexit proceedings which suggests yellow metal has bullish short term outlook and will trade positive across january 2019 this article was originally posted on fx empire more from fxempire

silicon valley ended 2018 somewhere it had never been embattled lawmakers across the political spectrum say big tech for so long the exalted embodiment of american genius has too much power once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter tech is now accused of inflaming radicalizing dumbing down and squeezing the masses tech company stocks have been pummelled from their highs regulation looms even tech executives are calling for it in the face of such a sustained assault this might be a good moment for big tech to lie low it could devote some of its mountains of cash apple inc alone has us 237 billion in the bank to genuine good works and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny that is not the path the companies are taking the tech companies are not flinching said bob staedler a silicon valley consultant nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back instead they are expanding they re going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz bang thing there is so much of life that remains undisrupted the companies are competing to own the cloud to become in essence the internet s landlord they have designs on cities google made a deal in 2017 to reimagine a chunk of waterfront toronto from the ground up amazon com inc is reworking the definition of community from the inside as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekend these changes are only beginning to redefine society when every home has an amazon echo google home an apple homepod or some other smart speaker the companies are already signalling all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled for those who insist on venturing out there will be driverless cars operated by big tech and the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence with consequences unclear even to them to accomplish all this big tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees which means it needs somewhere to put them this isn t a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters it means building new campuses around the country big tech s push into new york and the washington area has been well documented in recent months with google bulking up in the first and amazon planning satellite offices in both but even in its backyard of silicon valley which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well paid engineers can scarcely afford there is a boom that if anything is accelerating anyone who wants to believe big tech is chastened should visit a section of san jose calif just west of downtown a jumble of car washes and autobody shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments on a short street there is a house nearly a century old a tiny thing with only one bath google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for us 4 million according to county documents reviewed by the san jose mercury news multiply that real estate transaction by dozens big parcels and small totalling hundreds of millions of dollars to date google is planning very long term here the buses light rail caltrain and amtrak trains that converge on the diridon station transit centre will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth the eventual result will be a new google campus of eight million square feet with offices for 20 000 workers a figure that is more than the company s total employment in 2009 but diridon station is just a part of google s silicon valley expansion a week before the company got the two houses it bought a 100 000 square foot building in palo alto calif for us 70 million facebook inc keeps growing too in the spring it leased one million square feet in the silicon valley community of sunnyvale for its fast growing community operations team which deals with safety and security issues confronting facebook users and it will soon move this year into 750 000 square feet in a san francisco tower making it the third biggest tech tenant in the city after salesforce com inc and uber technologies inc in total google s employment increased 21 per cent in the last year facebook s work force rose by 45 per cent in that time to 34 000 and it is advertising 2 700 additional jobs amazon s head count tripled over the last three years thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of whole foods market inc it is only the second company in the united states to employ more than 500 000 people and that is not counting its contractors the expansion underlines the dizzying truth of big tech it is barely getting started for all intents and purposes we re only 35 years into a 75 or 80 year process of moving from analogue to digital said tim bajarin a long time tech consultant to companies including apple ibm corp and microsoft corp the image of silicon valley as nirvana has certainly taken a hit but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them that s evident in how robust big tech s businesses remain in march 2018 research firm emarketer said facebook including its less controversial photo sharing site instagram would earn us 21 billion this year from digital ads in the united states in september it raised that forecast to us 22 87 billion emarketer also revised up its forecasts of google s digital ad revenues in the united states for 2018 2019 and 2020 the third big digital advertising recipient is amazon which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fast the contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious one important way big tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us in a pew research center survey in june 42 per cent of adult facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site but even as we say we trust tech less we invite it deeper into our lives apple amazon facebook and alphabet inc google s parent company together generated us 166 9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone up 24 per cent from a year earlier when the four companies hauled in us 134 4 billion much as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by facebook google amazon etc they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide said david autor an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology big tech needs to be regulated many are beginning to argue and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government the government doesn t have a good clue mr bajarin said they re not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation which leaves regulation up to the companies themselves always a dubious proposition for facebook to have a better year in 2019 it needs to be more upfront and transparent said debra aho williamson an analyst at emarketer this was also the advice facebook got for 2018 to little avail all this could change if the anti tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch on the other hand the most recent recession tended to work in big tech s favour by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about during the 2008 financial crisis amazon s north american media sales increased 20 per cent borders one of its biggest book selling competitors saw revenue drop 9 per cent reported a record loss and was soon defunct with so little to really worry about big tech is planning for a future far beyond any present day turmoil google which has 3 500 job openings says it is too early to say what the thousands of diridon employees will do but jonathan taplin director emeritus of the annenberg innovation lab at the university of southern california has a good idea everything they re in the transportation business the medical business every business said mr taplin a frequent critic of how big tech took over a decentralized

as most writers in my own case i use that term loosely i have been racking my brain as to what to write about in my first and by default or by definition the best writing of the new year japanese culture takes such first writings to a whole new level during oshogatsu japanese new year japanese people participate in the tradition of writing auspicious wishes poems and other positive and encouraging words using beautiful calligraphy such kakizome or first writings are usually burned a couple of weeks later it is thought that if the burning paper flies high up in the sky that person will be bestowed with the gift of writing in an even better hand the next year while i have no hope of being bestowed with the gift of writing in an even better hand figuratively or literally i had thought about including some auspicious thoughts and wishes about the near term state of our union in my first writing but seriously perhaps cynically how can we be auspicious about politics in the new year when there is every indication that the constitution the rule of law and every remaining semblance of decency values and principles will continue to be violated by the present occupant of the white house and at best ignored at worst assiduously abetted by compliant and therefore complicit republican legislators a first writing by our former contributor shaun mullen came to the rescue early this morning it is not only much better and more powerful than what i could have calligraphed it also expresses down to a t what i sincerely believe are the new year hopes and wishes of most americans to glimpse a ray of sunlight penetrating the clouds author and journalist shaun mullen born to blog has been keeping us informed of trump s scandals and shenanigans and their connections to russia all dating back to 1980 a comprehensive timeline of the russia scandal related events 1980 2018 can be found here and his articles read at kiko s house without further ado here is shaun s america fights back 2019 will be the year that donald trump falls to earth in full i ve been doing this blogging thing for 14 years now and too often my new years posts are bummers that certainly has been true and then some the last two years but i embark on 2019 standing a little taller and feeling a little more optimistic despite the category five shitstorm a president unbound has unleashed on america and the world i would be lying if i told you that i always knew that things would begin to get better i didn t know because donald trump and his republican enablers have succeeded in short circuiting our constitutional checks and balances to such an extent that some things never will be better again ever but the wheels of justice are turning and america is fighting back typical of those bummer new years posts was a january 2 2007 essay in which i asked whether we had become a nation of sheep can we survive two more years of a george bush presidency i wrote the silence has been deafening when it comes to americans demanding that bush be held accountable for his actions let alone pull the u s back from the brink of myriad disasters are we so inured to arrogant and inept leadership and a corrupt political culture that we would rather retreat to our barcaloungers than fight as trumpian outrages go it is not possible to top his collusion with russia his policy of separating children from migrant parents seeking better lives for their families in america or his abhorrent nativist instincts but one particular incident way back on the evening of october 9 2016 at washington university in st louis has haunted me in particular because it says everything you need to know about trump it was on that night that trump invited women who had accused bill clinton of groping them to sit in the front row at his debate with hillary clinton whom he menacingly stalked around the stage at the very moment that his lawyer fixer michael cohen was negotiating a 130 000 hush payment with a porn star to prevent her from going public about her own sexual encounter with the vile man with the small hands and peculiar hair in the last 12 years the washington swamp has continued to fill yes even during the obama years yet enough of us have now roused our weary bones from our barcaloungers to doom trump in 2019 trump is doomed because he is profoundly unqualified to be president his self inflicted wounds and twitter diktats leaving america in a perpetual state of crisis as he gives every appearance of taking orders from vladimir putin alienates the u s s most important allies announces phony victories over still lethal islamist adversaries and unilaterally triggers unnecessary trade wars that have caused misery in the heartland and palpations in the financial markets oh and three government breakdowns er shutdowns since republicans took complete control of washington two years ago trump is doomed because the last of the few old guard professionals read adults who were checks on his irrationality temper tantrums and base fawning excesses have resigned in protest leaving his administration in tatters trump is doomed because of a resistance movement led by women angered by the republican jihad to deny they and their families access to affordable health care among other necessities of life that propelled the midterm election blue wave trump is doomed because of his oft declared arch enemy a vigorous news media that has repeatedly jerked the curtain back on his awfulness even if many outlets continue to give him the deference that the office but not the man deserves trump is doomed because of the labors of robert mueller and other prosecutors whose belief in the rule of law stands in stark contrast to a president and congressional sycophancy that history will judge to be quislings all trump is doomed because even his conservative base is cracking as once reliable allies in the right wing media including rush limbaugh and la passionata coulter mock him for being a squish and there still is no border wall and trump is doomed because as we saw that night in st louis he is a self necrotizing virus who has never done an honest thing in his life and for whom a karmic payback has been long in the offing the beginning of the end of the trump presidency arrived a long time ago and although impeachment has not come quickly enough i anticipate articles being filed against trump by the democratic controlled house judiciary committee before we get too far into the new year the constitution cites treason bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors as the reasons for impeaching a president reasonable people can argue about whether trump has met the legal definition of treason but there is no question that dirty money has been the currency of his presidency so bribery is a no brainer while the list of high crimes and misdemeanors grows by the week historical contexts are important here and none is more important than richard nixon and watergate and donald trump and the russia as well as his many other scandals this is because more than just 45 years separate the two like trump s administration nixon s was rife with corruption but the republican party of 1973 was law abiding most republicans reflexively defended nixon as the watergate scandal grew and the attendant constitutional crisis deepened and they stuck with him even after attorney general elliot richardson and deputy ag william ruckelshaus resigned rather than carry out his order to fire watergate special prosecutor archibald cox the robert mueller of those turbulent times but three republicans senate minority leader hugh scott house minority leader john rhodes and senator barry goldwater had the guts to go to the white house and tell nixon he had lost the support of the country he soon resigned today s republican party has become as deeply corrupt as the president whom it also reflexively defends susan collins s pathetic expressions of concern are what passes for criticism of trump is there even a heart beating beneath her burberry suit jacket republican corruption is a product of what journalist george packer calls institutional depravity the abuse of power as an end in itself and justifying almost any means as the democratic party although far from perfect has become more diverse today s gop has walled itself off into a fortress of older white male rural and conservative voters for whom trump as apolitical as he is amoral was a shotgun marriage of convenience that has plunged america into an age of darkness that make the bush and nixon eras seem quaint what can go wrong in the new year almost anything can go wrong because survival is trump s only priority still i suspect the siren call of the barcalounger will be more powerful than the lure of the barricade and many trumpkins will chuck their red maga baseball caps with much caterwauling but little else once it becomes obvious that the virus in chief has pretty much eaten himself there has been a dark shadow over our lives for the past two years akin to the fear a victim of sexual assault carries with her trump of course does happen to be a sexual predator but there are moments when i can see beyond the dark shadow and glimpse a ray of sunlight penetrating the clouds and a return to a normalcy we once took for granted when things made sense best wishes for a better new year coda and no mr president we won t just calm down and enjoy the ride lead image by ky

as we begin 2019 the global economy seems uncertain but experts believe the outlook is more positive than negative including in new jersey our growth rate for employment at least through october was very consistent to that of the nation was very consistent to that of new york and was ahead of pennsylvania and connecticut rutgers university economist james hughes said as a result the new jersey economy in 2018 really outperformed our expectations earlier in the year hughes pointed out that after a sluggish period following the great recession the last several years we have gained traction and the economy has gotten up to speed he said the state economy has been impacted by fundamental structural changes including the flow of millennials out of suburban new jersey into urban environments and suburban office buildings and malls struggling to stay relevant we ve had to adjust to really a post suburban economic and demographic era but i think the state has finally started to respond he said the office industry has repositioned a number of buildings and campuses really transforming them into viable future economic assets at the same time as millennials adults as old as 35 have started having children they re going to be looking for family raising environments and i think they re getting tired of living in a shoebox in brooklyn and a little bit of green patch in new jersey looks pretty good hughes pointed out the recent announcement by e commerce giant amazon to locate a new headquarters in long island city will benefit the garden state economically we re in the gravitational field of new york city and so we re getting a spillover effect from that we have a chance to be part of that broader technology ecosystem going forward with the recent interest rate hike by the fed ongoing concern about a possible trade war with china and political shifts in europe financial markets remain jittery but hughes said the state s unemployment rate remains low and should remain that way unless the global economy goes into a tank

people watch the performance of the boat of the new york city fire department before the firework event to celebrate the independence day of the united states in new york city july 4 2018 xinhua han fang new york jan 1 xinhua after a year of improvement the u s economy may face challenges in 2019 as waning stimulus less friendly monetary policy coupled with decelerating global growth are among the multiple risks for a slowdown economists said real u s gross domestic product gdp growth of 2 7 percent is forecast for 2019 slowing in the second half of the year as the effects of fiscal stimulus begin to fade analysts from bank of america bofa merrill lynch global research said in their 2019 outlook report released in december the unemployment rate could reach a 65 year low of 3 2 percent by year end pushing wage growth of 3 5 percent in aggregate core price inflation should gradually rise to 2 2 percent through 2019 and hold as rates continue to rise the housing market is no longer a tailwind for the u s economy we believe housing sales have peaked and home price appreciation is forecast to slow said the research team slowing growth the projection of an economic slowdown was widely shared by many renowned institutions goldman sachs said in november that the u s gdp growth will slow to below 2 percent in the second half of 2019 as the u s federal reserve continues to raise interest rates and the effects of corporate tax cuts fade growth is likely to slow significantly next year from a recent pace of 3 5 percent plus to roughly our 1 75 percent estimate of potential by end 2019 wrote jan hatzius chief economist for the investment bank in a recent note to clients we expect tighter financial conditions and a fading fiscal stimulus to be the key drivers of the deceleration said hatzius the bank saw the economy expanding at 2 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 3 5 percent in the third quarter real gdp growth will come in at 2 5 percent again in the first quarter of 2019 but then will slow to 2 2 percent 1 8 percent and 1 6 percent in the next three quarters respectively 2018 has roughly been a banner year for the world s largest economy especially in the second and third quarters thanks largely to federal spending and tax cut u s gdp rose at an annual pace of 3 4 percent and at 4 2 percent in the second quarter the department of commerce said late december in its third estimate the economy has been firing on most of its cylinders as consumers spent more companies invested in inventories and local governments maintained their spending said the department while many barometers for u s economy still look encouraging unemployment near a half century low inflation tame pay growth picked up and consumers spending robust in this holiday season economists cautioned the looming of headwinds gregory daco chief u s economist at oxford economics warned recently that the falling stock market reflects multiple hazards that can feed on themselves what really matters is how people perceive these headwinds and right now markets and investors perceive them as leading us into a recessionary environment daco was quoted by the associated press forecasting firm macroeconomic advisers in november estimated a growth rate of 2 5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2018 the fed expected the u s economy to grow at 3 percent in 2018 a bit lower than 3 1 percent estimated in september according to its latest economic projections in december moreover the central bank lowered its 2019 growth forecast from 2 5 percent to 2 3 percent fading momentum analysts expected a fading fiscal stimulus in the year ahead noting the boost from tax cuts is not sustainable the u s economy showed signs of late stage expansion cycle early in 2016 guan ning co founder ceo of quant space am a u s asset management firm told xinhua in october policies including tax cuts and deregulation have boosted the equities market helping prolong the economic recovery however the cycle would come back she said the united states passed its biggest tax overhaul in three decades in december 2017 in the tax revamp corporate tax rate was slashed from 35 percent to 21 percent u s president donald trump and republicans have expected the move to boost corporate investment and hiring and keep companies from leaving the united states while democrats have criticized the law as a giveaway to the wealthy a recent study from the new york based conference board finds that the u s expansion will likely peak in the next few months as the effects of tax cuts and fiscal spending wane during the course of 2019 an annual economic forecast released in november by the university of michigan showed effects of tax cuts on u s economy will start to diminish in 2019 before fading out in 2020 meanwhile an october survey conducted by the national association for business economics indicated that u s firms saw improved profit margins in the third quarter of 2018 but the tax reform has not broadly impacted hiring and investment plans others even alarmed tax cuts could pose economic risks in the medium term these risks include higher public debt an inflation surprise international spillover future recession and increased global imbalances the international monetary fund imf said in july a newly released report by the u s treasury department showed u s federal budget deficit spiked to a record 204 9 billion u s dollars in november the second month of the government s fiscal year 2019 due to the tax cut and increased government spending the congressional budget office warned that growing budget deficits would boost u s public debt sharply over the next 30 years if current laws generally remain unchanged earlier report from the treasury department showed that federal budget deficit registered 779 billion dollars in the fiscal year 2018 ending sept 30 tightening monetary policy economists hold that a mistaken faster or tighter than expected monetary policy may pose threat to the economy the fed has raised the key short term rate four times in 2018 and indicated two more hikes in 2019 it generally increased rates to keep growth in check and prevent annual inflation from rising much above 2 percent if the central bank were to miscalculate and raise rates too high or too fast it could trigger the very downturn that fed officials have been trying to avoid experts noted bridgewater the world s largest hedge fund warned that the u s economy faces a looming deceleration as tighter monetary policy starts to weigh on growth and ratchets up pressure on financial markets we are at a potential inflection point where the economy is moving from hot to mediocre bob prince co chief investment officer at bridgewater said in a note as long as the fed continues to raise rates the grim reality of an overhanging recession risk will be there and the prudent trade will be away from risk assets said chris low chief economist at ftn financial over the past year the fed s rate hikes have tightened global financial conditions and brought spillover effects for emerging markets some of which have faced strong pressure in capital outflows and currency devaluations bofa merrill lynch forecast global monetary policy to become less friendly in 2019 a divided government means that additional fiscal stimulus in the u s seems unlikely europe is largely frozen in place by its budget rules and japan appears ready to implement yet another ill timed consumption tax hike said its researchers the conference board projected a continuous tightening monetary policy but probably at a moderate pace unless inflation emerges much faster than anticipated global risks the world economy is showing clear signs of a downshift with both developed and emerging economies expected to expand at a slower speed their deflating growth can in turn weigh on the u s economy bofa merrill lynch said in its 2019 outlook that global growth is expected to dip from 3 8 percent in 2018 to 3 6 percent in 2019 amid potential risks adding that the slowing growth is likely a benign slowdown instead of a recession a less friendly policy environment suggests a significant slowing in growth globally and risks including uncertainties caused by lingering global trade tensions and brexit are skewed to the downside according to analysts moreover a poll of economists by reuters in october cautioned that an escalation of global trade actions could lead to substantial slowdown in u s economy by 2019 there would be no winners from a global trade war all countries would ultimately be worse off compared to the status quo noted neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics it would inflict lasting damage to growth and cause a permanent loss of output he added looking beyond 2019 the main concerns are slower growth of labor supply and modest projections of productivity growth said bart van ark executive vice president and chief economist at the conference board the research institute projected global growth to be 3 1 percent in 2019 down from 3 2 percent in 2018 economist positive or pessimistic about the future agreed that 2019 is likely to be challenging for both investors and policymakers

conditions and a fading fiscal stimulus to be the key drivers of the deceleration said hatzius the bank saw the economy expanding at 2 5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2018 down from 3 5 percent in the third quarter real gdp growth will come in at 2 5 percent again in the first quarter of 2019 but then will slow to 2 2 percent 1 8 percent and 1 6 percent in the next three quarters respectively 2018 has roughly been a banner year for the world s largest economy especially in the second and third quarters thanks largely to federal spending and tax cut u s gdp rose at an annual pace of 3 4 percent and at 4 2 percent in the second quarter the department of commerce said late december in its third estimate the economy has been firing on most of its cylinders as consumers spent more companies invested in inventories and local governments maintained their spending said the department while many barometers for u s economy still look encouraging unemployment near a half century low inflation tame pay growth picked up and consumers spending robust in this holiday season economists cautioned the looming of headwinds gregory daco chief u s economist at oxford economics warned recently that the falling stock market reflects multiple hazards that can feed on themselves what really matters is how people perceive these headwinds and right now markets and investors perceive them as leading us into a recessionary environment daco was quoted by the associated press forecasting firm macroeconomic advisers in november estimated a growth rate of 2 5 percent for the fourth quarter of 2018 the fed expected the u s economy to grow at 3 percent in 2018 a bit lower than 3 1 percent estimated in september according to its latest economic projections in december moreover the central bank lowered its 2019 growth forecast from 2 5 percent to 2 3 percent fading momentum analysts expected a fading fiscal stimulus in the year ahead noting the boost from tax cuts is not sustainable the u s economy showed signs of late stage expansion cycle early in 2016 guan ning co founder ceo of quant space am a u s asset management firm told xinhua in october policies including tax cuts and deregulation have boosted the equities market helping prolong the economic recovery however the cycle would come back she said the united states passed its biggest tax overhaul in three decades in december 2017 in the tax revamp corporate tax rate was slashed from 35 percent to 21 percent u s president donald trump and republicans have expected the move to boost corporate investment and hiring and keep companies from leaving the united states while democrats have criticized the law as a giveaway to the wealthy a recent study from the new york based conference board finds that the u s expansion will likely peak in the next few months as the effects of tax cuts and fiscal spending wane during the course of 2019 an annual economic forecast released in november by the university of michigan showed effects of tax cuts on u s economy will start to diminish in 2019 before fading out in 2020 meanwhile an october survey conducted by the national association for business economics indicated that u s firms saw improved profit margins in the third quarter of 2018 but the tax reform has not broadly impacted hiring and investment plans others even alarmed tax cuts could pose economic risks in the medium term these risks include higher public debt an inflation surprise international spillover future recession and increased global imbalances the international monetary fund imf said in july a newly released report by the u s treasury department showed u s federal budget deficit spiked to a record 204 9 billion u s dollars in november the second month of the government s fiscal year 2019 due to the tax cut and increased government spending the congressional budget office warned that growing budget deficits would boost u s public debt sharply over the next 30 years if current laws generally remain unchanged earlier report from the treasury department showed that federal budget deficit registered 779 billion dollars in the fiscal year 2018 ending sept 30 tightening monetary policy economists hold that a mistaken faster or tighter than expected monetary policy may pose threat to the economy the fed has raised the key short term rate four times in 2018 and indicated two more hikes in 2019 it generally increased rates to keep growth in check and prevent annual inflation from rising much above 2 percent if the central bank were to miscalculate and raise rates too high or too fast it could trigger the very downturn that fed officials have been trying to avoid experts noted bridgewater the world s largest hedge fund warned that the u s economy faces a looming deceleration as tighter monetary policy starts to weigh on growth and ratchets up pressure on financial markets we are at a potential inflection point where the economy is moving from hot to mediocre bob prince co chief investment officer at bridgewater said in a note as long as the fed continues to raise rates the grim reality of an overhanging recession risk will be there and the prudent trade will be away from risk assets said chris low chief economist at ftn financial over the past year the fed s rate hikes have tightened global financial conditions and brought spillover effects for emerging markets some of which have faced strong pressure in capital outflows and currency devaluations bofa merrill lynch forecast global monetary policy to become less friendly in 2019 a divided government means that additional fiscal stimulus in the u s seems unlikely europe is largely frozen in place by its budget rules and japan appears ready to implement yet another ill timed consumption tax hike said its researchers the conference board projected a continuous tightening monetary policy but probably at a moderate pace unless inflation emerges much faster than anticipated global risks the world economy is showing clear signs of a downshift with both developed and emerging economies expected to expand at a slower speed their deflating growth can in turn weigh on the u s economy bofa merrill lynch said in its 2019 outlook that global growth is expected to dip from 3 8 percent in 2018 to 3 6 percent in 2019 amid potential risks adding that the slowing growth is likely a benign slowdown instead of a recession a less friendly policy environment suggests a significant slowing in growth globally and risks including uncertainties caused by lingering global trade tensions and brexit are skewed to the downside according to analysts moreover a poll of economists by reuters in october cautioned that an escalation of global trade actions could lead to substantial slowdown in u s economy by 2019 there would be no winners from a global trade war all countries would ultimately be worse off compared to the status quo noted neil shearing group chief economist at capital economics it would inflict lasting damage to growth and cause a permanent loss of output he added looking beyond 2019 the main concerns are slower growth of labor supply and modest projections of productivity growth said bart van ark executive vice president and chief economist at the conference board the research institute projected global growth to be 3 1 percent in 2019 down from 3 2 percent in 2018 economist positive or pessimistic about the future agreed that 2019 is likely to be challenging for both investors and policymakers enditem

as we begin 2019 the global economy seems uncertain but experts believe the outlook is more positive than negative including in new jersey our growth rate for employment at least through october was very consistent to that of the nation was very consistent to that of new york and was ahead of pennsylvania and connecticut rutgers university economist james hughes said as a result the new jersey economy in 2018 really outperformed our expectations earlier in the year hughes pointed out that after a sluggish period following the great recession the last several years we have gained traction and the economy has gotten up to speed he said the state economy has been impacted by fundamental structural changes including the flow of millennials out of suburban new jersey into urban environments and suburban office buildings and malls struggling to stay relevant we ve had to adjust to really a post suburban economic and demographic era but i think the state has finally started to respond he said the office industry has repositioned a number of buildings and campuses really transforming them into viable future economic assets at the same time as millennials adults as old as 35 have started having children they re going to be looking for family raising environments and i think they re getting tired of living in a shoebox in brooklyn and a little bit of green patch in new jersey looks pretty good hughes pointed out the recent announcement by e commerce giant amazon to locate a new headquarters in long island city will benefit the garden state economically we re in the gravitational field of new york city and so we re getting a spillover effect from that we have a chance to be part of that broader technology ecosystem going forward with the recent interest rate hike by the fed ongoing concern about a possible trade war with china and political shifts in europe financial markets remain jittery but hughes said the state s unemployment rate remains low and should remain that way unless the global economy goes into a tank

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news as the years transition lists of evs coming to market in 2019 are omnipresent but there is a problem with those lists first they are mainly for the usa market and second the availability of those new models is not great only in california or a handful of zero emission vehicle zev states or some other very limited supply formula why the understandable reaction of many is that the carmakers are not interested in bringing electric vehicles to market that these are only compliance cars that they have to sell in certain states but brands that have announced a switch to 100 battery electric vehicles in the short or mid term like jaguar and volvo are very serious and brands that have gone all in like smart and polestar don t make compliance cars they are just as committed as tesla in 2012 the us electric car market was the leading market in the world thanks to the chevy volt nissan leaf toyota prius phev ford s two energi models the mitsubishi i miev and the tesla model s among others in europe norway and the netherlands started ambitious incentive programs those were later followed by incentive programs in other european countries less ambitious but offering ev drivers incentives nonetheless in 2014 china started its electrification efforts it used the let a hundred flowers blossom approach to get rapid development of local production in an open and competitive market and then something strange happened while the rest of the world slowly started to grow its ev market the us market got stuck in fact 2015 sales were even lower than 2014 sales in 2016 there was a market recovery but outside tesla there was only about 20 growth not very much for a young market with this much promise for a great future loren mcdonald did write a great article about the market push of new models the article does not explain why the usa market is developing slower than the european or chinese markets and why older models are doing great in europe the chinese used like norway a combination of financial and non financial incentives to push ev adoption like parking permits and registration benefits combined with the many local governments that hoped to push their champions to become the next industrial giant the chinese ev market started to grow very fast plug in vehicle sales year usa europe europe s share of combined sales 2012 52 607 43 543 45 2013 97 507 67 026 41 2014 122 438 100 060 45 2015 116 099 193 439 62 2016 158 614 222 619 58 2017 199 818 306 143 61 2018 jan nov 312 877 345 312 52 sources insideevs ev sales blog but the growth in europe was more organic there were many different incentive schemes often less generous than the us schemes and badly publicized still the european market overtook the us market and even the model 3 avalanche this year could not close the gap in a previous article i speculated about non us carmakers not exporting to the usa that it was more profitable to deliver their products to customers who had signed a sales order and placed a deposit putting cars on a dusty parking lot at a dealer not really interested in selling them is a waste of resources but the sales of locally produced plug ins like the chevy bolt nissan leaf and chrysler pacifica hybrid are also far lower than might be expected in 2017 sales through dealers were 150 000 in the usa and 280 000 in europe i get these numbers by omitting the tesla sales this is contrary to the belief that carmakers are only producing compliance cars they are mostly the same carmakers in europe as in the usa that make and sell these evs the big difference is the sales channel the favorite bogeyman of many a car buyer story is the american auto dealer who repeatedly fails to sell evs in europe most sales are by special order waiting three months for even a simple renault twingo or vw golf is normal in the usa cars are bought like jeans at walmart the customer expects to have a wide choice and to leave the premises with the product of his choice in one or two hours chip in a few dollars a month to help support independent cleantech coverage that helps to accelerate the cleantech revolution there are over 4 000 chevy dealers in the usa in colors trim levels and options there are hundreds if not thousands possible configurations for the chevy bolt no dealer can ever have most configurations in stock only a small sub selection of hopefully the most popular models this many dealers can only have adequate cars in stock of products that sell in high volumes the tactics employed by the japanese and koreans when they entered the usa car market decades ago should be used again for plug in vehicles pevs but the established dealerships of chevy and nissan have no reason to try to build a pev business in that manner and gm and nissan don t push them to do it better markets elsewhere and products that are hard to sell can t be the whole reason why the toughest salesmen fail to sell electric cars though if they wanted to sell them they would sell them but they don t to explain this i have a wild ass guess wag just a gut feeling that might have some truth at its core the slowdown of dealer sales started in 2014 when tesla became successful and refused to sell through dealers if dealers in their mind equated tesla and pevs as the same thing they may well have developed an aversion against selling pevs then it probably went from tesla is the enemy to pevs are the enemy 2019 prediction with this in mind we can look in a completely different way at the sales expectations for 2019 i have made a list of most models that are new or refurbished enough to be attractive again some have officially entered the market in the last month or few months in reality 2019 is when sales begin in earnest mini and vw have a bit of a reputation using sliding windows in their planning but it appears they have at least started the preparations brand model battery kwh price audi e tron 95 75 000 bmw i3 42 45 000 hyundai kona ev 64 38 000 hyundai ioniq ev 39 34 000 jaguar i pace 90 69 500 kia e niro 39 64 40 000 kia soul ev 39 64

crystal balls laying the tarot and drawing each car s horoscope if at some future date a dealer or heaven forbid a carmaker decides to use a different price the stars are at fault you can not hold me responsible i don t know what that is these are all models that can do very well in their segment if a serious effort is made to sell them for the reasons discussed above i doubt that will be the case they are all production constrained by their battery supply and overly careful planning overstock is the nightmare of every production planner and they don t yet believe in the market potential of these cars like we do my guess is they will all sell twice to 10 times as much in europe as in the usa even with the stiffer competition of the cars that will enter the european market besides these models vehicles shown in the next table brand model battery price ds 3 crossback e tense 50 35 000 opel vauxhall corsa 60 30 000 peugeot 208 60 30 000 peugeot 2008 60 35 000 renault zoe next gen 50 27

starting production before they announce the car to the public and have some suv or cuv in the pipeline or perhaps we will see an unexpected offering from a japanese or chinese carmaker the ds 3 and the peugeot 2008 are direct competitors to the kona ev and e niro the other europe only cars are too small for the us market with these new year s lists ought to come a prediction on sales and market growth with all of these new entrants 2019 will be a very interesting year both in the usa and in europe my hope is the carmakers will surprise us with a capacity for high volume production that buyers have enough choice of models with decent range charging speed and a useful charging network i expect sales of 400 000 in the usa and 600 000 in europe and i hope i am completely wrong that the

london oil prices rose 4 in choppy trading on wednesday but concerns remained about rising crude production and weakening global economic growth which could hurt demand for oil brent crude futures

mcgillian vice president of market research for tradition energy in stamford connecticut oil futures were buoyed by some gains in us stocks with the nasdaq composite turning positive after earlier losses crude futures have recently tracked stocks on wall street however disappointing manufacturing data from china earlier added to ongoing concerns about a slowing global economy and increased output out of countries like russia china s factory activity contracted for the first time in over two years in december highlighting the challenges facing beijing as it seeks to end a bruising trade war with washington the manufacturing survey data out of china this week is particularly negative for crude oil as it goes to the heart of the key demand center for the market said john kilduff a partner at again capital management in new york worries about an economic slowdown and excess supply dragged oil prices from multi year highs reached in october 2018 crude futures ended 2018 down for

citing rising non opec supply and the likelihood of further increases in oil inventories the current bearish bias will therefore continue in the near term and it stands to reason that oil will struggle to break out from its current trough he said however nitesh shah director of research at wisdomtree saw the prospect of a rebound for brent because of an opec led supply cut that starts this month and moderating us supply growth we believe we will see an upward correction he said recent weakness in prices should slow the growth of us shale production oil prices fell in 2018 for the first

back up and move forward this site was started on the premise that in mexico history matters and that our politics and political discourse is a continual recycling and repackaging of our history it s so obvious even jude weber finally gets it i don t have a financial times subscription so stolen and google translated from el financiero the portrait and the presence of benito juárez are so ubiquitous in mexico these days that one can almost forgive anyone who thinks that he not andrés manuel lópez obrador known as amlo is the one who has just assumed the presidency of the country the image of the 19th century lawyer and former president of mexico is at the center of the new government logo his huge black and white image was the official backdrop of amlo during the transition between his election and his inauguration on december 1 his face also appears on the new 500 peso bill 25 lópez obrador who often says that his dream is to be a president as good as his hero has moved his office to the national palace where juarez worked and as some newspaper articles suggest he might even be imitating juarez s hairstyle however although lópez obrador is a somewhat clumsy public speaker he is a clever political communicator and his use of history improves the effectiveness of his messages the past is the prologue in his second week of work he was embroiled in a dispute with the supreme court over insisting that no official should be allowed to earn more than his own salary as president a level he had already set at 60 percent less than that of his predecessor enrique peña nieto to emphasize this point he read a decree of 1861 in which juarez announced cuts to his own salary investors are worried about another historical parallel their desire to place the state oil company pemex at the center of the national oil industry the intention evokes the image of lázaro cárdenas the former president who expropriated american and british companies in 1938 and created pemex and who is next to juarez and other heroes of independence and revolution in the new logo lópez obrador has already limited peña nieto s historic energy reform which put an end to pemex s monopoly and opened the sector to private investment for the first time in eight decades by suspending oil auctions meanwhile a capital injection of 75 billion pesos 3 7 billion dollars for pemex has the purpose of financing the exploration to resuscitate the glory days of the past but pemex s production has been in decline for the past 14 years and has well deserved its reputation for bloated bureaucracy corruption and inefficiency the story shows pitfalls and lessons for a leftist nationalist president that critics fear will lead mexico to the economic crisis of the 1970s and according to an executive director of the oil company to the decisions of the past that did not work lópez obrador has faced financial markets after announcing that he will discard the new partially built airport in mexico city which has a cost of 13 billion dollars after it was rejected in a referendum but as the historian andrew paxman points out even cardenas had to answer to the business elite after the nationalization caused the peso to lose a third of its value from march 1938 until the end of 1940 lópez obrador is a man with a vision the president has embarked on an anti corruption crusade the central axis of what he grandly calls the fourth transformation after juarez s liberal reforms the independence of spain in the 19th century and the mexican revolution more than 100 years ago lópez obrador has called another popular consultation for next year on the creation of a new national guard and on whether the last five presidents should be judged for promoting the neoliberal policies that he blames for impoverishing mexicans the date is surely not a coincidence juarez s birthday on march 21 the historical references of the government clearly have the purpose of being suggestive but in the end lópez obrador can arrange things as he wants you just have to keep your promises
by dean baker the media continue to be in a panic over the drop in the stock market over the last few weeks fortunately for political pundits there is no expectation that they have any clue about the subjects on which they opine for those more interested in economics than hysterics the drop in the market is not a big deal the market is at best very loosely related to the economy it generally rises in recoveries and falls in recessions but it also has all sorts of movements that are not obviously related to anything in the real economy the most famous example of such an erratic movement was the crash in october of 1987 the market fell by more than 20 percent in a single day there was no obvious event in the economy or politics that explained this fall which hit markets around the world nor did the decline presage a recession the economy continued to grow at a healthy pace through 1988 and 1989 it didn t fall into a recession until june of 1990 more than two years later there is little reason to believe the recent decline will have any larger impact on the economy than the 1987 crash as a practical matter stock prices have almost no impact on investment the bubble of the late 1990s was the major exception when companies were directly issuing stock to finance investment stock prices do affect consumption through the wealth effect but the recent decline is not large enough to have all that much impact also since it was just reversing a sharp run up in the prior 18 months it essentially means that we will not see some of the positive wealth effect that the economy would have felt otherwise basically the hysteria over the drop in the stock market is either people in the media displaying their ignorance or a political swipe at donald trump by people who apparently don t think there are substantive reasons to criticize him this drop is not the sort of thing that serious people should concern themselves with wealth inequality and the stock market one of the most bizarre aspects of the market s recent decline is that many of the same people who have been decrying the rise in wealth inequality in this recovery have been complaining about the drop in the market this is bizarre because the rise in wealth inequality is the run up in the stock market over the last decade stock is disproportionately held by the rich with the richest 1 0 percent of families hold almost 40 percent of stock wealth held by individuals and the top 0 5 percent of families holding almost a quarter of stock wealth this means that when the market rises the rich get richer relative to everyone else conversely when the market falls wealth inequality is reduced for most middle class people their house is their main asset house prices have been outpacing inflation in recent years but generally house prices increase roughly in line with the rate of inflation it is not a good story when house prices rise more rapidly rapid rises in house prices mean that homeowners become wealthier but it places houses further out of the reach of those who don t already own a home furthermore if the rise in house prices reflects the fundamentals in the housing market it means that rents are also rising if the rise in house prices doesn t reflect the fundamentals in the housing market then we have a bubble as was the case in the last decade this is also not good news anyhow it is not really plausible to tell a story where rises in housing wealth will allow the middle class reduce the wealth gap in the context of a rapidly rising stock market it is also not plausible to tell a story of the wealth gap closing appreciably due to increased savings by low and middle class families suppose the bottom 100 million families increased their annual savings by 5 000 this would be a huge increase after three years they will have accumulated another 1 5 trillion in savings in a context where total wealth is near 100 trillion this is barely a drop in the bucket i have argued elsewhere that wealth is really not a very useful measure but those who think it is have an obligation to be consistent the long and short is that you get to either complain about wealth inequality or a falling stock market you don t get to complain about both the stock plunge and stock returns much of the commentary on the drop in the stock market ignores its absolute levels in spite of the drop the price to earnings ratio for the stock market as a whole is still close to 20 to 1 this compares to a long run average of close to 15 to 1 and it is important to remember that corporate profits remain at extraordinarily high levels as a share of gdp it is reasonable to think that a tight labor market will allow workers to get back some of the income share they lost in the weak labor market following the great recession we may also hope that a democratic congress and possibly a democrat in the white house in 2021 will retake some of the tax cut that trump gave to u s corporations last year for these reasons it is wrong to see the drop in the market as being a great buying opportunity i don t do market analysis for a living and am not in the habit of giving stock advice but no one would have seen the current levels in the stock market as being low if we had not seen the run up of the prior two years the fact that we did see this run up should not change our perceptions of proper market valuation the other point is a simple arithmetic one that seems to be too simple for most economists to grasp the returns that we can expect on stock are inversely related to the price to earnings ratio when the price to earnings ratios are low then returns can be high when price to earnings ratios are high returns will be low this is important because price to earnings ratios have historically been much lower as i just pointed out this allowed for higher returns the long term average for real returns had been over 7 0 percent prior to 2000 it has been considerably lower in the last two decades with the recent plunge putting the annual average under 4 5 percent this is noteworthy for two reasons first if we go back to the late 1990s both democrats and republicans thought it was a clever idea to put social security money in the stock market democrats wanted to put the social security trust fund in the stock market while republicans wanted workers to hold individual accounts that would be largely placed in the stock market in both cases they assumed that the stock market would continue to provide 7 0 percent real returns in spite of the high price to earnings ratios that exists at that time i was rather lonely in arguing that these sorts of returns would not be possible and it does make a difference if someone invested 1 000 in the market in 1998 and got 7 0 percent real returns their money would have increased to 3 870 in 1998 dollars however given the returns we have actually seen a 1 000 invested in 1998 would only be worth 2 410 today the gap between 7 0 percent annual returns and 4 5 percent is a big deal and it becomes even bigger over time if we looked at it over 30 years it would be 7 610 versus 3 750 after 40 years 14 970 compared with 5 820 the other point about the 4 5 percent returns over the last two decades is that it means that shareholders have not been doing great the run up in the stock market from 1980 to 1998 meant that people who held stock forty years ago did quite well but the people who bought into the market in the last two decades have not for some reason there is little awareness of this fact this is likely due to the fact that people do not distinguish between corporate profits which are very high especially after the tax cut and the returns to shareholders this is not a question of feeling sorry for shareholders since the rich hold such a disproportionate share of stock wealth it is simply a question of whether shareholders have been doing especially well in the last two decades the fact their returns have not been good means that they could be allies in trying to bring down ceo pay ceo pay is essentially coming out of profits that could otherwise go toward higher returns there are two reason for preferring the money goes to shareholders rather than ceos while most shares are held by the rich a substantial portion is held by pension funds and middle class people with 401 k s by contrast every penny of ceo compensation goes to someone in the top 0 01 percent more importantly ceo pay affects pay structures throughout the economy if ceo pay were again 20 to 30 times the pay of ordinary workers instead of 200 to 300 times their pay it would bring down pay at the top of the corporate hierarchy more generally we might see the second and third tier of corporate executives getting pay in the high hundreds of thousands instead of millions the same would be true of presidents and ceos of universities and other non profits shareholders should be seen as allies in this effort they have every bit as much reason to want to see lower ceo pay as lower pay for manufacturing workers or retail clerks we should look to help them in that effort and part of the story is increasing their stock returns this column originally ran on dean baker s blog
world economy to grow by 3 5 per cent the world economy will see annual growth of 3 5 percent in 2019 according to a forecast by economists of the chinese academy of social sciences they attributed the slowdown to the expected weakening of the us economy the world s largest after its elevated growth this year as well as financial market turbulence the limited policy tools of major economies to handle an easing as well as trade frictions among major trading powers the predictions are contained in the yellow book of world economy 2019 published by the social sciences academic press china in the united states the authors posited major economic indicators such as gdp and employment have registered levels close to historic highs that means 2018 may be a peak for the us economy said sun jie an author of the book and economist at the institute of world economics and politics of the cass the conference board a new york based economics research institution also said that the us economy may peak at the end of this year for 2019 many organizations such as the world bank and the international monetary fund have forecast that the gdp growth of the us will weaken compared with this year the world bank said us growth could ease to 2 5 percent in 2019 from 2 7 per cent this year the weakening will make the us federal reserve more cautious in raising interest rates sun said world economic growth may also be affected by possible financial market turbulence caused by expected us interest rate hikes which could lead to currency depreciation and monetary crisis in other countries debt defaults in some high debt level countries and possible asset price slumps in other countries as a result of the slowing us economy the book said meanwhile compared with 10 years ago the world s economies have less policy room to cope next year with any crisis the book said in the us the federal funds rate was 5 25 percent before the global financial crisis in 2008 making it possible for the us federal reserve to continually cut interest rates in response to the crisis now however the rate is only 2 25 percent the trade disputes between china and the us and those involving other countries if they escalate could spill over to affect global trade growth reduce investment confidence and even lead to financial military and political conflicts in a worst case scenario which would prove disastrous to the world economy the book said china should stick to its policy of reform and opening up to cope with the impact from changes in the global economy said zhang yuyan director of the cass institut

outlook for the market in the united states was great and stocks did hit a record high in september with apple and amazon becoming the first publicly traded american companies to be valued at more than 1 trillion but 2018 was also turbulent with markets falling sharply in february and again at the end of the year here are the factors that will help determine whether that happens this year

investors were mostly buoyant about his presidency and tolerant of his unpredictable declarations on twitter that bullishness persisted even after it became clear that trump was serious about imposing restrictions on trading partners as a way of gaining concessions from them but as the trade war continued unresolved tensions with china started to become a concern and trump s proclamations started

ari shapiro host until defense secretary jim mattis abruptly resigned last week president trump s critics saw him as an important check on an impulsive commander in chief traditionally it s the role of congress to counterbalance the presidency and next week the powerful armed services committees in both the house and senate will have new chairmen as npr s david welna reports one is definitely not a trump supporter while the other most definitely is david welna byline earlier this month military officers filled an auditorium at the national defense university a defense department funded school focused on national security strategy they d come to hear jim inhofe the oklahoma republican who succeeded the late john mccain as chairman of the senate armed services committee inhofe had been invited to discuss defense policy which he did but he also made sure to put in a good word for president trump soundbite of archived recording jim inhofe it didn t really fit in that presentation here but you got to realize this guy s doing a great job welna inhofe s loyalty to trump was also evident three days after mccain a sharp critic of the president died in august he was asked by a reporter about the white house flying the american flag at full staff even though everywhere else it was still at half staff here s his response soundbite of archived recording inhofe john mccain was partially to blame for that because he was very outspoken that he disagreed with the president in certain areas and wasn t too courteous about it welna inhofe told the national defense university audience he had just spent two hours at the white house with trump who tweeted days earlier that what the u s spends on defense was quote crazy and who d also called for a 5 percent cut in next year s military budget inhofe said he wants tens of billions of dollars more for defense soundbite of archived recording inhofe our number one priority in this country should be defense it should be a no brainer people here with your orientation who are the military you know what i m talking about the general public doesn t welna inhofe apparently did change trump s mind after their meeting a white house official confirmed that trump had agreed to boost the pentagon s budget to 750 billion a 34 billion increase unlike mccain who often tangled with pentagon contractors inhofe has long been a booster of the defense industry todd harrison quite frankly i think inhofe and mccain there s a night and day difference welna that s defense budget analyst todd harrison at the center for strategic and international studies a washington defense think tank harrison expects an even greater contrast between inhofe and adam smith the washington democrat who s about to take over as chairman of the house armed services committee harrison i think smith in general is going to be more skeptical you know looking at increases in the defense budget in particularly some of the major new weapons systems that are due for modernization whereas i think senator inhofe is going to have a more open wallet when it comes to many defense issues welna in an interview incoming chairman smith says he has yet to see a compelling argument for boosting next year s defense budget soundbite of archived recording adam smith when you look at our budget priorities for the country the size of our debt and our deficit the infrastructure needs the other needs that are out there if you spend that much money on defense the debt and the deficit will go ever higher and these other priorities go unaddressed welna smith points to the trillion dollar plus cost of upgrading the nation s nuclear forces as a prime example of unwise spending to that inhofe has a simple reply soundbite of archived recording inhofe mr smith s a very good friend of mine we ve always disagreed on this subject welna inhofe s campaign to boost defense spending got linked earlier this month to some recently acquired stock soundbite of archived recording unidentified reporter the chairman of the senate armed services committee coming under fire this week for buying tens of thousands of dollars in defense stocks after pushing for a big boost in military spending welna when the nbc affiliate in inhofe s hometown of tulsa spotlighted his defense stock purchases the 84 year old five term senator said he d sold that stock and insisted it was bought without his knowledge by a financial adviser for his part inhofe has publicly questioned soon to be house chairman smith s ability to fulfill their two committees biggest task coming up with an annual defense policy bill that sets spending levels both panels can agree on smith dismisses inhofe s sniping soundbite of archived recording smith eh you know things get said it doesn t bother me i m 100 percent confident that i can work with senator inhofe to get a defense bill welna for now though smith plans to be a thorn in the side of the same defense establishment

2018 bloomberg finance lp as u s markets open briefly again tomorrow this analysis addresses a key question for most global investors what is the relationship between u s political risk and the recent volatility in equity markets a quick scan of financial headlines could lead one to conclude that u s politics the ongoing government shutdown the president s attacks on the fed developments in the u s china trade dispute the mueller investigation and more broadly the chaotic governance style of the trump administration are core drivers of stock market gyrations at the same time equities have boomed during very recent periods of political volatility and us markets large deep and diverse are historically quite resilient to geopolitical shocks a lack of data measuring or even defining political risks adds to the confusion with investors relying on breaking news headlines ad hoc punditry and their own implicit or sometimes explicit bias to try unwind the politics markets connection geoquant fills this void with our daily systematic and ai driven political risk data streams allowing investors to connect the dots between politics and markets to wit here we examine the relationship between key u s political risks and the s p 500 the analysis echoes the three core points we have made over the past two years of u s political volatility there has been a major buildup of u s political and geopolitical risk which at least until recently has not been reflected in u s equity markets in large part due to strong economic fundamentals and equity positive risks like pro cyclical expansionary fiscal policy the country s negative political fundamentals as we argued would bite once economic fundamentals began to fall off that said larger draw downs in the s p 500 over the past 6 years are clearly associated with periods of increasing top line political risk while policy risk and regulatory risk are both negatively correlated with the s p 500 in the same period higher u s political risks especially policy uncertainty risk and geopolitical risk have hit the market more severely since the 2018 midterm elections as predicted at the time the graph below tracks our top line u s political risk score against the s p 500 close over the past six years recall that for each country in our dataset the top line political risk score is composed of 22 fundamental political sub indicators ultimately grouped into governance risk social risk and security risk more holistic theory driven measurements of political risk than suggested by sensationalistic headlines geoquant 2019 the correlation between the two indicators is weakly positive r 0 19 suggesting no intuitively negative relationship in aggregate nonetheless by overlaying the largest single day drawdowns in the s p 500 as indicated by the red vertical lines in the figure above it is clear that all but one the march 2018 drawdown came amid increasing u s political risk this echoes our broader findings that although the relationships between political risk and market outcomes are often too complex to be captured by bivariate correlations even these simple analyses reveal compelling highly relevant patterns that only become apparent by measuring political risk at high frequency the complexity of political risk notwithstanding per the table below two of the most equity relevant sub indicators of u s political risk regulatory risk and policy risk do show relatively strong negative correlations with the s p 500 over the past six years at 52 and 61 respectively moreover the correlation for policy risk which aggregates macro policy risks micro policy risks and investment trade policy risks has strengthened to 0 80 since the 2016 presidential election while the correlation for regulatory risk which is effectively a sub indicator of policy risk has strengthened to 0 81 the strengthening of these relationships post 2016 election reflects the equity positive decline in business regulations under the trump administration along with the more idiosyncratic negative effects of nationalist unpredictable trade policies note further that higher macro economic policy risk under trump i e pro cyclical tax cuts and higher spending have generally been good for equities i e a positive correlation weakening the broader negativity of the policy risk relationship geoquant 2018 a much broader set of u s political risks have negative relationships with the s p 500 since the even more recent u s midterms reflecting trends which we warned about before and after the polls we specifically predicted an increase in policy uncertainty risk which has since materialized with the government shutdown trump s accelerated attacks on the fed and mixed signals on the u s china trade dispute nb unlike policy risk policy uncertainty risk includes the potential for rapid policy change and or instability regardless of the direction of such change higher policy uncertainty risk is set to continue in 2019 with a new democratic house at least in part due to developments in the mueller probe and the related set of institutional regime risks associated with a potential impeachment drive and the trump administration s more aggressive posture toward state institutions geoquant 2018 note as well that a new democratic house is also driving a projected spike in previously declining regulatory risk albeit from a low base geoquant 2018 finally note the strong negative post midterm correlation between the s p 500 close and u s geopolitical risk as latter has been exacerbated by recent developments like the syria troop withdrawal the mattis resignation and escalating cold tech war tensions with china
by john rubino much about 2019 is uncertain but a few things are pretty much guaranteed including the following government debt will rise at an accelerating rate like a life long dieter who finally gives up and decides to eat himself to death the us is now committed to trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see and that s get this assuming no recession in the coming decade during the next downturn that trillion will become two or more but in 2019 another trillion plus is guaranteed but the us debt binge is downright orderly compared to much of the rest of the world after paris nearly burned to the ground last month president macron responded surprise with massively higher spending macron bets spending binge can save his plan to transform france bloomberg emmanuel macron is rolling the dice with france s public finances to keep his grand plans for the economy alive after weeks of protests on the streets macron s government will set out a raft of measures to try to calm the so called yellow vest protests on thursday and they will almost certainly see france breach the european union s budget deficit ceiling next year the 40 year old president is arguing the concessions are necessary to maintain public support for his efforts to make the economy more efficient macron is now facing an impossible trilemma said bernhard bartels associate director at frankfurt based scope ratings you can t have have popular support ongoing structural reforms and fiscal consolidation all at the same time macron s announcement monday that he ll raise the minimum wage abolish taxes on overtime and get rid of a controversial tax on pensions will send next year s budget deficit to about 3 5 percent of output up from a previous target of 2 9 percent according to media reports that s well beyond the 3 percent limit imposed on members of the euro zone china s growth has been slowing in part because it eventually had to and in part because the us has finally lost patience with beijing s cheating and cybertheft china s response china says more tax cuts easier monetary policy coming in 2019 bloomberg china s top policy makers confirmed that more monetary and fiscal support will be rolled out in 2019 as the world s second largest economy grapples with a slowdown that s yet to show signs of ending facing the most difficult economic environment in years amid the trade standoff with the u s the conference outcome suggests beijing sees increasing urgency in tackling stalling growth the focus for macro policy has shifted from lowering long term risks to boosting short term demand said larry hu head of china economics at macquarie securities ltd the stimulus pledge did little to convince investors who have seen nearly 3 trillion wiped off the value of china s stock market since the end of january the australian dollar a proxy for betting on china due to the country s trade exposure to the asian economy fell against the dollar along with most major currencies the economy slowed again in november as retail sales and industrial production weakened economists see growth of the world s second largest economy slowing to 6 2 percent next year from 6 6 percent in 2018 as uncertainty over the trade war couples with a decline in consumer confidence to dim the outlook corporate share buybacks will slow to a trickle corporations are the ultimate dumb money note on the following chart how in the previous cycle their buying back of their own shares peaked just as stock prices hit record highs in 2007 stocks then plunged and corporations dumb to the end became net sellers at the bottom the first part of this pattern repeated in 2018 as corporations took advantage of tax law changes to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars and apparently used the whole load to buy back their shares just before pretty much everything fell off a cliff starting in october now ceos across the corporate spectrum are heading into their annual shareholder meetings having squandered big parts of their investors capital on overpriced stock tense times for sure and not likely to whet the appetite for more buybacks we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us if the rest of the pattern holds expect corporations to stop buying and maybe even start selling by year end politics will get even crazier this is the easiest prediction in the history of predicting the us just handed the house of representatives to democrats who have been itching to destroy the president for two interminable years given a chance to make those dreams a reality the dems will throw everything in the political dirty tricks handbook at the executive branch the result something much worse than gridlock let s call it chaos until the media coins catchier term across the pond brexit is looking decidedly hard meaning the uk just leaves the eu and lets the lawyers sort out who owes what to whom and who gets to go where when the french government s promise of deficits that blow through the eu s limits meanwhile presents continental bureaucrats with a dilemma let france get away with it which also means letting italy and every other dysfunctional european country do whatever they want or stop france and open a possibly irreparable rift between the eu s major powers and this is all happening with german chancellor angela merkel a lame duck and no clear replacement in sight and with the far right ascendant as for latin america just google brazil argentina or venezuela and see what their 2019 looks like a year of crosscurrents take soaring government debt combine it with less corporate support for stocks and political turmoil wherever you look and the impact on equity and bond prices is unclear rising government spending will support stocks while falling corporate share buybacks will remove support political turmoil will spook the markets but also engender hope that panicked central banks will respond with bigger and better qe programs which other things being equal would be good for bonds and maybe stocks financial assets as a result might do pretty much anything there s no way to know precious metals however will love a world of falling governments and soaring debt so one bonus prediction gold tests the 1 360 resistance that has repelled it four times in the past five years and this time breaks through

if macy s can close the sale of the i magnin building in san francisco within the next month it s likely to beat its full year targets for real estate gains and asset sale cash proceeds check out the latest macy s earnings call transcript at the beginning of the current fiscal year macy s m 0 53 management projected that 2018 would be another big year for asset sales former cfo karen hoguet stated on the fourth quarter 2017 earnings call that macy s would likely book 300 million to 325 million of asset sale gains this year with cash proceeds coming in even higher at 340 million to 370 million most of the expected windfall would come from selling part of macy s downtown san francisco flagship store but thanks to some smaller deals along the way macy s could potentially exceed its forecast for asset sale gains and total cash proceeds during fiscal 2018 asset sales have been a key source of earnings and cash for the past two fiscal years macy s has been quite active on the asset sale front the company booked 209 million of real estate gains in fiscal 2016 and 544 million in fiscal 2017 cash proceeds from asset sales peaked at 673 million in fiscal 2016 and retreated to 411 million in fiscal 2017 the discrepancies between the real estate gains and the cash proceeds are driven by the book value of the properties being sold as well as accounting rules that determine when the gains can be booked a substantial chunk of macy s asset sale gains have come from selling parts of its downtown flagship locations at the end of fiscal 2015 macy s struck a deal to sell the upper floors of its brooklyn store for 270 million in a deal that was structured for the buyer to pay over a three year period 100 million of the proceeds was used to fund a multiyear renovation that has substantially improved the rest of the store the men s store in downtown san francisco was sold a year later for 250 million macy s also sold the upper floors of its downtown seattle store in two phases for a total of 115 million in smaller moves the company has unloaded its stores in downtown portland and minneapolis for a total of 113 million these city center real estate deals have grabbed most of the headlines however macy s has also sold numerous mall based stores a mix of underperforming stores valuable locations in high traffic malls and stores that are very close to other macy s locations more success in fiscal 2018 during the first three quarters of fiscal 2018 macy s booked 111 million of gains from selling real estate cash proceeds totaled 121 million since the end of the third quarter macy s has sold at least three more properties it has unloaded two massive stand alone furniture stores in the chicago suburbs for 26 million and a full line store in nanuet new york for 11 5 million both furniture stores are less than a mile from large full line macy s stores that could easily be reconfigured to accommodate furniture sections meanwhile the nanuet location is just three miles from a newer macy s store that said macy s biggest deal of the year if it can be completed will come in the final month of fiscal 2018 having reaped a massive windfall from selling its san francisco men s store two years ago macy s is now looking to sell the i magnin building a 240 000 square foot piece of its san francisco flagship store if macy s gets a similar price per square foot as it received in the men s store sale the proceeds would exceed 240 million including its other asset sales since the beginning of fiscal 2018 this would push the company s total cash proceeds for the year to 400 million or more ahead of management s guidance there s more to come while macy s won t be able to come up with 400 million in asset sale proceeds every year the company does have a long pipeline of opportunities ahead of it it is currently marketing its long term ground lease for the medinah temple in chicago s river north neighborhood the building currently houses a 130 000 square foot bloomingdale s home store which macy s plans to consolidate into its full line bloomingdale s store just half a mile away macy s also may sell its boulder colorado store which could be converted to office space macy s has dozens of other stand alone home or furniture stores that could be sold in future years it also may begin to redevelop some of its excess parking lot space in partnership with brookfield asset management to build restaurants hotels apartments or offices near its stores lastly macy s massive herald square flagship store in manhattan remains its most valuable asset the company is moving very deliberately to figure out how best to capture the value of this prime real estate while enhancing the productivity of its most important store with all of these opportunities asset sales should continue to make a meaningful contribution to macy s bottom line and its cash flow for the foreseeable future

by david shepardson washington reuters alphabet inc s o google unit won approval from u s regulators to deploy a radar based motion sensing device known as project soli the federal communications commission fcc said in an order late on monday that it would grant google a waiver to operate the soli sensors at higher power levels than currently allowed the fcc said the sensors can also be operated aboard aircraft the fcc said the decision will serve the public interest by providing for innovative device control features using touchless hand gesture technology a google spokeswoman did not immediately comment on wednesday google said in documents filed with the fcc that the effort emerged from the work of google s advanced technology and projects group that focuses on development of mobile technologies the fcc said the soli sensor captures motion in a three dimensional space using a radar beam to enable touchless control of functions or features that can benefit users with mobility or speech impairments google says the sensor can allow users to press an invisible button between the thumb and index fingers or a virtual dial that turns by rubbing a thumb against the index finger in a video on its website google said a user could operate a smart watch scroll through music or adjust the volume by simply motioning using the system google added that the radar signal could penetrate fabrics enabling controls that could work in a pocket or a backpack the company says that even though these controls are virtual the interactions feel physical and responsive as feedback is generated by the haptic sensation of fingers touching google says the virtual tools can approximate the precision of natural human hand motion and the sensor can be embedded in wearables phones computers and vehicles in march google asked the fcc to allow its short range interactive motion sensing soli radar to operate in the 57 to 64 ghz frequency band at power levels consistent with european telecommunications standards institute standards facebook inc o raised concerns with the fcc that the soli sensors operating in the spectrum band at higher power levels might have issues coexisting with other technologies after discussions google and facebook jointly told the fcc in september that they agreed the sensors could operate at higher than currently allowed power levels without interference but at lower levels than previously proposed by google the company told the fcc that without the higher power levels that field testing showed blind spots could occur close to the sensor location facebook told the fcc in september that it expected a variety of use cases to develop with respect to new radar devices including soli the soli devices can be operated aboard aircraft but must still comply with federal aviation administration rules governing portable electronic devices

marimed canadian national railway and shotspotter are all flying below analysts radar check out the latest canadian national railway and shotspotter earnings call transcripts following the crowd may give one a sense of security but it s in finding stocks no one else is looking at that the real opportunity lies if a stock is flying under wall street s radar there s good chance an issue is being mispriced by the market we asked three motley fool contributors to identify such stealth investments and they discovered marimed mrmd 4 23 canadian national railway cni 1 17 and shotspotter ssti 5 62 as ones you might want to get in on before the crowds come along a low flying pot stock george budwell marimed if you re looking for an under the radar growth stock to add to your portfolio marimed an american cannabis oriented company is certainly worth checking out right now marimed is an ever evolving cannabis company that generates its revenue from multistate leasing agreements professional consulting services to potential growers and distributors and in house cultivation capabilities largely derived from its acquisition of former clients and as an important offshoot marimed also plowed 30 million into a strategic partnership with hemp producer gencanna earlier this year with the recent passage of the 2018 farm bill which basically legalized hemp and hemp derived products like cbd oil in the united states this side business could end up becoming a major source of revenue for marimed in the not so distant future despite the company s multipronged approach to business development however marimed s stock hasn t exactly caught the eyes of wall street s blue chip investors quite yet in fact the most recent 13f filings with the sec show that only a smattering of institutional investors currently own shares of this promising cannabis company what s the holdup a few things first and foremost marijuana remains illegal at the federal level within the united states which presents a number of legal and logistical barriers for companies operating in this emerging space another major issue is that marimed s stock doesn t trade on a major exchange at present but rather on the largely unregulated over the counter exchange taken together these two factors are probably more than enough to keep the majority of institutional investors from even considering marimed s stock but that doesn t mean that marimed s stock isn t worth owning by retail folk long story short marimed is exceedingly well positioned to become a top player in the american cannabis market once lawmakers finally put an end to prohibition at the federal level and that seminal event no longer appears like a pipe dream with several lawmakers expected to introduce legislation early next year designed to decriminalize marijuana at the federal level or at a minimum make it a states rights issue neha chamaria canadian national railway canadian national railway shares were on their way to a solid 2018 before reversing course in october the railroad stock has shed nearly 19 in just the past three months wiping out all of its early yearly gains and some more that is despite the fact that key end markets are on strong footing and the company is on track to deliver strong earnings growth for fiscal 2018 investors have been wary ever since canadian national reported strong third quarter numbers in late october but kept its full year guidance unchanged the company however still expects to earn adjusted earnings of 5 30 to 5 45 canadian dollars per share compared to the ca 4 99 it earned in 2017 meanwhile canadian national s revenue grew roughly 8 during the nine months ended sept 30 2018 to hit record highs and it continues to generate greater free cash flow than net income further down the road canadian national remains a top railroad stock to own for several reasons it is the only railroad in north america that connects three coasts atlantic pacific and gulf coasts and moves goods worth a whopping ca 250 billion every year this company is also the most cost efficient railroad and is committed to shareholders having increased its dividend every year since 1996 and topped it up with regular share repurchases this year management pumped out record capital expenditures to speed up as many as 27 projects all of which are investments that should benefit the company in the long haul given canadian national s solid track record and its foothold in an essential industry i don t see why long term investors shouldn t consider the recent drop in the stock price an opportunity a shot in the dark rich duprey shotspotter although gunshot detection leader shotspotter has lost more than half its value from the 52 week high it hit in september shares have still more than doubled over the past year the pullback was more the result of the broader collapse in the stock market that occurred in october and again in december but this small company still stands poised to make a big bang third quarter revenues jumped 35 to a record 9 2 million as the company added 36 net new square miles of coverage from the addition of three new cities a college campus and a highway project and expanded coverage in four existing cities only a few dozen cities have signed up for shotspotter s services so far meaning there s a lot of room to grow for one it has the market all to itself no one else offers shotspotter s type of technology what it does is place sensors in areas where gunfire may occur the sensors pick up the sound of a gunshot transmit a recorded file to a review center at which acoustics experts confirm whether the sound was indeed gunfire and then forward the alert to law enforcement for a response this all typically occurs within 45 seconds the sensors can also tell whether there are multiple shooters or if high capacity weapons are being used considering the need for shotspotter s technology and its near monopoly on deployment although there are competitors serving college campuses it maybe surprising that wall street isn t following but because it is still a niche company and a small one at that it has mostly stayed off the radar

if the shutdown doesn t end quickly the one in january 2018 lasted just two days several agencies will not release regular government reports for the current week the november new home sales report will be delayed update the bls is fully funded and the december employment report will be released on time private data like the pending home sales report this week will still be released all federal reserve data will continue to be released separate funding also the dol will continue to process unemployment claims and release the weekly initial unemployment claims report if the shutdown lasts through this week we should see a spike in claims in the report released the following week the following graph shows the 4 week moving average of weekly claims since january 2000 with various event driven spikes labeled click on graph for larger image note the spike related to the 2013 government shutdown weekly claims jumped 66 000 in the week following the shutdown in 2013 we will probably see a similar spike in the report released the week of december 31st if the shutdown does not end quickly another impact from the shutdown will be on mortgage lending in 2013 the irs stopped processing 4506 t forms the required two years of tax returns for mortgage lending for loans ready to close this will not be a problem and lenders can still accept applications but this could slow closings a few weeks depending on the duration of the shutdown there are many other impacts from the shutdown and hopefully it will be resolved soon

these might be the cheapest stocks you ve never heard about since the great recession ended growth stocks have handily outperformed value stocks thanks to historically low lending rates that have facilitated borrowing and business expansion but that could be about to change last year brought with it two stock market corrections of which the ongoing correction is the steepest we ve witnessed in about a decade with wall street and investors clearly concerned about the near term direction of the economy more focus is probably going to be paid to value in 2019 and just in case you d forgotten a bank of america merrill lynch report found that value stocks pretty sizably outperformed growth stocks over a 90 year stretch between 1926 and 2016 as you can imagine value stocks can be found in every sector of the stock market but not every value stock is obvious many are in fact going unnoticed by wall street and investors if you re looking for deep discounts in 2019 then perhaps one or more of these under the radar value stocks is perfect for you innoviva there s a pretty good chance that you ve never heard the name innoviva inva 0 49 before but that shouldn t stop healthcare investors from digging into this incredibly cheap company that s valued at just over eight times its 2019 consensus earnings per share eps innoviva is the partner that helped to develop the next generation of long lasting copd and asthma inhalers that glaxosmithkline brought to market these include the duo s most successful launches breo eliipta and anoro ellipta as well as the newer trelegy ellipta initially these long lasting medicines struggled to find insurance coverage and had difficulty penetrating a market that had a number of well known copd and asthma medicines with long track records although it took years of marketing and physician re education breo has generated 960 million in sales through the first nine months of 2018 with anoro chipping in 422 million through september year over year sales growth for breo and anoro has totaled 11 and 48 respectively through q3 as a royalty partner innoviva receives a percentage of sales which through the third quarter equaled 181 1 million since innoviva has no research and development ongoing and therefore incredibly low operating expenses it s able to simply sit back and count its high margin royalty revenue with innoviva working hard to repay debt that it took on in 2014 and on track for more than 2 in eps in 2019 this under the radar value stock could be worth a look allegiant travel generally speaking the airline industry is one to avoid over the long run but it s hard to ignore the value that discount airline allegiant travel algt 0 38 brings to the table at eight times next year s eps and with a peg ratio below 0 7 allegiant has lost more than half of its value since the midpoint of 2015 as a result of lower crude oil prices scratching your head as to how that makes sense the gist is that allegiant s key competitive advantage is its ability to undercut major airlines on ticket price but with crude prices remaining relatively low for years major players were able go toe to toe with allegiant and its bare bones fare peers however things are changing in a big way allegiant has upgraded to an all new airbus fleet the company previously had one of the oldest fleets in the skies which certainly helped with plane acquisition costs but was a killer on the fuel efficiency front although it s had some higher expenses in recent years that ve weighed on the company s bottom line as the result of this decision its fleet is significantly more fuel efficient now and therefore able to give this discount airline its competitive edge over the major airlines once again allegiant s efforts to reward its shareholders aren t unnoticed either share repurchases along with a 0 70 per quarter dividend have provided some stability in an otherwise volatile industry the sky remains the limit for this profitable airline ani pharmaceuticals not to focus on drugmakers but there are quite a few under the radar bargains with single digit forward p e ratios and double digit sales growth potential minnesota based ani pharmaceuticals anip 1 12 which develops generic and branded medicines happens to be one of them the past year has been very unkind to ani pharmaceuticals with its stock losing a third of its value interestingly you won t find anything among ani s press releases that merits this decline instead it s likely the result of weaker investor sentiment that comes with a falling stock market and generic drug price weakness for all generic drug makers in 2018 however it s unlikely that this generic drug pricing weakness lasts long or that it affects ani s growth potential this is a company that had just 10 commercial products on pharmacy shelves in 2014 and was generating 56 million in sales as of the end of september 2018 ani had 42 products on pharmacy shelves 31 of which were generic and was on pace for approximately 200 million in sales per wall street ani s consensus estimate is close 300 million in sales by 2021 how can such incredible growth and the company s sub nine forward p e go unnoticed well that s because ani tends to acquire and recommercialize previously approved medicines rather than develop new therapies in house like most drug companies this suggests wall street is overlooking the product diversity and low cost nature of ani s approach and is the perfect reason why you shouldn t check out the latest allegiant travel and ani pharmaceuticals earnings call transcripts

of all the holiday gatherings jerome powell gets invited to a sit down in the oval office might be one of the last he d want to attend just days after president trump blamed the federal reserve chairman for the stock market s december swoon and discussed with aides his desire to fire him white house staff are reportedly working to set up a meeting between the two men while some fed watchers said such a confab could ease tensions most warned it might be a minefield for powell either creating the impression the fed is giving in to presidential pressure or simply generating confusion over what gets discussed this is a very dangerous meeting said mark spindel the head of potomac river capital a washington investment fund coming amid a massive market sell off and soon after a bevy of attacks on powell from trump a meeting might only put the fed in an even tougher spot spindel said could i imagine a kiss and make up in the rose garden yes he said but the president could also offer his own read out of what happens as he has after other meetings donald kohn a former fed vice chairman under ben bernanke agreed a meeting would carry plenty of peril for powell the downside is not the meeting itself but what happens afterwards said kohn a senior fellow at the brookings institution in washington the risk is that the president interprets what he hears and then repeats something publicly that is not entirely consistent with what the chair wanted to convey he said advertisement with nine rate hikes in three years the fed is trying to balance the risks of moving too fast and squelching the u s expansion and moving too slowly allowing the economy or financial markets to overheat trump has railed against rate hikes since july because inflation is tame his ire hit a new level after the fed hiked for a fourth time this year on dec 19 a move that further depressed an already sliding stock market two days later bloomberg news reported that trump had spoken with aides about firing powell triggering even worse pain for stocks the s p 500 index fell on dec 24 to its lowest since april 2017 that s angered the president who has encouraged americans to judge his performance by the size of their retirement accounts on christmas eve he continued to blame the fed tweeting the only problem our economy has is the fed the constant pressure has forced powell to regularly reassure markets that fed officials operate independent of politics that means they will neither stop raising rates at trump s behest nor continue hiking in order to demonstrate their independence advertisement trump is changing the debate about what monetary policy should be said george washington university professor sarah binder it just raises these doubts about how insulated the fed can be from these kinds of pressures some senior administration officials appear to understand the risks of undermining the fed and have sought to contain the controversy trump s incoming chief of staff mick mulvaney said dec 23 that trump now realizes he does not have the ability to fire a fed chairman on dec 26 kevin hassett chairman of the white house council of economic advisers told reporters that powell was 100 percent safe in his post a report that white house staff hoped to set up a trump powell meeting appeared in the wall street journal on dec 23 since bill clinton presidents have refrained from criticizing the fed in public and generally resisted pressuring the central bank behind the scenes still meetings between a fed chair and president were not unheard of alan greenspan bernanke and janet yellen all attended such gatherings typically to brief the president on the u s economic outlook deal with a crisis or discuss their reappointment or departure even in the current rancorous circumstances a meeting now has some potential upside for powell the opportunity for jay is that he gets a chance to confront his chief critic and enhance the president s understanding of why the federal reserve is doing what it s doing kohn said hassett said the two of them are great guys who would get along if they were to meet and talk things through the president loves to listen to reason to arguments to analysis and jay does too so i think they would have a very productive dinner were they to meet he told fox business network on thursday adam posen president of the peterson institute for international economics in washington counseled powell not to challenge the president even if trump follows the meeting with a mischaracterization of what was discussed the fed can just be factual he said it s not their job to correct other people it s their job to repeat what their message is send questions comments to the editors
as we begin 2019 the global economy seems uncertain but experts believe the outlook is more positive than negative including in new jersey our growth rate for employment at least through october was very consistent to that of the nation was very consistent to that of new york and was ahead of pennsylvania and connecticut rutgers university economist james hughes said as a result the new jersey economy in 2018 really outperformed our expectations earlier in the year hughes pointed out that after a sluggish period following the great recession the last several years we have gained traction and the economy has gotten up to speed he said the state economy has been impacted by fundamental structural changes including the flow of millennials out of suburban new jersey into urban environments and suburban office buildings and malls struggling to stay relevant we ve had to adjust to really a post suburban economic and demographic era but i think the state has finally started to respond he said the office industry has repositioned a number of buildings and campuses really transforming them into viable future economic assets at the same time as millennials adults as old as 35 have started having children they re going to be looking for family raising environments and i think they re getting tired of living in a shoebox in brooklyn and a little bit of green patch in new jersey looks pretty good hughes pointed out the recent announcement by e commerce giant amazon to locate a new headquarters in long island city will benefit the garden state economically we re in the gravitational field of new york city and so we re getting a spillover effect from that we have a chance to be part of that broader technology ecosystem going forward with the recent interest rate hike by the fed ongoing concern about a possible trade war with china and political shifts in europe financial markets remain jittery but hughes said the state s unemployment rate remains low and should remain that way unless the global economy goes into a tank he said when all of these factors are taken together we re in a much better position today than we were say in 2012 and 2013
