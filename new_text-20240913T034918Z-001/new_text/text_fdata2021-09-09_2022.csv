one year after the head of illinois largest public employee pension fund resigned due to what the fund has only described at performance issues a recently published report by the state s chief ethics officer reveals the circumstances behind the departures of two more former high ranking officials at the pension fund in 2020 the former chief information officer at the illinois teachers retirement system repeatedly directed contracts toward the company he founded and also lied about having severed ties with the company according to a report published last month by illinois executive inspector general susan haling trs manages the pensions of more than 427 000 current and retired teachers as well as pension beneficiaries the report centers on former cio jay singh s conflicts of interest but also brings to light the firing of trs former chief financial officer jana bergschneider who was fired last july as the investigation unfolded singh resigned in april of last year two months after he was interviewed as part of an internal investigation into his conflicts of interest singh began as the pension fund s cio in august 2019 but for 10 months before that worked on a contract basis as a project manager for trs gemini project a custom software program built to administer a new defined contribution plan made available to teachers in a 2018 law while he was the contractual project manager on the gemini project singh steered three contract jobs to employees of singh3 consulting the company he founded in 2015 the investigation found according to the report investigators found singh put his thumb on the scale during the procurement process by electing not to review a submission for the work from a competing vendor and closely overseeing the scoring process for awarding the contract the first singh3 employee was hired as a part time software developer in november 2018 a little over a month after singh began his contract as gemini s project manager investigators also noted that despite the work order s stipulation that at least 90 of the work for that position be performed on site in springfield the singh3 employee worked from india and was never on site that person was eventually hired as a senior technical systems analyst in april 2019 at a 105 per hour rate a 30 hourly increase from the previous contract singh also influenced the contract awards for two other singh3 employees while he was still the contractual project manager according to investigators including being present for an interview directing work orders to be changed to better fit the singh3 employees and ultimately directing the contract award of at least one of the employees the singh3 employees were subcontractors of two unnamed vendors that trs has kept on call in order to expedite filling positions that come up according to trs spokesman dave urbanek who stressed the pension fund has totally revamped its contracting protocols in the wake of the investigation even with subcontracted singh3 employees coming through another vendor an unnamed trs employee began getting suspicious of singh s behavior according to the report and started requesting subcontractor information from trs contractors in late july 2019 but several days after that singh officially began a full time job as trs chief information officer on aug 5 2019 earning 220 000 annually the day before singh provided trs a letter stating he was resigning from his positions at singh3 and severing all ties financial interests and management control with the business in the course of an internal investigation trs officials and later oeig investigators found that wasn t true singh remained involved with his company six months after he began as cio singh was still officially registered as a business officer on singh3 s corporate registration with the state of georgia where the company is based though singh said he d signed over singh3 s bank account to family members who took over the company he never transferred his shares of stock to family members according to investigators additionally according to accounts subpoenaed by the oeig during the investigation singh3 made more than 30 000 in payments to a credit cared company through transactions that referenced singh even after he became a full time trs employee even so singh directed one final contract to a singh3 employee after he began as cio this time awarding a contract for a business analyst position to someone singh admitted he had told the scoring team had good skills according to the report singh also directed the unnamed trs employee who was already suspicious of him to eliminate another vendor from the search process singh has not worked for the state for nearly a year and a half and the oeig can only recommend he never be rehired and singh3 never be used for contracting again but the report also places blame on trs executive team for turning a blind eye to singh s conflicts of interest and recommends big changes in the contract award process changes urbanek said have already been made the report found that ingram was aware of outstanding questions about what steps singh took to distance himself from his company and that it was the subject of discussion between trs higher ups but ultimately no one looked into whether singh had in fact removed himself as an officer from the company or was still benefitting financially from singh3 according to investigators singh could not be reached for comment through either singh3 or his new venture a startup based in marietta ga aimed at connecting cooks with consumers through shared kitchens according to singh s linkedin account the oeig called trs lack of action on singh s conflicts of interest disconcerting it appears that managers believed the issue was sufficiently dealt with by solely relying on mr singh s representation that he was severing ties with singh 3 the report said no action was taken or follow up conducted by trs while the oeig agrees that trs managers do not have to be investigators there is a duty of managers to at least determine an appropriate course of action when presented with an actual or perceived conflict the report noted several high up trs employees who should have exercised oversight in the matter no longer work for the pension fund including bergschneider who allegedly carried out some of the contract award business in concert with singh since november bergschneider has worked as the chief fiscal officer and human resource director at the state s office of the state appellate defender bergschneider could not be reached for comment corrective action and a cloud bergschneider was terminated from trs on july 2 2020 based upon her work performance and conduct related to the procurement process on the gemini project the oeig report said apparently quoting from a reason given to investigators by the pension fund ingram was placed on administrative leave at the end of that month a result of the trs board s unanimous vote after an investigation into performance issued conducted by chicago law firms king and spalding he resigned a few days later and trs remains tight lipped about the exact reason for ingram s departure calling it a personnel matter but urbanek reiterated to npr illinois the same reasoning given every inquiring media outlet in the last year that ingram had difficulties meeting performance metrics in his contract in the 2020 fiscal year the last four months of which were marked by the covid 19 pandemic trs assumed rate of return for its pension investments was 7 but the actual rate of return was only 0 6 according to a final report published by the commission on government forecasting and accountability earlier this summer however urbanek last month august said the pension fund s preliminary rate of return for the most recent fiscal year that ended june 30 was 23 5 which represents a 10 billion boon to the fund in a hot stock market year according to a response to a freedom of information act request from illinois times last year trs spent 577 000 on king and spalding s investigation between march and september of 2020 aimed at ingram alone the pension fund spent an additional 114 000 on an investigation conducted by chicago law firm elrod friedman during the same time period on a probe of both ingram and bergschneider according to reporting from the illinois times the fbi expressed interest in the matter last year but it s unclear what if anything came of that interest the oeig report outlines a few changes trs has made since investigators looked into singh s conflicts of interest including a new contracting process overseen by a hiring committee of five or six senior managers everything has to be documented every decision is recorded urbanek said of the hiring and contracting process it prevents everything going through one person who can basically manipulate the system while urbanek acknowledged the new protocol has slowed down contract awards and inhibited the fund s ability to be as nimble as it was before he described it as a necessary tradeoff to rectify trs embarrassing predicament in addition to hiring a new human resources director and providing additional procurement training to staff trs has also established a whistleblower hotline for employees and contractors to anonymously report fraud one of the things that was concerning abut this incident was that people were raising questions about hiring practices very brave people raising concerns and their concerns urbanek said urbanek stressed singh s conflicts of interest were confined to hiring within the pension fund and did not affect trs members pension benefits copyright 2021 npr illinois 91 9 uis

yellen says u s could default in october urges congress to raise debt ceiling washington treasury secretary janet yellen again called on congressional leaders to raise the debt ceiling in a letter wednesday saying the country may soon be unable to meet its financial obligations if nothing is done why it matters yellen said the treasury estimates that it will run out of cash and extraordinary measures used to finance the government in october a default which has never before occurred in u s history would likely cause irreparable damage to the u s economy and global financial markets yellen said the last debt limit suspension passed in 2019 lapsed on july 31 republican lawmakers have threatened to vote against raising the debt ceiling arguing that it will only promote more government spending senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky has instead urged democrats to pass an increase through their proposed 3 5 trillion budget reconciliation package because it cannot be filibustered by republicans the move is mcconnell s attempt at making it easier to saddle his opponents politically with greater debt but the reconciliation process may not be finished before the treasury breaches the debt limit which could force some republicans to vote for an increase axios hans nichols reports yellen opposes a debt ceiling increase through a budget reconciliation package saying it should instead be passed through regular order with broad bipartisan support what they re saying we have learned from past debt limit impasses that waiting until the last minute to suspend or increase the debt limit can cause serious harm to business and consumer confidence raise short term borrowing costs for taxpayers and negatively impact the credit rating of the united states yellen said in the letter at a time when american families communities and businesses are still suffering from the effects of the ongoing global pandemic it would be particularly irresponsible to put the full faith and credit of the united states at risk yellen said there is considerable uncertainty surrounding exactly when the treasury will run out of funding in part because of the coronavirus pandemic and spending associated with covid relief programs house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said in a press conference on wednesday that democrats will not include a debt ceiling increase in the reconciliation package the big picture since the debt limit was reinstated on aug 1 the treasury has been forced to resort to extraordinary measures to service debt such as by suspending investments in certain federal retirement and health funds the debt ceiling does not determine how much the government spends but only how much the government can borrow to pay for spending approved by congress republicans and democrats worked together to raise the borrowing limit three times throughout the trump administration and several times in other previous administrations source axios story date september 9 2021

the most recent international atomic energy agency iaea report on iran s nuclear program paints a bleak picture of the agency s current ability to monitor tehran s nuclear activities and the new iranian government s willingness to cooperate with the agency newly inaugurated iranian president ebrahim raisi may think intransigence and ambiguity over the status of iran s nuclear program will build leverage in negotiations to bring tehran and washington back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal which would reimpose on iran the most stringent monitoring regime ever negotiated but his administration s failure to get off on the right foot with the agency is not only jeopardizing tehran s relationship with the iaea but also the prospects for restoring the accord iaea director general rafael grossi warned in the sept 7 report that iran s failure to fully cooperate and communicate with the iaea is seriously compromising the iaea s ability to maintain continuity of knowledge about iran s nuclear activities which is necessary if the agency is to resume the monitoring and verification activities required by the 2015 nuclear deal the agency s confidence that it can maintain that knowledge continuity has now significantly further declined and will continue to do so unless the situation is immediately rectified by iran the report says specifically the report notes that the iaea has been unable to ascertain since june if iran is still abiding by the special arrangement intended to mitigate the effects of iran s february 2021 decision to suspend implementation of the additional protocol to its safeguard s agreement and other jcpoa specific monitoring measures under a special arrangement reached prior to iran s suspension of those monitoring measures the iaea and iran agreed that tehran would allow certain surveillance to continue but the agency would not receive any data from the machines until iran received sanctions relief in accordance with the restoration of the jcpoa that arrangement was extended may 24 for one month and at that time agency inspectors were allowed to service the machines and swap in new data storage however since the monthlong extension expired june 24 iran has failed to officially convey to the agency if the special arrangement is still ongoing and failed to respond to requests from the iaea to allow inspectors to service the equipment access to the machines is particularly critical now as the sept 7 iaea report noted that the surveillance equipment cannot be left for more than three months without being serviced and that aug 24 marked three months since inspectors last accessed the machines and replaced the data storage iran s failure to respond to iaea requests to service the equipment is seriously compromising the agency s technical capability to maintain continuity of knowledge about iran s nuclear program according to the report information in the report also points to a serious gap in current surveillance architecture iran removed four iaea surveillance cameras from a centrifuge component manufacturing workshop in late june after a reported attack at that facility the iaea has not been able to install new replacement equipment according to the sept 7 report furthermore when the iaea was finally granted access to the removed cameras on sept 4 inspectors noted that the data storage was not among the debris from one of the cameras which iran said was destroyed in the incident the iaea requested in an aug 6 letter that iran locate the data storage and recording components inspectors were also not able to determine if data from the other three cameras is recoverable according to the report this current gap in monitoring and uncertainty over the status of past collected data could seriously inhibit the iaea s ability to reconstitute iran s activities at that facility in addition to the verification challenges this situation poses the surveillance gap is also likely to increase speculation that tehran diverted centrifuge components or has something to hide the iaea report also notes unsurprisingly that iran is continuing nuclear activities in violation of limits imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal known formally as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa see below for more details while tehran has not installed any new advanced centrifuge cascades at the main fuel enrichment plants at natanz nor fordow over the reporting period iran has continued to stockpile uranium enriched to higher levels tehran s stockpile of uranium enriched to 20 percent grew from 63 kilograms noted in the may report to 84 kilograms in the sept 7 report the stockpile of 60 percent enriched uranium also grew from 2 4 kilograms in may to 10 kilograms in september while iran also accelerated its production of uranium enriched from between 2 to 5 percent the total stockpile of uranium enriched to that level remained at the same amount as was noted in the prior report about 1 774 kilograms that stockpile size remained static since the prior report in may because tehran is using the 2 5 percent enriched uranium as feed for producing uranium enriched to higher levels iran s decision to use its stockpile of less than 2 percent enriched uranium as feed for higher enrichment levels as opposed to solely using natural uranium contributed to the acceleration of 2 5 percent enriched uranium production over the past quarter given that the number of centrifuges available to enrich uranium appears unchanged from the prior report and that iran still has not accumulated enough 20 percent or 60 percent enriched uranium which when enriched to weapons grade or greater than 90 percent is enough for a bomb iran s breakout the time to produce enough weapons grade uranium gas for one bomb of about 2 months remains relatively unchanged from the prior quarterly report however iran continues to gain knowledge about advanced centrifuge performance and higher level enrichment that cannot be fully reversed the sept 7 report notes for instance that iran reconfigured its 60 percent production lines at natanz and appears to be enriching to that level more efficiently and consistently which is unsurprising given it has had more time to work out that process furthermore as the iaea noted in an earlier report in august iran is continuing its research on uranium metal and produced a small quantity of uranium metal enriched to 20 percent in a research lab new to the sept 7 report is the iaea s observation that iran has nearly completed installation of the equipment for the first stage of its process for producing uranium metal at the fuel plate fabrication plant at esfahan while iran claims that the uranium metal is necessary to fuel its tehran research reactor trr which produces medical isotopes the iaea noted in the sept 7 report that the initial 20 percent enriched uranium metal produced is not suitable for that purpose the knowledge however is applicable to weapons development unfortunately the biden administration has not waived sanctions reimposed by former president donald trump targeting the transfer of uranium to iran including fuel for the trr the nuclear deal requires the p5 1 china france russia germany the united states and the united kingdom to ensure iran can import fuel for that reactor while iran would likely have pursued uranium metal anyways as part of its strategy to press the united states into returning to the jcpoa granting waivers would have removed tehran s justification that the uranium metal fuel for the trr is necessary for its functioning in sum the sept 7 iaea report paints a bleak picture while iran has not accelerated certain violations such as the further installation of advanced centrifuges the current monitoring situation is of serious concern and uranium stockpiles of 20 and 60 percent material continue to grow while iran s violations can mostly be reversed quite quickly centrifuge machines can be disassembled and uranium stocks shipped out or blended down to return iran to compliance with the limits put in place by the nuclear deal the knowledge iran is continuing to gain from activities such as advanced centrifuge operation enrichment to 60 percent and uranium metal production cannot be undone this knowledge combined with the risk that the iaea will not be able to recreate a record of iran s nuclear activities threatens the prospect of restoring the 2015 nuclear deal the biden administration has made very clear that talks to return to compliance will only continue so long as the united states assesses that the nonproliferation benefits of the accord can be reestablished just two days after the sept 7 report u s secretary of states antony blinken said we are getting closer to the point at which a strict return to compliance with the jcpoa does not reproduce the benefits that that agreement achieved while blinken did not put a date on when the window for talks to restore the nuclear deal would close the timeframe will undoubtedly continue to decrease if iran does not change course raisi may believe that he is building leverage but if tehran s nuclear program remains on its current trajectory he risks overplaying iran s hand raisi s administration must return to talks in vienna without delay and build off the progress made between the biden and rouhani administrations during the first six rounds of talks it also behooves iran to fully cooperate with the iaea by addressing the status of the special monitoring arrangement and allowing inspectors to service surveillance equipment failure to do so risks prospects to restore the deal and could ignite a new nuclear crisis key details from the september report the iaea s sept 7 quarterly report on iran s nuclear activities like its may 31 report contains significantly less detail than prior reports due to tehran s suspension of more intrusive monitoring measures required by the nuclear deal in february 2021 as a result inspectors no longer have the same access to sites and facilities in iran complicating the iaea s reporting the iaea notes in the sept 7 that if the gaps in its monitoring persist for too long and it cannot maintain continuity of knowledge about iran s nuclear activities it could inhibit the agency s ability to resume verification of iran s jcpoa s commitments in the future the iaea does not determine iran s compliance with the jcpoa but the agency s most recent report indicates that iran continues to violate the following restrictions on its nuclear activities that were agreed to in the jcpoa breached the limit on enriching uranium to no more than 3 67 percent uranium 235 for 15 years the iaea first verified that iran exceeded the 3 67 percent uranium 235 enrichment limit and began enriching uranium to 4 5 percent in june 2019 according to the sept 7 report iran continues to enrich and stockpile uranium up to 5 20 and 60 percent uranium 235 breached the stockpile limit of 300 kilograms of uranium hexafluoride gas uf6 enriched to 3 67 percent about 202 kilograms of uranium by weight for 15 years in may 2019 iran stated it would no longer be bound by the jcpoa s 300 kilogram stockpile cap and the iaea verified that iran breached that limit in july 2019 according to the iaea s sept 7 report iran s total enriched uranium stockpile equates to 2 441 3 kilograms of uranium by weight representing a 799 7 kilogram decrease from the last reporting period the decrease is due to iran having used a significant portion of its uranium enriched to less than 2 percent which would not be useful if iran were to decide to pursue a nuclear weapon to produce uranium enriched to 2 5 percent of the 2 441 3 kilograms 2 372 9 are gas form 34 5 kilograms are in the form of uranium oxides 21 1 kilograms are in fuel assemblies and rods and 12 8 kilograms are in liquid and solid scrap iran s enriched uranium stockpile in the form of uf6 measured by uranium weight is comprised of 503 8 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 2 percent 1 774 8 kilograms of uranium enriched from 2 5 percent 84 3 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 20 percent and 10 kilograms of uranium enriched up to 60 percent iran s stockpiles of 5 percent enriched uranium remained the same as it was used as feed to produce uranium enriched to higher levels iran s stockpiles of 20 and 60 percent enriched uranium grew by 21 and 7 5 kilograms respectively from the last reporting period breached the prohibition on any uranium activities including enrichment at fordow for 15 years iran began enriching uranium to 4 5 percent uranium 235 at fordow in november 2019 since then the iaea has verified that iran continues to enrich and stockpile uranium at the fordow facility using 1 044 ir 1 centrifuges in january 2021 the iaea observed the reconfiguration of the centrifuges into three sets of two interconnected cascades which were fed with 5 percent uranium 235 and used to produce 20 percent enriched uranium the agency s sept 7 report verifies iran continues to use the same configuration at fordow but notes iran s plan to use two cascades of ir 6 centrifuges to enrich natural uranium up to 5 percent to be fed into the three sets of two interconnected ir 1 cascades to produce 20 percent enriched uranium the use of interconnected cascades is prohibited by the jcpoa breached restrictions on the number of advanced centrifuges installed and the 10 year prohibition on accumulating enriched uranium from advanced machines last year iran informed the agency of its intent to install a total of 19 cascades at natanz comprised of six using ir 1 centrifuges six using ir 2m centrifuges six using ir 4 centrifuges and one using ir 6 centrifuges in addition to the 30 cascades of 5 060 ir 1 centrifuges already installed at natanz and permitted by the jcpoa the iaea s sept 7 report notes that iran continues to test operate and accumulate enriched uranium from advanced model centrifuges at the natanz enrichment facility however the agency did not report the installation of any new advanced centrifuges in the planned cascades at the main fuel enrichment facility over the last quarterly period specifically the iaea found that at the natanz fuel enrichment plant as of aug 25 iran is enriching up to 5 percent uranium 235 using 30 cascades of ir 1 centrifuges these 30 cascades were permitted to enrich to 3 67 percent under the deal six cascades of ir 2m centrifuges and two cascades of ir 4 centrifuges the agency also observed that the installation of the remaining four ir 4 cascades the six ir 1 cascades and the single cascade of ir 6 centrifuges had yet to begin as was reported in the previous quarterly report released may 31 at the natanz pilot fuel enrichment plant as of aug 28 the iaea verified that iran fed 5 percent enriched uranium into two cascades comprised of 153 ir 4 centrifuges and 164 ir 6 centrifuges respectively to produce uranium enriched up to 60 percent as of aug 28 the agency also verified that iran continues to accumulate uranium enriched up to 2 percent from cascades of nine ir 4 centrifuges five ir 5 centrifuges four ir 6 centrifuges 10 ir 6 centrifuges 19 ir 6 centrifuges three ir 6s centrifuges and 10 ir s centrifuges relatively similar to the prior report as of aug 28 iran fed natural uranium into cascades of 18 ir 1 centrifuges and 32 ir 2m centrifuges to produce 2 percent enriched uranium breached the prohibition on uranium metal production for 10 years iran informed the iaea of its intention to produce uranium metal in december 2020 on may 18 the agency verified that iran produced 2 42 kilograms of natural uranium metal from 3 1 kilograms of natural uranium from that iran used 0 85 kilograms to produce 0 54 kilograms of uranium in the form of uranium silicide the agency s sept 7 report confirms that iran s work on the main production line at the esfahan fuel fabrication plant is ongoing and that as of aug 29 the installation of equipment for the first stage of the three stage process the production of uranium tetrafluoride uf4 from uranium hexafluoride uf6 gas was almost complete iran previously informed agency inspectors that uranium metal would be produced at the second stage of the process iran is continuing its uranium metal production research and development activities according to the iaea the agency verified aug 14 that iran used 257 grams of uf4 enriched up to 20 percent uranium 235 to produce 200 grams of uranium metal enriched to the same level suspended monitoring and verification provisions required by the nuclear deal iran suspended implementation of the additional protocol to its safeguards agreement feb 23 2021 while iran and the iaea reached a joint arrangement feb 21 that allowed the agency to remotely continue its necessary additional safeguards activities in iran for three months that agreement expired june 24 after it was extended for one month may 24 the monitoring equipment left in iran under the temporary arrangement was due for service aug 24 but iran has not allowed inspectors to access the equipment according to the sept 7 report the iaea wrote a letter to tehran july 9 requesting confirmation on the status of the four surveillance cameras that were installed at a centrifuge component manufacturing workshop at iran s tesa karaj complex tehran granted the agency access on sept 4 inspectors found that of the four cameras two remained intact while one had been severely damaged and the other destroyed the agency noted that the data storage and the recording unit from the destroyed camera were not present in the remnants provided to inspectors the iaea was able to recover the data storage components from the two intact cameras and the damaged camera but has been yet unable to read and interpret the data according to the sept 7 report until the agency is able to access the storage media from the other three cameras which have been placed under agency seal it will not be in a position to determine whether the data from the storage media is recoverable

plc joint venture agreement jorc table 1 section 1 sampling techniques and data criteria commentary sampling techniques core samples are obtained from core drilling in proterozoic basement lithologies pq hq and nq diameter core was drilled on a 6m run core was cut using an automated core cutter and half core sampled at 1m intervals with breaks for major geological changes sampling intervals range from 0 2 1 0m cover sequences were not sampled drilling techniques permian paterson formation cover sequence was drilled using mud rotary drilling depths of cover typically observed to approximately 420m vertically below surface steel casing was emplaced to secure the pre collar core drilling was advanced from the base of the cover sequence with pq3 hq3 and nq2 diameter coring configuration core from inclined drill holes are oriented on 3m and 6m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100 with isolated zones of lower recovery cover sequence drilling by the mud rotary drilling did not yield recoverable samples logging geological logging recorded qualitative descriptions of lithology alteration mineralisation veining and structure for all core drilled 10 375m for 18 drill holes all intersecting mineralisation including orientation of key geological features geotechnical measurements were recorded including rock quality designation rqd fracture frequency solid core recovery and qualitative rock strength measurements magnetic susceptibility measurements were recorded every metre the bulk density of selected drill core intervals was determined at site on whole core samples all geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the havieron site digital data logging was captured on diamond drill core intervals only and all data validated and stored in an acquire database all drill cores were photographed prior to cutting and or sampling the core the logging is of sufficient quality to support mineral resource estimates sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled core was cut and sampled at the havieron core processing facility half core samples of between 0 2 and 2 0 m were collected in pre numbered calico bags and grouped in plastic bags for dispatch to the laboratory sample weights typically varied from 0 5 to 8kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation drill core samples were freighted by air and road to the laboratory sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso17025 accredited intertek laboratory perth intertek samples were dried at 105oc and crushed to 95 passing 4 75mm and the split to obtain up to 3kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm5 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 95 passing 106µm routine grind size analysis is conducted duplicate samples were collected from crush and pulp samples at a rate of 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at intertek all samples were assayed for 48 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method 4a ms907 which is considered to provide a total assay for copper gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with aas finish method fa50n aa which is considered to provide a total assay for gold sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in the acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data extended quality control programs including pulp samples submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs have been completed analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled calico bags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the acquire database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by re logging of diamond drill core intervals and assessment of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person qualified person no adjustments are made to assay data and no twinned holes have been completed there are no currently known drilling sampling recovery or other factors that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data location of data points drill collar locations were surveyed using a differential gps with gnss with a stated accuracy of 0 5m for all drill holes reported drill rig alignment was attained using an electronic azimuth aligner downhole survey was collected at 6 12m intervals in the cover sequence and every 6 to 30m in diamond drill core segments of the drill hole using single shot axis mining champ gyro the single shot surveys have been validated using continuous survey to surface axis mining champ along with a selection of drill holes re surveyed by an external survey contactor using a devigyro tool confirming sufficient accuracy for downhole spatial recording a lidar survey was completed over the project area in nov 2019 which was used to prepare a dem topographic model for the project with a spatial accuracy of 0 1m vertical and 0 3m horizontal the topography is generally low relief to flat elevation within the dune corridors in ranges between 250 265m australian height

recorded with the dispatch of samples to analytical services any discrepancies logged at the receipt of samples into the analytical services are validated audits or reviews internal reviews of core handling sample preparation and assays laboratories were conducted on a regular basis by both project personnel and owner representatives in the competent person s opinion the sample preparation security and analytical procedures are consistent with current industry standards and are entirely appropriate and acceptable for the styles of mineralisation identified and will be appropriate for use in the reporting of exploration results and mineral resource estimates there are no identified drilling sampling or recovery factors that materially impact the adequacy and reliability of the

less cars can be loaded onboard a typical pctc whenever there is a high volume of bev bookings because the average density per car unit has increased eating into deadweight capacity essentially pctcs with low deck strengths will be disadvantaged as bevs start to dominate over time diminishing the earning opportunity of the asset while modern pctcs and lctcs equipped with stronger decks from 0 3t m2 upwards will hold more value due to the higher earnings opportunity derived from the better stowage factor vessels trading to used car markets such as africa are less exposed to this headwind however this is already an issue for ships operating on major east west liner routes delivering finished new cars to european and north american markets with long term ramifications for fleet development logically demand for stronger decked ships will increase cargo miles will also receive a credit in the short to midterm as more capacity is required to carry the same volume of seaborne cars around the world this is assuming global demand remains relatively static whilst bevs continue to take share in sales and exports toyota has been forced to cut global production by 40 for september because of the chip dip crisis leading to a slump in their share price which spread to nissan and honda u s retail sales figures also turned negative in july weighing on sentiment it s possible we will see some softening in cargo mile demand in q4 however the fundamental imbalance driven by low supply versus recovered demand is unlikely to change in the midterm figure 2 supply chains will continue to be choked by the stop start nature of the pandemic restricted by slow terminal operations and ongoing vessel delays at congested ports as the new normal reducing liner frequency and therefore the overall supplied capacity available for ocean exporters china s strict policy on covid by shutdown as seen at yantian and ningbo ports this year taught us that consumer goods remain highly sensitive to operational stops until the world is vaccinated further disruption is to be expected looking a little further into 2022 the supply demand imbalance could widen if the microchip shortage eases while covid lingers enabling more bevs to be finished and exported across seas which is plausible noting hyundai coming out last month declaring the worst is behind us a firming of pent up cargo demand from auto dealerships looking to replenish depleted stocks unfulfilled on top of their usual monthly seaborne import orders would create a compounding effect of growth

springdale ark sept 08 2021 globe newswire tyson foods nyse tsn categorically rejects the conclusions drawn earlier today by the secretary of agriculture and the director of the national economic council in a white house press briefing the u s department of agriculture recently published a report detailing the drivers of consumer inflation in the food sector none of which are related to industry consolidation or scale the report can be found by clicking here increase in beef prices due to unprecedented market conditions as we have explained in great detail to the u s senate committee on the judiciary in testimony provided in august 2021 which can be accessed by clicking here the increase in the price of beef in particular is due to unprecedented market conditions multiple unprecedented market shocks including a global pandemic and severe weather conditions led to an unexpected and drastic drop in meat processors abilities to operate at full capacity this led to an oversupply of live cattle and an undersupply of beef while demand for beef products was at an all time high so as a result the price for cattle fell while the price for beef rose today prices paid to cattle producers are rising labor shortages the inability of the industry to adequately staff its plants has exacerbated the situation labor shortages are also affecting the nation s pork and poultry supply tyson foods today pays its frontline workers an average of 22 per hour including full medical benefits we recently announced additional paid sick leave and vacation benefits starting in 2022 the company is also piloting childcare programs and providing access to vaccinations for all of its u s workers inaccurate claims of consolidation impact it is inaccurate to suggest that consolidation in the meat processing industry is leading to higher prices for consumers in fact evidence of healthy competition can also be found by looking at historical outcomes for example we have seen a rise in availability and quality of beef while the price has become more affordable over the past quarter century data shows that while the concentration of the industry has remained relatively constant for close to 30 years quality has significantly improved furthermore as the u s department of agriculture table below clearly illustrates the historical ratios of margins of cow and calf producers and feeders versus processors including tyson show that cow and calf and feeder margins outpace processor margins in almost every year except the most recent table usda data historical ratios of margins of cow and calf producers and feeders versus processors including tyson scale allows for efficiency leading to lower prices for american families tyson s scale allows it to operate efficiently which keeps costs down for consumers at tyson we rely on independent farmers and want them to succeed because without a steady pipeline of livestock we can t run our business in rural communities across america every year we invest more than 15 billion with 11 000 independent farms supplying us with cattle hogs and chickens tyson foods is committed to working with the administration the u s congress and others to find ways to better feed this growing country and keep consumer prices affordable we welcome a deeper discussion on all of the issues raised today about tyson foods inc tyson foods inc nyse tsn is one of the world s largest food companies and a recognized leader in protein founded in 1935 by john w tyson and grown under three generations of family leadership the company has a broad portfolio of products and brands like tyson jimmy dean hillshire farm ball park wright aidells ibp and state fair tyson foods innovates continually to make protein more sustainable tailor food for everywhere it s available and raise the world s expectations for how much good food can do headquartered in springdale arkansas the company has 139 000 team members through its core values tyson foods strives to operate with integrity create value for its shareholders customers communities and team members and serve as a steward of the animals land and environment entrusted to it visit tysonfoods com to learn more media contact gary mickelson gary mickelson tyson com 479 236 9022 category ir

connie mcelrone and cynthia hirsch carried dozens of colorful fabric bolts from a pile on hirsch s front porch out to a small silver suv wednesday afternoon on madison s near west side oh i hope two cars will do it mcelrone said to another neighbor the women along with a network of people from the local sewing community and beyond raised 8 000 in less than a week and amassed a mountain of fabric to donate to afghan refugees staying at fort mccoy in western wisconsin mcelrone said mcelrone got the idea while having dinner with a friend sue savage who has been volunteering at fort mccoy the two worried about the culture shock the afghans would experience when coming to the u s after fleeing from afghanistan as their country fell to the taliban mcelrone said although fort mccoy has received piles of new and lightly used clothes from the community mcelrone noted that those donations would not be traditional clothing right off the bat we had a sense that fabric to sew tunics would be welcomed mcelrone said hirsch said they wanted to give the afghan women at fort mccoy the comfort of being able to make what they need and what they want in their own fashion rather than forcing them to wear western clothes savage was helping load up the suv and her small white sedan with fabric sewing machines and other materials she said she planned to drive the donations to fort mccoy wednesday night mcelrone would follow with the suv the following day chris hennemeyer who is leading the united states conference of catholic bishops volunteer efforts at fort mccoy said his group has been working with savage to get the sewing supplies up to the base we absolutely welcome it he said of the reams of fabric a lot of people boarded flights to the states with just one little bag the catholic charity has been running some of the social centers for women and children at fort mccoy volunteers set up a few sewing machines in one of the centers and they were an immediate hit hennemeyer said afghan women started making blouses and other clothes with one woman even making a child s outfit from one of her blankets hennemeyer said we just had a little supply of fabric he said and they went through that in no time mcelrone said the fact that the women jumped at the chance to begin sewing is part of what inspired her and savage to start the fabric drive the madison women emailed sewers they knew friends and local sewing groups who reached out their friends and so on creating a network of people who wanted to help the madison area sewing guild and the sewing machine project were among the groups that spread the word we just are so inspired and excited by this amazing response that we ve had mcelrone said someone started a venmo account to fundraise for the effort and another reached out to joann fabric which offered a discount for bolts of fabric mcelrone said they spent about 5 000 at joann fabric on the east side west side and in janesville buying out the stores stocks of cotton polyester blend fabric the result was nearly 40 bolts of fabric piled on hirsch s front porch and cardboard boxes and bags filled to the brim with even more pieces of folded fabric donated from local sewers boxes were also filled with thread scissors needles buttons snaps and elastics margaret jankowski founder and director of the sewing machine project was able to find nine sewing machines to donate to the effort savage planned to take three machines up with her wednesday and mcelrone would take another three thursday fort mccoy only had three sewing machines wednesday hennemeyer said he said they ll continue to put more in the social centers as they receive them for those who are interested in donating to help the refugees hennemeyer said a cash donation is most helpful because it gives them the flexibility to adjust to changing circumstances one day they might need toys the next they might need diapers monetary donations can be made online at go madison com catholic charities and go madison com irc team rubicon a nonprofit that responds to disasters is leading the effort to collect clothes and other items for the refugees the most updated list of needed items can be found at go madison com rubicon donations new clothing or gently used clothes that have been freshly laundered can be dropped off at the sparta armory at 602 e division st sparta from 9 a m to 4 p m daily items can also be donated to local goodwills which will coordinate to get needed donations to team rubicon or the red cross hirsch said she and mcelrone are going to wait to see what s needed before accepting more donations of fabric but hirsh said they now have a network of people to call on when the need arises we want to help wisconsin welcome the women from afghanistan hirsch said we know they ve had a very long journey and it s remarkable and satisfying what friends and neighbors can do photos afghan refugees at wisconsin s fort mccoy receive clothing

san francisco ap technology companies that led the charge into remote work as the pandemic unfurled are confronting a new challenge how when and even whether they should bring long isolated employees back to offices that have been designed for teamwork i thought this period of remote work would be the most challenging year and half of my career but it s not said brent hyder the chief people officer for business software maker salesforce and its roughly 65 000 employees worldwide getting everything started back up the way it needs to be is proving to be even more difficult that transition has been complicated by the rapid spread of the delta variant which has scrambled the plans many tech companies had for bringing back most of their workers near or after labor day weekend microsoft has pushed those dates back to october while apple google facebook amazon and a growing list of others have already decided wait until next year given how they set the tone for remote work tech companies return to office policies will likely have ripple effects across other industries employers next steps could redefine how and where people work predicts laura boudreau a columbia university assistant economics professor who studies workplace issues we have moved beyond the theme of remote work being a temporary thing boudreau says the longer the pandemic has stretched on she says the harder it s become to tell employees to come back to the office particularly full time because they typically revolve around digital and online products most tech jobs are tailor made for remote work yet most major tech companies insist that their employees should be ready to work in the office two or three days each week after the pandemic is over the main reason tech companies have long believed that employees clustered together in a physical space will swap ideas and spawn innovations that probably wouldn t have happened in isolation that s one reason tech titans have poured billions of dollars into corporate campuses interspersed with alluring common areas meant to lure employees out of their cubicles and into casual collisions that turn into brainstorming sessions but the concept of water cooler innovation may be overblown says christy lake chief people officer for business software maker twilio there is no data that supports that really happens in real life and yet we all subscribe to it lake says you can t put the genie back in the bottle and tell people oh you have to be back in the office or innovation won t happen twilio isn t bringing back most of its roughly 6 300 employees back to its offices until early next year at the earliest and plans to allow most of them to figure how frequently they should come in this hybrid approach permitting employees to toggle between remote and in office work has been widely embraced in the technology industry particularly among the largest companies with the biggest payrolls nearly two thirds of the more than 200 companies responding to a mid july survey in the tech centric bay area said they are expecting their workers to come into the office two or three days each week before the pandemic 70 of these employers required their workers to be in the office according to the bay area council a business policy group that commissioned the poll even zoom the silicon valley videoconferencing service that saw its revenue and stock price soar during the pandemic says most of its employees still prefer to come into the office part of the time there isn t a one size fits all approach to returning to the office kelly steckelberg zoom s chief financial officer recently wrote in a blog post but the biggest tech companies which have profited even more than zoom as the pandemic that made their products indispensable for many workers aren t giving employees much choice in the matter apple google amazon and microsoft have made it clear that they want most of their workers together at least a few days each week to maintain their culture and pace of innovation that well worn creed sounds like backward thinking to ed zitron who runs a public relations firm representing technology companies and which has been fully remote since it launched in 2012 the only reason to have an office he says is to satisfy managers with vested interests in grouping people together so that they can look at them and feel good about the people that they own so that they can enjoy that power switching to hybrid work is ideal for people like kelly soderlund a mother of two young children who works in offices in san francisco and palo alto california for travel management company tripactions which has about 1 200 employees worldwide she couldn t wait to return when the company partially reopened its offices in june partly because she missed the built in buffer that her roughly one hour commute provided between her personal and professional life when i don t have that i wake up in the morning i start doing work and i take my kids to their camp or their daycare soderlund says and then i come back and i work and then we pick them up make dinner and then i go back to work so it feels like it s just work all the time soderlund believes being together in an office leads to more collaboration although she also learned from the pandemic that workers don t need to be there every day for teamwork to happen camaraderie and the need to separate work from home are among the top reasons employees at business software maker adobe cite for coming back to the office said gloria chen chief people officer for one of silicon valley s older companies working from home is here to stay but we also continue to value people coming together she said the transition from the pandemic should enable smaller tech companies to adopt more flexible work from home policies that may help them lure away top notch engineers from other firms more insistent on having people in the office says boudreau the columbia university scholar labor markets are relatively tight now so employees have more bargaining chips than they have had in a while boudreau says ankur dahiya who launched his software startup runx last year during the pandemic lockdowns believes that remote work has helped him hire employees that otherwise may not have been candidates the eight worker startup rents a san francisco office one day a week so dahiya can meet with employees who live nearby but other employees are in canada nevada and oregon the workers living outside of california have been flying in once every three months for

cedar rapids speaking to iowa s growing need for affordable housing to help meet workforce demands gov kim reynolds announced wednesday a 100 million infusion to increase the state s housing stock and

the 230 million over five years the iowa legislature already passed earlier this year to help overcome the state s housing shortage that legislation alone reynolds said during the housingiowa conference in cedar rapids made the state a leader for passing one of the most ambitious plans for housing growth anywhere in the country if this was all that we had done to jump start construction

including 10 586 for iowans earning 38 450 a year or less we re doing everything we can to expedite that and not only retain but recruit more people to this great state reynolds said and these families many of whom will be attracted to our state by our economic growth our low cost of living and safe neighborhoods they need to be able to live in the communities where they work iowa might be

when looking to purchase a new heating or air conditioning system there can be some tempting bids or prices offered by contractors the difference in price between one contractor and another may raise a red flag when prices are so far apart it doesn t feel right usually the red flag is a warning that needs to be heeded many licensed insured and legit contractors will have higher prices than a company that is working under the table without the requirements of local laws on the cheap ever hear the saying you get what you pay for well when looking to have a contractor work on a home this is a good time to reflect upon that saying it may be tempting to hire the lowest bidding company to install or repair your air conditioner or heating unit but there is usually a reason why the price is so tempting hiring a questionable company can lead to many problems some of the issues may not arise until long after the questionable contractor is gone and not to be found lousy work and more often a company that is not following local laws and guidelines does not take the company or the work completed seriously enough these air conditioning contractors often will lowball the competition to get the work with no intention of completing professional level work low quality inferior workmanship and equipment that is below the desired quality may be installed and not installed properly a piece of equipment that is inferior or installed not properly can lead to higher heating and cooling costs equipment installed with shoddy work or equipment most certainly can lead to an unreliable hvac experience the air might not be cool enough from the air conditioner or the heat may not spread appropriately throughout the home sometimes these unskilled technicians will diagnose a system s issues and not tell the whole truth costing more money to fix or install when hiring a cheap contractor can feel like a way to save lots of money however contractors working on the cheap may save you upfront costs but in the long run they may end up costing much more money and causing quite a few headaches along the way saving money in the beginning can lead to technicians not working following the law and environmental necessities many times not completing work up to local codes to industry level service and installation standards this type of approach from a contractor certainly can cause issues in the future on a heating or cooling system the government is having difficulty tracking and finding hvac technicians who are not following laws the number of unreliable contractors increases before ever hiring an hvac contractor be certain to ask for insurance credentials before signing any installation or repair work contract while scouting contractors be sure to get as many bids as you can make time for the more bids that are gathered can help in the decision making process on who to hire the highest bid is not necessarily the best choice but if there is a super low bid it is likely the contractor does not carry insurance and most likely will fail on other predetermining factors to get the job references and word of mouth a reference can go a long way particularly when hiring workers to complete work within the home ask friends family and colleagues if they know of an hvac contractor they trust even if a friend has not used a company a friend of a friend may have had a great experience with a company references don t come cheap if somebody is referencing a company to do work odds are they have a great experience and a high level of trust in the company people who give references want others to experience the great level of service they received and at the same time help out a contractor they trust choose wisely when you hire a licensed hvac contractor like air conditioners usa the company is taking itself seriously enough that the company wants to protect its future in the industry and stand by its work once completed it says a lot to a customer when a company takes care of insurance needs and other laws to ensure a completely smooth project when a company takes these proper steps it shows they care about the customer s welfare and the professionalism offered although a license does not quantify success with a contractor is a strong sign of good intent unlicensed contractors will mean lower bids but with all the possible financial and legal issues that may arise it may cost more into the future than hiring a true expert in the first place if an issue arises after installation or repair hiring a licensed contractor will give more outlets for legal remedies the vast majority of contractors are diligent and handle work with professionalism and grace these contractors are honest well trained and hard workers completing great work when running a business in accordance with the local laws and regulations a company is more responsible and professional bad contractors getting called out shady and illegitimate contractors are on the rise the good news is many of these companies are being reported and this trend is also on the rise the low bids from non legal companies strain the hvac sector because the homeowners get caught in the middle of the situation the money saved by hiring a contractor without a license can truly be a high risk hire when a company scams a person the cost can be felt throughout the industry and beyond but the legit contractors pay the highest cost bad contractors can be reported online in a number of different ways depending on your local area at what cost protect yourself your family and your investment by hiring a licensed and insured contractor for your next project to stay away from shady scammers only hire companies that follow best business practices odds are they will also do a better job with your installation or repair a business is run from the top down and if the company is legit this trickles down through the employees legit business owners will be paying taxes have needed insurances run background checks on employees have set up a bonded practice and have taken other legit steps to ensure the client is protected as well as the business

mediations and arbitration hearings on aug 2 alpine which is based in salt lake city sued finra last november over the zoom requirement arguing that it violated the firm s rights the civil lawsuit garnered attention from smaller brokerages and aggrieved customers who worried that not presenting their cases in person put them at a disadvantage during hearings in 2020 for a high profile case involving a wealthy florida grandmother and two j p morgan brokers who are her grandsons one arbitrator dozed off alpine s legal defeat comes as finra ramps up its scrutiny of high risk firms and recidivist brokers who skip from job to job while cheating vulnerable investors alpine argued in its lawsuit that zoom didn t help things because the video frame displaying the witness is reduced to a thumb nail making it difficult if not impossible to view the witness s reaction and demeanor zoom also involves the burdensome elements of multiple data uploads and downloads before and during the testimony as well as screen switching the lawsuit said as such finra was unfairly and unconstitutionally denying alpine a fair procedure for the disciplining of members finra s rules the lawsuit added expressly state that members are entitled to be heard in person the wall street watchdog for its part sees zoom video conferencing as likely to outlast the pandemic from a finra perspective we put our cards on the table that we think that zoom is here to stay because we put all of our zoom information on our regular website not on the covid 19 part of our website but to the regular website richard berry the executive vice president of finra s dispute resolution services told an agency podcast on may 18 5 000 a month account fees alpine s woes began in august 2019 when finra started a disciplinary proceeding against the brokerage over excessive fees it had recently begun charging customers the watchdog alleged two months earlier that in the face of significant and mounting financial difficulties alpine began charging its customers exorbitant and arbitrary fees including a monthly 5 000 simply for having an account and another monthly 5 000 for certificate withdrawals the sky high fees which alpine began hitting customers with in 2018 caused some clients accounts to have negative balances that in turn prompted alpine to seize customers investments to pay the fees in one month alpine shifted 950 000 of clients securities to the firm s proprietary account which it used to cover the negative balance accounts alpine also misappropriated every client position worth 1 500 or less saying that they were worthless securities that had been abandoned finra alleged the brokerage which specializes in penny stocks also sold hundreds of customers positions to itself for a penny per share in all alpine allegedly siphoned over 2 8 million of client money out of the firm the brokerage argued in its lawsuit that the fees were intended to help to pare down alpine s customer base which consisted largely of inactive accounts holding illiquid securities that imposed massive carrying costs on alpine and severely restricted its ability to conduct transactions for its active customers in july 2019 finra slapped alpine with a temporary cease and desist order and commanded it to return the fees to customers alpine has 46 disclosures on finra s brokercheck of which 44 are regulatory in nature zoom carnival alpine executives and finra regulators first sat down for a face to face meeting on feb 18 2020 in salt lake city the covid 19 pandemic was just beginning to unfold days later the hearing was postponed due to an urgent personal matter affecting alpine s counsel court papers show finra and alpine agreed to resume in person proceedings in late april 2020 but the pandemic made that impossible at some point alpine said the two parties agreed again to resume in person meetings last november but on nov 2 finra s chief hearing officer maureen delaney ordered that everything be done by zoom video conferencing alpine argued in its lawsuit that it was unclear how speeding along through a virtual hearing that will potentially close a broker dealer currently providing services to investors across the country in the middle of undisputedly volatile and unstable securities market sic furthers finra s statutory obligations to protect investors and maintain fair and orderly markets alpine reported in unaudited financial statements dated may 31 that it has just over 31 million in assets as of sept 30 2020 it reported over 12 million in an audited statement alpine argued that finra was also violating the brokerage s constitutional right to due process in the fifth and fourteenth amendments the fifth amendment says that in general no person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury the fourteenth amendment guarantees equal protection under the laws judge david barlow of u s district court in salt lake city didn t agree tersely dismissing alpine s lawsuit in five short sentences with prejudice

products and services our reviews and ratings are not influenced by advertisers you can read more about our editorial guidelines and our products and services review methodology 20 years helping you live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers despite their concerns most americans are trying to overcome their financial challenges and fears on their own nearly 65 percent of adults are taking a self directed approach to planning according to the 2021 fidelity investments couples money study when people get sick they go to a physician when people get into legal trouble they go to a lawyer said robert johnson professor of finance at creighton university s heider college of business in omaha nebraska yet people somehow believe that they can navigate the complex financial markets without the assistance of a professional perhaps you need the help of a financial planner but don t realize it johnson said there are several signs that you should hire a professional to help you with your finances here are the five main indicators 1 you earn a decent living but don t have the discipline to save johnson said one sign you need the help of a financial professional is if you are progressing in your career and earn enough to set aside money for retirement but can t develop the discipline to invest for the future many people fail to take the steps to save for themselves if they do not have a financial advisor holding them accountable said michael hardy a certified financial planner and president of ocean wealth group in williamsville new york according to the fidelity study while a top financial concern of both millennials and gen xers is saving enough for retirement 51 of couples disagree on how much savings is needed for retirement a planner will help you create a budget so you can determine how much you can set aside advisors also help you figure out how much risk you are willing to take and how much you should take when it comes to investing then the advisor can structure a savings and investment plan that is objective and realistic johnson said 2 you are not sure you save enough for retirement without knowing how much you need to save it is hard to create a plan to set aside enough for a comfortable retirement over 50 of couples who responded to the fidelity study admitted that they don t know how much they need to save for retirement to sustain their current lifestyle unfortunately most people are not saving nearly enough to be able to retire when they would like to hardy said this is especially a problem for those nearing retirement hardy said he has seen this personally the biggest concern of older adults who come to him for help is whether they will have enough assets to live a comfortable retirement and if not what they need to do to get there a planner can help you figure this out 3 you do not know how to build an investment portfolio very few people feel confident enough to put together their own portfolio that takes into account risk tolerance costs asset allocation and time frame hardy said it can be complicated for the average investor according to the fidelity study 40 of couples disagree on how much risk they are comfortable taking on in their investments which can greatly affect their potential earnings the investments you choose can affect how much money you ll have in retirement i am amazed that some young individuals with a very long time until retirement choose very conservative asset allocations johnson said this can cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars when it is time for them to retire a financial planner can help you create an investment portfolio that will help you reach your goals a good advisor won t use a cookie cutter approach either the portfolio will be based on your risk tolerance age and other factors such as your tax bracket 4 you do not know how to create a long term plan unfortunately many americans do not have a financial plan creating a financial plan can be difficult because most people are uncomfortable examining their own financial situation hardy said sometimes it is easier and less stressful for someone else to create a plan and hold us accountable than doing it on our own he said if you re confused about how to set financial goals and what you need to do to achieve them a financial planner can help a financial planner will help you look holistically at all of your assets and help you develop a plan that is right for you johnson said advisors create a plan based not only on your investments such as stocks and bonds but also on assets such as real estate life insurance and even your own human capital or earning power in fact the fidelity study found that couples who work with a financial advisor are up to 19 less concerned about common financial stressors such as saving and paying off debt than those who do not work with a professional 5 you are afraid you will lose all your money in the stock
