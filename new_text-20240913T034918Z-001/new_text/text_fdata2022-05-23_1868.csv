eggs hard boiling your own eggs takes time first you have to wait for the water to boil and then let them cook for around 11 minutes then you must allow the eggs to cool a bit and peel them but by

precut versions milkos getty images istockphoto 21 gift cards when you re running short on time to shop having the option to grab a gift card while you re picking up a cake can be the perfect solution

grocery store know that you re likely paying a huge markup instead take a look at the prices on prepackaged bulk spices at warehouse clubs and figure out the difference another way to save money on spices is to buy them from a natural food or ethnic food retailer that keeps bulk bins save your old spice jars and refill them with bulk spices or if you don t want to buy bulk or bagged spices look for generic brands a 4 ounce bottle of house brand seasoned salt at the grocery store retails for 1 while the same size of a name brand bottle costs 3 49 peopleimages getty images istockphoto 25

shenaya ann washington and a close friend cleared a small patch of grass at the base of a utility pole on riley street they dug a hole there and planted a red rose bush seedling next to it they leaned 10 prayer candles against the pole washington said she chose that spot to memorialize the victims of last weekend s massacre at tops friendly market because it is closest to the store entrance she had always used as a part time worker for instacart the grocery delivery service sometimes when she would exit the store aaron salter jr the slain retired police officer who worked security at tops would help washington back to her car with the grocery orders she said the shooter whose racist attack deeply wounded east buffalo s black community has stolen much more than the neighborhood s only grocery store and the sense of peace many residents felt in the cherished community gathering spot he took away people who did for the community just because of the color of their skin it s an eye opener it s a reality check washington said during sunday service pastor russell bell of the state tabernacle church of god in christ where shooting victim heyward patterson was a deacon promised his congregation that they would hold a celebration of his life bell also encouraged his predominantly black flock to lean into their faith advertisement we re going to be winners if we endure to the end he said just over a week ago a white gunman in body armor killed 10 black shoppers and workers at the supermarket that has been temporarily closed three others were injured in the attack which federal authorities are investigating as a hate crime long before that 18 year old avowed white supremacist inflicted terror in this community buffalo s black neighborhoods like many others around the nation had been dealing with wounds that are generations old the attack has scraped off the scab hiding black trauma and neglect that sit just below the surface in what s called the city of good neighbors residents business owners and faith leaders said healing will require not only an immediate flood of charity but also systemic solutions economic investments and mental health counseling that are long lasting they said it s been great to see the outpouring of support i must say that said jackie stover stitts co owner of golden cup coffee about a block from the tops on jefferson avenue for the past few days the atmosphere around her shop had been festival like and at times a somber space of mourning organizations from across the nation and even a few global charities offered food and other essential goods to residents who relied on tops to meet their basic needs advertisement the only concern is that it s not short lived stover stitts said it would mean more if we could see on monday that all those people with funds that came down to say how sorry they were could show it by investing in our area buffalo with a population of 255 000 that is 47 white 35 black 12 hispanic and 6 asian is one of the nation s most racially segregated cities the neighborhoods around the tops market are predominantly black and impoverished earlier in the week civil rights leader the rev al sharpton pointed to racial and socioeconomic inequality that made the tops a target for the shooter who officials say drove hundreds of miles to find black people to gun down if there wasn t but one supermarket in the black community he wouldn t have gone to tops sharpton said at a prayer vigil held in buffalo for the victims families on thursday if you can figure out how to get millions of dollars for a stadium can t you figure out how to get a supermarket sharpton added referring to a new 1 4 billion home turf planned for the buffalo bills that will be funded largely by taxpayers la tryse anderson of buffalo snug a gun violence prevention organization canvassed the neighborhood around the tops with other volunteers to get a sense of residents needs some told her they needed groceries toiletries replacement appliances and even a utility bill paid advertisement i wish i had a magic wand she said there were so many needs out here before this shooting happened without real investments in the areas that surround the tops anderson said i don t think we ll ever fully heal from this residents will definitely need the option of another supermarket as some have vowed to never set foot in that tops location again she added they are too traumatized reshawna chapple a black therapist and associate professor in the school of social work at the university of central florida said the shock and grief caused by the supermarket shooting are made worse when people are not tending to their mental health systemic racism is part of the reason why too few in the black community seek mental health counseling either on a regular basis or in the wake of tragedy she said every time something like this happens it opens up the wounds all over again chapple said we aren t taught to acknowledge feelings that are negative the ones who need help the most are definitely not going to ask for it mental health and grief counseling is why several community service organizations have been camped out around the supermarket for several days with the tops fenced off organizations such as feed buffalo ramp global missions and life camp inc lined the surrounding streets with food trucks mobile food pantries and barbecue grills serving chicken burgers and hot dogs advertisement a trio of massage therapists offered neck and back treatments to victims families and other residents a local starbucks gave out free coffee to passersby an evangelist baptized people in a large galvanized stock tank on the corner of riley street and jefferson avenue the local muslim community offered prayers and chants of we are with you near the supermarket gregory jackson jr a washington based organizer with the community justice action fund said he came to buffalo to help coordinate relief efforts to victims families and residents who were too traumatized to ask for what they need a lot of folks have not even gotten close to going back to normal life yet he said you get local police cameras and media from all over the world but the community is stuck to pick up the pieces without any bigger support the supermarket shooting has also drawn support for the activists from around the nation on saturday organizers with black lives matter grassroots a national collective of chapters held a vigil for buffalo organizers from boston detroit virginia beach virginia and minneapolis attended and vowed to be with buffalo s residents as they continued to heal from the racist attack we cannot have a world that steals the lives of our grandmothers said melina abdullah who directs the blm group and founded its los angeles chapter we are duty bound to shut that down send questions comments to the editors previous next

an underlying asset longchamp thinks that if stablecoins are here to stay regulation is a must because there were some ust holders that had good faith in the project and were not aware of the underlying risks regulators should discourage the use of algorithmically backed stablecoins he says by giving ones with sound backing a green light via a regulatory framework after all with usdc it s well known what s behind it stablecoin tether usdt has worked so far because the redemption requests for usdt have been successful but it s still unclear what s behind it but with algorithmic stablecoins like ust the problem he says is that dollars are created at no cost it s not like usdc where you park a dollar to issue a dollar decentralized finance defi and stablecoins are right now going through what has been learned in the 19th century in the banking system which at the end of the day led to the rise of central banking he said but while banks like seba welcome regulation and it

the nigeria media space has been abashed with the story of the richest man in africa mr aliko dangote being broke and needing a bailout the nigeria media space has been abashed with the story of the richest man in africa mr aliko dangote being broke and needing a bailout to complete his refinery project the story reverberated in nigeria because the president muhammadu buhari s administration is relying on the yet to be completed refinery to turn the country s fortune around last april information minister lai mohammed described the project as a game changer to conserve foreign exchange by ending the importation of petroleum products creating employment and generating foreign exchange through the export of finished products the american credit rating agency noted that aliko dangote needs about 1 1 billion n900 billion to complete his refinery in lagos it further detailed that the refinery s existing creditors will not be able to give the organisation the amount needed for the completion of the project if the transaction is not successful or should completion cost overrun or market conditions in the cement or urea deteriorate materially however daily trust s analysis of the current and future cash flows from all of the dangote industries limited productive assets sugar cement refining salt agriculture fertilizer etc does not lay credence to the story that he is broke speaking with our reporter a financial expert and publisher of money central patrick atunya said the talk about dangote being broke smacks of financial illiteracy dangote cement shares are as good as currency the expert argued that dangote cement plc dcp the flagship company of dil is a significant contributor to dil s consolidated profile the company is supported by large scale operations in nigeria and pan africa in 2021 dcp s earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation or ebitda contribution to dil stood above 90 in 2021 revenues from cement sales in all its operations nigeria and the rest of africa rose by 34 and amounted to n1 383 trillion after paying taxes and making other expenses dangote cement reported a profit of n346 4 billion fitch ratings forecasts that dangote s cement business will average 1 1 billion per annum in ebitda between 2022 and 2025 making it one of the most profitable cement firms in the world dil owns 85 8 of dangote cement atunya said because of the expected free cash flows from the cement operations dangote cement stock listed on the nigeria exchange limited are valued at 14 times earnings for a market capitalisation of n5 11 trillion this means that from just one of his firms dangote cement alone aliko dangote is liquid to the tune of n4 38 trillion representing dil s 85 8 ownership a liquid asset is an asset that can easily be converted into cash in a short amount of time stocks money market instruments and marketable securities are generally considered liquid assets this alone debunks the notion of dangote being broke as he can sell down his stake in the cement firm or borrow against its assets if he chooses as a way to raise money he added in 2021 the directors recommended a dividend of n20 per share for shareholders daily trust analysis indicates that dil received n292 billion as dividends last year from dangote cement equity sale in refinery the nigerian national petroleum corporation nnpc in 2021 took a 20 stake worth 2 76 billion in the dangote refinery project valuing the refinery at 13 8 billion then analysts believe that the valuation is much higher today with the refinery nearing completion and the current geopolitical landscape with the russia ukraine war which has sent commodities soaring funding for the completion of the refinery project could then be gotten through further asset sales in the project dil could today probably raise 2 billion with a 10 15 sale of stakes in the refinery more than is needed to complete the project fitch expects the project to contribute around 1 billion to ebitda annually when ramped up from 2024 assets for loan one way through which companies finance expansions or acquisitions is through loans backed by their existing assets dangote industries limited dil is planning to establish a local bond programme amounting to 750 million to partially finance the completion of its refinery and petrochemical plant dangote oil refining company limited dorc and dangote fertiliser limited dfl dil s subsidiaries will be co obligors under the proposed programme the bond programme together with dils retained earnings from its other operations should be enough cash to complete the refinery in atunya s opinion dangote fertiliser dangote s fertiliser plant was commissioned last year and there were 2 lines operational as of april 2022 the fertiliser plant line 1 is expected to gradually ramp up to an average of 60 capacity utilisation in 2022 2023 and to around 80 by 2025 from 25 in 2021 line 2 will ramp to around 80 capacity rate by 2025 from 50 in 2022 according to fitch the fertiliser plant is expected to be highly profitable also with a 66 ebitda margin in 2022 2025 the urea prices have soared as the russia ukraine war affected commodity prices currently traded at usd630 ton as of may 17 dangote fertiliser plant has also begun exports of its products meaning it is earning foreign exchange for dil which can be channelled into the completion of the refinery project fitch estimates dil to have an adequate liquidity score at 1 5x for 2021 with estimated total external group debt of 3 8 billion it has no significant maturities until 2023 when fitch expects the refinery to start generating cash flow we expect positive free cash flow fcf from 2023 when both projects refinery and fertiliser plants are ramped up and capex is moderate fitch said atunya said in essence aliko dangote is far from broke and will continue to smile all the way to the bank as all his major projects cement refinery and fertiliser generate mountains of cash annually into the foreseeable future

by paul craig roberts we are hearing from many that the world after covid 19 will be different the question is different in what way will it be better or worse elites are working to make it better for them and worse for the rest of us about that the evidence is clear the big boys are being bailed out and their debts covered everyone else except those already marginalized and without a recent work record and fixed address got a month s rent and extended unemployment benefits big pharma sees massive profits in the virus government sees more power to control but the disparity in economic benefits is only a part of it powerful vested interests such as bill gates and big pharma are determined to vaccinate us all and to control our movements with an internal passport called vaccinated health cleared or other words to that effect new tracking procedures and technologies are to be put in operation reminiscent of the mark of the beast to police the access of various categories of people to various areas and benefits experts point out that just as we cannot be vaccinated against the common cold except perhaps for the past year s version we cannot be vaccinated against covid 19 and other mutating viruses but the experts are already being shouted down no expert opinion is to be permitted to stand in the way of vaccination profits neither will nutrition and vitamin advocates be allowed to get in the way bill sardi predicts that orchestrated scares generated by mandatory recalls of toxic vitamins await us big pharma is determined to acquire control over vitamins and homeopathic remedies and the fda is big pharma s likely pawn vaccination has been elevated above cure as big pharma and its shills such as cnn shout down the positive experience doctors report of successful treatments with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and the effectiveness of vitamin c vitamin d3 and zinc in strengthening the ability of immune systems to fight off the virus big pharma influenced medical orthodoxy cannot get out of the box it has been put into when new thinking and experimentation are needed those capable of thought are hassled and even blocked by fda regulations and dogmatism the permanent government and its security agencies see in the population s fear and confusion opportunities to put into place more tyrannical measures more set asides of constitutional rights more impairments on free speech the ability of freedom to resist oppression is ever diminished various descriptions of the expected dystopia are offered on the internet but it does not have to turn out this way it is up to us demoralized and fearful we can accept more government power as we did after 9 11 instead we can collectively recognize the massive failure everywhere of western leadership and construct a more livable and sustainable society the failure of leadership is an opportunity for real change cnn the new york times and the rest of the controlled media tell us every day that president donald trump represents the failure of leadership but the failure of leadership goes beyond all the leaders of the last 30 years and resides in the system itself global self regulating greed driven financialized soulless capitalism cannot unite people into a sustainable community the failure of leadership resides in the long term failure of leadership that made western societies vulnerable by moving high productivity high valued jobs offshore in order to raise corporate profits at the expense of domestic consumer incomes it means the movement offshore of the ability to produce medicines n95 masks and other needed resources for national survival it means dependency on foreign powers it means the inability to function without massive imports however you look at it globalism is a death sentence its only advantage is to the rich and the advantage comes to them in the form of cheap labor that swells their profits while it shrinks domestic incomes and the purchasing power of the population without incomes to drive the economy the elites provided loans and expanded credit in order to provide spending power based in personal debt to absorb the offshored production brought home to sell in american markets the cost of college education soared as its quality declined education subsidies were cut and student debt substituted in its place inflation was understated in order to deny social security pensioners cost of living increases medicare payments to healthcare providers were squeezed down the social safety net was ripped again and again more and more people fell out and homeless populations grew providing fertile breeding grounds for covid 19 the income and wealth distribution in the u s went from fair to extremely unequal in a short time as the rich profited from the federal reserve pumping trillions of dollars into the prices of financial assets and from corporations buying back their own stock thus decapitalizing the corporation while taking the company into debt all for the temporary benefit of higher bonuses for executives and more capital gains for shareholders the elites killed the economy for short run benefits to themselves these destructive polices were the work of greed driven short term thinkers people whose only vision was i want even more and it is these unworthy people not their victims that uncle sam is now rescuing the massive unpayable debt bubble that already overhung the economy is being blown larger the federal reserve and the u s treasury are in the process of destroying the u s dollar in futile efforts to save the super rich from their own greed driven misbehavior in place of this insane approach to the economic crisis there is a sane approach the bailed out corporations and banks are in effect being purchased by the government therefore they should be treated as the nationalized corporations that they are once nationalized the government unlike the corporations can create the money to pay the salaries and health premiums the predicted 30 or 40 unemployment can be avoided it is better to pay salaries than to pay unemployment benefits the psychological difference alone is worth a vast amount the inability of the high cost american private healthcare system to cope with the present medical crisis is apparent a profit driven healthcare system is the highest cost system to have profit is built in at every level which raises costs to levels that private insurance and medicare refuse to reimburse the result is shrinkage not expansion of the system just look for example at the number of hospitals especially in rural areas that have recently closed moreover the coverage of a private system and medicare itself has massive gaps the resistance to a nationalized health service is ridiculous especially as a nationalized service can coexist with a privatized one two are clearly better than one nationalization has numerous benefits it permits the large unwieldly enterprises created for example by the mergers of giant banks like chase manhattan and j p morgan to be broken up and to reestablish the separation of commercial from investment banking the repeal of the glass steagall act and the suspension of enforcement of the anti trust laws were ignorant policymaking at its worse nationalization permits the government to bring home the offshored production of global u s corporations and to put the u s workforce back to work in middle class jobs it is win win for the american people once the giant monopoly corporations are broken up they can be privatized and returned to private ownership on a fair value basis not on the giveaway basis of a pennies on the dollar sale the money the government receives from their sale can be used to retire government debt for individuals the life and economy suffocating heavy debts should be written down to levels that can be serviced by their incomes michael hudson and i proposed a debt jubilee as a solution others have taken up our call currently the federal reserve is socializing debt without writing it down this is nonsensical as it bails out debt by expanding it in the u s there is so much dogmatic prejudice against anything that has a tint of socialism even as a temporary expedient measure that thought and sensible action face strong barriers if we cannot overcome these barriers we are destined for far more difficult times can community be restored or will nationality degenerate into the clans and tribalism of identity politics the greatest challenge we face is to restore the concept of community there was a time when the united states was a community a unique one as it consisted of a multitude of ethnicities as each wave of ethnic immigrants arrived they passed a test on the constitution learned the national language and became assimilated into the american community this community has been destroyed by a variety of forces the latest being identity politics identity politics prohibits community by breaking down the population into mutually hostile groups by gender sexual preference race and whatever classification can be invented or imagined the result is a tower of babel a tower of babel is not a community instead of community the u s is a place where hatreds are cultivated with those claiming the status of victims doing the most hating and those assigned the status of victimizer being most hated initially white hetereosexual males were the primary hate objects but lately we have the transgendered hating the feminists who say that a woman is a woman not a man who claims to be a woman the transgendered attacks on well known feminist leaders are violent in their language and are likely to progress into violent deeds various unassimilated immigrant groups battle each other over who controls disputed territory israel s inhumane treatment of palestinians has enraged muslim immigrants against jews violent racial attacks on white people are becoming more common for decades women s studies have taught hatred of men and black studies have taught hatred of whites this taught hatred is now supplemented by the new york times 1619 project in place of assimilation we now have mutual hatreds how do we escape from this perhaps the challenge from covid 19 will force us to come together again in order to prevail over the virus which in mutated versions might be with us forever a coming together would be helped by an economic bailout perceived as fair rather than as the one sided approach that has been taken a debt jubilee provides the necessary fairness the elites by thinking only of their interests are in the way of the opportunity that crisis provides to bring people together if we can t be brought back together we can forget about unity beyond the boundaries of our own victim or identity group in place of community we will be organized in clans of separate identities the absence of unity at home will make us a sitting duck for enemies abroad we know what the dystopian wish list is can we come together with an anti dystopian wish list as a mutually supportive community or have the elites succeeded in atomizing us into disparate tribal hate groups dr paul craig roberts was assistant secretary of the u s treasury under president ronald reagan and was associate editor and columnist at the wall street journal he has been a professor of economics in six universities and is the author of numerous books available at afp s bookstore

the consumer financial protection bureau again faces an existential threat in the courts this time over whether the agency s funding by the federal reserve system is constitutional earlier this month five judges on the u s court of appeals for the fifth circuit signaled their view that the cfpb s funding mechanism violates the constitution s separation of powers because it happens outside of the congressional appropriations process the opinion is not binding and the five judges represent less than a third of the 17 active judges on the fifth circuit court of appeals still a decision by the second circuit court of appeals in another legal challenge to the cfpb s finding source is expected in the next six months earlier this month five judges on the fifth circuit court of appeals signaled their view that the cfpb s funding mechanism violates the constitution s separation of powers adobe stock bloomberg compared with past legal challenges to the cfpb the cases winding their way through appeals courts stand a better chance of disbanding the agency entirely and invalidating every action the bureau has taken since it was created in the dodd frank act of 2010 lawyers say this is another big storm cloud for the cfpb said alan kaplinsky senior counsel at ballard spahr if a court finds that the appropriations language is unconstitutional that really puts the cfpb into danger two years ago the supreme court ruled in seila law llc v cfpb that the bureau s single director structure was unconstitutional but that decision left the agency and all of its rulemakings and actions intact the reason is that congress included in dodd frank what is known as a severability clause which allowed certain provisions that were found to be illegal to be struck down while the statute could remain in a split 5 4 decision chief justice john roberts found that a sitting president can fire the cfpb director for any reason the result was that the so called for cause provision in dodd frank was simply removed the agency s past actions were then ratified by former cfpb director kathy kraninger but there is no severability clause for the cfpb s funding mechanism if an appeals court were to find that the cfpb s source of funds is unconstitutional it would be a far more serious threat to the agency s viability lawyers said it is likely that eventually the supreme court will have to decide the funding issue eventually said rich samp senior litigation attorney at the new civil liberties alliance a nonprofit law firm that litigates against federal administrative agencies samp said he has been advising targets of recent cfpb enforcement actions to challenge the bureau s funding mechanism in the fifth circuit case the concurring opinion of the five judges who objected to the cfpb s funding mechanism has no binding effect but could influence other cases samp said three of the five judges who found the funding structure unconstitutional were appointed by former president donald trump u s circuit judge edith jones who was appointed by former president ronald reagan wrote that if congress allows the cfpb s funding structure to remain there will be no limits to the appropriations process being bypassed congress may no more lawfully chip away at its own obligation to regularly appropriate money than it may abdicate that obligation entirely jones wrote if the cfpb s funding mechanism survives this litigation the camel s nose is in the tent when conditions are right the rest will follow still the judges found that the cfpb can continue to litigate a 2016 case filed against all american check cashing a mississippi check cashing and payday lender firm with 50 stores in three states the appeals court remanded the case to the district court the five judges opined that in fact the cfpb continues to be unconstitutional because of this funding mechanism and that issue would probably be much more important than what was addressed in the seila law decision samp said i personally think it is and it s an issue we are raising in the second circuit defenders of the cfpb note that as a banking regulator the cfpb is hardly alone in being free from congressional purse strings every other federal banking regulator including the federal deposit insurance corp the office of the comptroller of the currency the federal reserve and the federal housing finance agency is funded by exam fees or other sources such as deposit insurance assessments those funding mechanisms were designed primarily to make the agencies independent and free from the political process republican lawmakers have recently taken up the latest legal challenge to the cfpb raising concerns in hearings about the fact that the agency is not subject to the appropriations process republican lawmakers appear to be teeing up bills to address the bureau s funding source some lawmakers have said the cfpb is not a prudential regulator and argued that its funding structure should instead be similar to those of the federal trade commission and the securities and exchange commission which receive congressional appropriations the questioning you re getting from many members is warranted because the cfpb unlike other independent agencies such as the sec or ftc aren t dependent on the congressional appropriations process rep bryan steil r wis told cfpb director rohit chopra last month at a house financial services committee hearing in fiscal 2021 the cfpb requested 596 million of the 717 5 million available in transfers from the fed kaplinsky said that even if congress were to amend dodd frank an impossibility given the body s partisan fractures there may be no way to save the cfpb s past actions i think it s a real worry at the bureau now how is this all going to play out kaplinsky said
cnn a shipment of 35 tons of baby formula has arrived sunday in indianapolis on a us military aircraft from germany to address a nationwide shortage the prescription formula will be distributed to areas around the country where there is the most acute need a biden administration official earlier told cnn the shipment included 132 pallets of formula which arrived on one c 17 cargo plane the formula originated from zurich switzerland and was trucked to germany where it was loaded on the c 17 and flown to the us agriculture secretary tom vilsack who greeted the arrival of the delivery in indianapolis said sunday s shipment would provide enough formula for 9 000 babies and 18 000 toddlers for one week it is a large shipment of very specific and specialized formula formula for moms and dads who have children who have allergies where the regular formula just simply will not work the secretary said at a news conference in indianapolis shortly after the shipment landed the biden administration official told cnn earlier that the product contained in the first shipment will be distributed to hospitals doctors home health care facilities and pharmacies in regions where the needs are most acute the official said that none of the first shipment would land on store shelves in the us adding that the formula being shipped sunday is hypoallergenic and will be fed to babies intolerant of protein in cow milk the aircraft transported pallets of nestlé health science formula including alfamino infant and alfamino junior at the site of the arrival in indianapolis on sunday a nestlé spokesperson said some cases are ready for distribution in the next couple of days others will be released into the supply chain after standard quality testing is completed frustration for american families the shipment comes as the shortage of baby formula has caused major disruptions and frustration for some desperate american families already some families have begun rationing their supply of formula while others have turned to hospitals when they can t find the kind they need and in a clear sign of the deep effects of the crisis a doctor at le bonheur children s hospital in memphis tennessee said last week that he admitted two young patients a toddler and a preschooler because the specialty formula they need is out of stock and they haven t been able to tolerate any replacements clinical dietitians at medical university of south carolina shawn jenkins children s hospital in charleston have reported that at least four babies were recently hospitalized for complications related to the ongoing formula shortage according to a spokesperson for musc the spokesperson said three of the four babies were hospitalized due to intolerance of formula that parents had to try because of shortages while one was sickened by mineral imbalances from caregivers mixing their own formula on sunday new york city mayor eric adams declared a state of emergency over the nationwide shortage of the supply of infant formula a statement from his office said the move would empower the new york city department of consumer and worker protection dcwp to prevent price gouging for formula the baby formula shortage has thrown the white house into crisis mode and opened yet another political wound going into an already challenging midterm election season frustrating the west wing and the rest of the administration as they struggle with how little control they have over a situation that is centered at the us food and drug administration an independent agency that the white house neither controls nor gets direct reports from officials have faced criticism that the fda moved too slowly to address warning signs at the same time they have been attempting to learn whether formula companies are actually short on ingredients while also trying to tackle potential price gouging vilsack said in indianapolis on sunday that the federal government is working with suppliers of baby formula in the us to increase production and address the nationwide shortage he said the government is working to help get the abbott facility in michigan up and running through the aid of the defense production act the baby formula manufacturer abbott nutrition is the company at the heart of a nationwide formula recall the agriculture secretary also said an agreement with the fda would allow the abbott facility and others to jump ahead of line for the necessary supplies that are necessary and required in order to produce the formula more flights expected earlier sunday president joe biden touted the first flight from his administration s baby formula airlift operation on twitter folks i m excited to tell you that the first flight from operation fly formula is loaded up with more than 70 000 pounds of infant formula and about to land in indiana our team is working around the clock to get safe formula to everyone who needs it biden said on twitter national economic council director brian deese told cnn s dana bash on state of the union on sunday that as part of the airlift operation more flights with baby formula will be coming in early this week we re going to keep ramping that up until we get there deese said pressed by bash on how the us ended up in a position in which baby formula has to be airlifted into the country deese in part blamed market consolidation it goes back to this question of how we can bring more competition in our economy have more providers have this formula so that no individual company has this much control over supply chains he said the biden administration official told cnn earlier that the product was coming from a factory that has already gone through us fda approval meaning us inspectors would only need to conduct spot checks sunday after the product lands those checks include ensuring that the product was not damaged in transit and has appropriate labeling an fda inspector was onsite to conduct the spot check separately nestlé is also going to conduct its own quality check at its local distribution site this shipment is essentially going to get off this cargo plane then the federal express folks are going to take it from there they are going to deliver it to a distribution center that the nestlé gerber folks have here in indiana and then it s going to go on trucks and it s going to be delivered in hospitals and home health care clinics across the country providing support and help vilsack said sunday additionally the biden administration is engaged in conversations with makers of other european baby formula to approve and obtain excess supplies for us distribution the administration official told cnn indianapolis was chosen as the arrival site for the formula because the nestlé distribution site is located there the official added that the administration is plugging into the existing distribution chain we re turning a two week process into 72 hours the official said the cnn wire 2022 cable news

even before the us federal reserve starts hiking interest rates more aggressively a surefire way to discourage spending some investors are already in a tizzy about the state of the american consumer the reason last week s results from big retailers suggest consumers are in worse shape under inflation than many realize not only is this stoking fears of a recession but big retailers stocks promoted as safe havens just two weeks ago have suddenly turned in a black monday worthy performance big box stores from stock score to bore until last week the s p 500 consumer staples index which features big box retailers like target and walmart along with pharmacies and food producers was one of only three segments on the s p 500 also including energy and utility stocks that hadn t declined in 2022 oh how things have changed last week walmart considered by many a bellwether of the us retail sector and thus a proxy for the state of the american consumer surprised investors by cutting its earnings guidance rival target issued a similar warning both stocks proceeded to have their worst day since the infamous black monday of 1987 and by week s end the consumer staples index was down 8 9 for the year such results lead to two concerns that consumers have hit the cap on what they re willing to spend and that retailers can t keep up with costs the jury s out on which one is weighing heavier on the sector last month visa s spending momentum index which tracks credit and debit card spending fell to its lowest level since february 2021 visa said consumers are spending more on food and gas which hurts their ability to pay for discretionary items their wallets are being squeezed said kohl s ceo michelle gass whose company also slashed its profit targets last week on an investor call on the other side of the equation are companies absorbing equally significant hits walmart s fuel costs in the last quarter were 160 million higher than planned another unexpected wallop comes from inventory companies who paid the price for not having it on hand pre pandemic are now paying the price for a lesson learned too well target s inventory is up 43 from a year ago walmart s 32 whatever your economies of scale all that stuff costs money to buy and store keep in mind during most of the big sell offs of my lifetime 2009 the dot com bubble or 1987 almost every one of these times within two years you saw very strong recoveries retail investor richard thalheimer told the financial times now if only someone had a time machine to 2024
while the nation seems to be experiencing a shortage of infant formula here on guam we should be ok said janela carrera spokeswoman for the department of public health and social services public health is staying on top of this we are communicating with distributors we re also in communication with our federal partners as well carera said we re not experiencing the shortage that we re seeing stateside so we re very fortunate in that regard national shortage according to associated press news reports supplies of baby formula across the nation have been severely limited in recent weeks as a result of a product recall back in february by abbott nutrition in order to streamline infant formula production president joe biden on wednesday invoked the defense production act and authorized flights to import supplies from overseas in an effort to decrease production or shipping issues according to ap reports biden also is authorizing the department of defense to use commercial aircraft to fly formula supplies that meet federal standards from overseas to the u s in what the white house is calling operation fly formula guam preparations while the national shortage is having increasingly anxious parents struggling to find infant formula on the mainland the shortage currently isn t an issue on guam public health already has had alternatives prepared not just for potential shortages but for shipping delays as well we were actually very good about preparing for this we monitor the level constantly carrera said we communicate with food and nutrition services and we let them know what our current supply levels are and if they can go ahead and increase the stock for us so that we don t experience the type of shortage that we re seeing in the states snap wic for clients under the supplemental nutrition assistance program or the women infants and children federal assistance programs for low income pregnant women and families with children under the age of 5 there is an exchange program in place in case the specific wic approved items are not in stock especially for children with allergies carrera explained there may be a different type of formula that s not necessarily covered under wic they just need to notify wic notify us about this particular formula and we can do the exchange program and we can do this online said carrera public health s federal partners also are strategizing with preemptive solutions and alternatives such as looking into other formula brands and manufacturers that may be approved as part of the formula exchange local retailers pay less supermarkets chief people officer louise borja said their stores are in short supply of the wic approved baby formula brands similac and enfamil but that is because it depends on the shipments given by their vendors they re the ones who give us the supply and we really can t control how many or how much of that we bring in borja said we ve just reached out to them and the next shipment which is delayed would not be coming in until next week pay less supermarkets does have other specialty baby formulas in stock and like public health the company is exploring other types of formula brands that are closest to the similac and enfamil brands
the world has plenty of oil but the companies and nations that pump crude have no reason to sell it for less an international cartel controls the cheapest oil and the corporations that control the rest cannot compete below current prices of 100 a barrel or more the days of cheap energy are over at least until we all drive electric vehicles most of the world s crude oil comes from corrupt democracies or authoritarian dictatorships some of which market themselves as monarchies these governments rely on oil companies owned by the government to remain in power many members of the organization of the petroleum exporting countries can produce oil for less than 20 a barrel but paying brutal security forces and operating luxury yachts gets expensive they need prices above 85 a barrel to keep angry mobs off the streets and their crews from mutiny petro dictators are also becoming more united saudi arabian crown prince mohammed bin salman s new alliance with russian president vladimir putin comes as no surprise after the free world shunned them for exporting their oppression the prince shattered the kingdom s oil for security deal with the u s by ignoring president joe biden s call for more production u s companies can produce more but shale oil from fracked wells has always been expensive prices only dropped in 2014 because opec flooded the market to push u s oil off the market until russia aligned opec leaders feel pressured to defend their market share they are happy to enjoy the windfall foreign producers know well that u s competition is not coming anytime soon drilling costs are higher laborers want better pay and freedom loving people refuse to finance putin s war crimes american oil companies are making a killing right now but that s because they have not been drilling only emptying storage tanks inflation has hit every link in the supply chain and sinking more wells will be expensive president joe biden is not to blame no matter what the oil lobbyists say neither an increase in government leasing nor a lightening of federal regulation will make a difference within the next two years the economics of oil is the problem since 2015 more than 600 oil exploration and production oil field service and pipeline companies have filed for bankruptcy bringing more than 321 billion in debt to court according to haynes and boone a dallas based law firm that tracks oil and gas bankruptcies investors lost hundreds of billions because oil companies sold oil for more than it cost to produce today investors insist management teams keep production low and return profits to them publicly traded companies that follow these orders like exxon mobil have seen stock prices jump over the last six months geology though is the more significant problem top tier reservoirs are getting harder to find and so are good workers since many swore off the oil patch after the last bust international tariffs have made steel pipe more expensive and remember it takes a lot of expensive diesel fuel to drill a well higher oil prices will lead to additional u s production but not enough to lower prices because input costs and demand have also grown the u s energy information administration said earlier this month a high level of uncertainty remains in our outlooks but we have consistently forecast that elevated crude oil prices would help drive record level annual u s oil production levels in 2023 said eia administrator joe decarolis low global oil inventories coupled with continued high demand for gasoline diesel and other petroleum products means that increased production likely won t have much impact on prices in the short term gasoline producers have plenty of reasons to keep prices at 4 a gallon there are few potential catalysts to drive them lower opec and oil companies could over produce again as they did in 2014 but that was a price war for market share that caused widespread financial losses for everyone involved the war in ukraine meanwhile means traders will use any additional supply to reduce reliance on russian exports not bring down prices demand could also drop high fuel prices hit low income working people especially hard and many will drive less to save money high fuel prices also increase the costs of all goods which slows economic activity combined with the federal reserve making loans more expensive high fuel prices can cause a recession which would send demand and prices down the third option is substitution consumers can buy electric vehicles which are cheaper to own at these gas prices if that happens in large enough numbers few of us will care what gasoline costs have you checked out the ford f 150 lightning yet chris tomlinson writes commentary about business economics and politics twitter com cltomlinson chris tomlinson chron com

even before the us federal reserve starts hiking interest rates more aggressively a surefire way to discourage spending some investors are already in a tizzy about the state of the american consumer the reason last week s results from big retailers suggest consumers are in worse shape under inflation than many realize not only is this stoking fears of a recession but big retailers stocks promoted as safe havens just two weeks ago have suddenly turned in a black monday worthy performance big box stores from stock score to bore until last week the s p 500 consumer staples index which features big box retailers like target and walmart along with pharmacies and food producers was one of only three segments on the s p 500 also including energy and utility stocks that hadn t declined in 2022 oh how things have changed last week walmart considered by many a bellwether of the us retail sector and thus a proxy for the state of the american consumer surprised investors by cutting its earnings guidance rival target issued a similar warning both stocks proceeded to have their worst day since the infamous black monday of 1987 and by week s end the consumer staples index was down 8 9 for the year such results lead to two concerns that consumers have hit the cap on what they re willing to spend and that retailers can t keep up with costs the jury s out on which one is weighing heavier on the sector last month visa s spending momentum index which tracks credit and debit card spending fell to its lowest level since february 2021 visa said consumers are spending more on food and gas which hurts their ability to pay for discretionary items their wallets are being squeezed said kohl s ceo michelle gass whose company also slashed its profit targets last week on an investor call on the other side of the equation are companies absorbing equally significant hits walmart s fuel costs in the last quarter were 160 million higher than planned another unexpected wallop comes from inventory companies who paid the price for not having it on hand pre pandemic are now paying the price for a lesson learned too well target s inventory is up 43 from a year ago walmart s 32 whatever your economies of scale all that stuff costs money to buy and store keep in mind during most of the big sell offs of my lifetime 2009 the dot com bubble or 1987 almost every one of these times within two years you saw very strong recoveries retail investor richard thalheimer told the financial times now if only someone had a time machine to 2024
buffalo n y shenaya ann washington and a close friend cleared a small patch of grass at the base of a utility pole on riley street they dug a hole there and planted a red rose bush seedling next to it they leaned 10 prayer candles against the pole washington said she chose that spot to memorialize the victims of last weekend s massacre at tops friendly market because it is closest to the store entrance she had always used as a part time worker for instacart the grocery delivery service sometimes when she would exit the store aaron salter jr the slain retired police officer who worked security at tops would help washington back to her car with the grocery orders she said the shooter whose racist attack deeply wounded east buffalo s black community has stolen much more than the neighborhood s only grocery store and the sense of peace many residents felt in the cherished community gathering spot he took away people who did for the community just because of the color of their skin it s an eye opener it s a reality check washington said just over a week ago a white gunman in body armor killed 10 black shoppers and workers at the supermarket that has been temporarily closed three others were injured in the attack which federal authorities are investigating as a hate crime long before that 18 year old avowed white supremacist allegedly inflicted terror in this community buffalo s black neighborhoods like many others around the nation had been dealing with wounds that are generations old the attack has scraped off the scab hiding black trauma and neglect that sit just below the surface in what s called the city of good neighbors residents business owners and faith leaders said healing will require not only an immediate flood of charity but also systemic solutions economic investments and mental health counseling that are long lasting they said it s been great to see the outpouring of support i must say that said jackie stover stitts co owner of golden cup coffee about a block from the tops on jefferson avenue for the past few days the atmosphere around her shop had been festival like and at times a somber space of mourning organizations from across the nation and even a few global charities offered food and other essential goods to residents who relied on tops to meet their basic needs the only concern is that it s not short lived stover stitts said it would mean more if we could see on monday that all those people with funds that came down to say how sorry they were could show it by investing in our area buffalo with a population of 255 000 that is 47 white 35 black 12 hispanic and 6 asian is one of the nation s most racially segregated cities the neighborhoods around the tops market are predominantly black and impoverished earlier in the week civil rights leader the rev al sharpton pointed to racial and socioeconomic inequality that made the tops a target for the shooter who officials say drove hundreds of miles to find black people to gun down if there wasn t but one supermarket in the black community he wouldn t have gone to tops sharpton said at a prayer vigil held in buffalo for the victims families on thursday if you can figure out how to get millions of dollars for a stadium can t you figure out how to get a supermarket sharpton added referring to a new 1 4 billion home turf planned for the buffalo bills that will be funded largely by taxpayers la tryse anderson of buffalo snug a gun violence prevention organization canvassed the neighborhood around the tops with other volunteers to get a sense of residents needs some told her they needed groceries toiletries replacement appliances and even a utility bill paid i wish i had a magic wand she said there were so many needs out here before this shooting happened without real investments in the areas that surround the tops anderson said i don t think we ll ever fully heal from this residents will definitely need the option of another supermarket as some have vowed to never set foot in that tops location again she added they are too traumatized reshawna chapple a black therapist and associate professor in the school of social work at the university of central florida said the shock and grief caused by the supermarket shooting are made worse when people are not tending to their mental health systemic racism is part of the reason why too few in the black community seek mental health counseling either on a regular basis or in the wake of tragedy she said every time something like this happens it opens up the wounds all over again chapple said we aren t taught to acknowledge feelings that are negative the ones who need help the most are definitely not going to ask for it mental health and grief counseling is why several community service organizations have been camped out around the supermarket for several days with the tops fenced off organizations such as feed buffalo ramp global missions and life camp inc lined the surrounding streets with food trucks mobile food pantries and barbecue grills serving chicken burgers and hot dogs a trio of massage therapists offered neck and back treatments to victims families and other residents a local starbucks gave out free coffee to passersby an evangelist baptized people in a large galvanized stock tank on the corner of riley street and jefferson avenue the local muslim community offered prayers and chants of we are with you near the supermarket gregory jackson jr a washington based organizer with the community justice action fund said he came to buffalo to help coordinate relief efforts to victims families and residents who were too traumatized to ask for what they need a lot of folks have not even gotten close to going back to normal life yet he said you get local police cameras and media from all over the world but the community stuck to pick up the pieces without any bigger support the supermarket shooting has also drawn support for the activists from around the nation on saturday organizers with black lives matter grassroots a national collective of chapters held a vigil for buffalo organizers from boston detroit virginia beach virginia and minneapolis attended and vowed to be with buffalo s residents as they continued to heal from the racist attack we cannot have a world that steals the lives of our grandmothers said melina abdullah who directs the blm group and founded its los angeles chapter we are duty bound to shut that down

zillionaire elon musk s glorious red pilling has predictably made him public enemy number one of the garbage ruling caste back when he was only making electric cars rocket ships and producing children with bizarre names via singers with bizarre names he was a ok in the blue zone but then he embraced radical notions like free speech and well now he s a threat a treasonous traitor of insurrection he even said he d vote republican oh how the wine women wailed instantly the regime s immune system sprung into action to purge the body politic of the truth pathogen that is elon musk advertisement his tesla stock coincidentally took a tumble but there are no coincidences i own some regime whiteboard new york times devoted the space they did not devote to robby mook s devastating testimony regarding felonia milhous von pantsuit musk recently got woke to the russiagate lies and he publicly wondered what else he was being lied to about to scoops about the apostate and of course the corrupt feds are looking into him since they have plenty of time on their hands not stopping mass killers don t be surprised if a swat team shows up to arrest him for planning to kidnap the governor of michigan and there s the sex slander it came out that musk confidentially settled a lawsuit with some bimbo and instantly he was bill clinton times gropey joe plus harvey weinstein except he s no longer liberal so suddenly liberals care about women i defend people and others in lawsuits over bogus sex claims and i can smell a rat but this is not just a rat this is a new york city alley full of them do i believe that elon whipped out his spacex love rocket to some tart no musk can get chicks the old fashioned way by having a lot of money look the guy dated amber heard and survived with his throat unslit and his linens undefiled this trollop s trumped up charges are not going to take him down the fact is that what my mother the judge told me after she swore me in as a lawyer in 1994 remains true everyone lies allegations in sex lawsuits are as reliable as jen psaki and even bullschiff claims get settled advertisement recommended but the truth is not the point obedience is they are terrified of elon musk because his money combined with his iconoclasm makes him dangerous the thought that musk would take over twitter and allow free speech thereby utterly undoing their last stranglehold on social media filled the unelite elite with a cold terror they know their ideas are garbage they can only keep power by ensuring they control the marketplace of ideas and they control it by ensuring it is not a marketplace at all but a supermax prison where wrongthink is locked away in solitary with a lonely cellmate named ox elon musk is threatening to bust their info monopoly so they will do whatever they can to break him first and they want you to know he s being broken because if the richest guy in the universe can t withstand them what hope do we peons have except musk is not backing down he s gone to the conservative medicine cabinet and gobbled a handful of red pills his twitter feed is a non stop chronicle of his ideological makeover he talks about the truths he s learned since he popped the blue bubble surrounding him he points out the hypocrisy he sees and he refuses to back down in the face of the regime s full court press it s kind of inspirational advertisement musk has announced that he s taking the next step and forming his own legal delta force under his personal command nice there s a lot of damage you can do using the courts his bat signal to hardcore ambulance chasers focused on lawyers who win at trial and trials are important but winning at trial is not optimal that s tactical thinking strategic thinking focuses on results and trials are but one way to get the result you want if you are bringing a suit trial may be the only way to get what you want money if you are defending one you want to win without trial why because in a trial you can lose you can t lose a case bringing motions to dismiss or for summary judgment you can only win in any case this is not a column on litigation theory but on how a rich guy is owning the libs and owning them he is he has gone from green demigod to reactionary demon in just a couple of months all because he took seriously the principles the progs posed with hell hath no fury like a lib disrespected and musk s insult is really the basis of this backlash musk is publicly unimpressed by the left and the mediocrities who make it up he sees they are unaccomplished he sees they are liars and he sees they are stupid in his world you have to perform the car goes vroom vroom or you go bankrupt there s no excusing the car not moving because of structural racism or the male gaze or literal shaking or any of the other crap these quarterwits kick up to obscure the truth the progs suck and their ideology is a non stop series of complaints and curated posturing musk s world is binary in an unwoke way you either do or do not their world is not about doing but about being woke sensitive whatever you are what you pose advertisement that is the antithesis of an achiever like musk s and our worldview when musk called for counsel to come to fight by his side his criteria was a proven track record of success libs would want to know where your grandpa came from how you pee and what your pronouns are they can throw everything they have at musk and will but at the end of the day they are soft and dumb he s hard and smart my money literally remains on musk conservatives must stand together and fight join townhall vip and check out last week s stream of kurtiousness i m concerned that trump is going to lose his influence and my podcast unredacted go pre order my next non fiction book we ll be back the

davos switzerland before the pandemic interrupted the ritzy gatherings of the world s political and business elites in this swiss mountain town russia occupied a central space literally anyone strolling along the main davos promenade would encounter a wooden building that if you squinted seemed sort of like a traditional dacha russia house as it was called was part of the kremlin s soft power play at the world economic forum and served as a venue for boozy cocktail parties and cheery panels on investment opportunities and tourism in russia this week as the forum convenes after a more than two year gap russian businesses and political authorities are explicitly not invited a consequence both of the western sanctions that followed the russian invasion of ukraine as well as the principled stand taken by the forum no russian oligarchs will be jetting in on their private aircraft no russian delegations will rub shoulders with their governmental counterparts at the forum s fresh juice and espresso bars advertisement meanwhile russia house has been seized by the foundation of ukrainian oligarch viktor pinchuk and converted into the russia war crimes house set to feature photographs taken in ukraine over the course of the conflict that documents evidence of rapes executions and other atrocities along with a series of discussions on russian human rights abuses 1 2 the pinchukfund rented the russian house in davos and turned it into the russia war crimes house an exhibition will be held there from 22 to 29 may with testimonies of russianwarcrimes during the brutal invasion of ukraine ukrainerussiawar pic twitter com pmurpfrf15 anton gerashchenko gerashchenko_en may 22 2022 it s a symbolic transformation that sets the stage for this week s proceedings for the first time in the forum s half century history the gathering will take place in the shadow of war between nations in europe ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky will deliver the first speech by a head of state on monday and will participate virtually in a number of other events as well from his war torn country s capital a significant ukrainian delegation will be physically present in davos including the foreign minister two deputy prime ministers five parliamentarians and the mayor of kyiv other headliners include german chancellor olaf scholz and european commission president ursula von der leyen who are both expected to speak at length on the crisis in ukraine scholz s earlier declaration that the war marked a turning point in history or zeitenwende in german is being amplified in davos with the guiding theme of this year s gathering focused squarely on how governments and businesses can grapple with history at a turning point advertisement the mood reflects a broader conviction in the west certainly in the united states that we are entering a new epoch in global politics feb 24 the date russia launched its invasion argued susan glasser in her column for the new yorker represents one of those hinge point moments that happens every decade or two a transformative event not just for ukraine and europe but for washington too american power and purpose will be redefined by putin s decision for years to come there will be a before february 24th and an after do not stop supporting ukraine iklympush tells a packed room of journalists in davos wef22 pic twitter com purm763do7 ishaan tharoor ishaantharoor may 22 2022 but there s no shortage of other crises too many of which are interlocking countries are still struggling to recover from the pandemic while vaccinations still need to be sent to some parts of the world the turbulent economic head winds spurred by the pandemic have cast a pall over global financial markets and raised fears of recession in the united states as my colleague abha bhattarai reported share this article share the war in ukraine only deepened mounting food crises across the developing world with surging prices for a slate of commodities leading to fuel and grain shortages in countries as disparate as tunisia and sri lanka advertisement the return of war epidemics and the climate crisis all those disruptive forces have derailed the global recovery klaus schwab the forum s founder and executive chairman said in a briefing with journalists last week those issues must be confronted in davos the global food crisis in particular needs our immediate attention as is its wont the forum will try to focus on proactive and positive solutions to these challenges it sees itself as an indispensable vehicle for collaboration between policymakers and the private sector the annual gathering which because of the pandemic is taking place unusually in springtime gets routinely pilloried by its critics as an elitist talkshop on the mountain avant ski that caricature often obscures the rather genuine commitments and efforts made by the forum s participants and organizers including projects to help upskill hundreds of millions of workers in the global economy and a major initiative launched in partnership with u s climate envoy john f kerry that aims to decarbonize the supply chains of some of the world s biggest companies last year the forum framed its programming around the recovery from the pandemic as the great reset suggesting that the global experience of the coronavirus presented a narrow window for governments and businesses to reimagine and reset our world as schwab put it advertisement the initiative was an attempt to put policymakers in a positive frame of mind adrian monck a managing director of the forum told me but it also stoked a backlash among the western far right who linked the idea of the great reset to a baseless conspiracy theory about global elites planning the pandemic to impose new systems of control on the population

canadian subsidiary sayona quebec which is owned by sayona mining asx sya 75 and piedmont lithium asx pll 25 highlights positive pre feasibility study pfs shows value of north american lithium nal operation in quebec canada confirming technical and financial viability over 27 year life of mine pre tax net present value npv 8 discount estimated at approx a 1 billion with pre tax internal rate of return irr of 140 and capital payback within two years modest capex for nal restart of approx a 100m with upgrades to improve operational efficiency grade quality and recovery long lead equipment already ordered to facilitate q1 2023 restart results confirm potential for abitibi lithium hub adding to emerging northern hub and facilitating downstream processing as company bolsters leading position in north american lithium industry forming the key part of sayona s abitibi lithium hub comprising nal and the nearby authier lithium project the restored nal operation and the authier deposit together with the company s emerging northern quebec hub comprise north america s largest lithium spodumene resource base this will allow sayona to launch production ahead of other north american projects generating sustainable cash flows and putting the company on a fast track to go downstream into value added lithium hydroxide or carbonate production quebec is rapidly emerging as a leader in the battery sector benefitting from its clean and sustainable hydropower world class infrastructure and proximity to market at nal the overriding development objective is for the restart of production with the benefit of supplementary ore feed from sayona quebec s syq wholly owned authier lithium project located just 30 km from the nal site initially nal will produce a lithium concentrate for general market conversion however nal will become a primary feed source for syq s integrated downstream refined lithium products sayona s managing director brett lynch said the pfs showed the company s ability to quickly transform the nal operation to generate a successful turnaround in performance and allow a customised feed source for the planned lithium conversion facility at nal sayona s acquisition of nal and turnaround plan was not based simply on restarting the existing operation rather it was based on our strategy of creating an abitibi lithium hub drawing upon the operation of our nearby authier project and investing in plant upgrades to deliver improved profitability and performance mr lynch said we have been modest with our pricing assumptions but as the sensitivity analysis indicates there is potential for significant upside in the npv projection given recent trends in spodumene prices accordingly the project partners have already pre ordered long lead equipment items in anticipation of a positive study result ensuring we are ready for start up in q1 2023 he added with an estimated npv of around 1 billion australian dollars low capex of about a 100m our fast speed to production and a lengthy 27 year life of mine this is a unique opportunity for sayona adding to our rapidly growing northern quebec hub as the leading lithium spodumene resource base in north america i look forward to driving this project forward as we move towards becoming north america s first local producer of spodumene next year notably there are several options to move downstream including completing the existing carbonate plant at nal which would provide for a low capex and accelerated pathway to market key results and assumptions key outcomes of the pfs include an estimated pre tax npv of c 952 million a 1 05 billion as at 23 may 2022 8 discount rate a pre tax irr of 140 and capital payback period within two years the life of mine has been extended to 27 years based on an estimated jorc proved and probable ore reserves of 29 2 mt 0 96 li2o proved reserve 1 2mt 0 92 li2o and probable reserve 28 0mt 0 96 li2o the above includes conservative allowances for non or low mineralised diluted material from the upper and lower contact of the pegmatite mining horizon sayona will implement a rom run of mine ore stockpile management system whereby diluted material lower grade ore and higher grade feed will be segregated and managed via a stockpile management plan to ensure consistent feed to the plant this will allow for production campaigns of similar material providing the concentrate plant sufficient feed stock to maximise product recovery and grade mr lynch added in doubling the expected mine life due to the expanded resource base at nal forecast tailings volumes on site significantly increased sayona has taken the proactive decision to dry stack tailings reducing their environmental impact in a move reflective of the company s esg focus this initiative requires detailed engineering to reach definitive feasibility study dfs standard in the meantime we plan on releasing an updated feasibility study for our authier project later in q2 further demonstrating the value of our abitibi lithium hub following sayona s acquisition of the nal mine and concentrator in la corne quebec in august 2021 the project revision process was initiated upon completion of the acquisition and the provision of historical geological mining and process data the data reviewed allowed for the update of the ore reserves estimate and increased concentrator

bloomberg broadcom inc could announce an agreement to acquire cloud computing company vmware inc as soon as this week according to people familiar with the matter setting up a blockbuster tech deal that would vault the chipmaker into a highly specialized area of software most read from bloomberg advertisement advertisement the offer is likely to be mostly in the form of stock but would include a large cash element said one of the people who asked not to be identified because the matter isn t public financing for the transaction is in place the person added vmware backed by billionaire michael dell currently has a market valuation of about 50 3 billion the takeover discussions are ongoing and there s also still no guarantee that the talks will lead to an agreement representatives for the two companies didn t immediately respond to requests for comment the wall street journal reported that the bid could be around 140 a share or 60 billion an acquisition at that price implies a price to earnings ratio of at least 17 and that s consistent with recent software deals according to bloomberg intelligence analyst woo jin ho shares in vmware rose 25 to 119 43 on monday in new york after bloomberg news first reported that the talks were underway that was the biggest one day gain since 2007 broadcom which has a valuation of about 215 billion fell 3 1 to 526 36 a deal for vmware would rank among the biggest ever acquisitions of a technology company the industry has been one of the bright spots for bankers in recent months even as the overall pace of dealmaking slows from 2021 s record pace takeovers of technology companies globally are up 46 this year to 263 billion according to data compiled by bloomberg the tally was buoyed by microsoft corp s agreement in january to buy video game publisher activision blizzard inc for 69 billion a consortium backed by vista equity partners is acquiring software maker citrix systems inc for 13 billion while elon musk announced a 44 billion deal for twitter inc last month the transaction would extend a run of acquisitions for broadcom chief executive officer hock tan who has built one of the largest and most diversified companies in the chip industry software has been a key focus in recent years with broadcom buying ca technologies in 2018 and symantec corp s enterprise security business in 2019 story continues read more dell becomes kingmaker in broadcom vmware deal in march tan told analysts on a post earnings call broadcom had the capacity for a good size acquisition investors have been increasingly focused on broadcom s appetite for another strategic or platform enterprise software acquisition especially given the recent compression in software valuation wells fargo analysts wrote after the bloomberg report an acquisition of vmware would be considered as making strategic sense consistent with broadcom s focus on building out a deepening enterprise infrastructure software strategy structuring the broadcom offer as mostly stock will let vmware shareholders participate in the upside from the substantial synergies that the deal is expected to yield the person familiar with the situation said even without factoring in synergies the transaction could boost earnings by 5 to 10 bloomberg intelligence s ho said in a report monday advertisement advertisement broadcom makes a wide range of electronics with its products going into everything from the iphone to industrial equipment data centers in particular are a vital source of growth and bulking up on software gives the company more ways to target that market vmware makes virtual software that allows users to access systems remotely the companies don t have overlapping products but are often used together to manage data centers broadcom has faced antitrust scrutiny over its contracts requiring equipment makers to use its chips in set top boxes and broadband internet devices the company settled with european competition authorities in 2020 and with the us federal trade commission last year the information reported last month that the ftc is again looking into broadcom s use of agreements that require companies to use its hardware exclusively given broadcom s history antitrust regulators would be likely to probe whether a deal with vmware would give the combined company greater leverage to demand exclusivity with customers broadcom was previously in talks to acquire sas institute inc a closely held software company valued at 15 billion to 20 billion but those discussions ended last year without a deal tan also was thwarted in his biggest takeover attempt of them all a bid to buy rival chipmaker qualcomm inc he had to walk away from that deal in 2018 after broadcom encountered resistance from the trump administration one concern was broadcom s singapore headquarters and the company has since switched its domicile to the us it s now based in san jose california about 20 miles from vmware s palo alto headquarters vmware founded in 1998 is a pioneering silicon valley company that has already changed hands more than once it invented so called virtualization software which consolidated applications and workloads on a smaller number of server computers by using each server to handle more than one program but as more tasks moved to the cloud vmware struggled to keep up growth and carve out a key role for itself the company eventually forged a close partnership with amazon com inc one of the biggest providers of cloud storage and services vmware was acquired by storage technology giant emc corp in 2004 that company then sold a portion of its stake as part of vmware s initial public offering three years later the business passed to dell technologies inc when that company acquired emc in 2016 vmware then spun off from dell last year advertisement advertisement michael dell and private equity firm silver lake remain top investors in vmware according to data compiled by bloomberg software would help decrease broadcom s reliance on chips but its previous forays into that market haven t always been applauded by investors tan has argued that he looks for businesses that are franchises ones that hold a strong market position and can be made more profitable without pouring in huge investments shares of broadcom and vmware had both slid roughly 18 this year through the end of last week hurt by a broader rout but they haven t been hit as hard as many tech stocks the philadelphia stock exchange semiconductor index is down 27 this year chipmakers like broadcom have enjoyed booming sales in recent years fueled by the spread of semiconductors into more products as well as by the need for work from home technology during the pandemic but tan has warned that the boom times probably won t last even after giving an upbeat sales forecast in march tan said that the semiconductor industry won t be able to stay on its current trajectory he expects the chip business to decelerate to historical growth rates of about 5 if anyone tells you otherwise don t believe it because it has never happened he said on a conference call at the time industry leaders claiming that

the calf canyon hermits peak fire which has devastated new mexico s northeastern mora and san miguel counties since last month is expected to worsen after two days of moderated winds and weather conditions allowed firefighters to slow its spread forecasters issued warnings that starting may 19 high fire danger would exist from southern nevada through parts of arizona new mexico and colorado and would last for at least three days the destruction from the calf canyon hermits peak fire now categorized as the largest fire in the state s history has been horrendous over 303 000 acres have been burnt and at least 340 homes and 275 other buildings in mora and san miguel counties have been destroyed projections of the total loss of buildings range from 1 000 to 1 500 the fire is the worst of several blazes scorching the state in the north central area just 25 miles west of the state capital santa fe the cerro pelado fire has consumed nearly 46 000 acres it is now considered 75 percent contained the black fire in gila national forest in the southwest has consumed 93 000 acres since it flared up on may 13 the bear trap fire north of the black fire has burned about 105 000 acres the containment level of these two wildfires is zero percent authorities have closed some public recreation areas the carson and santa fe national forests as well as the pecos canyon state park all in the north have been shut until further notice due to extreme fire danger in the central part of the state the cibola national forest and national grasslands west of albuquerque are partially closed to the public the calf canyon fire was the result of a botched prescribed burn carried out by the forest service on april 19 once it got out of control it merged with the hermits peak fire which had been raging since april 6 as of may 19 the calf canyon hermits peak fire was reported as 34 percent contained though continued aridity and gusty winds could negatively affect containment on may 19 the forest service released its first full statement about the combined blaze which said before ignitions ever take place on the landscape planning happens years before landscapes are analyzed for prescribed fire treatments and the effects on vegetation hydrology threatened and endangered species and human social impacts standard operating procedures to authorize prescribed fires include developing and coordinating a burn plan site preparation public notifications weather and forecast monitoring and validation before a decision is made to go ahead according to the statement in rare circumstances conditions change and prescribed burns move outside the planned project area and become wildfires in 99 84 percent of the cases prescribed fires go as planned the forest service conducts about a hundred prescribed fires each year in the southwest and has only seen 2 escape containment since 2011 with the hermits peak fire being the 3rd the forest service promised to complete an internal declared wildfire review by mid june and will identify and communicate the next steps when the report is finalized although most of these wildfires had begun in april it was not until may 4 that the biden white house declared a state of emergency making funding available to affected individuals for temporary housing and home repairs low cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster in the five most affected counties the declaration continued federal funding also is available to state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost sharing basis for emergency protective measures category b limited to direct federal assistance and reimbursement for mass care including evacuation and shelter support in the counties of colfax lincoln mora san miguel and valencia lastly federal funding is also available on a cost sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide about 2 100 firefighters have been deployed to the region and they have been frantically installing portable sprinkler systems in inhabited areas while helicopters have brought loads of water to the fire line and bulldozers have carved paths in the ground to block the fire not only is the response of the administration a stark example of too little too late it is an indictment of decades of willful neglect and refusal to heed warnings from scientists about the likelihood of extreme weather events brought on by human produced climate change years of defunding of necessary systems have exacerbated the crisis the southwest is in the grip of its worst drought in centuries in the first week of may more than 98 percent of the southwest was in drought and with the exception of washington state reservoir storage levels were below normal in all western states in march the national oceanic and atmospheric administration predicted prolonged persistent drought in the west where below average precipitation is most likely climate change and extreme weather are not confined to the american southwest or to the united states as with the covid 19 pandemic environmental degradation affects every nation and every person on earth natural disasters have always been a part of the planet s history but in recent years human activity has played a greater and greater role in the occurrence and severity of floods storms fires droughts and other extreme weather events the human race is now in a situation that requires planning preparation and international cooperation to lessen and if possible reverse their impact as the world socialist web site declared last august for the capitalist class however stopping civilization ending cataclysms is far less important than preserving their profits as has been the case for decades exxonmobil bp and other major fossil fuel corporations as well as the hedge funds and wall street banks that own their stocks are most concerned that coal oil and gas continue to be mined and sold to further enrich themselves and their fellow oligarchs if earth will be poisoned and burned in that pursuit so be it

recreational cannabis is now legal in 19 states and washington d c driving the growth of legal cannabis sales estimated at 33 billion this year up 32 from 2021 and expected to reach 52 billion by 2026 1 this movement signals that financial investment in cannabis is not abating but accelerating notwithstanding the impact of the lingering covid 19 pandemic this growth in the cannabis industry of course also means that operators and their investment partners face commercial risk including insolvency it has however become axiomatic that cannabis companies are barred from relief under the u s bankruptcy code 2 a line of court opinions in fact has held that cannabis companies cannot seek a chapter 11 restructuring or chapter 7 liquidation the reasoning is stated simply marijuana is a schedule 1 controlled substance under the federal controlled substances act the csa 3and therefore it is illegal under federal law to manufacture distribute or disperse or possess with intent to manufacture distribute or dispense a controlled substance 4 notwithstanding any contrary state law given its criminalized acts a marijuana business that intends to continue to operate as such cannot propose a chapter 11 plan of reorganization in good faith which has led bankruptcy courts to routinely dismiss such cases for cause pursuant to section 1112 b 1 of the bankruptcy code 5 nor can cannabis companies avail themselves of chapter 7 as any appointed bankruptcy trustee would then be required to sell marijuana and marijuana related assets of the liquidating company and in so doing violate federal law 6 compare this to canada in canada the federal cannabis act 2018 legalized cannabis nationwide while the provinces maintain certain regulatory powers related to the distribution sale and use of cannabis for cross border cannabis operators then a potential avenue for bankruptcy relief is for the company to first commence an insolvency proceeding in canada and then seek recognition of that foreign proceeding in a u s bankruptcy court under chapter 15 of the bankruptcy code upon recognition as a foreign main proceeding the automatic stay the power to continue to operate the debtors business and a number of other bankruptcy protections become available to that debtor company regarding assets located in the united states 7 if a bankruptcy judge determines that the canadian proceeding is non main rather than main the rights provided in the foreign proceeding are not automatically available but may still be requested by the foreign representative and granted at the bankruptcy judge s discretion 8 while direct access to bankruptcy relief in the united states remains closed to cannabis and cannabis adjacent companies chapter 15 could potentially open the proverbial side door i e the company first seeks insolvency protection in canada and then seeks recognition of the canadian proceeding in the u s bankruptcy court that s because chapter 15 sidesteps the hurdles that have historically barred bankruptcy relief to cannabis companies in a chapter 15 no bankruptcy estate is created that a chapter 7 trustee must administer and no chapter 11 plan of reorganization is proposed nor are traditional grounds for dismissal in a chapter 11 or 7 proceeding such as bad faith applicable in a chapter 15 proceeding 9 that said a cannabis company s access to chapter 15 may turn on whether a bankruptcy court invokes the so called public policy exception which while very rarely invoked allows a court to abstain from acting under chapter 15 if doing so would be manifestly contrary to u s public policy 10 the public policy exception is found in section 1506 of the bankruptcy code and reads nothing in this chapter prevents the court from refusing to take an action governed by this chapter if the action would be manifestly contrary to the public policy of the united states 11 courts have concluded that congress use of the word manifestly substantially limits the exception s scope to the most fundamental policies of the united states 12 accordingly courts applying the public policy exception have read it narrowly and applied it sparingly 13 in order to determine whether an action is manifestly contrary to u s public policy courts ask two questions i whether the foreign proceeding is procedurally unfair and ii whether recognition of the foreign proceeding would severely impinge a constitutional or statutory right or frustrate a bankruptcy court s ability to carry out the fundamental purpose of such constitutional or statutory right 14 most courts that have considered public policy arguments have declined to apply the exception in fact bankruptcy courts administering chapter 15 have only invoked the public policy exception four times 15 moreover case law on this issue reveals three salient points which should be important to cannabis operators first the existence of a conflict between foreign and u s law is a prerequisite to applying the public policy exception second even if the relief sought in a chapter 15 petition gives rise to a violation of a criminal statute it is not clear that such violation alone would trigger application of the public policy exception and third once a bankruptcy court grants recognition of a foreign proceeding the court s subsequent denial of requested relief based on the public policy exception does not nullify recognition theoretically keeping the door open to other bankruptcy relief first not all chapter 15 relief and the protection that the foreign debtor needs is created equal how narrowly a cannabis operator tailors the relief it seeks through its chapter 15 proceeding will likely determine whether the requisite ex anteconflict with u s law exists 16 for example a chapter 15 proceeding that merely seeks the protection of the automatic stay to bar collection activity against a cannabis company s property and assets in the u s arguably does not give rise to a violation of the csa 17 without a conflict with u s law no public policy inquiry is triggered this means that cannabis operators should carefully analyze the prohibited acts contained in the csa to determine whether the relief sought in their chapter 15 petition gives rise to a conflict with u s law even if relief sought in the chapter 15 petition would result in a violation under the csa for example if the foreign representative seeks authority to liquidate a cannabis operators inventory and repatriate the proceeds back to the foreign jurisdiction free and clear of liens claims and encumbrances for distribution to creditors under a foreign scheme of arrangement it is possible that a bankruptcy court may not automatically conclude that this statutory conflict is manifestly contrary to u s public policy 18as precedent informs us that the analysis needs to consider whether the relief would severely impinge a constitutional or statutory right or frustrate a bankruptcy court s ability to carry out the most fundamental policies and purposes of such constitutional or statutory right 19 in 2011 the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of new york in toft demonstrated this relationship the case involved an orthopedic surgeon who had sought bankruptcy relief under the german insolvency code during the german proceeding the debtor refused to cooperate with the administrator by hiding assets and purportedly relocating them to some unknown country outside of europe in accordance with what was understood to be common practice in germany the german court entered a mail interception order authorizing the foreign representative as administrator of the debtor s estate to intercept the debtor s postal and electronic mail the foreign representative then initiated a chapter 15 petition in new york and asked the bankruptcy court to recognize and enforce the mail interception order that would empower the representative to intercept and monitor the debtor s mail the new york bankruptcy court denied recognition of the german proceeding based on the public policy exception explaining that the relief sought would result in criminal liability under the wire tap act and directly compromise privacy rights subject to comprehensive scheme of statutory protection available to aliens built on constitutional safeguards incorporated into the fourth amendment as well as the constitution of many states 20 in the case of cross border cannabis it is not readily apparent that there is any constitutional or statutory right the csa ultimately seeks to safeguard perhaps the csa seeks to protect the public health from the dangers of controlled substances 21 and one could imply a statutory right to one s health and wellbeing however bankruptcy courts have yet to extend the public policy exception to such implied rights finally courts that have exercised the public policy exception in the context of an application for relief after entry of the recognition order have declined to revisit prior court orders granting recognition for example in qimonda ag the bankruptcy court for the eastern district of virginia had already recognized the chapter 15 proceeding before denying the foreign representatives requests for subsequent relief on public policy grounds qimonda was a german producer of computer microchips prior to its insolvency qimonda had entered into a series of cross licensing agreements with various international electronics companies allowing them to use its u s patents to manufacture and sell semiconductors in the u s and abroad in 2009 qimonda commenced insolvency proceedings in germany and soon thereafter filed a petition for chapter 15 recognition in the virginia bankruptcy court after holding a hearing on the petition the bankruptcy court issued an order recognizing the german proceeding as a foreign main proceeding and a second order granting discretionary relief to qimonda including section 365 n of the bankruptcy code which provides third party ip licensees the option to retain its rights under the license shortly after entry of these orders the foreign representative filed a motion seeking to eliminate the protections of section 365 n to conform with the german insolvency code and allow the debtor foreign representative to reject patent cross licenses the bankruptcy court ultimately denied the motion concluding that to except the application of section 365 n under the circumstances of the case would severely impinge an important statutory protection accorded licenses of u s patents and thereby undermine a fundamental u s public policy promoting technological innovation 22 notably in invoking the public policy exception as a basis to deny the additional relief requested the bankruptcy court did not reconsider its recognition of the foreign proceeding the automatic stay and other provisions of the bankruptcy code remained in place this and the preceding observations suggest that recognition under chapter 15 may not be wholly fantastical for insolvent cross border cannabis operators and that upon scaling the hurdle of recognition denial of certain relief under the public policy exception does not foreclose all bankruptcy relief accessible through chapter 15 chapter 15 is based on principles of comity i e giving recognition of and deference to a foreign ruling largely based on efficiency international cooperation and collaboration as the global trend towards legalizing recreational cannabis continues it is likely just a matter of time that a cross border cannabis company will seek chapter 15 recognition of its foreign insolvency relief and will unwittingly test the value of comity against the limits of the public policy exception footnotes 1 see 10

it was a nascar all star race that won t be remembered as a classic and for winner ryan blaney it almost went in the record books as an upset loss blaney outran denny hamlin who was racing with fresher tires and his team penske teammate austin cindric in a two lap overtime to score his first all star victory pocketing 1 million sunday night at texas motor speedway blaney rocketed to a three second lead in the fourth and final stage of the race and was cruising to an easy win but his victory was delayed when nascar threw the caution flag an instant before he crossed the finish line first in regulation ricky stenhouse jr had hit the wall on the last lap ah the good ol days nascar all star race is not what it used to be blaney and virtually everybody else at the track thought he had won the race at that moment he went so far as to drop the window net on his car so the celebration could begin but nascar bunched the field for a restart the rules for the race call for it to end under green flag conditions blaney s challengers had a second chance but he powered away from them quickly and won by 26 of a second over hamlin blaney was not able to reattach the window net and officials allowed him to hold it in place for the two lap run to the finish this didn t sit well with hamlin who said after the race that nascar rules call for the net to be attached sean gardner getty images ryan blaney takes the checkered flag at texas on sunday night blaney was simply relieved to keep first place despite the last second caution and the drama with the window net everyone thought the race was over he said i already had my window net down i want to thank nascar for letting us kind of fix it then i had to do it all over again for the first 47 laps the race belonged to kyle busch he led every lap and seemed invincible setting a precedent for a night in which there was little serious competition at the front of the field the first stage 25 laps was uneventful as busch sailed away from the rest of the field the lack of action drew the attention of dale earnhardt jr who tweeted stage 1 was about as fun as a rice cake the calm disappeared in stage two and busch was the main victim a

second stage and joey logano s crew won the pit crew competition after the stage to earn 100 000 and a third place starting spot for logano in the final stage blaney won the third stage and was easily the class of the part of the field that remained he had no competition in the final stage until the night s final caution almost cost him what appeared to be certain victory more from texas motor

a us military airplane transported 75 000 pounds of imported baby formula from ramstein air base in germany to indianapolis indiana on sunday amid the catastrophic nationwide shortage crisis of infant food in america crew members of an air force c 17 unload a plane load of baby formula at the indianapolis international airport in indianapolis sunday may 22 2022 the batch of baby formula which was trucked from switzerland to germany is the first shipment flown into the us from europe as part of the biden administration s emergency operation fly formula the department of agriculture said on saturday that additional flights will be announced in the coming days the corporate media is doing its best to present the arrival of three brands of powdered formula that are hypoallergenic as a significant measure to address the crisis for example cnn has been broadcasting over and over again for hours its video footage of 132 pallets being taken off the military c 17 cargo plane by servicemen driving forklifts and loading them onto fedex trucks however the amount of formula in the shipment from germany will make just 500 000 eight ounce bottles of baby food and does not even begin to address the magnitude of the crisis according to agriculture secretary tom vilsack the biden administration s operation fly formula shipment will feed a few thousand children for just one week meanwhile there are approximately 1 2 million babies that get their formula through the federal government s special supplemental nutrition program for women infants and children wic the dire conditions facing families from the crisis are beginning to emerge in news reports cnn reported that a doctor at le bonheur children s hospital in memphis tennessee said that two young patients were admitted because the special formula they need is out of stock and they cannot tolerate replacements the cnn report also said that clinical dietitians at medical university of south carolina shawn jenkins children s hospital in charleston reported that at least four babies were recently hospitalized for complications related to the ongoing formula shortage three of the four babies were hospitalized due to intolerance to formula that they had been fed by parents because of the shortages the other child became sick when a caregiver attempted to mix their own formula according to the data tracking firm datasembly nearly 45 percent of baby formula products were unavailable in the us for the week ending may 15 up from 43 percent the previous week on thursday us food and drug administration fda commissioner robert califf told the house appropriations committee that families should get relief soon due to increased output from manufacturers and the military deliveries when pressed califf said that the crisis would get better gradually and it will be a few weeks before we are back to normal but formula manufacturers and retailers say that it could take months for supplies to recover because the reasons for the crisis remain unresolved baby formula shortages started as early as 2020 when the pandemic began and supply chains were disrupted shipping delays and longer lead times for raw materials and packaging multiplied and compounded upon each other causing limited supplies on retail shelves across the us over the past two years then in february of this year abbott labs was forced to halt operations at its biggest factory in sturgis michigan which is responsible for one fifth of all us baby formula production the 200 billion medical devices and health care company which makes the popular similac baby formula product has previously refused to acknowledge that its factory was contaminated with bacteria and responsible for illness and death among infants that were fed with its products on saturday the washington post published a perfunctory corporate speak apology from robert ford chairman and ceo of abbott labs that said the fda had found a bacteria in our plant but that there was not any connection between our products and the four reported illness in children ford did reveal that some children have been hospitalized because of the lack of elecare a specialized formula for children who cannot digest other formulas and milks although he said that this is tragic and heartbreaking ford did not offer any immediate solutions to the catastrophic situation other than to say it is consuming my thoughts and those of my colleagues instead ford said we wish we could provide them the formula they need today and are working to identify ways to do so and we will prioritize elecare when manufacturing resumes the conclusion of ford s statement emphasized the consent decree between abbott labs and the biden administration to reopen the michigan production facility the consent decree issued by the us justice department on may 16 concludes the government investigation into the role of abbott labs in producing a contaminated product in exchange for the reopening of its baby formula factory the agreement amounts to corporate blackmail in which abbott labs avoids prosecution and admission of guilt even though fda testing found cronobacter bacteria at the sturgis factory because of the supply shortage crisis whatever the phony expressions of concern from ceo ford the fact is that abbott labs has been preoccupied with the megaprofits it has been earning from pandemic related products and abandoned any investment or development of the less lucrative baby formula operations john wallingford a former baby formula executive and now an industry consultant told the wall street journal that the largest baby food manufacturers also make higher profit medical devices and health care products wallingford told the journal companies that manufacture infant formula have to struggle to get investment for upgrading or building a new facility because they re competing with dollars that will go to other higher margin products the baby formula supply crisis in the us and the government response to it are clear expressions of the breakdown of the capitalist system millions of families are struggling to feed their newborn babies infants and toddlers because profits come before human life in america as has been demonstrated throughout the coronavirus pandemic in a society that is run by billionaire elites such as those who control the 35 billion international pediatric nutrition industry their stock portfolios and wealth accumulation are more important than the lives of millions of working class people
