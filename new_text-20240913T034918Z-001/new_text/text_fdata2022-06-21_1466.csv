jetblue nasdaq jblu today announced that it has submitted a decisively superior proposal to the board of directors of spirit nyse save to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of spirit the further improved proposal which was submitted at the request of spirit s board and following completion of jetblue s diligence review and discussions with spirit s management team is an update to jetblue s previous proposals dated march 29 2022 april 29 2022 and june 6 2022 respectively and is structured to maximize value and certainty for spirit and its stockholders with terms including increased price of 33 50 per spirit share jetblue s proposal continues to offer spirit stockholders a superior all cash premium the increased price of 33 50 per spirit share represents an improvement of 2 00 per share or 6 3 compared to jetblue s june 6 proposal and a 67 6 1 premium to the implied value of the frontier transaction as of june 17 2022 stronger divestiture commitment jetblue s june 20 proposal includes a significant enhancement to its prior proposals through an obligation to divest assets of jetblue and spirit up to a material adverse effect on the combined jetblue spirit with a limited carve out to this divestiture obligation for actions that would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the anticipated benefits under jetblue s northeast alliance this commitment significantly increases the divestitures jetblue would be willing to commit to making in order to obtain regulatory approval and meaningfully exceeds the divestiture commitment from frontier in addition to the improved terms the proposal continues to include commitments from previous proposals that were well received by spirit stockholders reverse break up fee jetblue would continue to offer a reverse break up fee of 350 million or 3 20 per spirit share2 payable to spirit in the unlikely event the transaction is not consummated for antitrust reasons this represents an increase of 100 million or 0 91 per spirit share compared to the reverse break up fee frontier agreed to on june 2 accelerated prepayment of 1 50 per share jetblue would prepay 1 50 per share in cash to spirit stockholders promptly following the spirit stockholder vote approving the combination between spirit and jetblue as a result spirit stockholders would receive total aggregate consideration of 33 50 per share in cash comprised of 32 00 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction and the prepayment of 1 50 per share in cash divesture commitment in new york and boston jetblue s proposal continues to include a proactive offer to the u s department of justice of a remedy package that contemplates the divestiture of all spirit assets located in new york and boston so as a result of the transaction jetblue will not increase its presence in the airports covered by the northeast alliance as well as gates and related assets at fort lauderdale after discussions with the spirit team last week and further due diligence review we are more convinced than ever that a jetblue spirit transaction would create a true national competitor to the big four and deliver value to all of our stakeholders said robin hayes chief executive officer jetblue together we will deliver lower fares and a better experience to more customers our previous proposal was met with an extremely positive reaction from spirit stockholders and we believe they will be even more pleased with these improved terms including additional regulatory commitments that reflect our confidence in our ability to obtain antitrust approval and are a direct result of our diligence we are ready to move quickly to reach a merger agreement bringing more value to shareholders more competition to the industry and more opportunities including jetblue s incredibly strong culture and commitments to our crewmembers as we welcome spirit team members into the jetblue family jetblue sent a letter to the board of directors of spirit containing its improved proposal the full letter follows june 20 2022 dear members of the board on behalf of jetblue airways corporation jetblue we would like to thank your team for the recent discussions the dialogue and information provided strengthened our conviction that a combination between jetblue and spirit airlines inc spirit would create a true national competitor to the dominant legacy carriers delivering low fares and a great experience for more customers more opportunities for crewmembers and team members and more value for stockholders therefore we are submitting a further update to our previous proposals dated march 29 2022 april 29 2022 and june 6 2022 respectively consistent with your board s request and following completion of our due diligence review to acquire all of the outstanding common stock of spirit our improved proposal in addition we included a revised draft of the merger agreement for the transaction reflecting the terms of our improved proposal our improved proposal is structured to maximize value and execution certainty for spirit and its stockholders and is responsive to the concerns you previously raised we firmly believe our improved proposal constitutes a decisively superior proposal as defined in the frontier agreement3 terms of improved proposal coupled with our june 6 proposal our improved proposal clearly offers spirit stockholders significantly more than the transaction with frontier increased price of 33 50 per spirit share of common stock in cash which represents an improvement of 2 00 per share or 6 3 compared to our june 6 proposal and represents 9 2 of spirit s unaffected share price4 a 57 4 premium to spirit s closing share price of 21 28 on june 17 2022 a 67 6 premium to the implied value of the frontier transaction which was 19 99 as of june 17 2022 and a total equity value for spirit of 3 7 billion and an enterprise value of 7 5 billion5 of common stock in cash which represents stronger regulatory commitment which includes an express obligation to litigate and to divest assets of jetblue and spirit up to a material adverse effect on the combined jetblue spirit with a limited carve out to this divestiture obligation for actions that would be reasonably likely to materially and adversely affect the anticipated benefits under jetblue s northeast alliance this commitment significantly enhances our prior proposal and meaningfully exceeds the divestiture commitment from frontier a proactive offer to the department of justice of a remedy package that contemplates the divestiture of all spirit assets located in new york and boston so as a result of the transaction jetblue will not increase its presence in the airports covered by our northeast alliance as well as gates and related assets at fort lauderdale which includes a reverse break up fee of 350 million or 3 20 per spirit share6 payable to spirit in the unlikely event the transaction is not consummated for antitrust reasons representing 100 million or 0 91 per spirit share more than the reverse break up fee spirit and frontier agreed to on june 2 and approximately 15 of spirit s unaffected share price7 and approximately 78 of the original premium offered by frontier8 or 3 20 per spirit share6 payable to spirit in the unlikely event the transaction is not consummated for antitrust reasons representing a prepayment in the amount of 1 50 per share in cash payable to spirit stockholders promptly following the spirit stockholder vote approving the combination between spirit and jetblue in the unlikely event the reverse break up fee is payable this upfront payment would reduce the payment to spirit at the time of the termination of the merger agreement to approximately 186 million 1 70 per share9 payable to spirit stockholders promptly following the spirit stockholder vote approving the combination between spirit and jetblue in the unlikely event the reverse break up fee is payable this upfront payment would reduce the payment to spirit at the time of the termination of the merger agreement to approximately 186 million 1 70 per share9 as a result spirit stockholders would receive total aggregate consideration of 33 50 per share in cash comprised of 32 00 per share in cash at the closing of the transaction and the prepayment of 1 50 per share in cash as has been the case since our initial proposal on march 29 when compared to the inferior frontier transaction our improved proposal offers spirit stockholders the compelling opportunity to receive a significant premium in cash in a transaction with more value and more certainty and stronger regulatory commitments and with the prepayment of a portion of the aggregate merger consideration as we have proposed more value upfront it is unambiguously a superior proposal we are confident your stockholders will embrace our improved proposal as they have done with our previous ones we are also confident our proposal is better for customers delivering more of our unique combination of low fares and great service to customers nationwide and better for spirit team members with higher pay and better benefits than either spirit or frontier exciting career development opportunities and jetblue s incredibly strong culture and set of values which include never having furloughed any crewmembers in our 22 year history as well as industry leading sustainability commitments as you know we have dedicated a full team significant management time and advisor resources to the evaluation of spirit and have finally been given the opportunity to conduct a review of spirit s business and operations we have completed our due diligence and our improved proposal is a direct result of that process we are now prepared to move expeditiously to execute definitive documentation while our strong preference is to reach a friendly negotiated agreement with you should the spirit board fail to declare our improved proposal a superior proposal we fully intend to continue our vote no campaign against the frontier transaction at your special meeting on june 30 as well as our tender offer we look forward to hearing from you soon and hope to finally move towards signing of definitive documentation for our superior transaction clearly the optimal outcome for spirit stockholders sincerely s robin hayes chief executive officer advisors goldman sachs co llc is serving as jetblue s financial advisor and shearman sterling llp is serving as jetblue s legal advisor

david paul morris bloomberg via getty images washington as top white house officials reiterate that tackling high inflation remains president joe biden s chief priority his administration is debating strategies to bring prices down and sending mixed signals about how and how quickly biden may act on an issue that is top of mind for voters and weighing on his approval ratings the president said monday he could make a decision as soon as this week on whether to support congress instituting a pause on the federal gas tax of 18 4 cents per gallon which experts have estimated could lower prices by approximately 14 72 cents per gallon treasury secretary janet yellen said on sunday that the administration was open to considering such a move citing the cost on consumers as of monday the national average gas price was 4 98 per gallon gas prices have risen a great deal and it s clearly burdening households yellen said during an appearance on this week with george stephanopoulos so stands ready to work with congress and an idea that s certainly worth considering but yellen s counterpart at the department of energy seemingly disagreed with that notion in her own appearance sunday part of the challenge with the gas tax of course is that it funds the roads energy secretary jennifer granholm said on cnn e just did a big infrastructure bill to help fund the roads so if we do if we remove the gas tax that takes away the funding that was just passed by congress to be able to do that that s one of the challenges but i m not saying that that s off the table granholm said a gas tax holiday would require approval from congress where democrats hold a fragile majority house speaker nancy pelosi has previously spoken skeptically of the idea saying it was possibly better pr than policy biden told reporters on monday that as another relief measure gas rebate cards were also under deliberation that s part of what we re considering he said when asked that s part of the whole operation it s unclear however how such rebate cards would work whether they would be pre loaded or provide rebates post purchase a recession isn t guaranteed white house administration officials are united on one point a recession is not inevitable they have all said there s nothing inevitable about a recession biden said monday yellen granholm and national economic council director brian deese likewise all used variations of that language during their sunday show appearances there s a lot of things about the economy right now that are unique deese said americans are spending less money on goods they re spending more money on services from companies the housing market is recalibrating yellen acknowledged sunday that inflation was unacceptably high again blaming russia s invasion of ukraine and long term supply chain issues as contributors these factors are unlikely to diminish immediately but over time i certainly expect inflation to come down she said still she noted consumer spending remains very strong there s month to month volatility but overall spending is strong and she added bank balances are high it s clear that most consumers even lower income households continue to have buffer stocks of savings with the federal reserve taking increasingly aggressive action to curb inflation raising interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point the largest hike in nearly 30 years yellen said the goal was a delicate balancing act chair powell has said that his goal is to bring inflation down while maintaining a strong labor market that s going to take skill and luck but i believe it s possible she said sunday as the administration insist there s a way to avoid recession while reigning in inflation republican lawmakers are taking the opportunity to hammer biden on higher prices a key talking point for the gop ahead of the november midterm elections bidenflation is costing average americans an extra 460 a month pennsylvania rep lloyd smucker tweeted on monday officials weigh more economic measures biden made clear monday he has no plans to meet oil executives in person but is instead tasking top aides like granholm with making his administration s position clear in a letter last wednesday biden called out seven oil refiners for earning record profits while oil supplies decrease he asked the companies to increase production or risk facing white house intervention while the president did not specifically identify the tools he could use granholm hinted during a wednesday cnn appearance that the defense production act may be on the table in his letter biden also instructed his energy secretary to convene an emergency meeting with oil company executives granholm will probe the companies to explain reductions in oil refining capacity according to an abc news report trade groups representing the producers contend that u s refineries are running at 94 percent of capacity the american petroleum institute also fired back at biden s letter with its ceo and president arguing it was the administration s misguided policy agenda shifting away from domestic oil and natural gas has compounded inflationary pressures and added headwinds to companies daily efforts to meet growing energy needs while reducing emissions separately yellen told federal lawmakers earlier this month that her department was reviewing trump era tariffs targeting china

saul klein is a busy man as co founder with his father robin of localglobe one of the longest running vcs in europe he has overseen a wide range of initiatives among other things the pair are passionate investors and philanthropists in localglobe s hq area of somers town london and are also involved in the more conventional business of venture investing in startups although the localglobe brand name and fund remains now the new umbrella brand for all the kleins activities will henceforth be phoenix court group for the purposes of this article i will refer to it as pcg the group is also unveiling how its four new funds will operate plus how it will deploy 10 of its profits to a charitable foundation the firm has now outlined how it will have 500 million at the first close to deploy across its funds localglobe early stage latitude early growth stage and two completely new investment vehicles solar and basecamp a healthy 10 of pcg s profit will go into its phoenix court works foundation to help local groups in somers town klein is also pushing the idea that pcg s king s cross london location puts it at the heart of a european region he is dubbing the next palo alto more on that later so first to the fund structures techcrunch has peered through the marketing buff to come up with these definitions of pcg s funds localglobe seed to series a latitude series b and later solar series c and beyond as well as investing in listed tech stocks public markets basecamp lp fund to invest in other smaller vcs angels and solo gps with this range of fund vehicles this will make pcg a lifestage tech investor able to invest from the earliest stages of startup all the way to the latest stage and to the public markets it s also now an lp in other funds via basecamp especially emerging markets like africa and latin america but zoom out for a moment and basecamp is effectively the retrofitted moniker pcg is giving to the several initiatives the kleins backed such as seedcamp in 2007 company builder zinc vc in 2017 and music industry platform platoon among others basecamp also partners with the diversity oriented newton venture program which localglobe co founded with the london business school phoenix court works has underwritten 60 scholarships to this program pcg also now argues that the region within a 4 hour train journey of its base in king s cross and st pancras which comprises paris amsterdam brussels northern uk cities such as manchester leeds liverpool newcastle bristol oxford and cambridge is home to over 40 million citizens and seven of the world s top 30 universities and contains a large number of europe s unicorns as mentioned earlier it calls this region of europe a new palo alto although the marketing spiel is overly labored furthermore pcg hardly has a monopoly on this region no matter what you call it given any other london vc a tube ride from king s cross has access to exactly the same ecosystem however saul klein said in a statement despite being the third best producer of high growth private companies globally this geography is still underserved by investors especially at the breakout and scale up stages not only is there an acute funding gap at the scale up stage here less than 20 of the capital invested at that stage is domestic so when companies in our region are acquired or move to the public markets uk pensioners and savers miss out while their canadian australian and singaporean equivalents benefit pcg will also support phoenix court works its foundation that supports organizations in the north london neighborhood of somers town as well as more broadly in camden and is funded by 10 of profits from phoenix court group s management company and 2 of carry from all the funds dealroom s recently published vc prominence rank showed largely u s based accel on 24 unicorns and sequoia on 20 while localglobe has mainly invested in europe and turned up 18 unicorns at seed stage localglobe s unicorns include at bay hailo motorway travelperk and zego speaking to me over a call klein expanded on the plethora of these funding vehicles if you look at the companies that get really big they don t just get really big in the private markets they get really big in the public markets we all think about sequoia which has this fund that can invest in both private and public companies that was 15 years in the making so our view is if you have the ability to get into companies at seed stage why wouldn t you want to continue to invest in the breakouts such as with latitude three to four years before these companies are capable of going public we had eight ipos last year why wouldn t you want to invest again that s solar if they re great companies that still have a long way to go keep holding right we ve now got the full life stage funding for companies but what klein seems to be ultimately driving at even with the rather forced stuff about the new palo alto is that he wants to do vc differently to how it s been perceived in the past after all there just aren t many other vcs at least that i know of lately doing this wide range of both hard core investing and taking an interest in their local area and putting 10 of profits and 2 of carry into philanthropic activity it s clear that pcg would like to build a new kind of bay area but this time with fewer tech bros and more tech values

inflation is taking off interest rates are rising and the economy is suffering are we on the cusp of another recession if so what should you do to protect yourself in terms of your personal finances nothing changes when it gets that title said alex cartwright associate economics professor at ferris state university most economists say a recession begins after two consecutive quarters of negative growth in the gdp others say it has two have two shrinking quarters and high unemployment we find out in july for sure but many feel it s inevitable the white house disagrees no i don t think it is said president joe biden from delaware there s nothing inevitable about a recession whether it officially gets the title or not it s not a good time for the economy one way or another it s an economic slowdown said cartwright cartwright said the best thing to do with a recession looming is nothing this is when we start making decisions with our hearts and not necessarily our most logical state of mind he said stick to your investment and retirement plan if anything cartwright said during high inflation now is when to invest even more the value of your cash is going down quicker than ever before said cartwright so you don t need to hold large emergency funds if you can afford it the cliché buy low and sell high reigns supreme if you can just continually invest your couple hundred dollars a week or a couple hundred dollars a month you ll be effectively getting more shares of stock at a lower price said cartwright this isn t the worst time to take on debt money locked in an interest rate below the inflation rate can be a long term win when things recover i m not saying to go out and buy a car that you weren t planning on but you should lean towards taking the loan on that new car said cartwright remember that any interest rate that is less than 8 is better than zero

bitcoin fluctuated around the 20 000 mark last night after days of turmoil fuelled fears of a crypto winter that could send shockwaves through the global economy the digital currency nose dived to 17 772 over the weekend as investors continued to rush to the exit with bitcoin down more than 30 per cent this month and 70 per cent since its all time high close to 70 000 in november a slight recovery back towards 20 000 did little to settle nerves sinking feeling with bitcoin down 70 since its all time high close to 70 000 in november a slight recovery back towards 20 000 did little to settle nerves other cryptocurrencies have been caught up in the sell off with ethereum down 70 per cent this year and dogecoin which was set up as a joke before gaining a following after attracting the attention of tesla founder elon musk has fallen 90 per cent since its peak the fallout has been felt hard with many of the 2million plus british investors holding crypto assets now sitting on heavy losses the rush into crypto was driven by ultra low interest rates over recent years and central banks using quantitative easing to flood the markets with cheap money aside from loose financial conditions they were also taken in by high profile celebrities who were paid to sell the currencies in online adverts including snoop dogg matt damon and gwyneth paltrow other admirers include paris hilton and reese witherspoon as well as musk himself but panic has ripped through the crypto markets in recent days as fears about runaway inflation higher interest rates global recession and war in

hiking rates aggressively this year to tame inflation following the steep falls analysts were quick to warn that investors should be braced for a long hard crypto winter neil wilson an analyst at

short the end of free money from the fed means the artificial pump that created these assets is no longer working bitcoin s popularity is even greater in the us where it has achieved a cult like status with 16 per cent of americans saying they have invested in or used it up from 1 per cent in 2015 its meteoric rise has come despite warnings from authorities and leading investment bankers who repeatedly told investors that crypto had no value wall street veteran and jp morgan chief executive jamie dimon last may called bitcoin worthless hedge funds and corporate companies are also exposed

sunday while for many investors crypto has been nothing more than a dabble analysts are warning the collapse of the industry could have serious consequences for the financial system hitting mainstream assets on wall street and in london in 2008 the prices of credit products built out of sub prime us mortgages went down triggering a global banking crisis and recession and the loss of millions of jobs worldwide similarly crypto has worked its way into the real financial system with household name asset managers like invesco and fidelity offering a number of exchange traded products already the fall in crypto markets has coincided with a slide in equities as us stocks suffered their biggest weekly percentage decline in two years last week malcolm freeman a director at broker kingdom futures

by brett kelman vaught was prosecuted this year in an extremely rare criminal trial for a medical mistake but the drug mix up at the center of her case is anything but rare computerized cabinets have become nearly ubiquitous in modern health care and the technological vulnerability that made vaught s error possible persists in many u s hospitals since vaught s arrest in 2019 there have been at least seven other incidents of hospital staffers searching medication cabinets with three or fewer letters and then administering or nearly administering the wrong drug according to a khn review of reports provided by the institute for safe medication practices or ismp hospitals are not required to report most drug mix ups so the seven incidents are undoubtedly a small sampling of a much larger total safety advocates say errors like these could be prevented by requiring nurses to type in at least five letters of a drug s name when searching hospital cabinets the two biggest cabinet companies omnicell and bd agreed to update their machines in line with these recommendations but the only safeguard that has taken effect so far is turned off by default one letter two letters or three letters is just not enough said michael cohen the president emeritus of ismp a nonprofit that collects error reports directly from medical professionals for example m e t is that metronidazole or metformin cohen added one is an antibiotic the other is a drug for diabetes that s a pretty big mix up but when you see m e t on the screen it s easy to select the wrong drug don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free a five letter fix making it stick omnicell added a five letter search with a software update in 2020 but customers must opt in to the feature so it is likely unused in many hospitals bd which makes pyxis cabinets said it intends to make five letter searches standard on pyxis machines through a software update later this year more than 2½ years after it first told safety advocates the upgrade was coming that update will be felt in thousands of hospitals it will be much more difficult to withdraw the wrong drug from pyxis cabinets but also slightly more difficult to pull the right one nurses will need to correctly spell perplexing drug names sometimes in chaotic medical emergencies robert wells a detroit emergency room nurse said the hospital system in which he works activated the safeguard on its omnicell cabinets about a year ago and now requires at least five letters wells struggled to spell some drug names at first but that challenge is fading over time for me it s become a bigger hassle to pull drugs but i understand why they went there wells said it seems inherently safer computerized medication cabinets also known as automated dispensing cabinets are the way almost every u s hospital manages tracks and distributes dozens to hundreds of drugs pyxis and omnicell account for almost all the cabinet industry so once the pyxis update is rolled out later this year a five letter search feature should be within reach of most hospitals in the nation the feature may not be available on older cabinets that are not compatible with new software or if hospitals don t regularly update their cabinet software hospital medication cabinets are primarily accessed by nurses who can search them in two ways one is by patient name at which point the cabinet presents a menu of available prescriptions to be filled or renewed in more urgent situations nurses can search cabinets for a specific drug even if a prescription hasn t been filed yet with each additional letter typed into the search bar the cabinet refines the search results reducing the chance the user will select the wrong drug the seven drug mix ups identified by khn each of which involved hospital staff members who withdrew the wrong drug after typing in three or fewer letters were confidentially reported by front line health care workers to ismp which has crowdsourced error reports since the 1990s cohen allowed khn to review error reports after redacting information that identified the hospitals involved those reports revealed mix ups of anesthetics antibiotics blood pressure medicine hormones muscle relaxers and a drug used to reverse the effects of sedatives in a 2019 mix up a patient had to be treated for bleeding after being given ketorolac a pain reliever that can cause blood thinning and intestinal bleeding instead of ketamine a drug used in anesthesia a nurse withdrew the wrong drug from a cabinet after typing in just three letters the error would not have occurred if she had been required to search with four in another error reported mere weeks after vaught s arrest a hospital employee mixed up the same drugs as vaught did versed a sedative and vecuronium a dangerous paralytic cohen said ismp research suggests requiring five letters will almost entirely eliminate such errors because few cabinets contain two or more drugs with the same first five letters erin sparnon an expert on medical device failures at ecri a nonprofit focused on improving health care said that although many hospital drug errors are unrelated to medication cabinets a five letter search would lead to an exponential increase in safety when pulling drugs from cabinets the goal is to add as many layers of safety as possible sparnon said i ve seen it called the swiss cheese model you line up enough pieces of cheese and eventually you can t see a hole through it and the five letter search she said is a darn good piece of cheese vaught a former nurse at vanderbilt university medical center in nashville was arrested in 2019 and convicted of criminally negligent homicide and gross neglect of an impaired adult during a controversial trial in march she could serve as much as eight years in prison her sentencing may 13 is expected to draw hundreds of protesters who feel her medical error should not have been prosecuted as a crime at trial prosecutors argued vaught made numerous mistakes and overlooked obvious warning signs while administering vecuronium instead of versed but vaught s first and foundational error which made all other errors possible was inadvertently withdrawing the vecuronium from a cabinet after typing just v e if the cabinet had required three letters vaught probably would not have pulled the wrong drug don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free ultimately i can t change what happened vaught said describing the mix up to investigators in a recorded interview that was played at her trial the best i can hope for is that something will come of this so a mistake like that can t be made again after the details of vaught s case became public ismp renewed its calls for safer searches and then held multiple calls with bd and omnicell cohen said ismp said that within a year both companies confirmed plans to tweak their cabinets based on its guidance bd raised the default on pyxis cabinets to a three letter minimum in 2019 and intends to raise it to five in a software update expected by the end of summer spokesperson trey hollern said cabinet owners will be able to turn off this feature because it s ultimately up to the health care system to configure safety settings hollern said omnicell added a recommended five letter search through a software update in 2020 but left the feature deactivated so its cabinets allow searches with a single letter by default according to a company news release perilous typos m o r f i n e at least some hospitals must have activated the omnicell safety feature because they ve begun to alert ismp to workflow problems spelling errors or typos made worse by requiring more letters omnicell declined to comment for this story ballad health a chain of 21 hospitals in tennessee and virginia activated the five letter search while installing new omnicell cabinets this year ceo alan levine said it was an easy choice to engage the safety feature after the vaught case but that the transition has laid bare an unflattering truth lots of people even highly trained professionals are bad spellers we have people that try to spell morphine as m o r f i n e levine said ballad health officials said one of the most common issues arose in emergency rooms and operating rooms where patients need tranexamic acid a drug used to promote blood clotting so many nurses were delayed at cabinets by misspelling the drug by adding an s or a z that ballad posted reminders of the proper spelling even so levine said ballad would not deactivate the five letter search because of the pandemic and widespread staffing shortages nurses are stretched and more likely to make a mistake so the feature is needed more than ever he said i think given what happened to the nurse at vanderbilt a lot of have a better appreciation of why we are doing it levine said because we re trying to protect them as we are the patient some nurses remain unconvinced michelle lehner a nurse at a suburban atlanta hospital that activated the five letter search last year said she believed hospitals would be better served by isolating dangerous medications like vecuronium instead of complicating the search for all other drugs five letter search while well intentioned might slow nurses down so much that it causes more harm than good she said don t like ads become a supporter and enjoy the good men project ad free as an example lehner said that about three months ago she went to retrieve an anti inflammatory drug solu medrol from a cabinet with the safety feature lehner typed in the first five letters of the drug name but couldn t find it she searched for the generic name methylprednisolone but still couldn t find it she called the hospital pharmacy for help but it couldn t find the medication either she said after almost 20 minutes lehner abandoned the dispensing cabinet and pulled the drug from a non powered old school medication cart the hospital normally reserves for power outages then she realized her mistake she forgot the hyphen if this had been a situation where we needed to give the drug emergently lehner said that would

david paul morris bloomberg via getty images washington as top white house officials reiterate that tackling high inflation remains president joe biden s chief priority his administration is debating strategies to bring prices down and sending mixed signals about how and how quickly biden may act on an issue that is top of mind for voters and weighing on his approval ratings the president said monday he could make a decision as soon as this week on whether to support congress instituting a pause on the federal gas tax of 18 4 cents per gallon which experts have estimated could lower prices by approximately 14 72 cents per gallon treasury secretary janet yellen said on sunday that the administration was open to considering such a move citing the cost on consumers as of monday the national average gas price was 4 98 per gallon gas prices have risen a great deal and it s clearly burdening households yellen said during an appearance on this week with george stephanopoulos so stands ready to work with congress and an idea that s certainly worth considering but yellen s counterpart at the department of energy seemingly disagreed with that notion in her own appearance sunday part of the challenge with the gas tax of course is that it funds the roads energy secretary jennifer granholm said on cnn e just did a big infrastructure bill to help fund the roads so if we do if we remove the gas tax that takes away the funding that was just passed by congress to be able to do that that s one of the challenges but i m not saying that that s off the table granholm said a gas tax holiday would require approval from congress where democrats hold a fragile majority house speaker nancy pelosi has previously spoken skeptically of the idea saying it was possibly better pr than policy biden told reporters on monday that as another relief measure gas rebate cards were also under deliberation that s part of what we re considering he said when asked that s part of the whole operation it s unclear however how such rebate cards would work whether they would be pre loaded or provide rebates post purchase a recession isn t guaranteed white house administration officials are united on one point a recession is not inevitable they have all said there s nothing inevitable about a recession biden said monday yellen granholm and national economic council director brian deese likewise all used variations of that language during their sunday show appearances there s a lot of things about the economy right now that are unique deese said americans are spending less money on goods they re spending more money on services from companies the housing market is recalibrating yellen acknowledged sunday that inflation was unacceptably high again blaming russia s invasion of ukraine and long term supply chain issues as contributors these factors are unlikely to diminish immediately but over time i certainly expect inflation to come down she said still she noted consumer spending remains very strong there s month to month volatility but overall spending is strong and she added bank balances are high it s clear that most consumers even lower income households continue to have buffer stocks of savings with the federal reserve taking increasingly aggressive action to curb inflation raising interest rates by three quarters of a percentage point the largest hike in nearly 30 years yellen said the goal was a delicate balancing act chair powell has said that his goal is to bring inflation down while maintaining a strong labor market that s going to take skill and luck but i believe it s possible she said sunday as the administration insist there s a way to avoid recession while reigning in inflation republican lawmakers are taking the opportunity to hammer biden on higher prices a key talking point for the gop ahead of the november midterm elections bidenflation is costing average americans an extra 460 a month pennsylvania rep lloyd smucker tweeted on monday officials weigh more economic measures biden made clear monday he has no plans to meet oil executives in person but is instead tasking top aides like granholm with making his administration s position clear in a letter last wednesday biden called out seven oil refiners for earning record profits while oil supplies decrease he asked the companies to increase production or risk facing white house intervention while the president did not specifically identify the tools he could use granholm hinted during a wednesday cnn appearance that the defense production act may be on the table in his letter biden also instructed his energy secretary to convene an emergency meeting with oil company executives granholm will probe the companies to explain reductions in oil refining capacity according to an abc news report trade groups representing the producers contend that u s refineries are running at 94 percent of capacity the american petroleum institute also fired back at biden s letter with its ceo and president arguing it was the administration s misguided policy agenda shifting away from domestic oil and natural gas has compounded inflationary pressures and added headwinds to companies daily efforts to meet growing energy needs while reducing emissions separately yellen told federal lawmakers earlier this month that her department was reviewing trump era tariffs targeting china economists in a march policy brief said that eliminating the tariff would save us firms and households about 81 billion annually on direct purchases from china when asked saturday about his position on eliminating those tariffs the president said we are still in the process of making up my mind abc news justin gomez contributed to this report copyright 2022 abc audio all rights reserved

while businesses continue to search for people to fill their jobs two things will be making that more difficult beginning july 1 the cost for employees will be officially going up again minimum wage in oregon will go up to 14 75 per hour in the portland area and will increase for benton county from 12 75 to 13 50 per hour yet the average hourly wage in corvallis as of may ranged from approximately 17 to 55 25 higher than the state mandated minimum to add to the issue oregon state university has ended the school year meaning local businesses may be looking for extra hands with an unemployment rate of only 2 9 in april that means finding people to work in corvallis will continue to be difficult the 1 000 foot rule an issue came up in a recent corvallis city council meeting about the 1 000 foot rule small business owner ryan weber was surprised to be denied a license to sell tobacco products from his smoke shop because his location was less than 1 000 feet as the crow flies from both the downtown safeway and dairy mart proponents were concerned about kids having access to tobacco when the city ordinance was implemented but weber says he doesn t want to sell tobacco products to minors and his business is being limited unfairly his store which sells bongs and pipes for use with cannabis is open only to those 21 and over weber says that even in 2017 when the rule was first put into place the councilors in corvallis expressed concern for smaller tobacco sellers saying maybe they shouldn t be standing in the way of retailers and what they re selling when weber bought the shop from the previous owner neither realized that they would be put in the position of not being able to secure a license to sell tobacco will the city council make exemptions for business owners like weber currently lobbyists for local businesses are meeting with city officials little known i bond was built for inflationary periods as you probably heard the united states federal reserve took aim at inflation last week raising their interest rate by 0 75 most economists quickly pointed out the increase wouldn t substantially slow inflationary pressures until after first quarter next year and that even then the current price spiral is also driven by supply chain issues and quite notably oil for savers and investors this is a difficult time the stock market has been up and down lately more often down and traditional investments are showing lower rates of return while interest rates on credit are getting higher so let s take a look at the almost unknown and slightly boring i bond which the u s government developed decades ago for times just like these the series i savings bond named because their interest rate is linked to the inflation rate is the underdog of the savings bond world yet in january of 2022 the u s treasury sold about 3 billion in these bonds which currently carry a guaranteed return rate of 9 62 if purchased before the end of october 2022 the rates for these bonds are set two ways there is a fixed rate currently set at 0 0 although it does go up and an adjustable rate based on inflation which is determined on may 1 and november 1 of each year money invested in i bonds which is capped at 10 000 per person per year can be cashed out after 12 months meaning these are not great for people who need easy liquidity in their investments if you re interested in these bonds you can go to the federal website to purchase them meaning yes they are electronic in nature but still backed by the federal government and therefore more stable than cryptocurrency note that these do not beat inflation but rather protect you from inflation over the long haul maturing fully in 30 years and are safe if a bit boring also for those worried about personal debt and investing experts suggest transferring high interest rate debt to lower interest cards or home equity loans and to stay focused on long term goals in their investments backing small

toronto a broad based rally allowed canada s main stock index to partially recover from last week s big fall the worst in more than two years in light trading as u s markets were closed colin cieszynski chief market strategist at sia wealth management said many sectors were up nicely to start the trading week which is not unusual when the toronto market is open and u s stock markets are closed so it s a decent day for canada all in considering that the u s was closed and overseas markets didn t do a heck of a lot he said in an interview the s p tsx composite index gained 253 15 points or 1 3 per cent to 19 183 63 after ending a brutal week that saw it plunge 6 6 per cent in its worst performance in more than two years u s stock markets were closed for the juneteenth holiday after being hit hard last week the closure of u s markets probably helped to relieve some selling pressure cieszynski said it s just kind of this relentless selling pressure that we ve seen for most of this month taking a day off utilities was the lone sector in the red ten sectors moved higher led by telecommunications and energy telecom increased 3 6 per cent as investors applauded the announced 2 85 billion sale of shaw communications inc s wireless carrier freedom mobile to quebecor inc owned videotron ltd the transaction could pave the way for final approvals of rogers communications inc s 26 billion takeover of shaw rogers shares increased 5 9 per cent shaw s climbed 7 8 per cent and quebecor s were 5 8 per cent higher energy was another strong performer increasing 2 5 per cent as crude oil prices increased with suncor energy inc gaining 4 6 per cent cieszynski said he hopes the sector s positive move will continue when u s markets reopen on tuesday are the americans going to come back and keep selling down the energy sector or are they going to let the sector come back as well because that was quite a hit it took last week the august crude contract was up 78 cents at us 108 77 per barrel and the july natural gas contract was down 25 cents at us 6 69 per mmbtu cieszynski said energy s increase was relatively moderate compared to last week s losses it s nice and if we were in an upward trend we d go great but in a downtrend this is more of like a bit of a bounce than a big turn around at this point the heavyweight financials sector increased 1 4 per cent as 10 year canada government bond yields rose all canadian banks were stronger on the day led by national bank which gained 3 2 per cent the canadian dollar traded for 76 96 cents us compared with 76 72 cents us on friday the materials sector which includes miners forestry producers and fertilizer firms was up as nutrien ltd shares climbed 3 6 per cent and teck resources ltd shares rose 3 4 per cent the august gold contract was up 10 cents at us 1 840 60 an ounce and the july copper contract was down less than a penny at us 4 01 a pound cargojet inc surged 11 1 per cent while air canada was up 3 2 per cent to help lift industrials the coming week will be partially guided by economic news with housing data in the u s canadian retail sales and consumer prices and pmi reports from around the world cieszynski said the canadian numbers will be important because of the speculation that the bank of canada will follow the u s federal reserve s decision last week by raising its trendsetting interest rate by three quarters of a per cent to help tackle soaring inflation so the only way that you might get a surprise is if something happened to change that assumption this report by the canadian press was first published june 20 2022 companies in this story tsx na tsx su tsx ntr tsx sjr b tsx rci b tsx qbr b tsx gsptse tsx_cadusd x

a man stands on the street on june 10 after his homeless encampment was removed due to the summit of the americas which was held at the los angeles convention center california the u s visual people the 16th president of the united states abraham lincoln once said a house divided against itself cannot stand he was right and so the recently concluded summit of the americas raises a good question can the house of the americas stand firm given its growing cracks in the lead up to the meeting which took place in los angeles california on june 6 10 the u s announced it would not be inviting cuba nicaragua and venezuela to the gathering due to these countries human rights records the move prompted the leaders of some latin american and caribbean lac countries to either dispatch lower level officials to attend or skip the meeting altogether eight nations did not send a top level official to the most important event we have hosted in the region in decades this speaks volumes about how badly we ve managed relations with our neighbors brett bruen a former u s diplomat who served as director of global engagement under the barack obama administration tweeted on june 8 the actual number was larger among them leaders of mexico guatemala honduras and el salvador boycotted the meeting uruguay s president said he had contracted covid 19 and bolivia also declined to attend there is polarization due to economic problems and the situation generated by the covid 19 pandemic the united states has not yet recovered said roberto zepeda a researcher with the center for research on north america at the national autonomous university of mexico adding that like previous administrations the current u s administration is looking abroad to divert attention despite washington s efforts as a host the summit showed the diminishing u s leadership in the region and how much progress remains to be made in areas such as integration and cooperation zepeda told xinhua news agency a woman protests against the u s refusal to invite the leaders from cuba nicaragua and venezuela to the u s hosted summit of the americas in los angeles california on june 10 xinhua fading influence the first summit of the americas took place in 1994 with the subsequent ones being held every three or four years the third summit held in canada in 2001 adopted the inter american democratic charter which stipulates that only democratic countries are eligible to participate in the organization of american states jiang shixue director of the center for latin american studies at shanghai university told beijing review that the emphasis on ideology and common values has long characterized the diplomatic strategies of successive u s presidents nothing illustrates this better than joe biden s decision to not invite the three countries under the pretext of attendees having to meet u s standards of democracy this practice is similar to the so called summit for democracy jiang said adding that democracy is merely a tool for the u s to challenge any opposition at the summit of the americas and then turn it into the summit of america a platform from which to lecture other countries i am not going to the summit because not all american countries are invited and i believe there is a need to change the policy that has been in place for centuries the exclusion the desire to dominate without reason the disrespect for countries sovereignty the independence of each country mexican president andrã s manuel lã³pez obrador a key latin american leader on the gathering s invitee list said at a news conference in mexico city on june 6 it shows the deep divisions across the continent said martha bã rcena former mexican ambassador to the u s she pointed out that the leaders who decided against attending were challenging u s influence because has been diminishing in the continent biden should prioritize dialogue rather than exclusion and commonalities instead of arbitrary notions of difference to keep the house of the americas intact according to david castrillã³n kerrigan a researcher and professor at the universidad externado de colombia should he fail to do so the standing of the u s in the region will further weaken he wrote in an article on china daily the u s wanted to use the summit as an opportunity to compensate for its inadequate attention to latin america in recent years however we are living in a multipolar world in which the u s cannot act as it has in the past not even in a region considered to be within its sphere of influence zepeda said during the gathering the u s proposed the americas partnership for economic prosperity an economic recovery plan to be developed only with its most trusted partners which distorts the continental character it purports luis ricardo delgado a professor of social sciences at venezuela s university of carabobo told xinhua the limited scope of the plan is a direct result of the fact that the u s insists on injecting ideology into its international ties he said as a consequence the summit does not substantially modify the current status quo of international relations in the hemisphere so its impact will be practically nil he added a migrant caravan continues its trek to the u s mexico border advancing along mexico s southern caribbean coast on june 7 visual people standing on their own as the first major diplomatic event targeting lac countries since the biden administration took office in early 2021 there was a significant division in expectations between the two sides from the very beginning and the structural conflicts of one trying to dominate the region with others trying to reject this have become a true portrayal of this summit said zhang jieyu a researcher with the department for latin american and caribbean studies at the china institute of international studies ciis argentine president alberto fernã ndez said at the summit that the silence of those who are absent is calling to us and insisted that the host country did not have the power to impose the right of admission we definitely would have wished for a different summit of the americas he added under the pressures of covid 19 and the spillover effects of the russia ukraine conflict many lac countries are facing severe challenges in economic recovery inflation control public health and poverty reduction said qian feng director of the research department at the national strategy institute at tsinghua university what these countries were expecting was for the u s to offer more favorable market access loans and aid to help them tide over difficulties what they need now is real respect and equality but the u s merely cares about its own interests qian added washington s economic recovery proposal aims to mobilize new investments in the region fortify supply chains promote decarbonization and biodiversity facilitate inclusive trade and update the social contract between governments and their people u s political news outlet politico reported noting that these priorities are unlikely to satisfy the desire among lac countries for more trade access to the u s donald trump offered the growth in the americas initiative in 2019 then biden touted his build back better world plan and now it s this new economic package but will those policies truly become effective it remains to be seen jiang said u s aid policies toward lac countries have always proven discontinuous and it is highly doubtful the new initiative can be realized according to zhang of ciis the country has long pursued the america first approach in dealing with international affairs giving short shrift to the interests of other countries in the region she added for example last year when people in lac countries were in urgent need of vaccines amid the covid 19 pandemic the u s refused to share its vaccines even though it had a surplus of stocks that were about to expire we are living in a different world there are new institutions new rules and that is what we are experiencing today mexican political scientist eduardo roldã n told xinhua the u s is going to have to understand that it has neglected latin america and we are not its backyard latin america is giving itself respect in 2011 33 lac countries announced the creation of the community of latin american and caribbean states which naturally excludes the u s and canada demonstrating the determination of those countries to stand on their own print edition title summit of discontent copyedited by elsbeth van paridon

david bowie s self titled debut album was released on june 1 1967 his movie career launched almost simultaneously bowie first appeared onscreen in 1968 on the bbc during an episode of the british tv drama theater 625 titled the pistol shot he went on to more than 30 eclectic and sometimes surprising roles appearing in several critically acclaimed mainstream movies like the man who fell to earth labyrinth and the linguini incident all while making almost as many studio albums for bowie the two careers weren t entirely unalike a point underscored when he created musical alter egos in ziggy stardust and the thin white duke my performances have got to be theatrical experiences for me as well as for the audience he told rolling stone in 1971 i don t want to climb out of my fantasies in order to go up on stage i want to take them on stage with me as you ll see in this list of david bowie s most compelling acting roles in television and movies the common bond was his boundless creativity the image 1969 bowie s debut as an actor came in a 13 minute short from director michael armstrong unknown at the time bowie played a nondescript character simply called the boy opposite actor michael byrne who went on to star in indiana jones and the last crusade the sum of all fears and tomorrow never dies in the image bowie appears as a ghostly figure who comes to life from a painting the man who fell to earth 1976 a larger role for bowie came several years later in the science fiction film the man who fell to earth about an alien that encounters complications as he tries to blend into the human race to save his own dying planet for his role as thomas jerome newton bowie won an award for best actor at the 1976 saturn awards just a gigolo 1978 another actor was originally set to appear in just a gigolo before bowie became interested screenwriter and executive producer joshua sinclair revealed to nme in 2021 unfortunately audiences ignored this poorly constructed tale about a prussian officer named paul ambrosius von przygodski who returns home to chaos listen you were disappointed and you weren t even in it imagine how we felt bowie complained in 1980 i mean oh god i really should have known better every real legitimate actor that i ve ever met has told me never to even approach a film unless you know the script is good if the script isn t any good then there s no way a film is going to be good luckily this flop didn t keep other prominent movie roles from coming his way in the future christiane f 1981 a 13 year old girl in 70s era berlin becomes addicted to heroin in an intense film that included a bowie cameo things in the teen s life gradually distort and disappear as she befriends a small crew of junkies and falls in love with a drug abusing male prostitute christiane f won a golden screen award in germany and was voted most popular at the montreal film festival the year it was released baal 1982 bowie played the title role in the bbc television adaptation of bertolt brecht s play after spending four weeks in rehearsals the week long shoot took place in august 1981 before baal was broadcast the following march as the protagonist bowie plays a drunken poet caught up in a downward spiral he also contributed several songs to the corresponding ep the hunger 1983 the film that critic roger ebert described as an agonizingly bad vampire movie wasn t a box office smash still it eventually achieved a cult following thanks to a cast that included bowie catherine deneuve and susan sarandon deneuve played a vampire named miriam in the movie while bowie was cast as her husband of 100 years stevie nicks told rolling stone that it was one of her favorite moments of bowie s career declaring his turn as john creepy and strange and amazingly beautiful merry christmas mr lawrence 1983 a war film about the experiences of a troop of british soldiers captured by the imperial japanese army during world war ii this christmas movie was a far cry from current light hearted hallmark flicks bowie embodied a british officer named major jack celliers who was interned by the japanese as a prisoner of war merry christmas mr lawrence covered topics including culture shock the dehumanization of war and homosexuality the film earned critical acclaim for its message of finding common ground and bridging gaps across cultural divides into the night 1985 jeff goldblum and michelle pfeiffer starred in this dark comedy action thriller which also enlisted the help of comedian dan akroyd just before spies like us and dragnet were released into the night follows ed orkin goldblum as an insomniac with a cheating wife and a dull job who ends up on a wild journey with a mysterious woman named diana pfeiffer after she drops out of the sky onto the hood of his car the adventure includes a memorable scene with bowie carl perkins and a particularly sharp weapon also making cameos were muppets creator jim henson and the film s director john landis absolute beginners 1986 director julien temple initially asked bowie to supply music for the soundtrack to absolute beginners after reading the script however bowie asked to play the gender bending character vendice partners instead the musical is based on the book by colin macinnes which is set in london in the late 50s and concentrates on the youth culture that will eventually become the trend influencing mod movement the title song absolute beginners served as bowie s final top five hit reaching no 2 in the u k the movie also featured the kinks ray davies labyrinth 1986 jim henson initially considered sting prince mick jagger and michael jackson for the role of jareth the goblin king in this musical fantasy before deciding on bowie labyrinth follows teenager sarah jennifer connelly through a surreal pursuit as she tries to rescue her baby brother from the clutches of the goblin king it was like a wonderland for me working on that film connelly told et in 2015 and i loved jim henson and david bowie was so sweet to me bowie wrote five songs for the soundtrack including as the world falls down and magic dance the last temptation of christ 1988 bowie appeared in martin scorsese s religious drama as pontius pilate the high ranking roman official who the gospels claim condemned jesus to die on the cross the last temptation of christ caused a stir when it deviated from the bible in retelling the story of jesus willem dafoe focusing on the main character s spiritual conflict as he wrestled with his divine nature by the late 80s bowie had become known for pushing the creative envelope unfortunately his overall screen time in the last temptation of christ accounted for less than four minutes in the 162 minute film the linguini incident 1991 this american crime comedy starred rosanna arquette opposite bowie as a fellow disgruntled new york city restaurant employee who set out to rob their mutual employer the linguini incident wasn t a commercial success or an award winner still bowie was reportedly quite happy with the end result twin peaks fire walk with me 1992 bowie built a successful acting career through a series of brief but pivotal roles and twin peaks fire walk with me served as more evidence he appeared as fbi agent phillip jeffries in the david lynch directed classic delivering an iconic performance in just four minutes of onscreen work in bowie s one scene he and co star kyle maclachlan imply disturbing ideas about mortality self control and the inability to escape from chaos basquiat 1996 it s a tall task for any actor to take on the role of iconic pop artist andy warhol but bowie had admired warhol s work for much of his career so the basquiat character served as one just more eclectic role in a portfolio of exuberant characters the movie also served as another mile marker on bowie s well documented journey of adventurous wigs mr rice s secret 1999 bowie portrayed a mysterious 400 year old man who helps a terminally ill teen find meaning in life in another adventurous and challenging role i have quite a few years of my own to draw upon though a year in manhattan is good for fatigue resource bowie quipped in 2002 i don t think you can play 400 there are no precedents a 400 year old may well have the ability to project the characteristics of a 19 year old who knows i just settled for him to be relatively low key zoolander 2001 bowie had no idea that this pivotal role in ben stiller s comedy classic was coming david bowie literally we just came up with the idea of who would be funny to judge this walk off bowie with his song fashion personified that stiller later admitted we put it in the script and sent it to him and he actually said yes that was one of those out of the blue things by the time bowie appears in this action comedy tensions have peaked between rival models derek zoolander stiller and hansel mcdonald owen wilson and they need a judge to settle the score enter a dapper looking bowie with let s dance playing in the background and the rest is slapstick gold if nobody has any objections i believe i might be of service bowie says playing himself arthur and the invisibles 2007 this animated flick based on the book by luc besson told the story of a young arthur who lives with his grandmother in an old farmhouse in connecticut to pass the time while his parents are away looking for work arthur reads his grandfather s journals and becomes inspired by the details of his adventures around the globe bowie plays emperor maltazard the father of darkos the emperor of necropolis and the main antagonist arthur and the invisibles was created in france for an english speaking audience and included the voices of madonna robert deniro chazz palminteri and harvey keitel in addition to bowie the prestige 2006 casting the small but vital role of nikola tesla was one of the most difficult aspects for director christopher nolan bowie actually turned him down the first time nolan asked the filmmaker said he begged bowie to take the part admitting that he had no idea how to move forward if the rocker didn t accept bowie eventually relented and played the serbian born tesla a pioneer of electronic engineering who died in 1943 august 2008 bowie didn t even rehearse this part beforehand he showed up knew his lines and was an absolute joy to work with director austin chick told the reeler august follows two brothers who are trying to keep their dot com company afloat as the stock market begins to collapse in august 2001 right before the 9 11 terrorist attacks the siblings were portrayed by josh hartnett and adam scott while bowie played a supporting role he sees a bit of himself in hartnett s character and sees this as an opportunity to teach a young man a lesson not destroy him forever chick said but you can tell he sort of relishes it i spent the whole day saying oh my god i m directing david bowie bandslam 2009 bowie s final movie role came in this pg rated teen musical which tells the story of a fledgling rock group looking for its big break in a local battle of the bands competition bandslam delivered another cameo for bowie or at least a toned down myspace checking version of himself as he sits in a coffee shop scrolling through his top 8 in one of the last scenes he comes across one of vanessa hudgens pop punk songs and becomes moved enough to email her i really like your band you know i m starting an indie label it served as a happy ending for a teen musical that was never intended to be epic while closing out bowie s career with another surprising role for underrated actor who was picky about his parts

when the wildfire in the wharton state forest was first spotted sunday morning it was burning in a small area estimated to be about 30 acres less than 24 hours later the fire had destroyed more than 7 000 areas of forest a section of a major highway route 206 was closed and a significant effort was underway to try to stop the blaze before it became a disaster the damage eventually spread to 11 000 acres and is expected to claim 15 000 by the time it is put out sometime on tuesday or wednesday greg mclaughlin the new jersey state fire warden and forest fire service chief said initial efforts to contain the blaze were not successful because of dangerous weather conditions and the fact that the fire started in a remote section of the forest he said when humidity levels drop and the winds pick up which was exactly what happened this past weekend that s all going to be factors that are conducive to fire start and fire spread and fire growth because the vegetation that s in front of that flaming front of fire is more ripe to burn fire whirls the wharton state blaze quickly became very intense sunday morning it s been a really long time since i saw fire whirls i saw several of them mclaughlin said a fire whirl is a small whirlwind induced by fire sort of like a mini fire tornado nbc philadelphia he explained when a fire breaks out in a part of the forest that is hard to get to there s a lot of areas that are wet too wet for equipment trucks and bulldozers to go in without getting stuck but not wet enough to stop fire from spreading through them he noted in many parts of the forest reaching a fire is hard if not impossible getting to a fire in the forest can be tricky some of the roads are well maintained and you can travel quickly other roads aren t meant to be roads and they re small and they re not maintained mclaughlin saod he said if crews are unable to get equipment close to a wildfire when it starts we re going to start to light fire to fight fire with fire and burn out all of the vegetation essentially around the fire so it cannot spread any further in all directions mclaughlin pointed out that while new jersey is the most densely populated state in the nation 42 of the state is forested and almost half of all homes and buildings in the garden state are located right next to a forest he said for the next several months when fire danger levels shoot higher in new jersey we ll staff our towers on those kinds of days we ll ready our people we have a large part time workforce that supports us and we make contingency plans new jersey has three forest fire divisions north central and south with resources that can be reallocated when a significant fire threat develops in a particular part of the state getty stock thinkstock david matthau is a reporter for new jersey 101 5 you can reach him at david matthau townsquaremedia com click here to contact an editor about feedback or a correction for this story see the must drive roads in every state these are the best hiking spots in new jersey a trip to new jersey doesn t have to be all about the beach our state has some incredible trails waterfalls and lakes to enjoy from the pine barrens to the appalachian trail to the hidden gems of new jersey you have plenty of options for a great hike hiking is such a great way to spend time outdoors and enjoy nature plus it s a great workout before you go out on the trails and explore some of our listeners suggestions i have some tips on hiking etiquette from the american hiking society if you are going downhill and run into an uphill hiker step to the side and give the uphill hiker space a hiker going uphill has the right of way unless they stop to catch their breath always stay on the trail you may see side paths unless they are marked as an official trail steer clear of them by going off trail you may cause damage to the ecosystems around the trail the plants and wildlife that live there you also do not want to disturb the wildlife you encounter just keep your distance from the wildlife and continue hiking bicyclists should yield to hikers and horses hikers should also yield to horses but i m not sure how many horses you will encounter on the trails in new jersey if you are thinking of bringing your dog on your hike they should be leashed and make sure to clean up all pet waste lastly be mindful of the weather if the trail is too muddy it s probably best to save your hike for another day i asked our listeners for their suggestions of the best hiking spots in new jersey check out their suggestions
ma xuejing china daily the consumer price index in the united states increased 8 6 percent in may the highest since 1981 outstripping the market forecast of 8 3 percent to rein in the ferocious inflation and cool borrowing the us federal reserve raised the interest rate by 0 75 percentage point on june 15 the highest hike since 1994 but will the fed s move tame the inflation in the us the record high inflation in the us is the result of the long term relocation of global industrial chains which cannot be reversed overnight in the 1980s the us succeeded in slowing inflation by raising interest rates but it could do so only because china and other east asian countries provided the world including the us with huge amounts of high quality products at relatively low prices and thus helped protect the livelihoods of the american people americans including former fed chairman alan greenspan have acknowledged that indeed the us economy rests on the coordinated development of global industries separated from the global industrial chains the us would not have been able to achieve the current level of development and ensure american people s high living standards other factors have also fueled the inflation in the us to begin with the covid 19 pandemic has seriously disrupted the global industry and supply chains especially the supply of goods in the us and the large scale pump priming actions taken to stimulate an economy usually during a recession through government spending and interest rate and tax reductions in recent years may have eased the pressure on the economy but it has also exacerbated the imbalance between supply and demand besides washington s efforts to check china s rise and change the global economic order to its liking are also taking a toll on the us raising interest rates has always been a double edged sword it cannot really curb inflation and instead may further exacerbate the existing difficulties in the us as the current economic situation in the us is very different from that in the 1980s at that time with the external environment generally improving and domestic production in order interest rate hikes in the us had a positive effect but now the conditions have changed the fundamental problem in the us today is the hollowing out of industries and the inefficiency of the industry and supply chains for example nonfarm labor productivity plummeted 7 3 percent in the first quarter of 2022 compared with the same period last year the largest decline since the third quarter of 1947 according to the bureau of labor statistics on the other hand the us china containment policy has weakened the country s economic foundation greatly undermining its cooperation with the rest of the world also the us monetary stimulus has disrupted the domestic job market and production activity and none of this can be resolved by interest rates hikes the us raised interest rates by 25 basis points in march the first hike since it cut interest rates to zero in april inflation fell by 0 2 percentage points from 8 5 to 8 3 percent but it rebounded to 8 6 percent in may which shows raising interest rates will not do much to curb inflation on the contrary higher interest rates will further disrupt global capital flows hurting production in other countries and supplies to the us it will also increase the cost of domestic production and accelerate the shift from the real economy to the virtual economy moreover rate hikes could dampen the gains from the stock market which has become a priority for the us economy the s p 500 has lost 2 7 percent during the one and a half years of joe biden s presidency with stocks plunging 3 9 percent on june 13 however if the us stock market continues to rise after the interest rate hikes it will hinder the us industrial structural adjustment process yet the us is not the only economy facing high inflation inflation in europe is on par with the us inflation reached 8 1 percent in may this to a large extent is due to the spillover effects of the us economic bungling and its efforts to reshape the world economy according to its preference to curb global inflation therefore countries need to work closely to initiate global supply side reform they should also initiate reform in real production but that would require the us to change course and abandon its wrong practices which have dealt a serious blow to the global economy for instance if washington lifts all the tariffs on chinese goods inflation in the us is likely to decline by 1 3 percentage points in the era of close global cooperation by adopting policies and taking actions to check other countries development the us will only hurt itself if it continues to repeat its mistakes economic hardships across the world will intensify and global inflation will rise further after all raising interest rates which is merely a monetary move to check inflation cannot solve real economic problems the author is an assistant

of position adjustment there has also been further hawkish rhetoric from federal reserve officials on friday for example long term dove minneapolis fed president kashkari stated that he could back a further 75 basis point increase in rates at the july meeting and it might then be prudent to continue with 50 basis point hikes after the july meeting he added that the fed might need to raise rates beyond what is currently forecasted if inflation drifts higher or the supply side does not improve the hawkish fed policy will support the dollar but there are also some expectations that aggressive action now will allow an earlier peak there are also concerns that aggressive fed action will push the us economy into recession bank of america expects a hawkish fed will support the dollar fx is a relative concept meaning that what matters for eurusd is the fed vs the ecb relative monetary policies the bank added just few weeks ago the market was expecting the fed to pause because of weak data and the tightening of financial conditions back then we argued strongly against this view because the economy will need to weaken if inflation is to come down since then labor market data and

with differences between pakistan and the imf over the government s budget and macro targets for the next fiscal yet to be resolved washington is believed to have agreed to intervene at the behest of islamabad to help it clinch a deal with the lender that pakistan needs the imf programme now to reverse the economic downturn in the country and stay solvent cannot be overemphasised pakistan requires 37bn or more to finance its debt and other payments next year as things stand the inordinate delay in the finalisation of a new staff level agreement with the imf has already shut down global bond markets and other sources of funding bilateral multilateral and commercial for pakistan while the latter s depleting foreign exchange stock is playing havoc with the exchange rate as the rupee dropped to 210 to a dollar on monday indeed the us has influence over the imf as its largest shareholder and its support can come in handy for pakistan but official confirmation is awaited although the finance minister sounded hopeful yesterday when he hinted at a deal being secured in a couple of days moody s investors service has downgraded pakistan s credit rating outlook to negative from stable the only way out of the current economic crisis is through the imf read up the imf creek islamabad not only wants the fund to resume disbursements but to also increase the package s size and duration there is no doubt the coalition government has made a few tough decisions though with a lag of several weeks and after incurring significant losses such as raising fuel and power prices despite the pti s street protests nevertheless it has failed to convince the fund on its next fiscal year s budget mainly regarding its exaggerated revenues and understated expenditure estimates that make the achievement of the targeted primary surplus or the savings from its revenues after meeting all its expenses excluding the interest payments for the year of rs152bn suspect if the government s finance team finds itself in a tight spot now or farther from an imf deal on the sustainability of its budget it has only itself to blame according to reports the government must get its budget passed by parliament before or on june 28 to legally ensure its implementation from july 1 as required under the constitution this requires the government to reach a final agreement with the imf at the earliest so that it can protect the agreed measures in its updated budget and show the expected financing from the imf in the documents while the government needs to rethink its budget to show to the international creditors that it has what it takes to put its fiscal house in order the imf must also realise that the continuing delay in signing the deal isn t helping anyone the more it gets delayed the more unmanageable the economy will become published in dawn june 21st 2022
photo zlaťáky cz on unsplash with conditions ripe for 1970s style stagflation stagnant economic activity and high inflation and 2008 style debt investors have started to think seriously about investing in gold gold which was the best performing asset class in the 1970s gaining 1000 across the decade has so far remained flat for the year however savvy investors understand that gold s long term status as a safe haven asset has not suddenly disappeared for them the real issue is knowing when they should invest understanding what indicators are useful will give you an edge on your investment decision gold against foreign currencies for investors in the united states one of the best leading indicators for gold is its performance against foreign currencies when foreign currencies are weakening central banks and foreign investors tend to fly to safety which initially typically means investing in united states treasuries and other dollar denominated assets the effect of this is that gold s price can cheapen given that it is sold in dollars that has been the case to date gold again the stock market traditionally gold has a low correlation with the stock market this makes gold an important tool for diversifying a portfolio with stocks what that also tells us is that gold tends to perform in a different direction to stocks so when the stock market is rising that s a sign that gold will fail to outperform the market however in periods such as the 1970s where the market struggled gold has done well the dow gold ratio the ratio of the dow jones industrial average to gold shows how many ounces of gold you would need to buy the dow the higher the number the cheaper gold is right now the dow gold ratio is at 17 76 which is about where the price was at the beginning of the 1960s when the bull market for gold began in the 1970s gold opened the decade in the 20s photo macrotrends an interesting feature of the ratio is that gold always responds to a high dow gold ratio by going on a bull run photo macrotrends so what we know right now is that gold is undervalued and you need to decide how to invest in gold whether it s with physical gold in the form of coins and bullion or through gold exchange traded funds etfs or through stocks in gold miners and explorers gold and interest rates gold and interest rates have a negative correlation when one goes uop the other goes down this is not cast iron indeed no indicator is as we saw from the chart on the dow gold ratio it s impossible to time the gold price you just have to position yourself correctly right now the federal reserve has begun to raise interest rates but the gold price has held steady an interest rate hike makes financial instruments more expensive and less appealing to investors on the other hand reducing interest rates makes them more attractive in the current environment as interest rates rise we should expect at some point that investors will turn to gold
the policy involved pegging the three year bond rate to the overnight cash rate target setting with the intention of lowering the cost of borrowing out to that term the target was also a de facto commitment that interest rates would not be increased for that period to give borrowers further confidence to take on debt but the policy met an undignified end last november as early evidence of rising inflation led the market to test the rba s ability to maintain the target as selling pressure increased the central bank chose to stand out of the market concluding the policy no longer had a purpose reputational damage an open question the rba conceded many financial market participants were burnt by its decision to drop the target including those that expected it to be retained as such this experience could lessen the effectiveness of any future commitments of this nature by the bank the review said the extent of reputational damage caused by its retreat was an open question but could only be assessed in the long run advertisement many other central banks have also been surprised by the strength in the economic recovery and inflation with associated reputational costs and large movements in market prices as forecasts and the forward guidance based on them have not been met the review said the rba said there was also a financial cost involved in defending the target because the bonds it purchased fell in value as yields rose but it said those costs were modest compared with the costs of its bond purchasing or quantitative easing program and its term funding facility policy qe favoured in future in future the rba said it would be more likely to opt for quantitative easing which involves targeting a quantum of bonds rather than a price or yield this provided greater flexibility and avoided the exit issues associated with the yield target it said adding that qe was not without its risks the bank will conduct a review of that policy later this year despite its ill fated end the bank said the policy worked for most of its existence because it prompted a record take up of cheap fixed rate loans that boosted the economy the setting of a low three year borrowing rate led to historically low fixed and variable lending rates for borrowers in response housing and business credit growth picked up to the fastest pace in over a decade advertisement these low borrowing costs worked by freeing up cash flows to support households financial positions the unusually strong housing price growth response by the standards of previous reductions in the cash rate was an important impetus in progress to employment and inflation goals through the usual channels of dwelling investment and consumption the review said frank and transparent economists and rba watchers said the report was more self critical than they expected rbc capital markets economist su lin ong described the review as detailed frank and quite transparent she said that of interest was the board s agreement to strengthen the way it considers a full range of scenarios when making policy decisions ms ong said perhaps this will deliver greater scenario analysis and policy options with a clearer reaction function as a key outcome of this review economist saul eslake said the reserve bank s error was putting a date on how long rates would stay at record low levels which to the best of my knowledge no other central bank did advertisement it s not often that people in high offices admit that they got something wrong or acknowledge that their reputations have taken a hit so it is to the reserve bank s and the governor s credit that they have done so on this occasion and indicated that they have learned something from the experience mr eslake said meanwhile anz economist david plank said the bank was honest about the issues let s not be too harsh on them hindsight is 2020 at the time things were happening at a furious pace he said the market thinks there s a chance that it s going to exit you either have to own all the bonds or you have to give up on the target either way you end up in a difficult position richard quin the head of fixed income fund bentham that had actively shorted bonds throughout the first half of the year said it was bizarre that the central bank stuck to its dovish prediction that the cash rate would not go up before 2024 they were so wrong and had the opportunity to be a bit more normal about things earlier in the year and they didn t take it he said previous reviews advertisement the review is not the first examination into the efficacy of the policy in may a new york federal reserve report concluded that the yield curve control policy helped stimulate the australian economy but its efficacy broke down once the bond market lost faith in the central bank s grip on monetary settings the fed study found that yield curve control mostly operated through a super narrow channel where only specific australian government bonds targeted in the rba s purchase operations were affected but there were no spillovers elsewhere the rba bought up the targeted bond but achieved little else it said in other words the policy failed to achieve its main purpose to ease financial conditions the forced removal of the peg at the hands of the market led to criticism of the central bank including by former treasurer peter costello who said its credibility had suffered advertisement the rba has come under constant criticism for not doing enough in november 2020 former prime minister paul keating scolded the bank for not engaging in quantitative easing which it eventually did in may governor philip lowe acknowledged his incorrect forecast that interest rate increases would not occur until 2024 was an embarrassing error as he lifted the benchmark rate the reserve bank will also face an independent review which garnered bipartisan support marking the most detailed examination of its capabilities since the 1997 wallis inquiry the australian financial review reported this week that treasurer jim chalmers intends to appoint a panel of independent experts to conduct the review

public it was his idea to broadcast music news and information into households everywhere his proposal was allegedly snubbed at first but persistence paid off and by 1919 radios were available for general purchase by 1922 the popularity of radio was gaining momentum at first manufacturers and department stores had the only transmitters kdka pittsburgh pa was the first radio station wwj detroit mi was soon to follow radio was entirely non commercial at that time and depended on public grants and donations the public not always being as generous as necessary stations began to look for a new way to generate income weaf new york ny is credited with airing the first commercial spot the first paid announcement in history was purchased by hawthorne court a real estate company based in queens it lasted ten minutes this should make all of us feel better about the length of commercial breaks on modern day stations birth of the networks in the twenties radio stations began linking up and forming broadcasting chains kdka began offering a schedule of daily broadcasts in 1922 and other stations followed by linking up one station could simulcast its programming to many different areas chain broadcasting and subsequently the major broadcast network was born the radio corporation of america rca headed by then ceo sarnoff established the first major broadcast network in 1926 they named it the national broadcasting company nbc yes nbc was before television nbc had two dozen stations several of which it acquired from at t after the government encouraged at t to sell off its broadcast holdings weaf was the flagship station of nbc in an effort to diversify nbc divided their networks into two groups the red and the blue networks the former were the bulk of nbc s stations and the latter was comprised of their few smaller stations two years after nbc started out columbia broadcasting system cbs launched its network with sixteen stations under the leadership of william s paley paley would serve as ceo of cbs from 1928 until well into the 1980s cbs was and still is credited with having very strong news programming in 1934 a third network surprisingly not abc they come in later emerged mutual broadcasting system mbs had affiliates in only four major cities and did not own any of their stations its primary focus was syndication of programming it had 160 affiliates in its heyday but left the air in april 1999 due to financial difficulties eventually nbc was forced by the fcc to break up its holdings in the early 1940s broadcasting rules were implemented which prevented one company from owning and operating two distinct networks rca decided to retain the larger red network and sell off the smaller blue network edward j noble purchased nbc s blue network and thus established the american broadcasting company abc radio prospers despite rough times in the five years after its inception radio saw amazing growth more and more stations were broadcasting and there wasn t enough room for them all on the am band interference frustrated listeners as more than one station would often broadcast on the same frequency finally congress intervened and made some more rules in 1926 the federal radio commission frc was formed the frc began issuing licenses and assigning frequencies to stations they established the standard broadcast band 500 1500 kc these efforts helped dissipate confusion and saved the fledgling medium during the depression radio shows provided light hearted humor to the downtrodden listener the most popular and longest running show of all time amos n andy debuted the same year the stock market crashed many people listened in an effort to escape the dismal reality of everyday life it was entertainment provided for free so long as one owned a receiver the medium gained such a large audience that in 1933 president franklin d roosevelt began broadcasting a series of speeches that were known as fireside chats that same year roosevelt created the federal communications commission fcc in an effort to regulate the growing medium and all other electronic communication once world war ii began the fcc prohibited the building of new broadcast outlets because all such materials were needed in the war effort existing stations enjoyed continued success as americans tuned in all across the country to hear the latest news from the front propaganda began to pour forth over the airwaves as broadcasters banded together to unify the country against the enemy by the end of the war 95 percent of homes had at least one radio receiver television appears radio suffers once the war ended the fcc lifted its freeze on further development of broadcast outlets this gave television an opportunity to grow now people could not only hear programs they had a visual to go with the actors and the scenarios they had a face to put on their newscasters in the 1950s television dethroned radio as the number one entertainment medium that meant not only did radio lose listeners it lost sponsors something had to be change or radio would go the way of the cotton gin silent films and devo initially programmers thought that the way to save radio was to broadcast exactly was television was broadcasting after all if it was working for them the idea was that people would tune in on their transistor radios developed by bell laboratory in 1948 instead of the televisions when they were away from home but it wasn t working stations began to play recorded music after having to drop their network affiliations due to decreased program schedules what looked like a last ditch effort would change the face of radio forever radio as we now know it in the mid 1950s rock and roll was born artists like bill haley and elvis presley began pumping out hits new york chicago dj alan freed began promoting rock and roll shows bringing it into the mainstream the top 40 radio format was born teens discovered the whole new radio which really was just what sarnoff envisioned in the first place keep in mind so far i have discussed only am radio although fm radio was created by edward armstrong back in 1938 it was not taken advantage of until much later the signal on fm was much cleaner but there weren t any receivers out there to pick up the signal manufacturers wouldn t make them until there was a demand for them there wouldn t be a demand for them until there were stations broadcasting on fm there wouldn t be stations broadcasting until there was an audience for it thus the vicious circle went the fcc freeze on broadcast medium development in the 1940s didn t help matters by the time the 1960s arrived although many am station operators owned fm licenses they merely simulcast their am broadcasts on their fm frequency two things would propel the stalled evolution of fm in 1961 the fcc authorized fm to broadcast in stereo many record companies at were making stereo disks at that time stereo sound needed to be tested and fm seemed a good place to try it then in 1965 the fcc created a law requiring fm stations to break simulcast with their am counterparts for at least half the broadcast day fm had to create its own sound the first format to take hold on fm was beautiful music a precursor to today s easy listening automation allowed fm stations to keep employees down to a minimum and would often assign the fm operation to an engineer but the more music less talk format proved successful and fm stations began making money fm stations began broadcasting album cuts that did not get air play on the top 40 am stations further chipping away at the am audience eventually fm eclipsed am in the early 1980s the then struggling am stations had to provide something different from fm since their non stereo sound could not outdo fm in quality am radio turned back to the medium s beginnings and became primarily talk radio giving birth to the careers of rush limbaugh howard stern and dr laura despite its best efforts am still remains in the shadow of fm today
by stefan gleason the u s economy appears headed for a hard landing after months of ignoring the steadily growing inflation problem the federal reserve is now using monetary blunt force to try to rein in rising prices fed policymakers have effectively decided that inflation is so out of hand they are willing to induce an economic slowdown that will reduce aggregate demand for goods and services the recent carnage in the stock market suggests that the fed s suddenly aggressive rate hikes are going to crimp consumer borrowing and hurt retail sales stocks which are now fully in bear market territory tend to lead the economy the message of the market is that a recession is coming the claims to the contrary by biden administration officials are less than convincing especially given their track record of failing to recognize the inflation problem until it became too overwhelming to deny treasury secretary janet yellen went on abc news on sunday to try to paint a rosy picture of the deteriorating economy i don t think a recession is inevitable she said perhaps nothing is inevitable except death and taxes but the latest economic indicators suggest that another recession caused by bungling central planners is also inevitable we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us bidenomics was predicated on fiscal and monetary stimulus propping up consumer demand at the same time the biden administration took steps to suppress supply of critical products such as fossil fuels going so far as to shut down pipeline plans and demand that oil companies stop investing in new sources of domestic production only to later demonize them for not doing enough to alleviate record high fuel prices now the economy faces a reckoning over supply and demand imbalances the housing market faces a reckoning after the fastest rise in mortgage rates since 1987 sellers are now being forced to negotiate prices down so buyers can afford the monthly payments meanwhile housing starts home construction permits and mortgage applications are now falling rapidly other danger signs for the economy the atlanta federal reserve bank s gdpnow tracker shows economic growth coming in at 0 this spring down from previous projections of second quarter gdp gains the philadelphia fed business index turned negative for the month of june the first such contraction since the depths of the covid lockdowns social mood is collapsing with the latest university of michigan survey of consumers showing consumer sentiment plunging to a record low a recent survey found that small business owners are feeling their gloomiest in nearly five decades and finally 59 of u s manufacturers now believe that a recession is coming the upshot is that periods of great fear create great buying opportunities asset classes that are currently under pressure will eventually reach a bottom some markets may be at or near a bottom now but with the economy likely to worsen before it gets better risks remain high in economically sensitive assets such as growth stocks and industrial commodities non cyclical assets such as precious metals tend to be more resilient to economic risks they may even benefit from an investor flight to safety especially as it becomes clearer that in a stagflation environment cash is no safe haven the bottom line is that holders of certain hard assets namely gold and silver will be better positioned than those stuck in paper assets to survive a hard landing for the economy

despite hours of testimony from residents of the yukon and kuskokwim rivers who called for urgent action to curb the salmon bycatch by bering sea trawlers the north pacific fishery management council decided to approach the problem more methodically in a unanimous vote near the end of its five day meeting in sitka the council recommended further study of salmon declines in the bering sea and a closer look at their connection to climate change salmon abundance in the yukon river the third largest river in north america has dropped sharply in the past two years the forecast is no better this season many yukon and kuskokwim river residents voiced concern during last monday s call at this point there should be alarm bells going off all over not only in our communities but all over the state and federal government agencies said vivian korthuis the chief executive officer for the association of village council presidents a consortium of 56 federally recognized tribes on the yukon kuskokwim delta among the region s 27 000 residents korthius said 98 of households harvested salmon council meetings typically involve hours of presentations on the scientific research into stock decline but korthius pointed out a glaring oversight what your reports don t show are the families in western alaska who are worrying about putting fish away to feed their children throughout the winter she said and parents and grandparents who are unable to pass our way of life down to our children and future grandchildren the salmon collapse is nearly as dire on the kuskokwim river i normally put away 2 000 chum salmon to feed my dog team mike williams sr of akiak testified last year i caught only two chums williams chairs the kuskokwim river intertribal commission which represents 33 tribes in the kuskokwim river drainage williams was discouraged that the pollock trawlers fleet so far this year had already caught and discarded 5 100 chinook salmon and last year caught and discarded 540 000 chum he said the waste of a single fish is unjust for iindigenous fishermen but recognized that the problem was complex we understand that not every salmon caught by pollock fisheries is bound for western alaska we understand that other factors like climate change and competition with hatchery fish have impacts on our salmon in their marine environment but we know that this council has the power to enact regulations and plans to reduce salmon bycatch he said 37 people signed up to testify before the council on the issue most of them urging the council to reduce the amount of allowable bycatch of chinook and chum salmon by the pollock fleet but it was clear from reports about conditions in the bering sea that although the bycatch numbers are significant they re still a fraction of the overall decline in salmon stephanie madsen the director of the at sea processors association sympathized with the crisis faced by the villagers of western alaska but she suggested that it was a mistake to pin the blame on trawlers if at all i understand from public testimony and reality that it really is at this time the only thing that is controllable she said but she said there were other factors like climate change and lack of food madsen argued that the decline in salmon was a coast wide issue and that if the council took steps to reduce the incidental catch of salmon by trawlers and the results were not what folks are hoping for disappointment will continue the effort to play down the significance of trawl bycatch did not sit well with representatives of other fishing industry sectors who testified on the issue sitka resident and former council member linda behnken the executive director of the alaska longline fishermen s association said it was the council s responsibility to address the disproportionate impact of the salmon collapse clearly the way we re inhabiting this planet is unsustainable that people have the ayp minimally participate in that unsustainable culture but they re bearing the brunt right now of those impacts in alaska she said behnken was a key figure in working to ban trawling off the coast of southeast alaska she didn t believe that trawling although an important provider of protein to the world was in any way sustainable even when council member anne vanderhoeven who works for the seattle based arctic storm management group argued that trawling had a lower carbon footprint according to a peer reviewed study released last year commissioned by an industry group behnken s pointed out that the failure of salmon runs also affects the culture of the area given the intensity of the feelings around bycatch the motion brought forward by the council s advisory panel was tepid advocates hoped to see the allowable bycatch of chinook cut from 45 000 to 16 000 they also wanted the bycatch of chum halved from 500 000 to 250 000 instead they got an extensive document that boiled down to a commitment to minimize bycatch there was also a call for further research to tease out whether lowering the current caps on the trawl bycatch of chinook and chum would make any difference at all to the recovery of the stocks in western alaska the motion included language to incorporate more traditional knowledge into the decision making process in the future

one woman cried after eating them she d avoided the sweet for 20 years due to allergies and couldn t believe she could enjoy doughnuts again it s something ozone can relate to she was diagnosed with dairy egg and gluten allergies in 2017 and the menu showcases her ingenuity the in house tempura batter miraculously doesn t contain wheat or egg a feat six years in the making khamsa cafe is sydney s

bulk out the numbers for a dinner with friends they re now married with a three year old daughter there have been huge hurdles though haga broke his back while working as a jockey i couldn t walk for

foods no spills or shakes and the pair like to explore vegan eateries in the neighbourhood together here are some of their favourites which i discover while joining them on a vegan tour of newtown its high density of plant based pit stops has led to the suburb s main drag being called the vegan mile herb fresh falafel at khmasa cafe edwina pickles advertisement local knowledge khamsa cafe is sydney s only palestinian eatery and it happens to be vegan too my first palestinian food was from khamsa says ozone the cafe is near comeco foods and while technically in erskineville it often gets counted in newtown s vegan mile along king street owner sarah shaweesh offers mushroom powered musakhan a palestinian dish typically made with sumac spiced chicken and iced nablus lattes with floral rosewater the creamy maple rich drink tastes like a middle eastern version of vietnamese coffee turmeric latte from khamsa cafe edwina pickles ozone is a fan of the herb fresh falafel here and admits it inspired the asian falafel on her comeco foods menu at khamsa she also enjoys the hummus plate with its garlic tahini yoghurt and fried pita bread advertisement haga is curious about the bestselling latte with freshly juiced turmeric its easy going mild flavour is more palatable than the mouthful of dirt aftertaste of ground turmeric shaweesh is a mutual supporter of comeco foods and admits to being delighted when a diner left their box of the japanese cafe s doughnuts behind at khamsa and never reclaimed it she enjoyed this lost property very much buddha bowl is known for its falafel waffles rhett wyman buddha bowl cafe is a vegan venue ozone visits nearly every week there are many gluten free options and that s one reason it s my favourite she says buddha bowl is a health focused place with kombucha on tap today it s ginger lime and salad packed dishes the cafe s specialty falafel waffles is loaded with herbed tahini dressing beetroot and carrot hummus dips black brown rice and a vinegary kale and lentil salad advertisement even my daughter loves it pink sauce yellow sauce green sauce says haga referring to the paintball like splodges of hummus and tahini owner adam chalk is known for his generosity his blue algae smoothie gets its ocean colour from organic spirulina it s 500 for half a kilo he says even after visiting for years they re still discovering new menu hits like tempeh skewers in herby lemon and garlic flavours and a chilli sweet gently spiced option tempeh might be known for its health cred rather than flavour but these skewers are a hit that was good tempeh ozone says photo supplied la petite fauxmagerie first existed as a stall at the monthly sydney vegan market their cheese toast is so popular and always has a big queue ozone says advertisement the full time store in newtown is run by michelle van rensburg who credits her family s anti apartheid protests in south africa as shaping her sense of ethics when growing up her partner

cheeses like feta pictured right la petite fauxmagerie also stocks small batch creations like cashew cheddar by tasmania s artisa smoked with local applewood it blows our mind ozone says the ingredients are very simple but it has stunning complex flavours could you imagine french pastries sculpted without butter cream and eggs you ll find a counter full of them at le gourmand a vegan patisserie run by a frenchman who used to be a seafood chef frederic mariage s plant based tribute to the rich food of his birthplace includes vegan macarons convincingly made with potato protein

something accessible to vegans six years ago i had only salad as an option when i went to a restaurant she says i felt isolated now she s proudly part of a multicultural community in newtown one of sydney s brightest meat free pockets where people are catered to regardless of their dietary restrictions or allergies figs radicchio dairy free blue cheese roasted pistachios and balsamic pizza at gigi pizzeria supplied advertisement also adam papastathopoulos knew giving up souvlaki was a big ask he enjoyed it at many family gatherings and this greek staple was what he d miss most after committing to a vegan diet his partner emma langley secretly mastered a plant based souvlaki and surprised him with it this led to their i should be souvlaki eatery a play on kylie minogue s song i should be so lucky they aptly pour her wines for diners the soy based vegan lamb with tzatziki and chipotle mayo is a delicious gluten free option ozone says while haga was amazed by the wheat based chicken souvlaki gigi pizzeria was accredited by naples associazione verace pizza napoletana for its traditional pizza long before founders marco and daniela matino controversially transformed it into a vegan restaurant in 2015 but given marinara pizza simply flavoured with tomato garlic and herbs was historically vegan to begin with maybe cheese free slices shouldn t be that polarising the dough and toppings are still brilliant with haga naming this his favourite pizzeria ozone appreciates the gluten free gnocchi and other wheat less options like schiacciata family run restaurant vina vegan opened in 2009 and its plant based takes on peking duck rolls pho and other noodle soups like vietnamese bun bo hue reflects the old school asian restaurants that defined vegan dining in sydney with mock meats aplenty and a buddhist omission of pungent ingredients like garlic and onions it still tastes delicious ozone says vandal taqueria joins the meatless mecca on king street chris grundy

do you have a good pension do you have any pension at all back in 1975 most americans who worked for established employers could say that they do indeed have a decent pension back then what the experts call defined benefit pension plans set the standard if you worked for a company with one of these plans you could look forward to receiving for every month of your retired life a pension check based on your salary and years of service these defined benefit plans gave employers the responsibility for funding their employee retirements employers contributed into retirement funds and used the investment returns these funds generated to keep pension checks flowing if those returns came up short employers had to fill the shortfall corporate execs not surprisingly didn t like bearing that risk over time they maneuvered to shift the pension risk onto employees mainly by substituting defined contribution plans for the defined benefit pensions that had their heyday in the decades after world war ii by the early 2000s pensions had essentially morphed into employer sponsored savings plans in this new defined contribution universe employees have been contributing their own dollars into their own personal retirement accounts with employers sometimes adding a bit of a match into the mix the employees get no guaranteed retirement check just the money contributed into their personal retirement account and whatever investment income the dollars in the account generate if those investments don t deliver tough luck for the employee in other words with 401 k s and other types of defined contribution plans workersbear all the economic risk and in times like today with a swooning stock market that risk looms large for the vast majority of american workers since as cnn reports only 4 percent of the nation s workforce now have their retirement relying on a defined benefit pension plan down from 60 percent in the early 1980s and what has this tilt toward 401 k s and the like meant for average working americans the national institute on retirement security addressed that question last year in a landmark study the united states the institute concluded has seen retirement security for many working families deteriorate in recent decades as collective sources of retirement income such as social security and pensions have been allowed to weaken while defined contribution plans have dominated the private sector this retreat from collective sources of retirement income does have its fans the affluent have benefited from 401 k s far more than average workers and that dynamic doesn t figure to change these affluent cnbc financial planning analyst kate dore observed earlier this month will always be more able to contribute substantial shares of their paychecks into their 401 k s allowing more time for compounded growth and greater tax benefits over time the greater tax benefits have added up over half the tax breaks for company retirement plans are now going to our top 10 percent of income earners in other words we re not growing retirement security in the united states today we re growing with our current approach to retirement greater overall economic inequality the already affluent have become more affluent and everyone else has become more insecure what else could we expect suggests tyler bond from the national institute on retirement security in a society where income and wealth have furiously concentrated at our economic summit a retirement system built around the individual ownership of financial assets cannot successfully provide retirement security bond notes if the bottom half of near retirees only owns 2 to 3 percent of their generation s financial assets so what can we do to start reversing the retirement status quo discussions of how to improve retirement security for all americans often ignore the fact that the united states already has a nearly universal retirement savings system social security note bond and his colleague dan doonan in a new national institute on retirement security study published last month a starting place for strengthening retirement security should be with social security in congress progressive lawmakers have just launched an effort to shove america in just that direction they ve introduced legislation the social security expansion act that would significantly increase the benefits that social security provides and pay for those benefits by increasing taxes on america s most wealthy an american making 147 000 currently pays 6 2 percent of that take home in social security payroll taxes but americans making 1 47 million pay just 0 6 percent of their income to social security excerpted can we ever retire to greater equality courtesy counterpunch org

inflation is the issue on the american people s minds which is a terrible and very bad thing for president joe biden his administration and the democratic party as a whole polls consistently show this to be the case the president s approval rating continues to go down indicating that the administration truly does not get the memo biden s approval rating according to realclearpolitics rcp stands at 39 7 percent while his approval rating on his handling of the economy is even worse at 33 6 percent this comes despite how white house director of the national economic council brian deese and treasury secretary janet yellen appeared on the sunday shows deese even made multiple appearances including on fox news sunday and cbs news face the nation while sec yellen showed up on abc news this week as has been the case for most of deese s media appearances his sunday show appearances proved to be a train wreck earlier on monday julio highlighted his performance on face the nation during which even host margaret brennan was not buying deese s excuses to give credit where it s due brennan early on pointed out that while joblessness is low a talking point the administration continuously touts wage growth not keeping pace with inflation as part of his response to that first question about what he would say to americans who are thinking that they might need a second job to pay their bills deese stuck to a popular line from this administration which is to claim that inflation is worse elsewhere despite economic data showing the united states has worse inflation compared to many other developed countries further as fox news martha maccallum told deese last week this isn t exactly something that s going to make the american people feel better a particularly telling moment which has been a hallmark of deese s media appearances is that he didn t have an actual timeline on policies that can actually provide actual relief despite talking about how they would work to control the things they can control as a way to gain back credibility on the issue well if we look at the things that we can control we win credibility deese before laughably claiming this president is acting when it comes to the job biden is doing brennan had asked multiple times times for a timeline when it comes to relief leading to deese bringing up a legislative package he claims will help by lowering the cost of prescription drugs utility costs and tax reform which will supposedly help or so we re told brennan was finally able to coax out of deese that he s hopeful that we can move that as well before the august recess brennan herself didn t sound so sure especially as she pointed to the failures of the build back better agenda item deese referred to the legislation as the single most impactful thing that we could do right now towards the end of the interview brennan called out president biden for dragging his feet on making a decision about tariffs with china one of the things that you do have control over at the executive is the approach on tariffs treasury secretary yellen told me back in november she acknowledged that the trump era china tariffs do add to inflation domestically here president was asked about this yesterday and said we are still in the process of making up my mind if inflation is the number one priority why are you dragging out this decision brennan asked how did deese respond by pointing out that i ll let the president s words speak for himself we re looking closely at and i anticipate the president will have more to say on that issue in the coming weeks in other words it wasn t much of an answer in november treasury sec yellen told margbrennan that the trump era tariffs on china do factor in america s inflation problem today nec dir deese says the biden administration may have a decision on what to do with those tariffs in the coming weeks pic twitter com iwjmj0ihvd face the nation facethenation june 19 2022 deese didn t fare much better on fox news sunday when he spoke with guest host shannon bream and discussed oil and the exorbitant gas prices which for that sunday came with an average price tag of 4 983 if there are practical things we can do we re willing to listen and willing to be open he claimed of the administration when it comes to working to lower prices deese made such a claim despite how biden signed an executive order his first day in office canceling the keystone xl pipeline sec yellen during her appearance on abc s this week was similarly asked by host george stephanopoulos about inflation gas prices and perhaps most tellingly about chances of there being a recession like a good soldier the secretary repeated the president s believe that a recession is not inevitable despite being confronted with numbers by a wall street journal poll that morning as i also covered that shows we are at a 44 percent chance of experiencing a recession the poll s write up stressed this as being alarmingly high well i expect the economy to slow it s been growing at a very rapid rate as the economy as the labor market has recovered and we have reached full employment it s natural now that we expect to transition to steady and stable growth but i don t think recession is at all inevitable yellen casually offered even when stephanopoulos asked about it merely being likely the secretary still did not seem perturbed and even discounted the chances of a recession she offered that bank balances are high it s clear that most consumers even lower income households continue to have buffer stocks of savings that will enable them to maintain spending so i don t see a drop off in consumer spending as a likely cause of the recession in the months ahead and the labor market is very strong arguably the strongest of the post war period yellen touted unemployment numbers but the poll warned unemployment may increase economists expect unemployment to rise as the fed raises rates although they see it staying at relatively low levels by historical comparison the write up from wall street journal mentioned treasury sec janet yellen tells gstephanopoulos that a recession isn t inevitable but says inflation is unacceptably high i expect the economy to slow pic twitter com ghuyndzage this week thisweekabc june 20 2022 to close the segment yellen was also asked by host george stephanopoulos about the tariffs as deese was her response was no more hopeful as she offered it s under consideration and i don t want to get ahead of where the policy process is
the reserve bank of australia rba has admitted that the exit of the yield curve policy in november last year was disorderly and triggered bond market volatility and dislocation in the market the experience caused some reputational damage to the bank the bank conceded in a report summarising its review into the use of the yield curve control policy which was introduced in march 2020 as part of a comprehensive package to support the economy through the effects of the pandemic at the time the bank announced it would keep buying enough government bonds to lower the cost of borrowing this saw the bank peg the three year bond rate to the cash rate target setting the yield target was viewed as an extension of and complement to the bank s longstanding approach of targeting the cash rate which forms the anchor point for the risk free term structure by targeting a risk free interest rate further out along the yield curve the bank s review said the rba then abruptly dumped the policy in november 2021 signalling that it was moving towards lifting the interest rate from its record low 0 1 per cent as a monetary policy tool the yield target contributed to insuring against extreme downside risk by lowering funding costs and reinforcing the other key elements of the package of policy measures the bank said the rba has now admitted that with the benefit of hindsight the yield target could have been ended earlier in retrospect given the evolution of inflation and the labour market an earlier end of the yield target would have been appropriate the bank said it conceded that the ending of the yield target was challenging for a number of financial market participants including those that expected the target to be retained as such this experience could lessen the effectiveness of any future commitments of this nature by the bank it continued the rba however seemingly defended its rash decision by reflecting on its global peers many other central banks have also been surprised by the strength in the economic recovery and inflation with associated reputational costs and large movements in market prices as forecasts and the forward guidance based on them have not been met the bank noted ultimately it said the degree of credibility and reputational cost from the yield target policy is likely to be determined by longer term outcomes and broader assessment of the package of policy measures and their effectiveness in contributing to attainment of the bank s goals the board views the probability of using a yield target again in future as low but recognises that the use of a yield target might be appropriate in extreme circumstances albeit in a form that incorporates the lessons learned from this experience it said different choices in the future speaking at an event hosted by the american chamber of commerce in australia on tuesday the governor of the rba philip lowe reflected on the bank s decision noting that while it did help the economy recover from the pandemic these benefits did come with complications if similar circumstances were to arise in the future the board would likely make different choices dr lowe said it s important to remember that at the time that the target was adopted there were credible forecasts that tens of thousands of australians would die in the next few months that the demand for hospital beds would exceed our capacity and that a vaccine would be years away the unemployment rate was also expected to reach double digit levels perhaps 15 per cent and there were fears of a deep and long downturn of scaring to the economy and that a generation of australians would have years of lost opportunity dr lowe said but he added in hindsight it can be agreed that there was too much focus on the downside risk to the economy the rba is expected to be subjected to an independent review shortly last month some of australia s top economists penned a letter to treasurer jim chalmers demanding that a review of the rba be headed by an internationally recognised foreign expert full independence is crucial if the review is to make the most of this unique opportunity no institution can be expected to independently or credibly review itself the group of 12 leading economists including deloitte access partner chris richardson leading independent economist saul eslake and grattan institute chief executive danielle wood said a foreign perspective would bring valuable external scrutiny to the process and enable a benchmarking of the rba against its overseas counterparts the rba has not been subject to a review since the early 1980s

that the world trade organization was able to come to any kind of deal at its 12th ministerial meeting last week was something of a miracle the organization has been dead for years as a location for trade governance and even longer as a place for successful negotiations in fact reports of the wto s continued existence are greatly exaggerated until the two most influential trading powers in the world the united states and china commit to reform the organization will continue to decline into irrelevance it is true that the deals struck last week mark two major steps forward for the wto while an agreement to limit subsidies for commercial fishing may have ended up much more modest in scope than originally envisaged it injects the question of environmental sustainability into global trade policy for the first time most developing countries have long preferred to address environmental issues separately through the united nations correctly viewing them as a possible source of non tariff barriers against emerging economy exporters the second sign of progress was china s tacit acceptance that it cannot always and perpetually claim the special benefits granted to developing economies at the wto the vaccine ip waiver countries agreed upon effectively excluded large exporters in this case china from benefiting though china accepted the restriction voluntarily it sets an important precedent the big question at the wto for most developing countries is this how can they preserve their own special rights while ensuring that china which has already benefited more than its fair share from the wto does not under current rules this can only happen with chinese acquiescence and this is the first time we have seen signs that china accepts its dominance of global goods trade means it must surrender some special protections for the wto to reclaim relevance and the faith of the developing world it will in the future need to codify china s new status but that will not be enough the other stumbling block to truly reviving the wto is the united states which under president joe biden has retained the previous administration s obstructive approach to global trade the biden administration s backing of a vaccine ip waiver was hardly a concession throughout the pandemic the bigger obstacle to getting shots in the world s arms was hoarding by the us and others alongside supply chain disruptions through misuse of legislation such as the defense production act more critically the us still hasn t repaired the damage it s done by vetoing nominees to the wto s appellate body until it does the wto will not be able to fulfill its central duty to resolve international trade disputes western trade officials and analysts like to focus their ire at countries such as india portrayed as obstructionist for wanting to maintain its oversized foodgrain stocks yet it s absurd to act like that s a giant worry in 2022 when the real issue is india s unwillingness to export wheat at a time of rising prices not the possibility that it might dump subsidized stocks on world markets in fact india and other developing countries are being far more cooperative on trade than the us or china india diluted its opposition to mixing environment and trade by allowing the fishing subsidies agreement to go through and its objections to the original text which effectively made no distinctions between enormous subsidies paid to industrial fishing fleets and the tiny amount 15 a year per person that india gives its largely underproductive fishing communities were entirely reasonable the developed world isn t going to be able to force any more cooperation from india or any other emerging economy than it saw at this ministerial meeting it s time for others to take on the responsibility for re animating the wto china has benefited far more from the wto than any other trading nation it should step up and take responsibility for keeping the organization afloat by redefining its role and the us concerned that it is being exploited by other countries trade policies must renew its commitment to wto arbitration if the global trading order is to survive it isn t indian or developing world intransigence that is keeping the wto close to death it is the entitlement of china and the us
a constant and largely unquestioned refrain in foreign policy is that the world has globalized closets are full of clothes stitched in other countries electronics and cars are often assembled far from where consumers live u s investment flows into asian markets and indians decamp to the united states for graduate school the numbers show the magnitude of international exchange trade among all countries hovers around 20 trillion a nearly tenfold increase from 1980 international capital flows also grew exponentially during that period from 500 billion a year to well over 4 trillion and nearly five times as many people are traveling across borders compared with four decades ago it is however misleading to claim that this flow of goods and services and people is always global in scale globalization as commonly understood is mostly a myth the reality is far closer to regionalization when companies supply chains and individuals go abroad they don t go just anywhere more often than not they stay fairly close to home consider trade if long distances didn t affect international sales the typical journey for any given purchase would be some 5 300 miles the average distance between two randomly selected countries instead half of what is sold abroad travels less than 3 000 miles not much farther than a flight across the united states and certainly not far enough to cross oceans a study by the logistics company dhl and scholars at the nyu stern school of business concluded if one pair of countries is half as distant as another otherwise similar pair of countries this greater physical proximity alone would be expected to increase the merchandise trade between the closer pair by more than three times companies forays abroad have been more regional than global as well a study of the fortune global 500 a list of the world s largest companies shows that two of every three dollars of their sales come from their home regions a study of 365 prominent multinationals found that just nine of them were truly global meaning that asia europe and north america each accounted for at least 20 percent of their sales additionally the oft repeated term global supply chains is a misnomer the making of things across borders tends to be even more regional than the buying and selling of finished products the pieces and parts that come together in modern manufacturing are more likely to be shipped between neighboring countries than from farther away international capital flows are also more regional than global cross border buyers of stocks bonds and other financial instruments don t invest as far away as one would expect given how global their options are on average going no more than the distance between tokyo and singapore foreign direct investment tends to follow trade over half of all cross border financing circulates solely within the european union and lending borrowing and foreign direct investment in asia by asian banks and companies is on the rise people tend to orient their lives regionally as well most people never leave their own countries and for those who do travel abroad well over half never leave their regions the vast majority of travelers taking european vacations are european the same goes for people in asia and north america those who move permanently abroad also tend to stick close to their countries of origin the majority don t leave their immediate region and although students who venture internationally tend to go farther than other travelers 40 percent don t leave the geographic area in which they were born over half the international flows of goods money information and people occurs within three main regional hubs asia europe and north america the economic rise of china south korea taiwan and vietnam began with regional investments and inputs eastern europe s fast paced growth came from linking to western europe between 1993 and 2007 mexico s economy more than doubled in size thanks in large part to the north american free trade agreement nafta reached in 1993 with canada and the united states the overlooked reality of regionalization has implications for u s policy although nafta was revised in 2020 it is now the u s mexico canada agreement usmca the north american hub is still not as integrated as that of its east asian and european counterparts in industries for which north american regional supply chains developed and solidified such as vehicles and aerospace local production maintained its edge but in other sectors including electronics and textiles north america s more limited regionalization led whole industries to move wherever regional links provided a leg up ideally the united states would be inking international trade deals to expand its market access and pursue its geopolitical aims such as countering china s rise that does not appear politically possible at the moment however a more viable policy would be to fortify and tap the united states regional network that would allow washington to access a broader swath of the global marketplace and stave off losing more of its competitive advantage to countries that are expanding their own regional footprints why regional trumps global the major reason networks skew regional is simple geography matters even with massive container ships moving things across oceans still costs time and money a transatlantic voyage adds a week to delivery and a trip across the pacific ocean adds a month before parts or goods show up in u s warehouses and factories that means producers and stores need to maintain larger inventories of goods that come from far away and it is not only cargo that can be delayed or lost when trade takes place over great distances even with virtually free calls video and file sharing the inherent difficulty of communicating and coordinating across space and time can add to the costs of doing business language and cultural cues vary by country and these differences often grow with distance this is one reason that a quarter of trade happens among countries that share a language legal codes and administrative norms also tend to be more similar the closer countries are eliminating the need for duplicate teams of lawyers accountants and human resources specialists and the intangible but vital task of finding things in common and building trust and understanding for teamwork can get harder as the distance between people grows the oft repeated term global supply chains is a misnomer trade pacts as well tend to be regional although the 1990s saw the creation of the world trade organization wto and the expansion of its membership and oversight powers what has been as important if not more so over the last 30 years has been the proliferation of bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements which tend to involve countries in the same region european countries turned first to each other for trade brazil joined with argentina paraguay and uruguay after reaching a bilateral trade deal with israel the united states turned to canada and mexico and later to ten other nations in the western hemisphere asian nations banded together through the free trade area of the association of southeast asian nations and later the regional comprehensive economic partnership rcep global arrangements such as the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership cptpp the successor to a pact that was engineered by washington but that the united states later abandoned are so far more the exception than the rule companies see differences in their bottom lines depending on their geographic dispersion many have gone abroad to boost their earnings benefiting from the cross country advantages of differential skills and wage costs yet go too far and costs begin to rise again in 2010 an academic study of 123 u s multinationals found that returns on assets improved as companies expanded internationally within their region but declined when they ventured farther from home the management consulting group mckinsey company dubs this the globalization penalty finding in a survey of 500 multinational corporations that earnings diminished as operations spread out it seems the optimal distance for private sector profits is a goldilocks zone not too close but not too far the rule of three the strength of the regional networks that a country belongs to are therefore particularly important and in this regard european countries are well situated although brexit and mounting populist euroskepticism may make the eu appear fragile the european continent is in fact the most integrated region in the world the deep ties that connect its countries are rooted in over a half century of diplomatic bargains that created a single market a common passport and a shared currency today europeans make things together and sell to one another with nearly two thirds of eu trade staying within the union similarly internal european investment exceeds that from the rest of the world by 50 percent asia is not far behind in its integration according to the asian development bank the proportion of the region s trade that takes place internally has risen from 45 percent in 1990 to nearly 60 percent today surpassing north america and closing in on europe decades of export oriented development propelled by asian business leaders and backed by bureaucrats tied country after country together through production supply chains asian countries make things together and increasingly buy from one another nearly one third of asian finished goods are sold to consumers in the region extreme weather will upend logistics as ports flood and rails buckle north america s countries have also deepened their economic ties to one another in the wake of nafta trade between canada mexico and the united states rose fourfold outpacing that between those countries and ones outside the region investment too became more regional particularly for mexico where since nafta s signing in 1993 one of every two dollars flowing in has come from its neighbors in particular north america s agricultural and advanced manufacturing supply chains expanded and strengthened over the course of the 1990s leading regional commerce to jump by more than a quarter this integration didn t last however after china s 2001 accession to the wto regional exchanges dwindled falling from around 47 percent of the continent s total trade in 2000 to a low of 39 percent in 2009 before recovering slightly to around 40 percent by 2018 still although north america s internal connections remain significantly less robust than those in asia and europe they far outstrip those among the countries of africa latin america the middle east and south asia regions where less than a quarter of trade and investment occurs between neighbors just in time during the covid 19 pandemic border closures and rising transportation costs have prompted companies to consider bringing production closer to home governments have suddenly become keen to exercise more control over international supply chains for pharmaceutical and medical products at the same time ongoing technological innovation has made it easier for the private sector to expand production in different geographic neighborhoods automation in particular is making far flung factories and supply chains less vital and less profitable than in the past as sensors increasingly monitor assembly lines and equipment and robots and other forms of mechanization take over many manufacturing processes and tasks wages make up a smaller part of operating costs that development has diminished at least in part the once strong draw of locations with cheap labor new ways of making things such as 3 d or additive printing are also changing manufacturing processes making small batch production runs more affordable and reducing the need for specialized factories these advances lower the numbers of workers that companies need and change the skill sets they seek in many sectors skilled and higher paid technicians have become far more important than line workers that shift diminishes the advantages of economies of scale enabling at least some companies to move production closer to consumers without sacrificing profits the value of time is growing too as consumers expect faster delivery and near immediate gratification the longer lead times for goods produced by factories thousands of miles away can mean lost sales the popularity of customized products also makes mass producing facilities abroad less relevant than in the past moreover demographic shifts are raising the low wages that once drew so many companies to developing countries in china the great migration that brought over 200 million workers from the hinterlands to manufacturing centers has largely ended after decades of strict family planning more workers are now exiting the labor market than entering it this trend looks set to accelerate the national workforce is expected to shrink by 100 million people over the next 20 years working age populations are contracting throughout much of asia limiting labor pools and driving up wage rates across electronics and other supply chains in europe working age populations are in decline or appear to be headed that way millions of hungarians romanians and other eastern europeans have headed to their western neighbors in search of better pay and opportunities and an influx of migrants and more recently refugees is only partly replenishing workforces another factor curbing globalization is climate change extreme weather will increasingly upend logistics as ports flood rails buckle and airplanes are more frequently grounded by storms longer supply chains increase these vulnerabilities and potential costs meanwhile policies designed to slow the planet s warming by cutting emissions are raising global transportation prices incentivizing companies to manufacture goods closer to consumer markets the power of politics it s not just technological and demographic shifts and climate change that will curb globalization and favor more regionalization political change is playing a role as well after decades of opening up to the world economy many countries are pulling back the global trade alert a nonprofit that tracks and collates trade policies from official sources around the world has calculated that since the 2008 global financial crisis new protectionist measures have outpaced liberalizing ones three to one meanwhile the wto has been sidelined it is no longer the forum to negotiate new trade rules its efforts to reshape global trade ended in 2015 when the so called doha round of talks sputtered to a close more niche efforts such as attempts to reduce fishing subsidies in mostly rich nations are struggling since 2018 the wto has been unable to punish countries that break the rules as the united states under both the trump and the biden administrations has refused to approve new judges to its appellate body instead regional accords have stepped in to govern international trade the usmca regulates north america s trade ties and arbitrates disputes in asia the rcep now governs commercial exchanges among 15 countries removing most tariffs and combining rules of origin requirements to favor regional supply chains the african continental free trade area agreement aspires to do something similar replacing a tangle of bilateral rules and regulations with a single almost continent wide commercial system regional accords now set the rules for more than half the world s trade regionalization not globalization will set the corporate agenda in the coming decades geopolitical tensions threaten to fragment international commerce even further economic competition has become a pillar of great power rivalry with industrial policy back in vogue many countries including the united states are throwing up protectionist barriers the u s government has identified semiconductors large capacity batteries pharmaceuticals and dozens of critical minerals as vital to national security and is now implementing policies and spending tens of billions of dollars to expand stockpiles beef up manufacturing capacity at home and in friendly nations and redraw global supply chains in these designated sectors countries everywhere are drawing up their own lists some of them adding information and data flows fragmenting cross border flows of services as governments work to reshape the business environment across more industries they are also implicitly or explicitly asking other countries to choose sides through export controls and other mechanisms this will further limit international ties the push to reshore critical products and services is underway almost everywhere but what most countries will find is that outside of a few highly sensitive or vital products companies can t or won t bring production back home those that try to do so are more likely to go bust as costs rise and innovation falls the most probable scenario is that multinationals will turn away from globalized supply chains in favor of shorter more duplicative regional ones regionalization not globalization will set the corporate agenda in the coming decades america s advantage many of these technological demographic and policy shifts favor the united states the declining importance of cheap wages and the rising role of skilled labor should advantage better paid u s workers a trove of intellectual property and intangible assets including several of the new technologies transforming work and workplaces will allow many u s based companies to reap outsize benefits abundant financing means more discoveries more patents and more products the united states also boasts clear laws and regulatory regimes which is why so many investors prefer stocks and bonds issued under new york law and a generally receptive and entrepreneurial business environment for all these reasons the u s economy should fare well in this next round of globalization still washington s advantages aren t immutable other countries are also investing in education research and development and advancing their own technologies and national corporate champions moreover the next billion new buyers of cars clothes and computers will be in asia where middle classes are growing faster than in any other region to tap into this growth u s multinationals and exporters will need to adapt to effectively compete the united states should pursue reforms at home to take better care of its people and workers and to prepare them for a more fluid and volatile economic future this will require expanding safety nets ensuring labor rights and improving educational opportunities that upgrade americans skills domestic infrastructure also needs an upgrade to lower logistical costs that weigh down american made goods the 1 2 trillion set aside in the 2021 infrastructure investment and jobs act to pay for improvements to highways bridges electric grids and broadband is a good start more public spending for basic science and research and development should follow to usher in cutting edge scientific breakthroughs and technologies in addition to getting its own house in order the united states needs a more strategic approach to trade one of the country s challenges is the eroding price competitiveness of its exports in an increasing number of international markets the countries to which the united states enjoys preferred access account for less than 10 percent of the world s gdp and few of them are among the fastest growing markets as other countries have formed and joined trade accords the cost of u s exports has risen in relative terms because of the rcep cars assembled in japan and south korea no longer face the double digit tariffs that u s manufactured alternatives still confront in the region and chinese steel chemicals and machines all face lower levies than options made in the united states in an ideal world the united states would pursue a robust and comprehensive trade agenda joining the cptpp restarting negotiations over the transatlantic trade and investment partnership which would have linked the u s and eu markets and revitalizing the wto would open up more markets to u s goods and services and reinforce more transparent fair and environmentally friendly ways of doing business the united states would also do well to regain its leadership in international standard setting bodies restoring its traditional role as a rule maker and not just rule taker a production line in production line in shenzhen china september 2019 jason lee reuters but until the politics of trade change in the united states none of that is likely to occur in the meantime washington can benefit by turning to its neighbors canada and mexico have preferred access to many global markets where the united states pays full fare their respective portfolios of free trade agreements each cover some 1 5 billion consumers representing nearly 60 percent of global gdp feeding into canadian or mexican manufacturing supply chains can give u s producers and parts makers preferential access to the world s consumers which they currently lack on their own for instance mexican made cars sold in europe dodge the ten percent tariff u s made models face lowering the sticker price by some 3 000 on a ford focus and by over 4 000 on an audi q5 a savings that makes it hard for u s carmakers to compete the opposite is true for u s based parts makers mexican plants can source up to 40 percent of their europe bound models from suppliers in countries that are not part of the bargain that means imported mexican made cars sold in france or germany also keep u s factories humming in today s more regionally focused world exports are more competitive when countries make them together much of germany s touted international commercial success has resulted from its regional manufacturing ties by seeding plants and operations throughout eastern europe germany s private companies the famed mittelstand have bolstered the country s manufacturing base and created jobs at home as their products have thrived on global markets china s spectacular rise and export dynamism similarly has depended largely on its incorporation into regional supply chains if the united states wants to help its companies replicate these successes it also needs a regional approach regionalization brings competitive advantages that a single country even one as large and wealthy as the united states cannot match on its own to make products as good affordable and fast as the competition u s companies need to be able to source parts from many places and complete some tasks and processes in other countries a regional commercial strategy will also help more work stay on the continent and thus in the united states when part of production is located in canada or mexico u s suppliers are more likely to keep or gain contracts and remain in business than when production moves overseas and when orders rise so do jobs all along the supply chain the organization for economic cooperation and development estimates that on average nearly 40 percent of the value of u s imports from mexico is created in the united states for canada that figure is just over 25 percent conversely u s input into imports from the rest of the world averages just 4 4 percent reflecting how few u s based suppliers are part of the global production process to enhance north america s regionalization the continent needs to improve its linking infrastructure this means adding land crossings upgrading thoroughfares that lead to and away from the border expanding rail lines and depots and investing in people and technology to staff and to support ports of entry with faster connections and lower logistical costs manufacturers in north america can make products that are more globally competitive a more competitive north american economy is possible as parts and components move between the three countries workers must be able to follow more and easier legal work based migration paths are needed to make the region as a whole more productive and they will require transferable credentials licenses and diplomas business visas and longer term migration avenues greater coordination in education and training can help address gaps in skill and improve work environments to ensure that north america s population growth already a bright spot for the region continues educational exchanges language learning and cross border apprenticeships and skill development programs can all help build a continental workforce better able to entice new businesses and investment stiffening migration barriers will just lead more firms to go elsewhere and as the u s government rolls out industrial policies to increase the resilience of and access to a host of critical supply chains its neighbors can help geographic diversification can offset the risks that natural disasters and accidents pose to stockpiles and production capacity regional manufacturing can lower the public financial burden of subsidies as goods are more likely to attain a higher quality at lower cost when drawing on a cross border network of suppliers north america s regional trade has recovered albeit slightly from a 2009 nadir of just 39 cents of every dollar thanks to expanding textile machinery and produce supply chains but no north american leader is prioritizing a continental commercial future mexico is turning inward with energy and natural resource nationalism threatening its manufacturing base canada is looking to diversify its international commercial ties by reaping the benefit of trade deals with the united kingdom and the european union and in asia as a member of the cptpp and the biden administration is guided by another repeated but unsubstantiated refrain that nafta and other trade agreements hurt rather than help u s workers that is misguided most of the studies trashing nafta don t calculate the better paid export oriented jobs gained as a result of more favorable terms in the united states two biggest export markets nor do they consider how lower north american production costs kept industries such as auto manufacturing alive and even allowed them to thrive in the face of global price competition from vehicles manufactured in other rival regional hubs through integration a more competitive north american economy is possible three decades of freer trade the existence of sophisticated supply chains in specific sectors and widespread cross border ties between communities and workers due to the movement of tens of millions of people could be energized and expanded but deeper more sustainable regionalization will also require a change in mindset it will require recognizing that the united states middle and working class would prosper more from engagement in the global economy than they would from a retreat to the domestic market americans could gain more jobs profits and financial security if their country decided to take what is on offer a slice of a large and growing economic pie

over the past week florida governor ron desantis and state health authorities have declined to pre order and approve mrna covid 19 shots for children aged 6 months to 5 years setting off a wave of outrage and opposition among parents to the governor s anti scientific repudiation of vaccines in a statement wednesday the florida department of health which is overseen by desantis office declared it did not place orders for the federal government to ship vaccine doses for pediatric patients because it has not advised that all children become vaccinated desantis and state surgeon general dr joseph ladapo have justified their denial of vaccines with talking points common of the far right including an entirely phony concern for the health of small children without offering a shred of real evidence desantis claimed that the u s food and drug administration s authorization of the moderna and pfizer biontech vaccines for children was aimed mainly at reducing parent s fears about the virus florida gov ron desantis speaks at the conservative political action conference cpac feb 24 2022 in orlando fla at an event last friday desantis categorically denied claims from the biden white house that there had been a change in policy by the state to administer vaccinations for toddlers and infants we are not going to have any programs where we re trying to jab 6 month old babies with mrna he declared that s just the reality i think what they thought would happen was that we d be embarrassed about it the governor also denounced the media saying definitely not surprised that legacy media would amplify the life because that s what they do desantis admitted he regretted state authorities had no authority to prevent practitioners and hospitals from ordering the vaccines but that this was no cause to believe somehow we ve reversed the doh s anti vaccination policies desantis remarks at the press conference ranged from unsubstantiated claims about european handling of the vaccines to baseless pseudo science the governor said florida had been watching the policies of european countries and taking cues from them he claimed some countries don t allow moderna for under age 30 or they recommend against it but refused to list any of the countries he was referring to specifically before highlighting that as a reason not to order any children s doses of the mrna vaccines the fascistic opposition to child vaccinations comes amid an alarming shift in the pandemic as florida reached the harrowing milestone this week of 75 000 deaths while covid hospitalizations are rising to levels last experienced during florida s winter surge as of friday more than 3 500 patients were in florida hospitals for covid 19 up from 3 200 patients a week ago and barely 1 000 covid patients in early april for the week ending on june 16 florida reported 74 323 confirmed new covid cases up from about 60 000 per week just a month ago these numbers are believed to be a vast undercount since state statistics do not include the people who are confirming infections using at home tests health experts note that at least four highly infectious strains of the deadly omicron variant are circulating in florida at this time the highly transmissible ba 2 12 1 omicron subvariant the ba 2 subvariant as well as newcomers ba 4 and ba 5 the entire record of desantis throughout the pandemic has been to staunchly oppose all impingements on the profits of big business not only banning mandatory vaccinations in workplaces but also prohibiting mask wearing in schools and rejecting the closure of all non essential businesses the latest far right assault on child vaccinations flows logically from the demands of the democratic and republican parties that schools be fully reopened so parents could return to work and that lockdowns be ended the capitalist politicians articulate the interests of corporations and the super wealthy who see any limitation to business activity as an intolerable barrier to the production of profit and who call for letting the disease rip through communities without restraint in seeking to further burnish his credentials among the extreme right desantis is opposing even the limited and ineffective mitigation policies of the democrats they long ago abandoned all essential public health measures meant to contain the spread of covid 19 and embraced the strategy of herd immunity which means the normalization of continued death from the disease desantis decision not to order child vaccines by last week s federal deadline and the demented anti vaxx conspiracy theories accompanying this stand sharply at odds with the scientific research supporting the deployment of vaccines for children florida remains the only state in the country that has refused to pre order shots for infants and preschoolers as state pediatricians and hospitals were forced to begin making their own order requests directly from the federal government although desantis could not forbid health care providers to order the newly authorized vaccines florida won t be included in the first two waves of vaccine shipments delaying their arrival at pediatricians offices and hospitals only large scale pharmacies like cvs and walgreens that participate in a federal program will get vaccines in the first wave at the friday press conference desantis referenced an examination of the fda s study by dr ladapo claiming the surgeon general had supposedly proved the vaccine had given no proven benefit for babies joe ladapo our department of health has looked at it there is no proven benefit to put a baby with an mrna so that s why our recommendation is against it that s different from prohibiting the use of it he declared but desantis himself acknowledged the study established effectiveness of the vaccines for younger children moreover neither desantis nor ladapo have offered up any credible evidence that the vaccines pose a risk to the health of infants and toddlers barring state programs for covid vaccines means florida s county health departments which are state agencies won t receive any shipments of the vaccines for children under 5 because state health officials refuse to recommend them the refusal to stock the vaccines at local health departments will have a devastating impact on working class families and the most vulnerable who rely on the cheaper costs and subsidies from state programs for medical services there is outrage among parents and the public as a whole over the criminally indifferent policies that will exacerbate the spread of the disease and place untold numbers of small children at risk lisa gwynn the academy of florida chapter president said our phones are ringing off the hook with concerned parents eager to know where they can get the vaccine right now she continued we don t have a good answer refusing to enact state programs for the distribution of vaccines will place all the burden on doctors and individual pharmacies which will place a heavy strain on health services and disrupt their distribution according to gwynn florida s vaccine distribution system is state based and not designed to allow individual doctors and institutions to order directly from manufacturers gwynn noted further the state s decision to obstruct access to covid 19 vaccines is anti science an affront to parental rights and an intrusion into the relationship between doctors patients and the families they serve
