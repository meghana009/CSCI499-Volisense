jay since winning the state competition in june the spruce mountain high school green team has been busy preparing for the national conservation foundation envirothon at miami university in oxford ohio july 24 30 on wednesday july 13 the team shared a presentation similar to one they will give at the upcoming competition for their current issue scenario they explained various factors involved in the waste management plan they had developed for dayton ohio the presentation was about twice as long as the 20 minutes allowed at the national competition envirothon is kind of a strange thing team advisor rob taylor said it is very very hard to describe to people what we actually do envirothon has five areas soils forestry aquatics wildlife those happen every year then there is a fifth called current issue the topic changes each year the current issue this year is waste to resources the kids are given a problem scenario and they have to develop a solution taylor said envirothon is meant to be very very place specific when we do envirothon here in maine we learn about maine fish soils and forests for maine teams were asked to pretend they were environmental scientists working for a lake association to develop a waste management plan for that watershed advertisement will be going to ohio a week from saturday basically they had to relearn everything from the ground up taylor said instead of knowing maine trees they need to know all the trees of ohio there are 69 different species of trees in ohio about 30 of those are in maine too there are 39 species we don t even have the same thing with ohio s wildlife aquatics soils half of ohio soils are unglaciated completely different kind of soils than we have in maine because all of maine is glaciated soil there are other differences at the national competition for the current issue for regional and state competitions teams are given the problem scenario ahead of time determine their solution prior to competing and use posters to explain their approach a week from next thursday will get locked in a dorm room without advisors and given the prompt scenario taylor said they will have two to three hours training with resource professionals explaining the scenario giving them information that they can use then they spend the next seven hours trying to solve this problem they will be given a computer without internet access can use power point in their presentation they will be given a stock set of images or can create their own smhs computers do not have power point so the team has been working to familiarize themselves with that program advertisement based on my previous experiences in order to be successful at these events you need to know the answer before you get the question taylor noted they need to be ready to solve this problem before really knowing what the problem is mr baker and i took a guess we are hoping it will resemble what they will be given in ohio taylor said dayton is near where the team will be in ohio and is urban in nature which he expects the current issue to focus on he said the scenario given to the team was made very broad intentionally to expose the team to every possibility that could show up we have been working on this since school ended we met with two people working with the state legislature he said maine is the first in the nation to require that the company that produces packaging waste has to pay for the disposal of that packaging the kids have spent a lot of time learning about all these things we don t want the kids going into a situation they are not ready for team member leah burgess explained the goals and objectives of the management plan implement a sustainable plan advertisement apply state of the art waste reduction and handling practices consider the needs of stakeholders reduce production of greenhouse gasses and address climate change consider how actions will affect or benefit the gulf of mexico assure the plan can be easily replicable to improve waste management beyond dayton team members burgess brendan veillieux dan wilson abrahm geissinger and owen schwab each took turns sharing specifics of the plan advertisement parents students and others scored the presentation using the score sheet that will be used in ohio a question and answer period was held afterwards q and a may be just as important if not more so taylor said the judges want you to think on your feet developing public speaking skills is an important part of envirothon when asked how inflation might impact suggested management programs owen said companies like mcdonald s work in more than one state and the costs of programs would be used to help other things in people s lives leah noted inconsistencies are seen with each town doing things differently there is no benefit to recycling she said brendan emphasized the importance of educating young people taylor said liz grondin who was part of the team at regional and state competitions is unable to travel with the team to ohio brendan has stepped up to take her spot he added taylor said this is the 12th time one of his teams has won the state competition taylor taught for jay prior to the consolidation that created regional school unit 73 send questions comments to the editors filed under

nine news reported a dire prediction from anz bank that most mortgagees really won t want to hear i think they ll be proved wrong but let s see what this economics team is saying and compare it to the view of 32 of the country s top economists it s always surprises me how the media never reminds big call merchants who so often get it so wrong just how wrong they ve been as someone who s expected to make calls on the economy and markets i know how hard getting it right can be but i so believe if we praise those who get it right we should also point out when some big calls were unnecessarily negative or positive this is what nine news reported and what ben fordham on 2gb asked me to comment on this morning interest rates could rise another four times before christmas according to one of australia s big four banks painting a bleak picture for homeowners as cost of living pressures already squeeze the family budget anz on tuesday predicted interest rates could rise by 50 basis points in august september october and november which would leave the cash rate at 3 35 per cent that means the average sydney mortgage holder could pay another 1 300 per month that adds 15 600 a year to repayments and if the rba does that by year s end dr phil lowe boss of the rba would go close to creating a recession in 2023 when the rba meets on august 2 i expect another 0 5 rate rise for the cash rate of interest and probably another in september but then i m guessing dr phil will hold fire to see what his rate rises do to inflation the economy and the jobless rate he ll also look at consumer and business confidence as well as the inflation expectations of consumers which on last reading were heading down here and in the us as a reminder the current cash rate is 1 35 and if you add in four 0 5 rises that takes it to 3 35 that s my best guess but what are 32 of our top economists surveyed by the afr a couple of weeks ago saying about the cash rate by december 2023 let s see what these economists predicted 1 not one economist agrees with this call 2 three economists saw the cash rate at 3 1 3 the median call was 2 35 which is a lot less than 3 35 4 three economists had the cash rate under 2 5 16 economists were perched between 2 1 and 2 35 the team at anz may have been influenced by the latest unemployment number which saw the jobless rate fall from 3 9 to 3 5 this fall could easily have made them push up their inflation forecast which then became a higher cash rate than they were expecting by christmas but i think they ve gone too far if the average mortgage holder is set to lose an extra 15 500 to the banks each year to cover their loan this will really hurt retail and services businesses it would also escalate the chances of 32 out of 32 economists being wrong on their no recession call over 2022 and 2023 i m expecting 2023 to be an economic rebound year hopefully sparked by the end of the ukraine war and substantially lower oil prices which will help lower our petrol and power bills i also expect china will be out of lockdown and us president biden will be trying to win back friends and influence voters following his collapse in the popularity polls since inflation climbed to 9 1 history shows the us stock market does best in years three and four of a us presidency and stock prices need a good economy to feed into profits so i expect the white house will be in an economy friendly mood i also like this chart below it shows that after we beat lockdowns and other economic and business hurting events like real wars and trade wars economies rebound watch the economic activity tracker blue line see how it fell with lockdowns in march 2020 and july to september 2021 but how it rebounded once the lockdown and bad news ended i expect a 2023 rebound is a very good chance but too many interest rate rises from the rba could spoil all that

a corn field near snook dries down for harvest early indications suggest corn and sorghum grain yields will be poor to below average texas a m agrilife photo by courtney sacco mark welch ph d agrilife extension grain economist in the department of agricultural economics bryan college station said texas appears to be facing much lower grain production in 2022 compared to the previous year the likely outcomes coupled by high demand are putting a premium on grain prices despite recent dips in the market wheat yields were abysmal for much of the state he said corn and sorghum projections do not appear to be much better as producers in the southern half of the state continue harvesting cash wheat corn and sorghum grain prices are strong but not as strong as they had been in late may welch said for instance wheat prices were 3 86 per bushel in august 2020 before starting a steady climb to more than 8 per bushel prior to the feb 24 russian invasion of ukraine prices quickly jumped to more than 11 per bushel before peaking at 12 62 per bushel on may 26 cash wheat prices have fallen relatively quickly to 8 27 per bushel on july 14 corn and sorghum grain prices took a similar path though the post invasion spike was less dramatic corn climbed from 3 41 per bushel in february to around 6 50 per bushel before the invasion corn prices peaked at 8 92 per bushel by june but fell back to 6 48 per bushel as of july 14 cash prices for feed grade grain in texas are still at a premium he said we re still living on supplies and harvests in southern parts of the state are trickling in but yields are below average heat drought taking a toll the coastal bend and south texas corn and sorghum crop harvests are well underway but the heat and drought have taken their toll on grain production many producers from those regions were reporting below average to poor yields harvests from those regions are some of the first to hit the market and begin to replenish supplies welch said corn crop on july 18 2022 in snook texas courtney sacco texas a m agrilife marketing and communications many producers in regions where corn and sorghum plants are still progressing were reporting poor to fair crop conditions with some reports of fields being salvaged as forage for cattle it s just going to be a tough year for producers to find a profit he said grain prices are relatively high but input costs for everything from fuel to fertilizer are high too producers need every penny welch said cattle on feed and the short term feed demand spurred by drought stricken rangelands and pastures were contributing to the tightening supplies and higher grain prices agrilife extension reports from around the state indicate cattle producers were moving calves earlier and culling herds deeper than usual sale barns around the state have been reporting higher sale volumes over the last few months but high sale numbers are picking up in historically wetter parts of the state particularly east texas welch said feed use numbers have been strong this year for all livestock but cattle producers around the state are experiencing below average hay and grazing capacity the question is how long that can continue before cattle producers work the numbers or run out of grazing and supplemental feed substitutes they can use to efficiently feed grain he said uncertain future for crops prices the u s department of agriculture added around 400 000 acres of corn to its planted acre estimates in a recent report welch said growing conditions in the nation s corn belt are much better than last year and good crop ratings were emerging as well but western parts of the corn belt are experiencing high temperatures as the crop progresses through stages sensitive to heat how those acres fare will likely impact longer term yields and ultimately grain prices welch said the usda made the harvest area adjustment based on a june acreage survey but held the u s yield estimates for 2022 steady at 177 bushels per acre yield estimates remain unchanged since may further down the road is more uncertain he said we need every bushel and every acre the umbrella over all the markets is the economic slowdown and what that could do to demand on everything from corn to crude oil and cattle that is an overarching concern agrilife extension district reporters compiled the following summaries a map of the 12 texas a m agrilife extension districts central dry conditions continued soil moisture conditions were very short corn harvest was ongoing with below average yields reported cotton continued to hang on despite high temperatures and low soil moisture some sesame was planted almost a month ago over wheat stubble but had yet to emerge pasture conditions were very poor and continued to decline with high temperatures and limited rainfall cattle body condition scores were fair and beginning to decrease with less than ideal grazing conditions producers were feeding hay and other supplemental feed sources but were beginning to cull cattle due to drought stock tanks remained low or dry some producers were testing forages for prussic acid and dealing with new problems such as blue green algae in water sources and other issues that can arise during drought rolling plains weather was very hot and dry a storm did develop over some range country and lightning started multiple wildfires one fire burned around 750 acres dryland cotton was in very poor to poor condition with some reports of fields failing irrigated cotton was progressing with low insect pressure though stink bugs were reported in fields with beneficial insects present in some fields heavy numbers of grasshoppers were reported in some counties some sorghum fields were heading out and were fair overall many failed or poor sorghum and corn fields were expected to be salvaged for forage pastures were dried up and most producers were very short on hay producers reported very little hay for sale in the area cake and minerals were being fed to supplement cattle diets and herds were being culled no sudan grass had been planted to date coastal bend scattered rain fell in parts of the reporting area but dry conditions remained the isolated showers halted some corn and sorghum harvest operations cotton was nearing maturity with most fields showing open bolls rice was headed out most rangeland and pastures remained in poor condition livestock auctions remained busy as many producers were culling and weaning early supplementation of livestock was still required ponds were dry or very low east producers continued to struggle subsoil and topsoil moisture conditions were very short excessive heat and very little to no rainfall has put many of them in a bind hay production had all but stopped and yields have been 25 50 the normal amount producers were cutting and baling pastures normally used for grazing due to reduced herd numbers crops and pastures were burning up stock ponds and creeks were very low pasture and rangeland conditions were very poor to poor sale barns were reporting record numbers of cattle coming through due to producers culling or liquidating grasshoppers and bermuda grass stem maggots were causing a lot of damage in pastures south plains extreme drought conditions continued across the district about 90 of the dryland cotton was a loss and producers were filing insurance claims about 50 of the irrigated cotton was not going to make a viable crop either irrigated corn seemed to be the only crop in fair condition cattle producers were out of grazing and relying on supplemental feed cucumbers were being planted and emerging according to some producers cattle were in good condition panhandle soil moisture levels were very short to short scattered showers delivered trace amounts of rainfall up to half an inch temperatures were in the triple digits hot weather was drying soil irrigated cotton and corn were doing well with pivots running at full capacity corn was at stages ranging from silking to knee high there appeared to be less cotton in the area and fields were behind in growth stage producers hope sorghum hay and silage recently planted will make before the first freeze wheat harvest was complete with below average yields and 50 normal yields for many producers range grasses were dormant and overall rangeland and pasture conditions were very poor to poor north topsoil moisture throughout the district was very short to short due to the lack of rain heat and drought were contributing to dormant grasses and poor pasture conditions ponds getting low and hay getting scarce cattle producers began to reduce their herds due to a lack of forage stockyards were accepting cattle on off days in preparation for the sale to avoid lines and blocking traffic some soybean fields looked good but a large percentage were being harvested early for round bale forage corn cotton and sunflowers were still doing well in some places with no reports of major insect or disease issues far west temperatures were around 100 degrees daily with overnight lows around 75 degrees sporadic showers fell across the district ranging from no precipitation up to 2 inches reported weeds were blooming in several fields corn was basically finished and needed to dry down the melon harvest continued small acreage producers reported struggling to keep corn and watermelon alive due to poor water quality and dryness there were reports of rose rosette mozena obtusa and mesquite webworms livestock were being sold due to poor grazing conditions sheep and goats may stay a little longer west central some areas received rainfall but not enough to make a difference in the drought temperatures were hot and dry with most days over 100 degrees pastures were brown with little to no green grass the drought was beginning to impact trees some corn was being harvested for silage but the quality and yields were down sorghum was drying down fast and yields were expected to be low some irrigated cotton looked good but the majority was struggling in the heat as irrigation failed to meet crop water demand the pecan crop did not look promising livestock were in poor condition the local cattle auction ran about 1 000 head with at least half of that being cows from ranchers culling herds southwest parts of the district received less than 1 inch of rain high temperatures remained pasture and rangeland conditions remained poor corn and sorghum harvests were underway with poor yields reported pastures continued to decline and supplemental feeding of livestock continued south conditions remained hot and dry with triple digit temperatures soil moisture levels were very short to short across the district some spotty rain was reported with many areas catching zero rainfall and a few scattered areas receiving 1 2 inches some fields were saturated by rains in drier areas irrigation pivots were running most hours of the day to keep up with crop water demand peanuts were pegging but some fields looked moisture stressed cotton was blooming but some cotton fields were not expected to produce harvest worthy yields some cotton fields were showing 50 90 open bolls and producers were applying boll openers and defoliating some whitefly pressure was reported along the river corn and sorghum harvests were underway and nearing completion in some areas irrigation canals continued to provide water to watermelon and cantaloupe fields irrigated coastal bermuda grass was producing good bales and irrigated pecan orchards were in good shape as well citrus and sugarcane continued to receive irrigation rangeland and pasture conditions continued to decline but should improve in areas that received decent moisture hay fields were being prepared for the next cutting in some areas but bale production was down dramatically overall and supplies were tightening producers were feeding hay and supplements to cattle and feed and hay prices continued to climb local beef producers were thinning herds or liquidating completely and sale barns were reporting high volumes of cattle being marketed prices were steady but early weaned calves weighing less than 300 pounds were lower food plots of sorghum and sunflowers were failing

970 000 accounts announced tuesday july 19 2022 as part of netflix s second quarter earnings report is by far the largest quarterly subscriber loss in the company s 25 year history ap photo marcio jose sanchez file the associated press san francisco ap netflix shed almost 1 million subscribers during the spring amid tougher competition and soaring inflation that s squeezing household budgets heightening the urgency behind the video streaming service s effort to launch a cheaper option with commercial interruptions the april june contraction of 970 000 accounts announced tuesday as part of netflix s second quarter earnings report is by far the largest quarterly subscriber loss in the company s 25 year history it could have been far worse though considering netflix management released an april forecast calling for a loss of 2 million subscribers during the second quarter netflix was probably spared from deeper losses by the ongoing popularity of œstranger things its science fiction horror series that debuted in 2016 following the release of the series fourth season in late may netflix said viewers watched a total of 1 3 billion hours of it over the next four weeks more than any other english language series in the service s history the less severe loss in subscribers combined with an outlook calling for a return to growth in the july september period helped lift netflix s battered stock by 7 in extended trading after the numbers came out netflix co ceo reed hastings didn t try to sugarcoat things during a tuesday conference call about the results œit s tough losing a million subscribers and calling it a success ť he said the company s april june regression follows a loss of 200 000 subscribers during the first three months of the year marking the first time netflix s subscriber totals have shrunk in consecutive quarters since its transition from offering dvd by mail rentals to video streaming began 15 years ago the loss of nearly 1 2 million subscribers during first half of this year also provides a start contrast to the pandemic driven growth that netflix enjoyed during the first half of 2020 when its streaming service picked up nearly 26 million subscribers despite the downturn netflix still earned 1 4 billion or 3 20 per share during the quarter a 6 increase from the same time last year revenue rose 9 from the same time last year to nearly 8 billion netflix ended june with 220 7 million worldwide subscribers far more than any of its new competitors such as walt disney co and apple and in a hopeful sign netflix management predicted its service will add about 1 million subscribers during the july september period signaling the worst of its slump may be over although netflix s springtime subscriber losses weren t as bad as investors and management feared the downturn served as a grim reminder of the challenges now facing the los gatos california company after a decade of unbridled growth netflix s stock price has plunged by nearly 70 so far this year wiping out about 180 billion in shareholder wealth since then other video streaming services have made big strides in attracting viewers with apple winning accolades for its award winning line up of tv series and films while disney s popular line up of family friendly titles continues to gain traction at the same time netflix has been raising its prices to help pay for its own original programming just as the highest inflation rates in 40 years have led consumers to curb spending on discretionary items such as entertainment œnetflix is still the leader in video streaming but unless it finds more franchises that resonate widely it will eventually struggle to stay ahead of competitors that are after its crown said insider intelligence analyst ross benes sensing potential trouble brewing netflix began branching out last year by adding free video games to its streaming service but that obviously hasn t been enough to propel subscriber growth prompting netflix s april announcement that it will crack down on the rampant sharing of subscriber passwords and take another step it once scorned by offering a less expensive tier of its service that will include commercial interruptions without providing further specifics netflix said tuesday that both the ad supported plan and the crackdown on password sharing will begin early next year the company didn t say how much the streaming option with commercials will cost netflix took another step toward putting together the ad supported option last week when it announced it will team up with microsoft

durango co accesswire july 19 2022 on july 19 2022 rocky mountain chocolate factory inc nasdaq rmcf issued the following press release and letter to stockholders of the company rocky mountain chocolate factory inc 265 turner drive durango colorado 81303 dear fellow stockholder rocky mountain chocolate factory inc s rmcf 2022 annual meeting of stockholders is scheduled to be held on august 18 your vote on the white proxy card is particularly important this year since your board s and management team s efforts to turn around rmcf and restore stockholder value are threatened by yet another costly and distracting proxy fight by the ab value and bradley radoff group ab value rmcf s business under the direction of a refreshed board and a new hard charging ceo is now stronger than it was pre covid 19 our franchisees weathered the storm quite well and most are posting stronger sales levels than pre covid inflationary and supply chain pressures which have adversely impacted many consumer facing businesses have been minimal offset by sustained consumer purchases targeted price increases and a captive and efficient supply and distribution network yet for the third time in four years ab value is waging another costly disruptive proxy fight by nominating two director candidates for election at this year s annual meeting despite the fact that two of our six director nominees on the white proxy card were previously nominated by ab value the election of their two new nominees would not just disrupt our program to turn around rmcf but would give ab value representation on our board far disproportionate to their stock ownership and far far more than any other stockholder please support your board s efforts to turn around rmcf and deliver superior value for the benefit of all stockholders by signing dating and returning the enclosed white proxy card with a vote for the election of all our nominees and for the other proposals our new ceo rob sarlls under the direction of our refreshed board is moving ahead on a detailed plan to deliver superior value for the benefit of all stockholders as we have previously written to you our board nominees have the right balance of skillsets experience and fresh perspectives to work effectively with newly appointed ceo rob sarlls to finish building and executing a long term strategic plan that benefits all stockholders and to maintain accountability over mr sarlls and the rest of the management team for example board chair jeff geygan has already done that as board chair at wayside technology group inc nasdaq wstg since 2018 he initiated a strategic review process at wayside that ultimately led to a new c suite refreshed and diverse board membership strategic acquisitions and a more innovative company that has experienced significant transformational growth during mr geygan s tenure wayside more than doubled its ebitda and its share price doubled resulting in the creation of substantial shareholder value similarly rob sarlls has completed several successful business turnarounds and transformations during his tenure as an executive officer of john b sanfilippo son inc nasdaq jbss that company s core ebitda nearly tripled in just over three years and the stock price more than tripled resulting in the creation of substantial shareholder value mr sarlls is an accomplished food industry veteran recognized for his strategic and operations leadership in only ten short weeks he has brought a clear strategic approach to improving and enhancing rmcf s business opportunities and franchisee outreach this includes launching a full executive team business and management strategy review of rmcf focusing on four primary goals geared to current and prospective business needs

achieve one or several of the following a deepening rmcf s product offerings b expanding our geographic and or demographic reach and c broadening our participation at different points in the consumer value chain we are already seeing progress new store openings have returned to pre pandemic levels a visible demonstration of the value our franchises can deliver newsweek s ranking of rmcf as number one in the chocolate and candy stores category in its list of america s best retailers 2022 has increased the number of prospective and existing franchisees seeking to expand their portfolios number one in the chocolate and candy stores category in its list of america s best retailers 2022 has increased the number of prospective and existing franchisees seeking to expand their portfolios increased focus on communications internal and external that ensures meaningful and consistent communications with all key constituencies especially stockholders and the investment community as evidenced by recent news releases and rmcf s first investor earnings call in more than four years and introduction of additional marketing initiatives including the introduction of a new corporate website this summer geared to drive both internet and store sales further helping to build our brand and increase plant throughput in contrast to your board s detailed plan to deliver superior stockholder value ab value has no apparent plan other than to mislead you with baseless personal attacks ab value s proxy materials and press releases lack details of any specific strategic business plan to drive stockholder value instead they try to mislead you with baseless and derogatory assertions regarding rmcf ceo rob sarlls board chair jeff geygan and other directors for example ab value s claims that jeff geygan controls and dominates the rmcf board is simply wrong and belied by the facts mr geygan is one of seven directors on a board which includes two directors who were originally nominated by ab value at the 2021 annual meeting mr geygan was unanimously elected chair of the board by the members of the board including the two directors nominated by ab value at the 2021 annual meeting following the resignation of former chair elisabeth charles as a director effective at this year s annual meeting in fact elisabeth charles notes that my decision to retire from the board was completely for personal reasons i fully support the board s nominees and jeff geygan as chair of the board and am thrilled that rob sarlls has joined as ceo two out of the three members of the nominating and corporate governance committee including the committee chair were first nominated for election by ab value at the 2021 annual meeting the board s appointment of these directors to this important committee is further evidence that the board is not controlled or dominated by one member but instead reflects the collaborative environment fostered by our refreshed board in another example the lack of any real constructive plans by ab value to increase stockholder value is highlighted by its willingness to attack mark riegel s service as chair of the nominating and corporate governance committee of the board when mr riegel was nominated for election by ab value ab value referenced mr riegel as being highly qualified and independent you should also know that if their nominees are elected at the 2022 annual meeting ab value is seeking expense reimbursement without stockholder approval estimated at 2 2 million ab value s costly and distracting proxy contest is not in the best interest of rmcf s stockholders as noted above ab value has not presented a detailed plan to deliver superior stockholder value in contrast to your board s carefully considered program perhaps that is because their previously stated concerns as also expressed by other stockholders have already been addressed by the current refreshed board new ceo the board recruited and hired a well qualified ceo rob sarlls only two months ago instead of allowing mr sarlls the time to evaluate rmcf and develop and execute a strategic business plan to drive stockholder value ab value chooses to disrupt rmcf at this critical time the board recruited and hired a well qualified ceo rob sarlls only two months ago instead of allowing mr sarlls the time to evaluate rmcf and develop and execute a

including two directors who were originally nominated by members ab value a director who was elected as a result of stockholder engagement a director who was secured as the result of an independent search the new ceo also secured by an independent search process and the sixth director with five years experience as a director of rmcf bringing a great balance of history and experience without an overly long tenure five of the six board nominees on the proxy card are new within the last year including the current board does not need further refreshment it does need the ability to continue its efforts to turn around rmcf and deliver superior stockholder value without further distraction and disruption separate the roles of board chair and ceo the refreshed board has appointed an independent non executive board chair separate from the role of ceo a governance best practice ab value has rejected good faith reasonable settlement offers by the board the board offered settlements would have increased the size of the board to seven appointed one of ab value s nominees and included 500 000 in reimbursement of ab value s expenses which was later increased to 600 000 in light of ab value s history of waging expensive and virtually continuous proxy fights in three of the last four years the board s offer to settle was conditioned on a two year standstill that would provide peace to rmcf and allow the already refreshed board and newly elected ceo to focus on rmcf s strategic plan to deliver superior value to its stockholders if the board s offers were accepted the seven person board would have included three directors originally nominated by ab value ab value has been unwilling to accept the board s offerings instead responding with demands i that ab value be permitted to designate a majority of the board in 2022 or 2023 or ii would result in rmcf and ab value agreeing to lock up the nominations of 5 of the 7 directors at the 2023 annual meeting hamstringing the board in the exercise of its duties from being able to consider its appropriate size and members the board has determined ab value s demands would not be in the best interest of the stockholders because they would either i provide control of the board to a single stockholder group by allowing that group to nominate a majority of the members of the board either in 2022 or 2023 and the payment of the significant expenses or ii would result in a majority of the board nominees being locked up a year in advance in summary the ab value agenda will not create value vote for all director nominees and the other proposals using the enclosed white proxy card your vote is especially important this year and we look forward to your participation regardless of the number of shares of common stock you own your vote is important we urge you to vote in accordance with the board s recommendations on each proposal please vote promptly by internet or telephone by following the instructions set forth on the

look for twitter this is nightmare scenario and now the stock is going to be under pressure with the must deal done because this is gonna be clear headwinds going forward employee turnover advertiser issues and really credibility i think it s gonna be viewed at least in the near term damaged goods from public market perspective airing dirty laundry in public in the courts in delaware i mean that s really gonna be i think for all the world to see now if it s 5 or less which twitter has claimed then ultimately they re proven right must likely has to pay some punitive damages including the breakup faith and twitter really ultimately wins in that situation problem is is that if this starts to ultimately cascade and the twitter body issue is much bigger and that comes out in court i think that really calls into question lot of issues about the business model modernization and others and that s why from twitter board perspective backs against the wall and the last thing they ever wanted to be was in court proceeding with the richest person in the world twitter legally could force sale to go through i think if you could historically likely it s in some sort of settlement but but no doubt i mean twitter is gonna sharpen the knives going in advertisement twitter musk takeover dispute heading for an october trial share copy link copy tesla ceo elon musk lost his fight to delay twitter s lawsuit against him as a delaware judge on tuesday set an october trial citing the cloud of uncertainty over the social media company after the billionaire backed out of a deal to buy it delay threatens irreparable harm said chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the head judge of delaware s court of chancery which handles many high profile business disputes the longer the delay the greater the risk twitter had asked for an expedited trial in september while musk s team called for waiting until early next year because of the complexity of the case mccormick said musk s team underestimated the delaware court s ability to quickly process complex litigation twitter is trying to force the billionaire to make good on his april promise to buy the social media giant for 44 billion and the company wants it to happen quickly because it says the ongoing dispute is harming its business musk the world s richest man pledged to pay 54 20 a share for twitter but informed the company in july that he wants to back out of the agreement it s attempted sabotage he s doing his best to run twitter down said attorney william savitt representing twitter before mccormick on tuesday the hearing was held virtually after mccormick said she tested positive for covid 19 musk has claimed the company has failed to provide adequate information about the number of fake or spam bot twitter accounts and that it has breached its obligations under the deal by firing top managers and laying off a significant number of employees musk s team expects more information about the bot numbers to be revealed in the trial court discovery process when both sides must hand over evidence twitter argues that musk s reasons for backing out are just a cover for buyer s remorse after agreeing to pay 38 above twitter s stock price shortly before the stock market stumbled and shares of the electric car maker tesla where most of musk s personal wealth resides lost more than 100 billion of their value savitt said the contested merger agreement and musk s tweets disparaging the company were inflicting harm on the business and questioned musk s request for a delayed trial asking whether the real plan is to run out the clock he s banking on wriggling out of the deal he signed savitt said but the idea the tesla ceo is trying to damage twitter is preposterous he has no interest in damaging the company said musk attorney andrew rossman noting he is twitter s second largest shareholder with a far larger stake than the company s entire board of directors savitt emphasized the importance of an expedited trial starting in september for twitter to be able to make important business decisions affecting everything from employee retention to relationships with suppliers and customers rossman said more time is needed because it is one of the largest take private deals in history involving a company that has a massive amount of data that has to be analyzed billions of actions on their platform have to be analyzed

future via getty images bad news was actually good news for netflix nflx on tuesday in the company s much anticipated second quarter earnings call coming three months after the streamer lost subscribers for the first time in a decade it announced that it had lost an additional 970 000 subscribers that s not good certainly but it could have been worse in fact netflix thought it would be worse it had projected a loss of 2 million subscribers in q2 which is why its stock price rose more than 6 in after hours trading on the news what s more netflix predicted it would return to black among subscribers in the third quarter projecting it will add 1 million last year during the same period it added 4 4 million so while the recovery is significant the company is still nowhere near returning to its peak boom period netflix currently has 220 67 million subscribers it credited content including the record breaking recent return of stranger things for continued growth the numbers came a day after the service said it would begin testing a new system to crack down on password sharing which it had blamed for some of its woes it s long been an open secret that users share passwords outside their households during the early days of the pandemic when subscribers were expanding seemingly by the day it didn t seem to bother netflix as much but with the recent rash of other streaming services debuting within the past three years including hbo max appletv disney and peacock and netflix s subscriber hiccups the service became laser focused on stopping the password share earlier this week it said it had expanded an initial test that allows one household to add users in a second home for a lower price it s been testing in latin america and the service hopes to roll out this paid sharing option worldwide in 2023 the battle over passwords sets up a strange dichotomy pitting the service against its own users if netflix discovers that people are continuing to share passwords without paying for the extra home the primary account will be blocked yet what choice does the service have it has estimated that as many as 100 million people could be watching for free with subscription growth now at a premium and many people maxing out on how many services they want to subscribe to it became clear that something was going to be done while much was made of password sharing when last quarter s numbers were announced it seemed less of a focus tuesday perhaps because the results were rosier than anticipated or perhaps because potential solutions have been discussed ad nauseam microsoft pun intended since that last call netflix is down but nowhere near out seemed to be the theme of the earnings call and it could soon be on its way back up again with the bow of that new ad supported streaming service which will launch in 2023 in its letter to investors netflix outlined its planned rollout using a system it has embraced for the second home service and other innovations easing out the widespread release to give time to make adjustments we ll likely start in a handful of markets where advertising spend is significant the company wrote in a letter to investors like most of our new initiatives our intention is to roll it out listen and learn and iterate quickly to improve the offering so our advertising business in a few years will likely look quite different than what it looks like on day one netflix also confirmed that existing plans would remain ad free while the jump in stock was heartening netflix has seen its value plunge this year amid concerns about subscriber bleed it is down about two thirds year to date in the wake of the subscriber losses the streamer has made cost cutting moves it dismissed a slew of people from content teams moves well documented across social media the past couple of months in two rounds of cuts this year more than 400 people have lost their jobs

look for twitter this is nightmare scenario and now the stock is going to be under pressure with the must deal done because this is gonna be clear headwinds going forward employee turnover advertiser issues and really credibility i think it s gonna be viewed at least in the near term damaged goods from public market perspective airing dirty laundry in public in the courts in delaware i mean that s really gonna be i think for all the world to see now if it s 5 or less which twitter has claimed then ultimately they re proven right must likely has to pay some punitive damages including the breakup faith and twitter really ultimately wins in that situation problem is is that if this starts to ultimately cascade and the twitter body issue is much bigger and that comes out in court i think that really calls into question lot of issues about the business model modernization and others and that s why from twitter board perspective backs against the wall and the last thing they ever wanted to be was in court proceeding with the richest person in the world twitter legally could force sale to go through i think if you could historically likely it s in some sort of settlement but but no doubt i mean twitter is gonna sharpen the knives going in advertisement twitter musk takeover dispute heading for an october trial share copy link copy tesla ceo elon musk lost his fight to delay twitter s lawsuit against him as a delaware judge on tuesday set an october trial citing the cloud of uncertainty over the social media company after the billionaire backed out of a deal to buy it delay threatens irreparable harm said chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the head judge of delaware s court of chancery which handles many high profile business disputes the longer the delay the greater the risk twitter had asked for an expedited trial in september while musk s team called for waiting until early next year because of the complexity of the case mccormick said musk s team underestimated the delaware court s ability to quickly process complex litigation twitter is trying to force the billionaire to make good on his april promise to buy the social media giant for 44 billion and the company wants it to happen quickly because it says the ongoing dispute is harming its business musk the world s richest man pledged to pay 54 20 a share for twitter but informed the company in july that he wants to back out of the agreement it s attempted sabotage he s doing his best to run twitter down said attorney william savitt representing twitter before mccormick on tuesday the hearing was held virtually after mccormick said she tested positive for covid 19 musk has claimed the company has failed to provide adequate information about the number of fake or spam bot twitter accounts and that it has breached its obligations under the deal by firing top managers and laying off a significant number of employees musk s team expects more information about the bot numbers to be revealed in the trial court discovery process when both sides must hand over evidence twitter argues that musk s reasons for backing out are just a cover for buyer s remorse after agreeing to pay 38 above twitter s stock price shortly before the stock market stumbled and shares of the electric car maker tesla where most of musk s personal wealth resides lost more than 100 billion of their value savitt said the contested merger agreement and musk s tweets disparaging the company were inflicting harm on the business and questioned musk s request for a delayed trial asking whether the real plan is to run out the clock he s banking on wriggling out of the deal he signed savitt said but the idea the tesla ceo is trying to damage twitter is preposterous he has no interest in damaging the company said musk attorney andrew rossman noting he is twitter s second largest shareholder with a far larger stake than the company s entire board of directors savitt emphasized the importance of an expedited trial starting in september for twitter to be able to make important business decisions affecting everything from employee retention to relationships with suppliers and customers rossman said more time is needed because it is one of the largest take private deals in history involving a company that has a massive amount of data that has to be analyzed billions of actions on their platform have to be analyzed
but block punctuating his remarks with expletives and chewing through a bowl of candy on a conference room table at his office in texas argues it proves his case the short selling realm is chaotic cutthroat and filled with people who try to profit from your ideas but he can deal with it he doesn t need the feds trying to sort things out for him nor does he believe that the person who tried to piggyback on his trade broke the law yet a flurry of subpoenas the justice department has sent short sellers and their allies hint at serious concerns the inquiries have sought information on trading in tal among numerous other companies according to people familiar with the matter prosecutors and the securities and exchange commission are examining whether short sellers are improperly teaming up to attack public companies part of a series of us inquiries into suspected market abuses in this case authorities are examining why bearish firms sometimes appear to move in sync spurring concerns about potential market manipulation or insider trading while prosecutors have gathered information on dozens of names in the industry they ve shown heightened interest in a few including block and his roughly us200 million 292 million firm in october federal agents wearing blue windbreakers approached block as he was putting one of his kids into his car they showed him a nine page subpoena and seized his phones there s a gun pointed at us block s view is that the universe has flipped upside down in the past the authorities used his research as a starting point for their own inquiries delisting companies or levelling regulatory or criminal charges now they re examining him last year he notes muddy waters and other short sellers were mercilessly squeezed while betting against chinese online education company gsx techedu prosecutors have since accused bill hwang of market manipulation for driving up prices of that stock and others with a series of highly leveraged wagers that ultimately collapsed and took down his archegos capital management hwang is fighting the charges muddy waters hq when it set up in 2010 activist short sellers were a loose constellation of misfits bloomberg during a day of interviews at his office block expressed confidence that he s done nothing illegal yet at moments he also questioned whether it s worth the trouble any more more recently he has sounded upbeat expanding his operation and preparing new reports he unveiled another trade just this week pressing on while waiting to see whether the government takes any further action advertisement the notion that prosecutors might go after muddy waters reminds block of the time he was mugged at gunpoint initially shrugging it off but later realising he could have died anytime somebody points a gun at you there s a non zero chance something goes wrong even if that s not their original intention he said that s the case with being the subject of a doj investigation there s a gun pointed at us and it s really uncomfortable a spokesperson for the justice department declined to comment authorities haven t accused block of wrongdoing and an inquiry doesn t necessarily mean charges will be filed wall street outsiders visitors to muddy waters new headquarters in austin are greeted by a sparkling gold tuxedo jacket commemorating jho low the fugitive financier accused of masterminding malaysia s multibillion dollar 1mdb fraud the garment is part of a costume used in the firm s raunchy send up of awards shows the fidouchies with guests including adult film actress stormy daniels celebrating corporate conmen along the walls are numerous other mementos of muddy waters skirmishes with public companies it s a reminder of how short selling has been a lot more colourful since block splashed onto the scene more than a decade ago it s really hard for us to hold our tongues and not make people feel uncomfortable carson block ceo of muddy waters when muddy waters opened in 2010 activist short sellers were a looser constellation of misfits including some who spent lonely hours in their basements poring over company disclosures and other evidence to spot malfeasance even those who achieved fame such as block recount how they struggled to fit into meticulously tailored wall street most of us were in some way outsiders for a long f ing time block says it s really hard for us to hold our tongues and not make people feel uncomfortable but when his 2011 report on sino forest sent the chinese company s shares down more than 70 per cent in a few days wall street and retail investors began taking him very seriously the research accusing the tree planting venture of exaggerating its assets sparked probes and sanctions sino forest s removal from the toronto stock exchange is one of eight delistings for which block claims credit he soon turned his attention to other chinese companies and their auditors advertisement muddy waters evolution since then illustrates how short selling is made up of ever changing alliances between researchers and money managers relationships that us investigators are now said to be mapping out when block set up shop he had to rely on a so called balance sheet provider an outside money manager that could set up trades to profit on his reports block would get a cut as muddy waters saw its clout grow it began managing outside capital from funds of funds as well as universities and foundations freddy brick a partner at muddy waters bloomberg now muddy waters conducts its own research handles trades and also teams up with outsiders who need its balance sheet that last part of its business is managed by freddy brick whom block brought over from oasis management in 2014 smash and grab block said he takes a variety of steps to prevent leaks before his trades he requires researchers to sign contracts barring them from sharing information capping their trading volume or even forbidding them from placing their own bets research partners let muddy waters look over their draft reports for quality control and are obligated to tell the firm publication is coming he says so that it can ensure its trades are set up still specific trading plans aren t shared block says he also monitors his staff s trading from the beginning block says he figured he would be sued or even investigated from time to time but that such things were the cost of doing business all he needs are three or four big successful shorts a year to make ends meet or as he put it feed the mouths of the research team and at the end of the day make it worth the bulls and the death threats and the dealing with litigation and all of the hatred on social media that hatred has been growing some of it comes from retail investors outraged over attacks on hot stocks but there are also suggestions by academics and even some money managers that activist short selling may have devolved into a scheme of its own for making a quick buck marc cohodes a former hedge fund boss who now manages his own money from a chicken ranch in california calls it smash and grab it works like this a prominent short seller stands on a stage and unveils research on a target company the stock plunges 10 per cent 20 per cent or 30 per cent before anyone has time to digest the report by the time the public can debate the merits the short seller has already closed out positions and is tallying gains cohodes has become outspoken in the short selling community about his disdain of such practices he and block have seen their once cordial relationship sour into a deeply personal twitter feud advertisement there s no place in the investment landscape for people who encourage others to trade one way and then take the other side of that position cohodes says by phone when the government is done looking at this people will know the proper rules on what you can and can t do block doesn t hide that he takes money off the table quickly what he calls smash and grab we call risk management he says of cohodes not fun any more in the interview block says he builds a position slowly over time hoping to avoid attention as he shorts a mountain of stock equal to about 50 per cent to 100 per cent of its average daily trading volume if his research causes the price to plunge block quickly locks in his gains reduces his risk over the next few days and maintains a small bearish position from there on out the short selling model had to change after the financial crisis he says because it spurred years of loose monetary policy that distorted markets and put a number of bearish investors out of business waiting any longer he says also leaves the short seller exposed to other forces in the market retail traders might spot a short position rally together and drive up the stock or algorithmic trading systems might exacerbate a rebound in a stock s price by snapping up shares erasing a short seller s gains and even turning them into losses block says that happened when one of his researchers published a bearish report in 2018 and watched the price climb he also worried about setting off algorithms when unwinding his bets against tal on the flight to new york it s frustrating he says that short squeezes and computer driven trading ignore the content of his reports like others embroiled in the us investigation he s trying to determine what prosecutors are actually after block saw the first sign that something might be up in late summer 2019 when one of muddy waters web hosts forwarded an email from a contractor for the postal inspector requesting an email trap be placed on one of the firm s domains meaning that copies of messages sent to his firm would also go to the feds he says this happened right after he published a report questioning the finances of burford capital which funds litigation burford didn t respond to messages seeking comment advertisement then last year federal officers approached block brick and muddy waters chief financial officer scott devinsky ever since block says his attention has been absorbed by the investigation while he and his staff continue to grind out research and plan for the next report block says it s no longer as much fun he describes the probe as a dark cloud hanging over everything including time with his family and the legal fees are painful no light at the end of the tunnel some of block s anger is aimed at columbia university law professor josh mitts who he believes helped spur the probe with what block sees as flawed research taking issue for example with his sampling of bearish reports mitts has found that in many cases such reports only temporarily depressed a stock s value raising concerns about potential market manipulation he and about a dozen other securities law professors urged the sec to enact stricter rules on short sellers forcing them to divulge more information on their trades block went so far as to send a letter to columbia asking the school to conduct an ethics investigation into mitts over his work for companies including burford that have been targeted by short sellers columbia didn t respond to requests for comment mitts addressed the issue in a recorded speech to a conference this month noting that when he initially published his research he didn t have a consulting business i fully complied with columbia s conflict of interest disclosure rules he said in fact i ve gone above and beyond those rules block suspects the tal education incident was caused by one of his outside researchers who got greedy traded on it and leaked it he suggests those trades may have in turn been detected and amplified by algorithms block ended up releasing his report on the chinese tutoring firm about a week after his ill fated delta flight to new york and the stock fell more than 40 per cent over the ensuing four months block rattled off several other instances when he suspected someone involved in the research either traded or spread word of an upcoming report despite confidentiality agreements he could try to sue confidantes for breaking promises but even then he doesn t see how their actions could trigger a federal probe with us investigators rummaging through bank records and personnel files block questioned his old analysis that an occasional inquiry would be a cost of doing business it now seems more existential he wonders aloud how long he ll stick with the business the guys who ve been making cases for years based on our s if they think we re a f ing problem there s no end block says of the justice department there s no light at the end of the tunnel bloomberg wealth

the tyee is a fan of hakai magazine victoria based hakai magazine part of the tula foundation and hakai institute family is an online magazine publishing fascinating articles about coastal science and societies globally the information and storytelling are top notch the accompanying article was first published there we strongly encourage you to visit hakai magazine for those who know how to read them the signs have long been there like the towering mound of 20 million oyster shells all but obscured by the lush greenery of central florida s gulf coast or the arcing lines of wave weathered stone walls strung along british columbia s shores like a necklace such features hidden in the landscape tell a rich and varied story of indigenous stewardship they reveal how humans carefully transformed the world s coasts into gardens of the sea gardens that produced vibrant varied communities of marine life that sustained indigenous peoples for millennia and in certain places like on the west coast of north america in what is now washington state and where the swinomish are building a new sea garden these ancient practices are poised to sustain them once again i see it as a way for our people to be reconnected to our place to be reconnected to each other and to have a purpose to have a responsibility that goes beyond us says alana quintasket siwəlcəʔ of the swinomish tribal senate across the planet indigenous communities from the heiltsuk in british columbia to the powhatan on the chesapeake bay on the u s atlantic coast to the māori in new zealand have successfully stewarded the sea for thousands of years these communities avoided diminishing their productive sea gardens despite in some cases seeing harvests that rival modern commercial fisheries the scale of historical indigenous oyster gardening for instance cannot be overstated on the u s southeastern atlantic coast in the modern states of south carolina georgia and florida indigenous peoples whose descendants include the muscogee built gargantuan monuments out of oyster shells these structures could reach 30 metres high or more these people are taking billions of oysters literally billions of oysters to form a single site says torben rick an archaeologist at the smithsonian s national museum of natural history the monuments were deeply significant serving as sites for human burial feasting and other ceremonies and rituals in 2004 scientists studying historical overfishing published a study showing how starting around the 19th century oyster stocks suffered a moving wave of exploitation that travelled down the atlantic and pacific coasts of north america and the eastern coast of australia the capitalist commercial fisheries that arrived with european colonization and settlement rick says undid thousands of years of sustainable prosperity within 50 years 100 years maybe even less in some areas they ve depleted that stock but to rick that modern narrative of rampant decline is only part of the story by focusing on the past few centuries that paper and many other important scientific studies and conversations overlooks the ways in which major indigenous oyster fisheries managed to sustain mass productivity for millennia paying these fisheries more attention says rick could have far reaching implications for restoring and managing the flagging oyster populations left today to fill in the rest of the story rick assembled a diverse multidisciplinary team of researchers to revisit the history of oyster fishing in the same places as in the 2004 study but they started their clock in the 1800s and looked backward relying on archaeological and ethnohistorical records the team followed how changes in the natural world such as the thawing of glaciers more than 11 000 years ago and the stabilization of sea levels thousands of years later created an abundance of estuaries and an explosion of intensive oyster harvesting by indigenous communities for 5 000 to 10 000 years through this and other insights the team is redrawing the historical ecological baseline for these oyster stocks the work adds to scientists growing understanding of the diversity and value of indigenous approaches to marine stewardship like the oyster gardens similar systems show up again and again around the world from native hawaiian loko i a fishponds and haida gwaii naw náagalang octopus houses to the shi hu stone fish traps of taiwan and corrales de pesca fish traps of patagonia these and other examples are being catalogued by a broad collaboration known as the pacific sea garden collective that is working to map this diversity of indigenous sea gardening innovations across the pacific ocean in her own work studying historical indigenous clam gardens on the north american west coast which date back at least 3 500 years anne salomon an applied marine ecologist at simon fraser university in british columbia has noted some of the key techniques that led to these bountiful yet restrained returns people would till the sediment replenish shells in the water and construct low intertidal rock terraces that flatten the shoreline and expand the farmable area in parts of b c clam gardens were packed across nearly all available coastal real estate she says those would have been hubs of major production but each clam garden itself is relatively small like a hotel california for fish read more these indigenous sea gardens doubled or even quadrupled the production of clams salomon s research shows they also attracted seaweeds crabs sea cucumbers and more to salomon who is involved in the pacific sea garden collective the intensive nature of some indigenous sea gardens is fundamentally different from the maximum sustained yield mindset of today s capitalist commercial fisheries archaeological evidence paired with indigenous oral histories salomon says shows how by focusing on common reciprocal relationship based principles and governance practices ones that sustain individuals communities and their environments indigenous communities often made decisions that led to huge harvests while also putting some limits on the scale at which that intensification was happening these gardening efforts included a continuum of features such as seasonal or size limits on harvest that may be invisible to the eye salomon says these features aren t just physical features they re cultural features and spiritual features adds marco hatch a member of the samish indian nation and a marine ecologist at western washington university who was involved in rick s study of oyster gardens it s time to decolonize conservation read more the cultural and spiritual aspects make recent momentum to revitalize sea gardening especially meaningful all of these practices i think are centred around this idea of growing food and growing community says hatch a community focus passing on traditional knowledge between generations and improving health through access to local foods is at the heart of the effort to build what is likely the first modern clam garden in the united states inspired by sea garden restorations led by indigenous communities in b c the swinomish indian tribal community has just received permits to start raking sediment and rolling rocks at a site on its traditional tidelands on kiket island roughly 125 kilometres north of seattle washington for years tribal members were chased away with guns and dogs and prevented from harvesting in the area says swinomish tribal member and shellfish community liaison joe williams squi qui it s a very special time for us to be able to reacquaint with this particular location he says unearthing the work of indigenous master horticulturalists read more this sea garden should help address recent declines of butter clams littleneck clams and olympia oysters and help those populations adapt to climate change historically indigenous peoples would shift the locations of clam garden rock walls as sea levels changed gardens also protect clams against ocean acidification and potentially against extreme temperatures it s like a playbook for us that our ancestors left us to get through climate change sea level rise says williams while such efforts will take time to bear fruit the resilience and impressive productivity of past indigenous oyster fisheries gives rick hope for improving future conservation and management but he emphasizes that reconnecting disenfranchised indigenous peoples with their traditional lands and bringing them back into decision making will be essential to restoring oyster populations hatch agrees building a sea garden without the descendants of the people that initially built it is missing the point

look for twitter this is nightmare scenario and now the stock is going to be under pressure with the must deal done because this is gonna be clear headwinds going forward employee turnover advertiser issues and really credibility i think it s gonna be viewed at least in the near term damaged goods from public market perspective airing dirty laundry in public in the courts in delaware i mean that s really gonna be i think for all the world to see now if it s 5 or less which twitter has claimed then ultimately they re proven right must likely has to pay some punitive damages including the breakup faith and twitter really ultimately wins in that situation problem is is that if this starts to ultimately cascade and the twitter body issue is much bigger and that comes out in court i think that really calls into question lot of issues about the business model modernization and others and that s why from twitter board perspective backs against the wall and the last thing they ever wanted to be was in court proceeding with the richest person in the world twitter legally could force sale to go through i think if you could historically likely it s in some sort of settlement but but no doubt i mean twitter is gonna sharpen the knives going in advertisement twitter musk takeover dispute heading for an october trial share copy link copy tesla ceo elon musk lost his fight to delay twitter s lawsuit against him as a delaware judge on tuesday set an october trial citing the cloud of uncertainty over the social media company after the billionaire backed out of a deal to buy it delay threatens irreparable harm said chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the head judge of delaware s court of chancery which handles many high profile business disputes the longer the delay the greater the risk twitter had asked for an expedited trial in september while musk s team called for waiting until early next year because of the complexity of the case mccormick said musk s team underestimated the delaware court s ability to quickly process complex litigation twitter is trying to force the billionaire to make good on his april promise to buy the social media giant for 44 billion and the company wants it to happen quickly because it says the ongoing dispute is harming its business musk the world s richest man pledged to pay 54 20 a share for twitter but informed the company in july that he wants to back out of the agreement it s attempted sabotage he s doing his best to run twitter down said attorney william savitt representing twitter before mccormick on tuesday the hearing was held virtually after mccormick said she tested positive for covid 19 musk has claimed the company has failed to provide adequate information about the number of fake or spam bot twitter accounts and that it has breached its obligations under the deal by firing top managers and laying off a significant number of employees musk s team expects more information about the bot numbers to be revealed in the trial court discovery process when both sides must hand over evidence twitter argues that musk s reasons for backing out are just a cover for buyer s remorse after agreeing to pay 38 above twitter s stock price shortly before the stock market stumbled and shares of the electric car maker tesla where most of musk s personal wealth resides lost more than 100 billion of their value savitt said the contested merger agreement and musk s tweets disparaging the company were inflicting harm on the business and questioned musk s request for a delayed trial asking whether the real plan is to run out the clock he s banking on wriggling out of the deal he signed savitt said but the idea the tesla ceo is trying to damage twitter is preposterous he has no interest in damaging the company said musk attorney andrew rossman noting he is twitter s second largest shareholder with a far larger stake than the company s entire board of directors savitt emphasized the importance of an expedited trial starting in september for twitter to be able to make important business decisions affecting everything from employee retention to relationships with suppliers and customers rossman said more time is needed because it is one of the largest take private deals in history involving a company that has a massive amount of data that has to be analyzed billions of actions on their platform have to be analyzed

adding to a growing nationwide trend placing restrictions on the use of non competition agreements in employment contracts colorado is the most recent state to adopt exacting restrictions on employers use of post termination restrictive covenants set to take effect on august 10 2022 the recently signed house bill 22 1317 dramatically amends colorado s non compete statute colo rev stat 8 2 113 in the following ways income threshold covenants not to compete entered into after august 10 will only be enforced against highly compensated employees according to thresholds set by the state s department of labor and scaled for inflation which for now means those earning at least 101 250 per year this rigid bright line income threshold replaces the statute s prior test which limited enforcement to agreements with executives officers certain management and professional employees and those with access to trade secrets without regard for earnings the income threshold applies at the time the covenant is entered and at the time the covenant is enforced since many workers will be employed by a new employer at the time of enforcement this requirement presents a vexing conundrum to employers who lack visibility into an employee s new income and which threshold could be defeated by the new employer deferring some part of the worker s compensation narrowing of legitimate protectable interests in addition to the income threshold covenants not to compete will only be enforced where necessary for the protection of trade secrets and only if the restriction is no broader than necessary to protect such trade secrets the definition of trade secrets is unchanged by the amendment examples of verified trade secrets in colorado include detailed customer information client lists customer contracts pricing information detailed debtor information and customer log in codes among other items where the employer takes reasonable steps to keep the information secret advance notice employers must inform applicants of their intention to require a covenant not to compete prior to the applicant accepting the offer of employment and provide a summary of the restriction s terms with the notice current employees must be provided at least 14 days notice before the earlier of i the effective date of the covenant or ii the additional consideration to be provided to the worker in exchange for the covenant the notice itself also must be signed by the employee the restriction must be in a standalone agreement and not included as a term in an employment or stock option agreement or included within an employee handbook choice of forum choice of law the amendment invalidates out of state choice of forum selection clauses provisions that specify where disputes will be heard if the worker primarily worked or resided in colorado at the time of termination of employment similarly the amendment renders unenforceable a foreign choice of law provision a provision that establishes which state s laws govern the interpretation of the agreement if the worker primarily resided and worked in colorado at the time of termination this amendment will be particularly impactful on employers who now post pandemic employ employees on a remote basis penalties in the event an employer fails to adhere to these requirements not only will the restriction be void but the employer may be held liable for an employee s actual damages and subject to a civil penalty of 5 000 per worker or prospective worker harmed by the employer s violation the penalty is discretionary and may be avoided in whole or in part if the employer can show that it acted in good faith and had reasonable grounds for believing it was not acting in violation of the statute criminal consequences colorado is the first state to tie criminal consequences to a violation of its non compete statute a violation of the newly adopted non compete law is classified as a class 2 misdemeanor if the employer is shown to have used intimidation to prevent conduct inconsistent with an unenforceable non compete agreement these harsh restrictions apply to true covenants not to compete i e agreements that restrict employees from working in their chosen field for a period of time after termination that are signed or renewed after august 10 2022 and not signed in connection with the sale of a business most of these requirements e g advance notice transparency separate agreement penalties also apply to customer non solicitation agreements provided however that an employee from whom a customer non solicitation covenant is sought is only required to earn at least 60 of the applicable highly compensated employee threshold which initially will be 60 750 annually at the time of execution and enforcement notwithstanding the statutory amendment reasonably tailored confidentiality non disclosure agreements will continue to be enforced in colorado however a purported confidentiality agreement will not be enforced if it is only aimed at protecting information that arises from a worker s general training knowledge skill or experience information that is readily ascertainable to the public or information that a worker has a right to disclose as legally protected conduct covenants prohibiting employees from soliciting other employees to leave their employer also remain lawful and do not require payment of a specific salary to be enforceable finally the amendment does not have retroactive effect so it will not automatically invalidate covenants entered into before august 10 2022 if they were enforceable under then current law when executed the amendment codifies colorado s hostility toward covenants not to compete generally and its intent to punish employers that impose onerous restrictions on workers particularly low wage workers after august 10 colorado employers are encouraged to consider less restrictive measures for protecting their confidential information and employee investment such as only requiring confidentiality agreements and when appropriate customer non solicitation covenants rather than outright bans on post termination competition in addition the colorado uniform trade secrets act and federal defend trade secrets act provide potent remedies when employees defect with protectable trade secrets providing for recovery of damages statutory penalties injunctive relief fees and costs after august 10 2022 the default in colorado will be that non competes are unenforceable except in very limited scenarios to ensure colorado employers comply with the amended statute employers should consult counsel before issuing new or renewing existing restrictive covenant agreements after august 10 and before seeking to enforce restrictive covenants this article was authored by squire patton boggs summer associate jacob williams

look for twitter this is nightmare scenario and now the stock is going to be under pressure with the must deal done because this is gonna be clear headwinds going forward employee turnover advertiser issues and really credibility i think it s gonna be viewed at least in the near term damaged goods from public market perspective airing dirty laundry in public in the courts in delaware i mean that s really gonna be i think for all the world to see now if it s 5 or less which twitter has claimed then ultimately they re proven right must likely has to pay some punitive damages including the breakup faith and twitter really ultimately wins in that situation problem is is that if this starts to ultimately cascade and the twitter body issue is much bigger and that comes out in court i think that really calls into question lot of issues about the business model modernization and others and that s why from twitter board perspective backs against the wall and the last thing they ever wanted to be was in court proceeding with the richest person in the world twitter legally could force sale to go through i think if you could historically likely it s in some sort of settlement but but no doubt i mean twitter is gonna sharpen the knives going in advertisement twitter musk takeover dispute heading for an october trial share copy link copy tesla ceo elon musk lost his fight to delay twitter s lawsuit against him as a delaware judge on tuesday set an october trial citing the cloud of uncertainty over the social media company after the billionaire backed out of a deal to buy it delay threatens irreparable harm said chancellor kathaleen st jude mccormick the head judge of delaware s court of chancery which handles many high profile business disputes the longer the delay the greater the risk twitter had asked for an expedited trial in september while musk s team called for waiting until early next year because of the complexity of the case mccormick said musk s team underestimated the delaware court s ability to quickly process complex litigation twitter is trying to force the billionaire to make good on his april promise to buy the social media giant for 44 billion and the company wants it to happen quickly because it says the ongoing dispute is harming its business musk the world s richest man pledged to pay 54 20 a share for twitter but informed the company in july that he wants to back out of the agreement it s attempted sabotage he s doing his best to run twitter down said attorney william savitt representing twitter before mccormick on tuesday the hearing was held virtually after mccormick said she tested positive for covid 19 musk has claimed the company has failed to provide adequate information about the number of fake or spam bot twitter accounts and that it has breached its obligations under the deal by firing top managers and laying off a significant number of employees musk s team expects more information about the bot numbers to be revealed in the trial court discovery process when both sides must hand over evidence twitter argues that musk s reasons for backing out are just a cover for buyer s remorse after agreeing to pay 38 above twitter s stock price shortly before the stock market stumbled and shares of the electric car maker tesla where most of musk s personal wealth resides lost more than 100 billion of their value savitt said the contested merger agreement and musk s tweets disparaging the company were inflicting harm on the business and questioned musk s request for a delayed trial asking whether the real plan is to run out the clock he s banking on wriggling out of the deal he signed savitt said but the idea the tesla ceo is trying to damage twitter is preposterous he has no interest in damaging the company said musk attorney andrew rossman noting he is twitter s second largest shareholder with a far larger stake than the company s entire board of directors savitt emphasized the importance of an expedited trial starting in september for twitter to be able to make important business decisions affecting everything from employee retention to relationships with suppliers and customers rossman said more time is needed because it is one of the largest take private deals in history involving a company that has a massive amount of data that has to be analyzed billions of actions on their platform have to be analyzed

washington july 17 ani amid the ongoing invasion of ukraine by russia washington s heavy outpour of missiles rockets and artilleries to war torn ukraine has raised fears of the powerful weapons entering ukraine s illicit arms market and that some of them could also re emerge in faraway conflicts for decades to come president joe biden is expected to sign a usd 40 billion security assistance package in the coming days amid urgent pleas from ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky to provide artillery needed to counter russian forces in the country s east and south however the ballooning of ukraine s illicit arms market since russia s initial invasion in 2014 was buttressed by a surplus of loose weapons and limited controls on their use the washington post reported it s just impossible to keep track of not only where they re all going and who is using them but how they are being used said rachel stohl an arms control expert and vice president at the stimson center united states has conducted thorough vetting of the ukrainian units it supplies while forcing kyiv to sign agreements that do not allow the retransfer of equipment to third parties without prior us government authorization said a us state department spokesman in mid april the united states showcased its interest in the ukraine conflict by announcing that it would transfer a fleet of mi 17 helicopters to ukraine that it originally purchased from russia about a decade ago however russia denounced the transfer saying it grossly violates the foundations of international law breaking of those end use agreements is a serious threat to the underlying but weak capacity for countries to control how weapons are used said jeff abramson an expert on conventional arms transfers at the arms control association a pentagon spokesman dismissed the criticisms calling russian charges a distraction and the transfer permissible under u s law and consistent with our national security priorities russia s claims are a disingenuous attempt to distract attention from russia s unprovoked invasion and its history of aggressive actions against ukraine since 2014 said marine corps lt colonel anton t semelroth notably the emergency spending bill awaiting approval in the us senate will cement ukraine s status as the world s single largest recipient of us security assistance receiving more in 2022 than the united states ever provided to afghanistan iraq or israel in a single year the bill will also add to the stocks of weapons the us already committed to ukraine including 1 400 stinger antiaircraft systems 5 500 antitank missiles 700 switchblade drones 90 long range howitzers artillery systems 7 000 small arms 50 000 000 rounds of ammunition and numerous other mines explosives and laser guided rocket systems the washington post reported officials estimated that at least 300 000 small arms and light weapons were looted or lost between 2013 and 2015 providing a boon to the country s black market run by mafia style groups in the donbas region and other criminal networks and the problem grew more acute after russia s invasion in 2014 which saw combatants looting arms and munition storage facilities of ukraine s security service interior and defense ministries weeks after russia s latest invasion of ukraine on feb 24 a group of interagency officials in the biden administration met with outside arms control experts to discuss the risk of small arms proliferation in the conflict according to stohl who attended one of the meetings us officials offered assurances about vetting ukrainian security forces and addressing reports of unauthorized transfer but scant details on how the vetting or monitoring happens it does not inspire much confidence said stohl moreover there are severe concerns among watchdog groups about arms proliferation stemming from moscow amid reports it has enlisted mercenaries from libya syria and chechnya as well as the wagner group a russian contractor during a televised meeting of russia s security council in march defense minister sergei shoigu said 16 000 volunteers in the middle east stood ready to fight alongside russian backed forces in eastern ukraine in response russian president vladimir putin offered his approval saying we need to give them what they want and help them get to the conflict zone stated the washington post shoigu proposed handing over captured us javelin and stinger missiles in the same meeting to pro russian separatists in the donbas region please do this putin told shoigu us security assistance to ukraine has turned out to be more than usd 6 1 billion since russia launched its brutal unprovoked full scale invasion of ukraine on february 24 washington through the us agency for international development usaid in coordination with the us department of the treasury also contributed usd 1 7 billion as part of budgetary aid to ukraine under president joe biden s commitment to president volodymyr zelenskyy since russia s full scale invasion of ukraine usaid has been working closely with humanitarian partners in the country and region to reach ukrainians with life saving humanitarian assistance the aid is also scaling up critical development assistance to respond to cyber attacks and threats to the energy sector countering disinformation supporting small businesses and the agriculture sector documenting human rights violations meeting essential health needs and ensuring the continued functioning of local and national government entities in the war ravaged nation notably russia launched a special military operation in ukraine on february 24 which the west has termed an unprovoked war as a result of this the western countries have also imposed several crippling

last week a spike in reported numbers of homebuyers halting mortgage payments prompted many banks to announce their low exposure to such loans across banks covered by goldman sachs average exposure to

policymakers to restore confidence in the market quickly and to circuit break a potential negative feedback loop goldman sachs chief china economist hui shan and a team said in a report sunday beijing china s real estate market desperately needs a boost in confidence analysts said after reports of homebuyers halting mortgage payments rocked bank stocks and raised worries of a systemic crisis the size of the mortgages isn t as worrisome as the impact of the latest events on demand and prices for one of the biggest financial assets in china residential housing it is critical for policymakers to restore confidence in the market quickly and to circuit break a potential negative feedback loop goldman sachs chief china economist hui shan and a team said in a report sunday get tri state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox sign up for nbc new york newsletters last week a spike in reported numbers of homebuyers halting mortgage payments prompted many chinese banks to announce their low exposure to such loans but the bank stocks fell the homebuyers were protesting construction delays for the apartments they d paid for ahead of completion as is typical in china if left on its own more homebuyers may stop paying mortgages straining property developers cash flows which in turn could lead to more construction delays and project halts the goldman report said uncertainty dampens households desire to buy homes from these developers who arguably need the sales the most the analysts said after two decades of tremendous growth china s property developers have found it harder to stay afloat under beijing s crackdown on the companies high reliance on debt for growth highly indebted developers like evergrande group defaulted late last year developers persistent financial troubles along with covid restrictions have delayed construction projects pushing homebuyers to put their own financial credit at risk by suspending their mortgage payments the number of property projects involved more than tripled in a few days to more than 100 as of july 13 according to jefferies that s a tiny 1 of the total mortgage balance in china the analysts said across banks covered by goldman sachs average exposure to property including mortgages was just 17 the firm s financial services analysts wrote in a report last week we view this mortgage risk to be more about households willingness rather than ability to make mortgage payments the report said as developers have dragged out the construction of properties given the difficulties of refinancing but if more homebuyers refuse to pay their mortgages the poor sentiment would reduce demand and theoretically prices in a vicious cycle that s prompted calls to boost confidence in the second half of 2022 there is no hope for a quick rebound in the real estate sector and it will continue to drag economic growth said gary ng senior economist natixis cib asia pacific the antidote is to boost the confidence of homebuyers and developers once again but it has proven to be a difficult task halting mortgage payments is an extreme measure that shouldn t become a common practice especially since there are legal processes to address delays in completing apartments said qin gang deputy director of china real estate research institute icr he cited conversations with industry executives in saying reports of stopped payments are very unfavorable for maintaining the real estate sector s recovery normally if developers fail to deliver apartments within the agreed period homebuyers can apply to terminate their purchase contracts goldman sachs real estate analysts said in a report last week the analysts said approval usually takes three months and the developer will need to return the down payment and completed mortgage payments to the homebuyer including interest the remaining mortgage payment should go to banks the report said a six year low in house purchase plans demand for new houses has already fallen a people s bank of china quarterly survey found in june that only 16 9 of residents plan to buy a home in the next three months the lowest since 16 3 in the third quarter of 2016 earlier this year the central bank took a significant step toward boosting the real estate market by lowering the mortgage rate many cities have relaxed policies in the last several months to support house purchases but since april real estate sales have fallen 25 or more from last year s levels according to wind information data the average price across 100 chinese cities has barely risen over the last year although prices in large cities like beijing and shanghai have surged by double digits reflecting divergence in demand according to wind information calls to complete and deliver apartments any policy that can assure the delivery of homes would be helpful said bruce pang chief economist and head of research greater china jll he said banks have limited exposure to uncompleted construction projects and have the ability to restore market confidence dai xianglong former head of the people s bank of china said saturday that china would not experience something like the 2007 u s subprime mortgage crisis and suggested measures to boost confidence in the real estate industry and stabilize housing prices that s according to a state media report but even state backed securities times last week raised the specter of systemic financial risk in an article that encouraged local governments and developers to deliver houses on time credit losses relating to mortgage loans are minimal and the affected balances are small at most chinese national banks currently harry hu senior director at s p global ratings said in a statement but downside pressure could build if the latest suspension in mortgage repayments by some resident groups in china is not managed well and manifest into system risks hu said the official newspaper for china s banking and insurance regulator on sunday published similar admonitions and pushed to support delivery of apartments and financing for the real estate industry without the property sector s drag china s gdp could have grown by 3 in the second quarter versus
