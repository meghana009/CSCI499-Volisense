investment grade are commonly referred to as high yield securities or junk securities they are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuing company s continuing ability to meet

senior loans risk the london interbank offered rate libor is the average offered rate for various maturities of short term loans between major international banks who are members of the british bankers association libor is the most common benchmark interest rate index used to make adjustments to variable rate loans it is used throughout global banking and financial industries to determine interest rates for a variety of financial instruments such as debt instruments and derivatives and borrowing arrangements due to manipulation allegations in 2012 and reduced activity in the financial markets that it measures in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the fca the united kingdom financial regulatory body announced a desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 although the period from the fca announcement until the end of 2021 is generally expected to be enough time for market participants to transition to the use of a different benchmark for new securities and transactions there remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of libor and the specific replacement rate or rates as such the potential effect of a transition away from libor on the trust or the financial instruments utilized by the trust cannot yet be determined the transition process may involve among other things increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor the transition may also result in a change in i the value of certain instruments held by the trust ii the cost of temporary borrowing for the trust or iii the effectiveness of related trust transactions such as hedges as applicable when libor is discontinued the libor replacement rate may be lower than market expectations which could have an adverse impact on the value of preferred and debt securities with floating or fixed to floating rate coupons any such effects of the transition away from libor as well as other unforeseen effects could result in losses to the trust since the usefulness of libor as a benchmark could deteriorate during the transition period these effects could occur prior to the end of 2021 real estate industry risk issuers principally engaged in real estate industry including real estate investment trusts may be subject to risks similar to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate including i changes in general economic

top oil consuming nations may find that one of their main tools to fight high global oil prices the release of strategic stockpiles will prove inadequate to soothe markets starved of russian supply since its invasion of ukraine the 31 member international energy agency representing industrialized nations but not russia presided over the fourth coordinated oil release in its history on march 1 of over 60 million barrels of crude its largest yet the united states is considering yet another massive release of up to 180 million barrels from the strategic petroleum reserve over months to stave off consumer energy inflation according to sources but the agreements unveiled so far have failed to stop a dizzying climb in oil prices underscoring the finite power of emergency reserves to address long term supply problems like those stemming from russia s war on ukraine strong consumer demand and capacity constraints in other producer nations to make up the shortfall historically spr releases have temporarily sent oil prices lower and are then followed by higher prices as the market prices in insufficient supply said josh young chief investment officer at bison interests it is likely that oil prices rise after an initial temporary pullback and that the spr may have to be refilled at even higher prices several consumer countries including the biggest the united states have imposed bans on russian oil imports since the invasion which moscow calls a special operation tightening global markets already hit by rebounding fuel demand and production limits by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries the iea expects 3 million barrels per day bpd of russian oil equivalent to over a third of its exports to be shut in as sanctions bite and buyers spurn purchases repeated stockpile releases meanwhile will further thin the world s supply cushion each release is likely to have diminishing effect on the oil markets said john paisie president of houston based consultancy stratas advisors president joe biden will deliver remarks on thursday on his administration s actions the white house said that news pushed oil prices down more than 4 late wednesday but was also met with skepticism by some analysts washington had also pledged in november to release 50 million barrels of spr oil in a coordinated move with china india south korea japan and britain a deal that also failed to stop oil s climb above 100 a barrel state storage across the organisation for economic cooperation and development most of whose members belong to iea hit 1 48 billion barrels late last year down more than 100 million barrels from a 2017 high a reuters analysis of iea data shows government controlled oil stocks among members states was at its lowest since 2005 even before the march 1 release u s spr levels have dropped to their lowest since 2002 government data showed it s not working do it again some analysts have called for governments to release even more oil from reserves with bank jp morgan suggesting the iea could commit to release 50 million barrels per month or more for the rest of the year neil atkinson an oil analyst and former iea senior official said only big releases will be enough to make a difference in a 100 million bpd global oil market this time it will have to be by comparison a big bazooka he said but longer term the key to rebalancing the market is increased commercial production not stockpile drawdowns stocks of strategic oil have a limit and flows of commercial oil do not flows that stop are a bigger problem than strategic stocks can solve over time said kevin book energy policy analyst at clearview energy partners in washington ramping up production can be slow however a shale boom roughly doubled u s oil output since the 2000s boosting the country to the world s top producer spot but after oil output fell during the coronavirus pandemic the u s energy information administration now forecasts the united states will return to being a net importer in 2022 before returning to net exporter status in 2023 meanwhile opec and ally producers including russia a group known as opec that cut output after demand slumped due to the pandemic will likely stick to plans for a modest uptick in production in coming months according to sources as the group s kingpin saudi arabia continues to reject calls from consumer nations for quicker increases stockpiles have helped with past limited disruptions the previous release of 60 million barrels coordinated by the iea amid the libyan civil war in 2011 slashed prices 10 a barrel to around 105 a prior 60 million barrel release in 2005 after hurricane katrina dropped the price around 3 on the week to 62 a barrel global benchmark brent futures fell by 4 36 or 3 84 to 109 09 a barrel at 0103 gmt on news of the potential release but remained up from just below 97 before the invasion source reuters reporting by noah browning timothy gardner and liz hampton in denver editing

for nine decades generations of neighbors ran into each other at the corner of huntoon and lane streets in central topeka much like local schools or a public library the intersection throbbed with the community s pulse it was the site of a grocery store i d see people from the neighborhood see people from school said janet cathcart who grew up in the area and raised her children there it was a nice place to just interact but in 2016 kroger co closed the dillons branded neighborhood grocery saying it hadn t turned a profit since 2004 when the federal government next updated its list of low income areas hurting for grocery stores also known as food deserts it added three central topeka census tracts and though six years have passed no independent grocer or major chain has stepped in to fill the gap what has happened to topeka and it has happened in a number of other medium and larger cities as well is that grocery stores are increasingly being concentrated on the periphery said michael bell president of the neighborhood improvement association for the city center s tennessee town area now a resident led movement to restore a full service grocery is gaining momentum the vision includes fresh foods postal and financial services for shoppers and fair pay for employees organizers say they have new market research showing a grocery store can thrive in the neighborhood and they re taking steps to make it happen they hope to sign a lease soon and nonprofit foundations are providing funds for the legal and administrative work half a million kansans live in nearly 140 census tracts with limited or no grocery stores the u s department of agriculture says the vast majority of these low income tracts are urban areas where residents commonly travel a mile or more to reach the store some of the tracts are rural areas without a grocery within 10 miles local dollar stores offer little in the way of fresh or healthy foods and lean heavily toward high salt and high sugar options kroger s closure of the central topeka dillons grocery store affected residents of historically african american tennessee town and several adjacent neighborhoods the 13 000 people living in the area have an average family income of 31 000 a year nearly a third of the households fall below the federal poverty line about half of residents are people of color primarily black and hispanic having a full service grocery store in your neighborhood seems to be less tied to the potential number of clients bell said and more tied to socioeconomic standing and part of that of course is ethnicity this map produced by the kansas health institute shows food insecurity rates by zip code two of the zip codes affected by losing the grocery store in central topeka have the county s highest rate of people struggling to stock their pantries nearly a third of the population kroger co said in an email that its central topeka market was unsustainable to maintain healthy operations overall unfortunately decisions have to be reached when stores are not profitable the company said citing the need to keep down prices and pay employees the company says it has invested tens of millions of dollars in grocery stores and gas stations across topeka since 2008 offering jobs and benefiting the local economy cathcart and bell are board members for the central topeka grocery oasis a nonprofit group founded by residents of the area s neighborhoods that want to re establish a grocery store in tennessee town it would give residents some independence said cathcart who lives just a few blocks from where the store closed why shouldn t the people in this area have access to the same things that everyone else has access to losing their local dillons made it harder for those with tight budgets to run everyday errands vital to their health and finances the dillons had been a place to shop for the week s meals pick up prescriptions and pay utility bills now the one quarter of residents without access to cars have to wait until their relatives or friends can offer a lift or wait on buses which takes more time and more trips since public transport doesn t offer the luxury of hauling home a car trunk s worth of groceries in this video donna rae pearson the history librarian at the topeka and shawnee county public library explains the effects of redlining policies and infrastructure projects that harmed neighborhoods of color and dramatically reduced black ownership of houses and businesses the affected neighborhoods include swaths of zip codes 66603 and 66612 which have the highest poverty rates in shawnee county compared to the city s wealthier suburbs to the city s north south and west people in this urban core are four times as likely not to have enough food according to a new report from the kansas health institute and commissioned by the shawnee county health department the roots of poverty in central topeka relate to the city s history as in other american cities white controlled public and private institutions undermined the accrual of wealth by black and hispanic topekans by throwing up barriers to loans good paying jobs home ownership and business ownership in the 1900s this dealt one blow after another to their growing middle class including descendants of the exodusters who settled tennessee town and wiped out the city s black owned business district regional and national grocery chains some of which specialize in suburbs with higher incomes where they can sell more expensive foods have so far shown little interest in central topeka so residents from nine neighborhoods created the central topeka grocery oasis group in 2018 local community groups and foundations awarded grants and offered logistical aid the not for profit group aims to lease land for a new neighborhood market and raise upward of 5 million to build it the group has begun researching co op and nonprofit business models and talking informally with food distributors and for profit grocers we would like anybody who works at our store to earn a living wage said marge ahrens another board member who lives just blocks from the closed dillons central topeka grocery oasis paid business consultants for a study that concluded a new grocery store could turn a profit the resulting report suggested a 14 000 square foot premise about the size of a walgreens the group may soon gain access to enough land for that and a parking lot just yards away from the former dillons community health clinic gracemed owns an unused one acre lot there gracemed also bought the empty grocery store building and now offers medical and dental services there the two not for profit groups are discussing lease details this usda map shows areas of kansas with low incomes and long distances to walk or drive to buy fresh food the vast majority of the census tracts are urban a smaller number are rural though those stand out visually because they are geographically larger several years ago shawnee county set goals to fight hunger reduce the number of local food deserts and make sure children and adults have healthy meals children without this typically suffer poorer health long term and do worse in school prior to the covid 19 pandemic there had been a lot of groundswell and a lot of momentum said craig barnes who leads the agency s community outreach efforts the department commissioned the kansas health institute s recent deep dive into local food access the report found that the percentage of people without consistent access to meals decreased in the two years before covid 19 hit the most recent statistics from 2019 show about 12 of shawnee county residents lack enough food to lead healthy active lives the pandemic paused some of the county health department s efforts forcing it to close a satellite office that helped low income mothers sign up for assistance with food for themselves and their children many shawnee county residents who qualify for food stamps 2 38 a meal and similar help don t get it one of the big key findings from the report is that about half of all people eligible are signing up barnes said the kansas health institute

major banks are building out teams dedicated to cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology start ups are looking to compete for talent by offering faster paced environments equity and less red tape courting talent from goldman sachs blackrock and others you re taking brand risk goldman is one of the storied institutions of wall street said justin schmidt former head of digital asset markets at goldman sachs wall street has been beefing up hiring for digital asset teams but some employees are walking away from name brand institutions in search of more risk and potentially more reward jpmorgan chase morgan stanley and goldman sachs are among the firms with dedicated groups for cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology jpmorgan has one of the largest crypto teams with more than 200 employees working in its onyx division the jpm coin digital currency is being used commercially to send payments around the world get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters umar farooq the ceo of onyx by jpmorgan said the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank s brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start up but when products are launched they reach a scale that a fintech can only dream of there aren t many places where you can roll out a new platform and that platform can go from literally nothing to transacting a billion dollars of trade a day in a few months farooq told cnbc that sort of scale can only be possible when you operate at a company like jpmorgan chase the upside of that scale is way more important than whatever downsides might exist by virtue of more regulations or controls when it comes to hiring farooq said it s a mix of current jpmorgan employees and competing for talent with start ups and bigger tech companies from first year analysts to senior management and managing directors there s a greater interest in making the move to crypto he said financial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015 according to recent data from linkedin in the first half of 2021 that pace jumped by 40 banks on a crypto hiring spree included deutsche bank wells fargo citigroup capital one barclays credit suisse ubs bank of america and bny mellon the crypto boom on wall street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start up world crypto and blockchain companies raised a record 25 billion last year an eightfold increase from a year earlier according to cb insights data farooq said that even with the start up boom jpmorgan has seen limited attrition those leaving have been people wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar however jpmorgan did lose one of its highest profile crypto deputies last year christine moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at onyx she has yet to announce her next move after over a half decade laying the foundations for blockchain based infrastructure across financial markets and cross border payments creating new businesses that have already scaled into the usd billions at j p morgan i am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the web3 crypto ecosystem from a new angle moy told cnbc in an email leaving wall street other top crypto executives who left wall street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution mary catherine lader chief operating officer at uniswap labs left her job as a managing director at blackrock last year her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company it certainly wasn t my primary job lader said it was kind of a hobby as it is for so many people on wall street and it definitely wasn t something that at the time i was thinking about because it was early stages of adoption at uniswap lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange she said she couldn t pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation this technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn t feel like a risk at all lader said i was sad to leave the people i had loved working with for many years i have tremendous respect for the firm but it didn t feel like a risk that s a great thing about where we are in web3 justin schmidt former head of digital asset markets at goldman sachs made a similar career change last year he joined institutional crypto trading platform talos and described the risk in a similar way calling the decision multidimensional inherently you re taking a brand risk goldman is one of the storied institutions of wall street schmidt said you are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional and i very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there s a generational opportunity here cryptocurrency start ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent many are looking beyond top candidates with mbas and instead considering those with less conventional resumes lader and schmidt said some of their best crypto hires have been self taught engineers or crypto influencers they first interacted with on twitter i constantly am meeting people who are 23 years old who are as smart about markets as people i worked with on wall street for years lader said people who frankly had no interest in financial services who would never really explore or consider working on wall street are excited to work at uniswap labs and companies like us

senior loans risk the london interbank offered rate libor is the average offered rate for various maturities of short term loans between major international banks who are members of the british bankers association libor is the most common benchmark interest rate index used to make adjustments to variable rate loans it is used throughout global banking and financial industries to determine interest rates for a variety of financial instruments such as debt instruments and derivatives and borrowing arrangements due to manipulation allegations in 2012 and reduced activity in the financial markets that it measures in july 2017 the financial conduct authority the fca the united kingdom financial regulatory body announced a desire to phase out the use of libor by the end of 2021 although the period from the fca announcement until the end of 2021 is generally expected to be enough time for market participants to transition to the use of a different benchmark for new securities and transactions there remains uncertainty regarding the future utilization of libor and the specific replacement rate or rates as such the potential effect of a transition away from libor on the trust or the financial instruments utilized by the trust cannot yet be determined the transition process may involve among other things increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that currently rely on libor the transition may also result in a change in i the value of certain instruments held by the trust ii the cost of temporary borrowing for the trust or iii the effectiveness of related trust transactions such as hedges as applicable when libor is discontinued the libor replacement rate may be lower than market expectations which could have an adverse impact on the value of preferred and debt securities with floating or fixed to floating rate coupons any such effects of the transition away from libor as well as other unforeseen effects could result in losses to the trust since the usefulness of libor as a benchmark could deteriorate during the transition period these effects could occur prior to the end of 2021 real estate industry risk issuers principally engaged in real estate industry including real estate investment trusts may be subject to risks similar to the risks associated with the direct ownership of real estate including i changes in general economic

recent market shifts will test portfolios that have leaned too heavily into growth investments diversifying is essential but do this in moderation the uk is now home to more than 2 000 isa millionaires that s testament to a good degree of patience substantial individual savings account isa contributions and some great investment returns that said markets never go up in a straight line that has become abundantly clear in the opening months of 2022 with markets tanking and many former investor favourites from tech stocks to various popular baillie gifford funds racking up alarmingly high paper losses initially sparked by concerns relating to inflation and interest rate rises this panic had ramped up at the time of writing with the russian invasion of ukraine sending markets further into tailspin isa investors surveying the sea of red may well be tempted to panic sell overhaul their portfolio or simply ignore the problem but there is a more prosaic solution with monetary tightening testing the former market winners and geopolitical strife heightening equity volatility now is the time to consider how diversified your isa really is and where it is appropriate to tinker with regard to monetary policy some investors may have found themselves overly exposed to the us and highly valued tech stocks or funds that have heavily invested in them over the years and this may have resulted in their portfolios being overly exposed to growth assets but if a remedy is required for inadequately diversified portfolios the asset allocation rules of thumb we outlined in getting asset allocation right in your isa ic 11 03 21 should still hold rob morgan chief analyst at as charles stanley says that investors should also avoid getting carried away with portfolio inflation proofing or style rotations he argues that we could well enter a more deflationary environment within a couple of years reinforcing the argument for balance rather than one way bets all out growth and the road to diversification if the opening weeks of the year have been deeply unsettling investors with a long time horizon should be able to stay the course if you can stay invested for the next 20 years or longer and are willing to ride out the ups and downs of markets you can still target all out growth by backing risk assets you could even top up on the likes of beaten up tech names where appropriate but smoothing out the ups and downs by making regular portfolio contributions and staying properly diversified is still important an all out growth mindset could apply to an investment junior isa set up for children or grandchildren or a stocks and shares isa run by an adult looking to maximise their assets either indefinitely or ahead of retirement likewise those using a lifetime isa as a means of maximising long term gains for retirement rather than for a house deposit would fall into this category whichever of those boxes you tick the asset allocation calls remain relatively simple provided you can withstand the volatility allocating predominantly or exclusively to equities is a reasonable approach with an added caveat about the need for diversification as jean paul jaegers head of asset allocation at barclays wealth and investments puts it diversification is a lot like a healthy diet and portfolios need a little of everything within equity portfolios this has applied to investment styles in recent history fans of growth and quality investment styles including many baillie gifford fund managers nick train and terry smith have hit bumps in the road after multi year successes while value plays have fared better take the strong returns made by commodities in recent months or the more promising outlook for banks if interest rates rise some investors may have loaded up on the obvious winners of recent years such as fundsmith equity gb00b41ybw71 us equities and tech or they may have allowed allocations to drift to the extent that their portfolios are too heavily weighted to one style while piling fully into value is not advised it makes sense to have a foot in each camp for investors who seem overly reliant on the growth style it would make sense to buy into value with future contributions to reset the balance rather than selling out of growth names and crystallising recent losses diversifying by style can take different forms especially when it comes to using passive funds some of the major equity markets can act as proxies on these investment styles from the energy and financials heavy ftse 100 index to the dominance that the faang tech stocks stalwarts of the growth styles have maintained in the us but diversifying within individual regional allocations can make sense as we explained in funds to hold alongside fundsmith equity and scottish mortgage ic 29 10 21 positions in growth minded global equity funds such as fundsmith equity scottish mortgage investment trust smt lindsell train global equity ie00bjspmj28 and rathbone global opportunities gb00bh0p2m97 could be offset by exposure to value plays such as ninety one global special situations gb00b29kp103 and schroder global recovery gb00byrjxl91 similarly dividend plays such as m g global dividend gb00b39r2q25 can work as a counterbalance to the big growth funds there are multiple fund options for exposure to each of the main geographic regions to give a very basic sense of which funds and investment trusts might have contrasting approaches i have singled out some of the best active performers of 2020 a year when growth and quality investors prospered for the value options i have identified some of the leading funds so far this year given that cyclical assets have until now fared better than the growth plays but this approach can be a blunt tool for example the performance of asia and emerging market funds depends in large part on their exposure to chinese equities which strongly outperformed in 2020 before running into trouble and the list does not include funds from income or small cap sectors contrasting fund options by equity region market possible growth quality options which were 2020 winners possible value options which have been 2022

geographic diversification still matters and ties in with not relying too heavily on market darlings dean cheeseman multi asset fund manager at janus henderson notes over the last two years a period dominated by quantitative easing but also complicated by covid and the structural challenges posed by lockdowns for more cyclical industries us growth stocks have massively outperformed entering that market now as the tailwinds are beginning to recede may incur elevated volatility he argues that long term investors who can tolerate ups and downs should turn their focus to emerging markets an area he views as promising after some disappointing years all out growth investors can afford to be ambitious and this could include backing some riskier funds and regions and taking a punt on promising themes this could be done via broader thematic funds such as pictet global thematic opportunities lu1437676809 or if relevant diversified environmental social and governance investing funds such as those in the liontrust sustainable future range but if the themes of the future such as battery technology and clean energy appeal it is important to remember that more targeted funds are highly vulnerable to the risks of market timing see further reading the drawbacks of thematic etfs ic 25 02 21 like many asset classes equities can struggle in the face of inflation morgan therefore warns investors not to write off other options if they can generate similar returns at the moment i think some of the inflation friendly income oriented areas look quite interesting such as infrastructure investment trusts he says private equity would be another diversifier though arguably it s not a different asset class as it s still equity the challenge of balanced growth and 60 40 asset allocation gets trickier for those not far from or already in retirement the level of risk you take at this stage depends heavily on circumstances morgan notes that those with substantial resources beyond their isa such as defined benefit pensions may maintain an aggressive growth approach to maximise their isa assets but circumstances and the fact that pensions can be worth preserving for as long as possible because they can be passed onto beneficiaries without incurring inheritance tax may result in you being more reliant on your isa and more risk averse some old rules of thumb still apply morgan and cheeseman point to a 60 40 portfolio 60 per cent invested in equities and 40 per cent in bonds as a starting point but morgan also suggests adding an element of inflation protection options include infrastructure investment trusts property gold and commodities a mixture could be a good bet in times of uncertainty although a few defensive investments had held up well between the start of the year and late february government bonds in particular are worrying some investors given their high valuations and exposure to both inflation and interest rate rises this has led to some notable calls peter doherty head of fixed income at sanlam declared in early 2022 that it made sense to mininimise holdings of government bonds in favour of cash as sovereign bonds were more at risk of losing their nominal value cash could form part of your arsenal and even allow you to top up holdings when markets fall but it is undeniably vulnerable to recent high levels of inflation others have turned to previously out of favour sub sectors as a defensive play sam dovey group head of fund research at ravenscroft has been looking to increase allocations to global equity income arguing that quality and near term cash flows tend to be highly valued at times of elevated uncertainty yet she is also sticking with some classic safe haven assets including conventional and index linked government bonds income generating income without taking too much risk is also a tricky undertaking although you could run a balanced portfolio and take capital gains where needed instead equities are likely to be a big component of income portfolios the uk market has made a strong recovery following cuts cancellations and suspensions after the outbreak of covid in 2020 but diversification is still key asia for example has strong income prospects and global equity income funds can offer a mixture of exposures other options include infrastructure investment trusts which offer equity like yields and often have inflation protection but these trade on hefty share price premiums to net asset value riskier bonds also offer reasonable yields and some of the riskier strategic bond funds such as royal london sterling extra yield bond ie00bjbqc361 and artemis high income gb00b2pljn71 offer substantial yields and loan funds such as cvc credit partners european opportunities ccpe generate attractive levels of income via debt with a link to inflation
major banks are building out teams dedicated to cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology start ups are looking to compete for talent by offering faster paced environments equity and less red tape courting talent from goldman sachs blackrock and others you re taking brand risk goldman is one of the storied institutions of wall street said justin schmidt former head of digital asset markets at goldman sachs wall street has been beefing up hiring for digital asset teams but some employees are walking away from name brand institutions in search of more risk and potentially more reward jpmorgan chase morgan stanley and goldman sachs are among the firms with dedicated groups for cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology jpmorgan has one of the largest crypto teams with more than 200 employees working in its onyx division the jpm coin digital currency is being used commercially to send payments around the world get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters umar farooq the ceo of onyx by jpmorgan said the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank s brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start up but when products are launched they reach a scale that a fintech can only dream of there aren t many places where you can roll out a new platform and that platform can go from literally nothing to transacting a billion dollars of trade a day in a few months farooq told cnbc that sort of scale can only be possible when you operate at a company like jpmorgan chase the upside of that scale is way more important than whatever downsides might exist by virtue of more regulations or controls when it comes to hiring farooq said it s a mix of current jpmorgan employees and competing for talent with start ups and bigger tech companies from first year analysts to senior management and managing directors there s a greater interest in making the move to crypto he said financial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015 according to recent data from linkedin in the first half of 2021 that pace jumped by 40 banks on a crypto hiring spree included deutsche bank wells fargo citigroup capital one barclays credit suisse ubs bank of america and bny mellon the crypto boom on wall street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start up world crypto and blockchain companies raised a record 25 billion last year an eightfold increase from a year earlier according to cb insights data farooq said that even with the start up boom jpmorgan has seen limited attrition those leaving have been people wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar however jpmorgan did lose one of its highest profile crypto deputies last year christine moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at onyx she has yet to announce her next move after over a half decade laying the foundations for blockchain based infrastructure across financial markets and cross border payments creating new businesses that have already scaled into the usd billions at j p morgan i am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the web3 crypto ecosystem from a new angle moy told cnbc in an email leaving wall street other top crypto executives who left wall street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution mary catherine lader chief operating officer at uniswap labs left her job as a managing director at blackrock last year her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company it certainly wasn t my primary job lader said it was kind of a hobby as it is for so many people on wall street and it definitely wasn t something that at the time i was thinking about because it was early stages of adoption at uniswap lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange she said she couldn t pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation this technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn t feel like a risk at all lader said i was sad to leave the people i had loved working with for many years i have tremendous respect for the firm but it didn t feel like a risk that s a great thing about where we are in web3 justin schmidt former head of digital asset markets at goldman sachs made a similar career change last year he joined institutional crypto trading platform talos and described the risk in a similar way calling the decision multidimensional inherently you re taking a brand risk goldman is one of the storied institutions of wall street schmidt said you are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional and i very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there s a generational opportunity here cryptocurrency start ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent many are looking beyond top candidates with mbas and instead considering those with less conventional resumes lader and schmidt said some of their best crypto hires have been self taught engineers or crypto influencers they first interacted with on twitter i constantly am meeting people who are 23 years old who are as smart about markets as people i worked with on wall street for years lader said people who frankly had no interest in financial services who would never really explore or consider working on wall street are excited to work at uniswap labs and companies like us

be careful what you post on social media after a night out getty images grossly offensive a man in the united kingdom has come under fire for a tweet that he posted after a night out drinking if you ve ever woken up to a bevvy of notifications and or texts about something that you posted the night or morning before and felt immediate shame or embarrassment it probably hopefully wasn t something so bad that a government agency would find it so grossly offensive that you wind up with community service or worse usually you ll probably just have to delete the post from social media maybe text call or message a few people to apologize and then it ll be a distant memory or joke getty images it seems that there are situations though if the post was offensive enough that simply deleting it won t suffice it happened to one man in the united kingdom who subsequently received a hefty punishment and the post was only up for around 20 minutes according to gizmodo a 36 year old man from glasgow scotland felt the heat last february following the death of captain sir tom moore who was a british army veteran who had previously helped raise over 30 million for healthcare workers during the pandemic by doing 100 laps around his garden back yard in the uk on his 100th birthday how to get arrested for social media post after hearing about his passing and in an alleged drunken state the man decided to tweet the only good brit soldier is a deed one burn auld fella buuuuurn as you can imagine even in said drunken state it didn t take long for him to realize that was not a good idea at all as it was deleted around 20 minutes after it was first sent out while not being up for long someone took note and it was brought to the attention of authorities who decided to charge him with violating section 127 of the uk s communications act which criminalized posts deemed grossly offensive or of an indecent obscene or menacing character the man s lawyer argued that he had been drinking and under stress when he sent the tweet out that didn t stop the court from sentencing him to 150 hours of community service now i don t know for sure that this would necessarily constitute authorities getting involved in the united states it might but best not to try your luck in other words just don t be an jerk

major banks are building out teams dedicated to cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology start ups are looking to compete for talent by offering faster paced environments equity and less red tape courting talent from goldman sachs blackrock and others you re taking brand risk goldman is one of the storied institutions of wall street said justin schmidt former head of digital asset markets at goldman sachs wall street has been beefing up hiring for digital asset teams but some employees are walking away from name brand institutions in search of more risk and potentially more reward jpmorgan chase morgan stanley and goldman sachs are among the firms with dedicated groups for cryptocurrency and its underlying blockchain technology jpmorgan has one of the largest crypto teams with more than 200 employees working in its onyx division the jpm coin digital currency is being used commercially to send payments around the world get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters umar farooq the ceo of onyx by jpmorgan said the team has to worry about compliance and protecting the bank s brand and often moves slower than your average crypto start up but when products are launched they reach a scale that a fintech can only dream of there aren t many places where you can roll out a new platform and that platform can go from literally nothing to transacting a billion dollars of trade a day in a few months farooq told cnbc that sort of scale can only be possible when you operate at a company like jpmorgan chase the upside of that scale is way more important than whatever downsides might exist by virtue of more regulations or controls when it comes to hiring farooq said it s a mix of current jpmorgan employees and competing for talent with start ups and bigger tech companies from first year analysts to senior management and managing directors there s a greater interest in making the move to crypto he said financial services firms added three times as many crypto jobs last year than in 2015 according to recent data from linkedin in the first half of 2021 that pace jumped by 40 banks on a crypto hiring spree included deutsche bank wells fargo citigroup capital one barclays credit suisse ubs bank of america and bny mellon the crypto boom on wall street coincides with more funding and hiring in the start up world crypto and blockchain companies raised a record 25 billion last year an eightfold increase from a year earlier according to cb insights data farooq said that even with the start up boom jpmorgan has seen limited attrition those leaving have been people wanting to start their own company versus wanting to leave and go do something similar however jpmorgan did lose one of its highest profile crypto deputies last year christine moy is on garden leave after departing her role as managing director and global head of crypto and metaverse at onyx she has yet to announce her next move after over a half decade laying the foundations for blockchain based infrastructure across financial markets and cross border payments creating new businesses that have already scaled into the usd billions at j p morgan i am looking to challenge myself further by finding new opportunities to create value and drive impact for the web3 crypto ecosystem from a new angle moy told cnbc in an email leaving wall street other top crypto executives who left wall street recently expressed some frustration at how long it takes to get projects moving within a large financial institution mary catherine lader chief operating officer at uniswap labs left her job as a managing director at blackrock last year her foray into crypto started as a side project within the asset management company it certainly wasn t my primary job lader said it was kind of a hobby as it is for so many people on wall street and it definitely wasn t something that at the time i was thinking about because it was early stages of adoption at uniswap lader is now working on an emerging decentralized cryptocurrency exchange she said she couldn t pass up the opportunity to work on the next wave of innovation this technology is so critical to the future of finance that it didn t feel like a risk at all lader said i was sad to leave the people i had loved working with for many years i have tremendous respect for the firm but it didn t feel like a risk that s a great thing about where we are in web3 justin schmidt former head of digital asset markets at goldman sachs made a similar career change last year he joined institutional crypto trading platform talos and described the risk in a similar way calling the decision multidimensional inherently you re taking a brand risk goldman is one of the storied institutions of wall street schmidt said you are also taking a risk by staying someplace more traditional and i very firmly believe that this is a generational change and there s a generational opportunity here cryptocurrency start ups and banks describe a shift in the hunt for top talent many are looking beyond top candidates with mbas and instead considering those with less conventional resumes lader and schmidt said some of their best crypto hires have been self taught engineers or crypto influencers they first interacted with on twitter i constantly am meeting people who are 23 years old who are as smart about markets as people i worked with on wall street for years lader said people who frankly had no interest in financial services who would never really explore or consider working on wall street are excited to work at uniswap labs and companies like us

document also alleged that driver destroyed her cell phone and left pieces in lyon churchill pershing humboldt and eureka counties the lyon county sheriff s office says driver shot irion in the head and chest the local community has been rallying around this family since this all started there are a couple of events this weekend kim lovett a fernley resident says for this to happen is a scary thing that even in our quiet little sleepy town that we have predators out there that would do something like this a devastated community that carried hopes of finding naomi for weeks and went on countless searches with her family they said this outcome wasn t one anyone wanted some of the resident we spoke with extended their condolences to naomi s family and want them to know they are supported tisha leija another fernley resident visibly upset told us i can t even imagine the first thing i thought of was poor mom poor mom very sad the man accused of kidnapping naomi irion will stay in lyon county jail on 750 000 bondable bail 41 year old troy e driver was arrested and booked into the jail last friday he s officially now charged with first degree kidnapping a felony should the defendant post bail he will not be released from custody until a gps monitoring device is installed judge lori matheus canal township justice court said the judge set driver s preliminary hearing for april 12 for 1 30pm irion s family attended the court hearing it does look like they re going to be posting bail from what i understand so he s the only one who can help us bring naomi home casey

three charges of robbery and one of burglary a judge sentenced him to 15 years in prison but the article said he could have been released after serving 12 it is upsetting to me that there is people

the war in ukraine and associated u s sanctions are exacerbating a world hunger crisis that already afflicts billions of people writes vijay prashad by vijay prashad tricontinental institute for social research on march 16 as russia s war on ukraine entered its second month kazakhstan s president kassym jomart tokayev warned his people that uncertainty and turbulence in the world markets are growing and production and trade chains are collapsing a week later the united nations conference on trade and development unctad released a brief study on the immense shock that will be felt around the world due to this war soaring food and fuel prices will have an immediate effect on the most vulnerable in developing countries resulting in hunger and hardship for households who spend the highest share of their income on food the study noted south of kazakhstan in the kyrgyz republic the poorest households already spent 65 percent of their income on food before these current price hikes as food inflation rises by 10 percent the impact will be catastrophic for the kyrgyz people after the fall of the soviet union in 1991 immense pressure was brought to bear on the countries of the global south to disband their food security and food sovereignty projects and to integrate their production and consumption of food into global markets in his recent address president tokayev announced that the kazakh government was now going to oversee the production of agricultural equipment fertilizers fuel and the stocks of seeds while 22 percent of world cereal production crosses international borders big agriculture controls both the inputs for cereal production and the prices of cereals four corporations bayer corteva chemchina and limagrain control more than half of the world s seed production while four other corporations archer daniels midland bunge cargill and louis dreyfus effectively set global food prices very few countries in the world have been able to develop a food system that is immune from the turbulence of market liberalization read our red alert no 12 for more modest domestic policies such as banning food exports during a drought or keeping high import duties to protect farmers livelihoods are now punished by the world bank and other multilateral agencies president tokayev s statement indicates an appetite in the poorer nations to rethink the liberalization of the food markets in july 2020 a statement titled a new cold war against china is against the interests of humanity was widely circulated and endorsed no cold war the campaign which drafted the statement has held a number of important webinars over the past two years to amplify discussions in africa asia latin america and europe on the impact of this u s imposed pressure campaign against china and on the racism that this has inflamed in the west part of no cold war s analysis is that these manoeuvres by the united states are intended to discourage other countries from commercially engaging with china and also russia u s firms find themselves at a disadvantage compared to chinese firms and russian energy exports to europe are vastly cheaper than u s exports the u s has responded to this economic competition not on a purely commercial basis but treated it as a threat to its national security and to world peace instead of dividing the world in this manner no cold war calls for relations between the united states and china and russia based on mutual dialogue centered on the common issues which unite humanity during this war on ukraine no cold war has launched a new publication called briefings which will be factual texts on matters of global concern tricontinental institute for social research will share these periodic briefings in this newsletter you can also find them here for its first issue no cold war has produced the following briefing world hunger and the war in ukraine the war in ukraine along with sanctions imposed by the united states and western countries against russia have caused global food fertilizer and fuel prices to skyrocket and endanger the world food supply this conflict is exacerbating the existing crisis of global hunger and imperils the living standards and well being of billions of people particularly in the global south war in breadbasket of world russia and ukraine together produce nearly 30 percent of the world s wheat and roughly 12 percent of its total calories over the past five years they have accounted for 17 percent of the world s corn 32 percent of barley a critical source of animal feed and 75 percent of sunflower oil an important cooking oil in many countries on top of this russia is the world s largest supplier of fertilizers and natural gas a key component in fertilizer production accounting for 15 percent of the global trade of nitrogenous fertilizers 17 percent of potash fertilizers 20 percent of natural gas the current crisis threatens to cause a global food shortage the united nations has estimated that up to 30 percent of ukrainian farmland could become a warzone in addition due to sanctions russia has been severely restricted in exporting food fertilizer and fuel this has caused global prices to surge since the war began wheat prices have increased by 21 percent barley by 33 percent and some fertilizers by 40 percent global south getting pummeled the painful impact of this shock is being felt by people around the world but most sharply in the global south in a word developing countries are getting pummeled united nations secretary general antónio guterres recently remarked according to the u n 45 african and least developed countries import at least a third of their wheat from either russia or ukraine 18 of those countries import at least 50 percent egypt the world s largest wheat importer obtains over 70 percent of its imports from russia and ukraine while turkey obtains over 80 percent countries of the global south are already facing severe price shocks and shortages impacting both consumption and production in kenya bread prices have risen by 40 percent in some areas and in lebanon by 70 percent meanwhile brazil the world s largest producer of soybeans is facing a major reduction in crop yields the country purchases close to half of its potash fertilizer from russia and neighboring belarus which is also being sanctioned it has only a three month supply remaining with farmers being instructed to ration us has sanctioned whole world the situation is being directly exacerbated by u s and western sanctions against russia although sanctions have been justified as targeting russian government leaders and elites such measures hurt all people particularly vulnerable groups and are having global ramifications nooruddin zaker ahmadi director of an afghan import company made the following diagnosis the united states thinks it has only sanctioned russia and its banks but the united states has sanctioned the whole world catastrophe on top of catastrophe the war in ukraine and associated sanctions are exacerbating the already existing crisis of world hunger the un s food and agriculture organization found that nearly one in three people in the world 2 37 billion did not have access to adequate food in 2020 in recent years the situation has worsened as food prices have risen due largely to the covid 19 pandemic climate change and related disruptions ukraine has only compounded a catastrophe on top of a catastrophe said david m beasley the executive director of the un world food program there is no precedent even close to this since world war ii if you think we ve got hell on earth now you just get ready beasley warned regardless of the different opinions on ukraine it is clear that billions of people around the world will suffer from this hunger crisis until the war and sanctions come to an end in 1962 the polish poet wislawa szymborska wrote starvation camp near jaslo located in south east poland not far from the ukraine poland border jaslo was the site of a nazi death camp where thousands of people mainly jews were caged and left to die of starvation how does one write about such immense violence szymborska offered the following reflection write it down write it with ordinary ink on ordinary paper they weren t given food they all died of hunger all how many it s a large meadow how much grass per head write down i don t know history rounds off skeletons to zero a thousand and one is still only a thousand that one seems never to have existed a

based upon the results of the distribution rate calculation there can be no guarantee that the level distribution policy will be successful in its goals the fund s ability to maintain a stable level of distributions to shareholders will depend on a number of factors including changes in the financial market market interest rates and performance of overall equity and fixed income markets as portfolio and market conditions change the ability of the fund to continue to make distributions in accordance with the level distribution policy may be affected shareholders have the option of reinvesting distributions in additional common shares through the fund s dividend reinvestment plan or electing to receive cash by contacting ast their financial adviser or their brokerage firm

necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income any such returns of capital will decrease the fund s total assets and therefore could have the effect of increasing the fund s expense ratio in addition the level distribution policy may require the fund to sell its portfolio securities at a less than opportune time to meet the distribution amount shareholders should not make any conclusions about the fund s investment performance from the amount of the fund s distributions or the fund s level distribution policy with each distribution

of the overall situation in the area he said the general radiation situation around the plant is quite normal there was a relatively higher level of localized radiation because of the movement of heavy vehicles at the time of the occupation of the plant and apparently this might have been the case again on the way out ukraine s state power company said russian troops received significant doses of radiation from digging trenches in the exclusion zone around the plant but grossi said we don t have any confirmation that soldiers were contaminated moscow russian officials say their demand that

millions of refugees fleeing the war in ukraine to exchange their hryvnia banknotes into the currencies of host member nations the european commission said friday its proposal aims at promoting a coordinated approach within the region this approach was necessary in light of the fact that the national bank of ukraine had to suspend the exchange of hryvnia banknotes into foreign cash in order to protect ukraine s limited foreign exchange reserves the commission said as a consequence credit institutions in eu member states have been unwilling to carry out the exchanges due to the limited convertibility of hryvnia banknotes and exposure to exchange rate risk according to eu figures more than 3 8 million of people fleeing the war have arrived in the european union more than 4 million have fled ukraine the commission proposed a maximum limit of 10 000 hryvnias 306 euros per person without charges at the official exchange rate as published by the national bank of ukraine berlin the

reported incident could be viewed as an escalation of the conflict kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said certainly this is not something that can be perceived as creating comfortable conditions for the continuation of the talks russia ukraine talks were expected to continue friday via video link the governor of the russian border region of belgorod accused ukraine of flying helicopter gunships into russian territory early friday morning and targeting the oil depot in what if confirmed would be the first attack of its kind it was not immediately possible to verify the report peskov said president

wall step by step zhao said while china says it is not taking sides in the conflict it has declared a no limits partnership with moscow has refused to condemn the invasion opposes sanctions on russia and routinely amplifies russian disinformation about the conflict including not referring to it as an invasion or a war in keeping with russian practice zhao s comments came as chinese and european union leaders were meeting virtually for a summit at which ukraine was expected to dominate discussions eu officials say they are looking for a commitment from china not to undermine sanctions and assist in efforts to halt the fighting geneva the international committee of the red cross says it s not sure that a planned delivery of aid into mariupol and an evacuation of civilians out of the besieged ukrainian city will happen friday spokesman ewan watson told a un briefing in geneva that the humanitarian group has sent three vehicles toward mariupol and a frontline between ukrainian and russian forces but two trucks carrying supplies for the city were not accompanying them dozens of busses that have been put together by ukrainian authorities to take people out also have not started approaching the dividing line he said friday watson called it an extremely complex operation adding that not all details are in place to ensure that this happens today he said the hope was that thousands of people could be ferried out and their destination would be into parts of ukraine less affected by the fighting that has been ongoing since russia s invasion on feb 24 the hague

president joe biden verbalized saturday what we all know is true as long as vladimir putin is russian president there will never be peace between russia and the west that said he did misspeak the u s does not have a strategy of regime change in fact it is not still clear that the u s has any real long term strategy to ensure putin is not a threat to us putin s war against ukraine raises two major questions the most obvious is what happens to ukraine after the fighting stops the answer of course depends on how the war ends win lose or draw the second big question is what happens to the transatlantic community and america s place in it the answer to that will depend mostly on what the president of the united states does and his actions in this regard will affect what happens to our paychecks our communities the sons and daughters who defend us and the security freedom and prosperity of every american what promises a better future for all of us is a strong confident and unified transatlantic community and the reason for that is china will europe finally wake up to the truth about joe biden now cutting the transatlantic community in half is the most important part of beijing s global strategy this would help isolate and tame america leaving us even more dependent on trade and investment with china moreover a weakened divided and distracted europe will be far more susceptible to chinese influence and beijing s best weapon for accomplishing that goal is russia there is no question that china greenlighted putin s attack on ukraine beijing like putin himself expected a lightening victory they calculated that washington and the western european capitals would then shrug their shoulders and go back to sleepwalking through history just as they did when putin usurped crimea a successful land grab would give immediate and obvious advantages to putin but what s in it for china the expectation was that another successful russian campaign would lead more european governments to lose faith in the u s and seek a new partner and interlocutor for dealing with the kremlin that new fixer would of course be beijing make no mistake not matter how this war ends russia will still be beijing s stalking horse in europe post war russia will remain a dangerous threat to the transatlantic community for two reasons its military power and its energy resources upon which so many of these countries rely yes the russian military has thus far proved embarrassingly inept in ukraine yet they have also shown they have no compunction about killing a lot of innocent civilians and flattening cities and they ve done that using only conventional weapons so far but europeans are keenly aware that russia has the largest and most powerful nuclear arsenal on earth one that includes the world s largest collection of tactical nuclear weapons moreover russian war doctrine embraces the use of tactical nukes even against nonnuclear powers at least as long as putin commands it the russian military will cast a dark and deeply concerning shadow on the west as for the energy threat the european nations rush to transition to a green economy has left them more dependent on russian oil gas and coal than ever while the west like the rest of the world needs abundant affordable reliable energy it has yet to figure out how to get it without doing business with nations that want to undermine bully and subjugate them the way to meet both challenges is to recognize that the west can t survive and thrive without the roaring economies that made the free world the envy of the world no matter how the war against ukraine ends putin will have to reset and rebuild his military it will be a span of months perhaps years before he can seriously threaten most of his neighbors again this gives the west a window when they can strengthen their capacity to stiff arm future threats from putin the question is will they use that time wisely the transatlantic community has shown admirable unity in the face of russian aggression against ukraine that is not the same as rolling up sleeves and doing the heavy lifting needed to deal with threats biden s swing through europe last week was supposed to reassure us and our allies that he is up for that it did not let s start with defense nato leaders announced deployments of battlegroups to show the flag along the alliance frontier these are a handful of battalion sized forces a few hundred soldiers each in comparison u s official estimates putin threw over 80 battalion sized groups into the first wave of the russian invasion nato deployments are based on a trip wire strategy to deter aggression the idea is to keep troop counts and firepower well below the russian forces on the other side of the border so they present no threat of aggression yet sufficient to slow a russian invasion until nato can move more forces into the battlefield in the event of an invasion but putin has shown he is reckless enough not to be deterred by the presence of clearly lesser forces nato needs to shift to a forward defense strategy that would change the signal to moscow from one that says if you cross into nato territory you can dictate the terms of the initial engagement to one that says from day one we will kill every aggressor who crosses the blueline that s a deterrent to establish that deterrent all nato members including the u s will have to field more capabilities additional air and missile defenses logistical support stocks of arms and ammunition the works biden said nothing in europe that suggests he acknowledges the need not one budget or defense plan the administration has produced suggests he gets it in fact the biden administration has yet to issue a national security strategy his team withdrew the draft they had produced because even they knew it was too milquetoast don t let putin s war in ukraine damage u s india ties biden s energy plan is even more pathetic he promised to help get europe liquid natural gas in the short term that is little more than a band aid the international equivalent of his move to ease the fuel crisis here by releasing three days worth of oil from the strategic petroleum reserve and his long term answer renewables shows that he really doesn t get it renewables require heavy subsidies can t deliver electricity for a stable reliable grid can t provide for all the needs of modern society and can t be scaled to meet the west s energy demand nor will they deliver better outcomes for the global environment finally we have yet to hear a responsible plan from the president on how he is going to unleash our economy in fact every policy biden suggests seems calculated to pile up more debt more taxes more inflation more government red tape and intervention the opposite of what needs to be done to unleash a free market economy crucial times such as these require bold rational leadership but there is little reason to believe we will get anything approaching that from our current president
i m josh conaway you might not think that the housing market could have much of an impact people who live on the streets but in springfield the housing market is directly related to the city s homelessness crisis in several ways one factor is springfield s severe shortage of affordable housing this shortage of low income units in the city means homeless shelters don t have anywhere for residents to transfer to so the shelters often stay full jeff sneider has been homeless for two months he s talking to us in central springfield at the veterans coming home center which is bustling with activity around dinnertime it s a rainy march evening sneider says he s glad he can come to the drop in center during the day but when it closes at night he only has one place to go every night sneider says every night it s above 32 degrees i know i m sleeping outside sneider says he can t get a bed in the city s shelters most nights because of overcrowding he s holding back tears as he talks i ve been sleeping outdoors i ve never done that but i am now and it s wearing on me i m a 51 year old man and it s wearing on me data from the department of housing and urban development showed homelessness decreased 8 in 2021 but before then homelessness had increased every year since 2016 in a november meeting of the springfield city council michelle garand from the community partnership of the ozarks says the organization is trying to reach functional zero on homelessness in the region which means a fast response and permanent solution for families and individuals who become homeless our goal is to ensure that homelessness is rare brief and doesn t happen again garand says but we can t reach functional zero without affordable housing garand said one main obstacle to addressing homelessness here is the lack of affordable housing and the current housing market nationwide which has seen the price for new homes and rent skyrocket during the pandemic is making matters even worse according to the department of housing and urban development median house prices are up more than 80 000 across the country since 2019 a report from harvard s joint center for housing studies found lower income renters were disproportionately affected the report also found the end of federal pandemic relief put many low income renters at risk of eviction lonnie funk president of the springfield apartment and housing association says the pandemic strained an already competitive housing market by increasing inflation and the cost of building new properties as families and individuals moved to springfield for job opportunities the number of vacancies shrank and the window of time to find a place to rent got smaller if you re not in the right place at the right time you re not going to be able to get an apartment funk told ksmu we ve got properties that have a waiting list that go out into august if you need a place tomorrow it s going to be a real struggle essentially the housing market has become more competitive for both renters and buyers this trend tends to push very low income individuals out of the housing market data from the national low income housing coalition found the average missourian would have to work 52 hours a week at the state s minimum wage to be able to afford a one bedroom rental home at the fair market rent rate and since there s a severe shortage of low income housing stock springfield s homeless population is straining emergency shelters that have to turn away people to manage overcrowding garand said many people have enough money for a deposit or even several months of rent ready but that there just aren t enough houses or apartments available at affordable prices we re able to pay for the deposits even double deposits up to 18 months but we just don t have the housing stock to make that possible garand said don curtis has been homeless in springfield longer than sneider he said he sees a lot more people without shelter in springfield these days than before the pandemic i know of quite a few individuals i met on the streets here that just lost their jobs because of evictions because of job loss and couldn t get back in curtis says and that was in this very city they raised their rents on them and i taught them how to camp garand says springfield needs to add more than 14 000 affordable housing units to meet the needs of households that the department of housing and urban development classified as extremely low and very low income garand presented several steps the city could take to help including conducting a housing survey expanding its crisis response system and building new emergency housing but she said one of the most important steps is to increase safe decent and affordable housing adam bodendieck the director of homeless services at the community partnership of the ozarks says the city can maximize the amount of houses available by building new properties and also by using existing properties that aren t being lived in we need to locally look at new developments bodendieck says locally we need to look at maybe our abandoned properties we need to look at nuisance properties we need to look at our aging housing stocks that s not currently being used and we need to figure out what we re doing to do with that and how we can convert that to sustainable low income housing for ksmu s sense of community series i m josh conaway

this article is more than 2 years old getty the second circuit decision in laurence gluck s appeal of a tax court decision has some important lessons about like kind exchanges partnership taxation and tax court jurisdiction with a deficiency over 1 5 million it seems like a pretty big deal based on this cuny tv interview with mr gluck a year before the 1031 deal it is maybe not that big a deal to him stellar management which he founded claims over 13 000 apartments and three million square feet of office and retail space under its corporate umbrella 1031 and partnership interests section 1031 is one of those code sections that is in the active vocabulary of nontax people like 401 k and 501 c 3 prior to 2017 it allowed us to defer gain on all sorts of property held for productive use or investment by exchanging for property of like kind you can do your exchange with a qualified exchange facilitator who will take the sales proceeds and use them to buy a property that you identify subject to strict deadlines and rules about who can or cannot be an exchange facilitator since 2018 1031 has only applied to real property in 2012 the year of the return in question there was a list of things excluded from 1031 like stocks bonds and notes the one that really intrigued me was choses in action never quite figured out what those are also on the list was interests in a partnership 1031 a 2 d the exclusion of partnership interests from 1031 gave rise to a sort of mini industry of tics tenancy in common that was a way to allow partial interests in real estate to be good 1031 vehicles in revenue procedure 2002 22 the irs outlined the preconditions it expected before being asked to rule that a tic was not a partnership interest one of them is the co ownership may not file a partnership or corporate tax return remember that the exchange in 2012 mr gluck and his spouse sandra prusock sold a condominium in nyc for 10 214 000 the money from the sale went to an exchange facilitator they identified 145 east 74th street in manhattan as a target property and formed a disregarded llc to act as the ownership vehicle and then on november 29 2012 the llc executed a contract in which it purported to acquire for 4 625 000 a 12 5 interest in the property emphasis added here is a pro tip for reading tax court decisions whenever the word purport occurs in any of its forms things are not going to go well for the taxpayer attached to the purchase contract was a tenancy in common agreement sadly there was not a ruling attached in which the irs determined that the tic was not a partnership there was another agreement for 12 5 at 4 625 million with his 2012 form 1040 mr gluck attached form 8824 like kind exchanges the form showed a deferred gain of 10 042 886 i know you expect me to dig through all the documents to figure out how they got there from the purchase prices totaling 9 250 000 but i am going to have to let you down that was not the issue incidentally the glucks had acquired another 25 of 145 east 74th street making them through the llc a 50 partner oops the partnership it turns out that the tic members were allowing a partnership return to be filed 2012 was business as usual with the gluck s llc being shown as a new partner with a 17 million plus tax basis capital account there was 754 depreciation computed that appears to have not taken into account the reduced basis from the deferred gain that was not mentioned in either opinion it comes from me nosing around in the exhibits the gluck return did not reflect either the partnership k 1 nor any income from the property there is not a lot of discussion of that here s the thing i can tell you now that i have been retired from active practice for several years on really big complicated returns with lots of moving parts that sort of thing can happen at any rate it appears that it was a small loss in 2012 thanks to the possibly over generous depreciation deductions what got the irs excited was that the tic was a partnership interest which blows up the 1031 exchange how it gets weird the partnership which is referred to as g p is considered a tefra partnership that acronym stands for the tax equity and fiscal responsibility act tefra passed in 1982 and the partnership provision was part of the long running war on tax shelters a partnership that meets certain requirements is referred to as a tefra partnership if the irs has an issue with a tefra partnership it fights one battle with the partnership about partnership issues it does not have to fight the battle over and over again with each of the partners what this means is that if you are a partner in a tefra partnership the k 1 is gospel unless the irs forces a change your only recourse is to file form 8082 notice of inconsistent treatment with your return the glucks did not do that the irs took the position that the tic was a partnership interest making 1031 unavailable irs assessed the additional tax along with a 20 accuracy penalty which they subsequently backed off from the notice of deficiency that they sent invited the glucks to contest the deficiency in tax court the irs took a different tack in tax court since the partnership that claimed the gluck llc as a partner based on the cotenancy agreement was a tefra partnership the glucks could not contest anything that was a partnership item their llc being a partner by virtue of the tic acquisition is a partnership item in the irs view and that means that the tax court does not have jurisdiction judge lauber of the tax court agreed with the irs about his court s lack of jurisdiction and the second circuit now backs him up glucks emphasize their view that nothing in the record reflects that they knew at the time of purchase that the existing property owners operated as a partnership for federal tax purposes contending that they should therefore be relieved of any adverse tax consequences related to their purchase but the glucks do not reference any authority for this position that undermines the reasoning set forth above instead the glucks argument underscores why it is so perplexing that they did not file a form 8082 once they received a schedule k 1 from g p that was completely at odds with their claimed understanding of the purchase the glucks opportunity to resolve the proper characterization of their interest in the property was when they received the schedule k 1 informing them of the partnership s tax filing had the glucks filed form 8082 which is required for taxpayers choosing to make an election that is inconsistent with a partnership tax return then they may have avoided the later computational adjustment the consequence of their failure to file form 8082 may be harsh but it is the result that follows from the statute and it is one that the glucks could have with little effort avoided at an earlier stage it would be good to know i think it is rather unfortunate that neither the tax court nor the second circuit got to the substance of the arguments what is supposed to happen if you buy an undivided interest in real estate and all of a sudden you find yourself a partner in a partnership you did not know existed generally speaking you can t become somebody s partner without them letting you in and you can t be drafted into a partnership code section 1031 no longer applies to anything other than real property and the list of excluded items including partnership interests is no longer in the code the irs has smuggled the list back in with regulation 1 1031 a 3 with the rationale that congressional intent was not to have some real property that used to qualify not qualify or visa versa so i would like to see the glucks get a hearing on this which may still be possible lew taishoff covered the tax court decision in 2020 with a post titled who dealt this mess he added an update edited to add 3 28 22 my colleague peter reilly cpa backed with all the resources of forbes and his own extensive knowledge informs me that the glucks appealed to 2 cir and got the pore l il ole tax court treatment i won t comment here as i did to mr reilly just now about my view of the quality of advice mr gluck got in this deal we went back and forth a bit and he indicates that mr gluck may still have the option to pay claim a refund and sue in district court if he is denied as one

the board approved a level distribution policy the level distribution policy under which the fund makes monthly distributions to stockholders at a constant and fixed but not guaranteed rate that will reset annually to a rate calculated based on the average of the fund s nav per share the distribution amount as reported for the final five trading days of the month preceding the announcement of distributions the distribution amount applicable to q1 2022 was reset based upon the results of the distribution rate calculation the distribution amount applicable for future periods may be reset based upon the results of the distribution rate calculation there can be no guarantee that the level distribution policy will be successful in its goals the fund s ability to maintain a stable level of distributions to shareholders will depend on a number of factors including changes in the financial market market interest rates and performance of overall equity and fixed income markets as portfolio and market conditions change the ability of the fund to continue to make distributions in accordance with the level distribution policy may be affected shareholders have the option of reinvesting distributions in additional common shares through the fund s dividend reinvestment plan or electing to receive cash by contacting ast their financial adviser or their brokerage firm

dividend reinvestment plan in the prospectus the board may amend the level distribution policy the distribution amount or distribution intervals or the fund may cease distributions entirely at any time without prior notice to shareholders the announcement of amendment to or later termination of this level distribution policy may have an adverse effect on the market price of the fund s shares of common stock the fund may at times in its discretion pay out less than the entire amount of net investment income earned in any particular period and may at times pay out such accumulated undistributed income in addition to net investment income earned in other periods in order to permit the fund to maintain a stable level of distributions as a result the dividend paid by the fund to shareholders for any particular period may be more or less than the amount of net investment income earned by the fund during such period the fund intends to distribute all realized net long term capital gains if any no more than once every twelve months to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis the fund s distributions may consist of return of capital in order to maintain the distribution amount a return of capital occurs when some or all of the money that shareholders invested in the fund is paid back to them a return of capital does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income any such returns of capital will decrease the fund s total assets and therefore could have the effect of increasing the fund s expense ratio in addition the level distribution policy may require the fund to sell its portfolio securities at a less than opportune time to meet the distribution amount shareholders should not make any conclusions about the fund s investment performance from the amount of the fund s distributions or the fund s level distribution policy with each distribution

other related information the amounts and sources of distributions reported in the notice to shareholders are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes the actual amounts

the biden administration has given the go ahead for another covid vaccine booster for people aged 50 and older and certain people who are immunocompromised they can now get another moderna or pfizer biontech booster at least four months after their last dose but just because you can get an additional booster does that mean you need to health officials argue that the protection provided by the covid vaccine booster shots wanes over time and they are concerned about people considered to be at highest risk of getting severe covid but the centers for disease control and prevention didn t make it clear how urgently people should be lining up for second boosters the agency says these groups are eligible for the shots but it stopped short of saying they should get them and some infectious disease experts say not everyone in this age group needs another shot now so if you re wondering whether to get a second booster here are a few key factors to consider risk of serious illness increases with age risk tracks with age and older people have the highest risk a recent study among people 60 and older in israel found that rates of covid 19 infection and serious illness were lower in people who had a fourth dose of the pfizer vaccine compared to three shots we re talking about extra protection from the most serious outcome of covid says dr eric topol founder and director of the scripps research translational institute dr bob wachter chair of the department of medicine at the university of california san francisco says he personally plans to sign up for a second booster i m 64 and pretty healthy he says but the evidence is clear that six months out from my first booster shot the effectiveness of that booster has waned considerably he says another dose will boost his immunity and decrease the probability of infection the benefits are very real wachter says but for people under 60 it s less clear a second booster is necessary i don t think we have the data for younger people 50 to even 60 says dr monica gandhi an infectious disease specialist at the university of california san francisco the study out of israel didn t include this younger age group she points out that other countries are targeting additional boosters for older people germany has authorized a fourth shot for people over 70 the u k is targeting people over the age of 75 and sweden is giving fourth shots to people over 80 gandhi says the u s is jumping the gun by forging ahead with shots for everyone over 50 without the relevant data still the trendline is clear says dr peter chin hong an infectious disease specialist at ucsf the older you are the bigger the benefit he says although the majority of deaths from covid have been people older than 65 there s a clear association with age and mortality with covid chin hong says it s really really striking and it starts at age 50 his advice walk to get the second booster if you re eligible then he says walk a little faster the older you get his mom is in her 80s and he wants to protect her as much as possible i m telling her to walk quickly he says dr carlos del rio an infectious disease researcher at emory university thinks it s reasonable for people under 60 to wait the vaccines are holding up pretty well against severe disease and death he says it s also worth noting that even for people over 60 the added protection of an additional booster shot is small in absolute terms people who got the first booster already have a very low risk of dying from covid chin hong points out that in the israeli study less than 1 of people with a third shot died a risk so low he calls it remarkable among people who got the fourth shot in this study just 03 died three shots is the magic number we think so far he says underlying conditions put you at higher risk certain medical conditions also increase the risk of serious illness and death from covid 19 and that s the reason the fda decided to authorize the additional boosters starting at age 50 we know that people in the age range from about 50 to 65 about a third of them have significant comorbidities said dr peter marks director of the fda s center for biologics evaluation and research at a press conference tuesday people with heart disease lung disease obesity and diabetes are at higher risk for serious illness and death and people over 50 particularly people of color are more likely to have an additional risk factor so by choosing age 50 and up to consider those at high risk or higher risk marks said we felt like we would capture the population that might most benefit from this fourth dose when it comes to age there s no bright cutoff of risk agrees wachter there are likely incremental increases in risk year after year as a person ages a 50 year old typically has lower risk than a 65 year old but health status matters too an unhealthy 55 year old is probably at the same risk as a healthier 65 year old wachter says bottom line risk goes up with age and underlying conditions and wachter says many people over 50 may benefit from another dose anyone who has a serious medical condition i would certainly suggest thinking about getting a booster says dr preeti malani an infectious disease professor at university of michigan health for my own family for my parents and my in laws this is something that i will recommend she says because that extra layer of protection does help ensure that if they get covid it s going to be milder immunocompromised people may need an extra boost health officials are particularly concerned about people who are immunocompromised because their immune responses to the vaccine tends to wane faster and they are at higher risk of getting severely ill or dying from covid 19 that s why anyone 12 or older with certain immunocompromised conditionscan now get an additional shot of the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine four months after their last dose a second booster of the moderna vaccine can be given to people 18 years of age and older this includes people who have undergone solid organ transplants or who are living with conditions that have a similar level of immunocompromise timing from last dose or infection is important there is mounting evidence of waning vaccine protection against serious illness from covid 19 in older and immunocompromised people who are at least four to six months past their first booster evidence of waning immunity comes from a recent cdc analysis of covid 19 emergency room visits and hospitalizations visits during the omicron predominant period two months after a third dose people were 91 protected against hospitalization but by four months that protection dropped down to about 78 it means that people who were boosted three four five six months ago probably have limited protection against current infection malani says this means a second booster can help shore up that protection but it s not going to be long lasting so the timing of the additional shot can be tricky right now the rate of viral infections has come down significantly since the peaks in january but there are signs that infections are rising in some areas the even more contagious omicron variant ba 2 is now the dominant variant in the u s and hospitalizations are also creeping up in some places peter chin hong says some people might want to wait to get a booster until a time when cases start to rise in their community and they need the added protection more urgently he also notes there may be more effective vaccines on the horizon as vaccine makers test omicron specific vaccines and continue research on vaccines that could fend off multiple variants it may make more sense for people at lower risk to wait still if you re high risk you may not want to wait too long polls show many vaccinated people held off on a first booster dose when they became available last year but waiting until you see another outbreak in your community could be risky it reminds me a little bit of trying to time the stock market it turns out nobody s actually good at it wachter says if there s another outbreak on the horizon it s best to maximize your protection in advance of it there s one more factor to consider when deciding on the timing of a fourth dose have you had a recent covid 19 infection if you ve had three shots and you ve had an omicron infection sometime between december and now i think it s reasonable to wait wachter says he says a recent infection likely puts a person in a similar immunologic state as a second booster rob stein and

looking for a healthcare stock with strong leadership our roundtable likes immunocore axsome therapeutics and glaxosmithkline when you invest in a stock you re not just investing in good numbers or an exciting story what you re really investing in is people who is leading your company where have they been and where do they want to go our roundtable is excited about three healthcare companies with outstanding leadership here s why we like glaxosmithkline gsk 0 39 immunocore imcr 1 75 and axsome therapeutics axsm 1 36 a full on reset george budwell glaxosmithkline emma walmsley took the reins as ceo of the british pharma giant glaxosmithkline five years ago this month during her relatively short tenure walmsley has overseen a complete makeover of the company s core businesses in consumer healthcare vaccines and pharmaceuticals for instance walmsley decided to dive back into oncology with the 2019 acquisition of tesaro along with several other in licensing deals after her predecessors sold off the company s cancer assets to novartis in 2014 more recently glaxosmithkline s top administrator has played a key role in the upcoming spin off of the company s consumer healthcare segment which will be called haleon as well as helping cement the drugmaker s competitive positioning in the high value hiv market the net result is that glaxosmithkline s shares have returned a healthy 34 6 when including dividends to shareholders since she became ceo while the drugmaker s stock hasn t exactly been a world beater in terms of return on capital over this period what s important to understand is that walmsley took over a company that was reeling from multiple miscues by its former brain trust speaking to this point glaxosmithkline s shares only produced 28 total returns on capital for the entirety of the ten years prior to her taking the company s top position is glaxosmithkline s stock a worthwhile buy with walmsley leading the ship i think that s a solid yes while some investors have been critical about the pace at which glaxosmithkline has been turning the corner there is no doubt that the company is in a better position than it was five years ago and the bulk of this turnaround can be attributed directly to walmsley s stellar leadership ready to lead a small cap to the next level patrick bafuma immunocore when you see small cap biotechs sometimes the c suite leaves a bit to be desired that s not the case with immunocore which has a star studded team loaded with big pharma experience many of whom have overseen the rollout of blockbuster therapeutics its leader bahija jallal has a jaw dropping cv and should inspire investor confidence in her role as medimmune s head of translational research in 2006 she fostered an incredible pipeline of more than 120 assets leading to astrazeneca s 2007 buyout of the company eventually dr jallal became president of medimmune as it became astrazeneca s global biologics research and development unit after the buyout there she oversaw the rise of blockbusters imfinzi 2 4 billion in sales in 2021 and fasenra 1 3 billion this rockstar further progressed to become ceo of immunocore in 2019 jallal is also a member of the board of anthem as well as guardant health so as ceo of a drug developing biotech she really understands both the insurance industry and personalized cancer diagnostics as a physiology phd from the curie institute in paris with a molecular biology post doc at the max planck institute dr jallal has over 15 patents to her name has authored over 70 peer reviewed publications and is the recipient of the 2017 woman of the year award from the healthcare businesswomen s association no doubt this ceo has serious biotech street cred since she s been involved in a buyout and shepherding multiple blockbusters i believe she is an ideal candidate to lead the up and coming biotech that is immunocore which has recently received its first u s food and drug administration fda approval its tcr immunotherapy kimmtrak recently approved for a rare form of melanoma is set up to continue expanding into broader addressable markets plus it has two other tcr therapies in trials if ever there was a person that could successfully grow immunocore it s jallal building a winner in the cns space taylor carmichael axsome therapeutics dr herriot tabuteau immigrated from haiti when he was nine years old he studied the human brain while he was a student at the yale school of medicine his advisors thought he might become a neurosurgeon he went into investment banking instead after stints at goldman sachs and bank of america and then managing healthcare investments at a couple of hedge funds in 2012 tabuteau founded axsome therapeutics a specialist in drugs for the central nervous system cns axsome went public in 2015 the company remained under the radar for several years at the beginning of 2019 it was a tiny micro cap but not for long after reporting positive data in several clinical trials the stock exploded 3 600 higher in a single year what s interesting about axsome is that its lead candidate for depression axs 05 is based on two drugs that are off patent wellbutrin bupropion and cough syrup dextromethorphan the company combined the two drugs and reduced the dosage of both it resulted in a drug for major depressive disorder mdd that has been wildly successful the biotech has already filed two new drug applications ndas with the fda in addition to axs 05 the company has high hopes for its migraine drug axs 07 axsome is prepping to launch both drugs later this year just this week the biotech acquired another cns drug this one for narcolepsy from jazz pharmaceuticals while narcolepsy is a small market axsome believes the molecule sunosi might reach 1 billion in sales in other treatment categories that would be quite the coup as axsome acquired the drug for 53 million plus future royalties so far investors are very happy with dr tabuteau s leadership axsome s stock has quintupled from its ipo and at a 1 5 billion valuation there is plenty of upside to be had

but love will make you do crazy things said hollywood actor will smith from the industry s most coveted and dazzling stage minutes after he had smacked comedian chris rock for a joke the latter cracked at actor and smith s wife jada pinkett smith the slap was followed by smith hurling profanities at rock from his seat who made light of it all within seconds the incident had overshadowedthe glittering oscars ceremony beamed on live television it has since been described as the slap that went around the world and drew a range of reactions ranging from admiration for smith to contempt for the protective framework of some men towards the women in their lives there s alot to unpack in that slap that lasted a few seconds smith with a long and admired career in hollywood hit rock as payback for the latter s joke about his wife s buzz cut forced by alopecia something she has bravely and openly spoken about in the last few months in his acceptance speech for the trophy he won as best actor incidentally his first smith self justified the slap using the oft heard line about love making us do crazy things danced at the after party showing none of the after effects of his on stage violence and later posted an apology of sorts on his instagram account that sounded disingenuous to many smith and his managers publicists must be weighing the impact of this act on his career and movie moguls must be assessing the possible market capitalisation of that slap ontheir projects if at all smith makes good with rock on stage it would give him ahalo and shoot up his stock rock has already made appearances at sold out comedy shows since but has refrained from making jokes around the slap there s talk about whether the slap was unscripted or part of a promotion strategy for alopecia medicines whatever it may be the impact of the slap on the men and their careers is only partof the larger canvashere smith s fingers on rock s cheek left reverberations not only in that exclusive hall that night but in related star galaxies off stage where furious discussions are said to have taken place about the correctness of smith continuing to be present in the confabulations of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences which had to apologise for the incident and consider disciplinary action for smith that could include expulsion or suspension fan followings of both the men culture writers and hollywood trackers feminists and women s groups among others there are good reasons why it matters so muchto so many the federal communications commission in the united states received more than 65 formal complaints from disgusted and disgruntled viewers who demanded action againstthe televisionchannelthat aired theoscars ceremony memes are par for the course in the social media era but some websites allow users to slap chris rock and measure it in miles per hour or kilometres per hour games and apps have been built around it there are furious discussions on online chat rooms and social media pages the slap has seeped well and proper into the popular culture and its grammar given smith s large and loyal fan following and coming on the back of many roles he essayed as the tough cop who relishes violence against the baddies onscreen it carries a message and it s not a nice one for many in the audience across the world smith s act of violence on stage was heroic and it signified his protectiveness for his wife but there s alot to worry abou there men who take to violence in words or act in defence of women are still held up as examples of the ideal manhood this warped view of manhood and what makes the alpha male is highly problematic especially in the subliminal messages it sends outto girls and young women who are still forming their ideas about gender roles and their appropriateness that some women saw smith as the ideal saviour and believed that he did nothing wrong in smacking rock was not surprising but rather a wake up call that patriarchy is often carried forward by women too those who justify smith s reaction to the joke about his wife as protective are just as patriarchal too smith himself referred to this protection aspect in his later messages but since when did women especially strong and sassy women like jada pinkett smith need such overt protection from their men since when did protection mean violence against another several troubling issues are mixed up here ideally if pinkett smithdid not like the joke she should have had the agency to select the type and timing of her response to rock in protecting his wife smith took that away from his wife women who hold their own in the outer world are often challenged to fight for space and agency intheir inner world all these matters because celebrities are examples and influencers their choices and behaviour are emulated by millions so was that joke kosher certainly not becauseno one should draw laughs from a medical condition or body type was there action appropriate not at all
