better reward to risk versus bonds but likely to be a bumpy ride summary in our base case we believe us stocks generate positive returns in 22 but with more volatility we start the year overweight us equities and underweight fixed income the largest market risk we see is interest rates rising faster than we forecast content continues below advertisement riverfront is proud to release our 2022 outlook entitled riding the recovery our outlook is a visual chart pack designed to walk investors through our investment views and predictions for the upcoming year in today s weekly view we created a concise synopsis of the outlook s conclusions along with four selected visuals that encapsulate a number of key takeaways note investors should contact your financial advisor to request a copy of the outlook 2022 we liken stock investing in 2022 to the experience of riding a mechanical bull more controlled than it seems and ultimately rewarding but not without its share of white knuckle moments in our base case scenario see table below we foresee 2022 as another bull market for stocks but caution investors that overall returns for stocks are likely to be lower than in the last 12 months and volatility likely to be higher we start the year overweight us equities and underweight fixed income we also see some selected opportunities overseas preferring developed markets to emerging ones while we are bullish on stocks we recognize that interest rates rising faster and higher than we foresee are perhaps the biggest risks facing the market riverfront investment group

and key drivers the i s have it positive catalysts we see for 2022 include solid earnings growth relatively low interest rates and capital shifting from bond to stock allocations the biggest risk we see for stocks is not another pandemic led economic shutdown but rather interest rates rising faster than we are expecting placing downward pressure on stock market valuations key drivers we are watching closely include inflation expectations interest rates and the continued innovation within the us economy and corporate sector in addition the way that interest rates historically interact with stock market valuation informs our view of the intrinsic value of equities we call these key drivers the four i s and view them as worthy of more in depth analysis each has its own section in our outlook intrinsic value stocks are pricey relative to history but reasonable relative to rates while stocks are expensive relative to history we think they remain reasonably valued relative to

the city of fountain valley calif voted 3 2 on dec 21 to draft a motion to support short term rentals with a moderate amount of restrictions instead of fully prohibiting them short term rentals are defined by the city as renting a living space for less than 30 days available options are commonly listed by homeowners on websites such as airbnb and vrbo given that short term rentals are not explicitly addressed in fountain valley s municipal code the city previously took the stance that they were prohibited due to the lack of an explicit prohibition it was challenging to hold violators accountable the city estimates that there are approximately 175 short term rental operators in the city at recent august and november council meetings the city council reduced approaches on how to deal with short term rentals to just two choices either prohibit them completely or allow them with a moderately restrictive level of regulations for moderately restrictive regulations the city manager explained it would entail a number of rules first the city would introduce a permitting process where only one license per owner would be issued in order to prevent corporations from taking over housing stock the ordinance would also limit the number of unhosted short term rentals where the owner is not present to 100 there would be no limit on hosted operations councilmembers said the current system of businesses taking over neighborhoods needs to be changed somebody needs to speak up for our city and for our residences we literally have businesses operating from our homes here this is a residential community i m just floored mayor pro tem kim constantine said we don t issue permits we don t issue licenses for this constantine who voted against allowing the operation to continue with restrictions said the 250 000 in tax revenue the city would receive from taxing operators is not worth it let me tell you something i am not excited about the 250 000 potential revenue because we re really going to have to have this policed with code enforcement the police various city staff planning and building and others it s just it s not worth it to this city councilmember michael vo said whether the city allows or prohibits short term rentals it will cost the city money because they need to enforce it whether we regulate it so that it can happen in an orderly manner that would benefit our residents or we just and it will grow it could go underground and other people can rent the house for 30 days and sublease it to other people the council voted to direct city staff to bring back a motion to approve short term rentals with the moderate level of restrictions with mayor patrick harper and mayor pro tem constantine dissenting

bitcoin and ethereum tokens surged on thursday afternoon pulling many stocks in the cryptocurrency sector along for the ride what happened the cryptocurrency market let out a proverbial sigh of relief on thursday easing into the extended holiday weekend with solid gains across the board here s what some of the leading names looked like as of 2 30 p m et stock or token brief description 24 hour price change bitcoin btc 4 96 the oldest and largest cryptocurrency specialized in storing and transferring monetary value 3 5 ethereum eth 9 13 the second largest digital token powering decentralized applications dapps via smart contracts 2 6 silvergate capital si 4 11 leading provider of banking services and trading platforms in the cryptocurrency market 5 3 marathon digital holdings mara 8 47 america based bitcoin miner 11 2 bitfarms bitf 5 24 bitcoin miner with mining sites in québec and washington state 13 1 so what the news behind these robust price gains is not systematically positive the securities and exchange commission sec rejected two applications to start bitcoin holding exchange traded funds etfs on wednesday night more to the point the sec refused to change its listing rules to allow the creation of bitcoin oriented etfs in general the commission argues that these funds cannot exist unless they are managed under surveillance by a regulatory body that can impose penalties if any fraud is detected that framework is not in place yet so the sec doesn t want any bitcoin etfs on the market on that note the cryptocurrency surge in the afternoon appears linked to an upcoming bitcoin bill in the u s senate sharing the news on social media senator cynthia lummis said she is crafting a detailed bitcoin and cryptocurrency bill to be introduced on the senate floor in 2022 the republican senator has reached out to find bipartisan support for this vision which aims to set up clear guidelines on how regulators should treat different types of cryptocurrencies in addition lummis wants to set up a whole new organization to oversee digital assets under the joint jurisdiction of the sec and the commodity futures trading commission if successful this bill looks like a positive piece of the regulatory puzzle some of the provisions may turn out to be stricter than bitcoin and ethereum enthusiasts would prefer but any increase in regulatory clarity must be seen as a step in the right direction marathon and bitfarms make their living directly from their bitcoin mining activities so their stocks tend to move in the same direction as bitcoin prices on any given day silvergate capital doesn t invest in digital currencies itself but the company is known as the leading provider of banking services and third party trading networks for other companies in the cryptocurrency sector hence this stock typically rises when volatility is rising in the digital asset market driving more demand for silvergate s services now what senator lummis s bill is just one baby step toward a properly regulated cryptocurrency market this framework will probably go through months of amendments and approvals before senators get to vote on it and a positive result there kicks the ball into the house of representatives for the second round of examinations when properly signed sealed and delivered this bill would still need support from a broader framework of u s legislation plugged into the global patchwork of different rules for every country so today s surge is far from a full recovery from the cryptocurrency sector s recent weakness all of the tickers mentioned above still trade more than 17 below their prices in early november led by price cuts of 35 for bitfarms and 50 for marathon november s crash showed that cryptocurrencies and stocks related to the sector can be sensitive to the same economic trends as stocks or bonds the digital assets market had been climbing to fresh all time highs back then only to be hamstrung by disappointing inflation reports the cryptocurrency market remains volatile and unpredictable the news was more good than bad today inspiring a sharp upturn in the long run we cryptocurrency investors really need that regulatory framework to come together whatever shape it might take again more clarity is always good news

with cash yields near zero and safe bonds paying little more many u s investors say they have no choice but to take more risk if they want to grow their money while that may be true investors also appear to be chasing the same investments in their quests for higher returns stretching valuations and ratcheting up risk notably junk bonds real estate and u s large capitalization growth stocks are overrun with investors yields on junk bonds and real estate investment trusts are the lowest on record yields and prices move in opposite directions the u s stock market which is dominated by large cap growth stocks is by most valuation measures more expensive than at any time except the peak of the dot com bubble in 1999 and by some measures it s even more expensive the danger is that record high valuations have a habit of tumbling from their perches there s not much investors can do about junk bonds and reits other than limit their exposure but when it comes to stocks there are many alternatives to large growth companies in the u s including small companies value stocks and foreign markets they ve been horrible performers in recent years leaving them cheap and unloved which is precisely why they merit another look small companies in the u s are as cheap as they have ever been relative to the broad market the s p 500 index trades at a price earnings ratio of 21 9 based on companies expected earnings for the current fiscal year compared with 16 4 for the s p small cap 600 index that spread of 5 5 points is only slightly smaller than the high recorded during the dot com era the same is true for u s value stocks the p e spread between the s p 500 and the s p 500 value index is 4 1 points also the widest since the dot com era the bargains are even better overseas the msci eafe index which tracks companies in developed countries outside the u s is 6 7 points cheaper than the s p 500 the widest on record and the spread between the s p 500 and the msci emerging markets index is 9 2 the widest in nearly two decades foreign value stocks are even cheaper relative to the s p markets are smart though and when one asset is more expensive than another there s usually a good reason when it comes to stocks the reason is often that more expensive companies are also more profitable businesses that shows in the numbers too return on equity for the s p 500 is 22 8 based on expected earnings for the current fiscal year compared with just 9 9 for the s p small cap 600 like the p e spread that 13 point roe spread is also among the widest on record the same is true for value and foreign stocks their roe relative to the s p 500 is smaller than ever or close to it but it turns out investors don t have to chase the s p 500 to capture its profits the index is dominated by some of the best money making machines ever devised including apple microsoft amazon com google parent alphabet and facebook parent meta platforms which account for nearly a quarter of the index the tech giants however are not representative of the field most s p 500 companies fall well short of the index s headline profitability if they re profitable at all and many of them are not cheap by cutting out expensive and lackluster companies investors can pay less without sacrificing profits one way to do that is to buy only the cheapest companies and the most profitable ones for example a 50 50 blend of the ishares msci usa value factor etf and the ishares msci usa quality factor etf results in a p e ratio that is a third lower than the s p 500 with nearly identical return on equity it s addition by subtraction the 50 50 value quality blend holds half the number of stocks as the s p 500 disclosure my asset management firm invests in ishares etfs a similar portfolio with foreign stocks also improves the price profits trade off relative to the s p 500 although it doesn t achieve the same level of profitability because few foreign companies are as profitable as the large u s technology companies still a 50 50 blend of the ishares msci international value factor etf and ishares msci international quality factor etf results in a p e ratio that is half that of the s p 500 with return on equity that s only a third lower investors may have to take more risk to grow their savings but that doesn t mean they have to pile into the same high priced investments now more than usual it pays to shop around
as montana s tally of new covid cases neared 1 000 each day in september shelly stanley lehman worried about when the virus would reach her day care in billings she wanted to have covid tests on hand to help prevent an outbreak from sweeping through her business but stores were sold out she spent days making calls and searching online when stanley lehman finally got her hands on a box of tests later that month it was too late a child s family member unknowingly infected had exposed the day care to covid the virus quickly spread to four others including kids and staffers we got the tests just in time to close down stanley lehman said rapid antigen tests for covid have emerged as a public health tool that can help keep schools and businesses open they are less accurate than polymerase chain reaction tests known as pcr tests which must be sent to a laboratory for results however the rapid tests turnaround time of as little as 15 minutes can spot cases early and through quarantines and isolation prevent infected people from spreading the virus at schools businesses and other workplaces but a box containing two at home binaxnow tests made by abbott laboratories costs 24 at a retail pharmacy and they are often in short supply the tests are much more accessible for those who are part of montana s state run free rapid test distribution program which gives away at least two types of binaxnow rapid antigen tests and a third non antigen test called abbott id now from the same manufacturer abbott this fall the state delivered as many as 113 000 antigen tests to hospitals health clinics government offices local health departments and others but communication on how to access tests has been inconsistent such as with certain detention centers and child care providers while some jails are screening symptomatic inmates with tests from their local public health department other law enforcement officials hadn t heard of the availability of the state s rapid tests at all tina bets his medicine assistant to the sheriff in roosevelt county said jail staffers there had not received rapid tests from the state or been trained on how to use them we re definitely interested she said that would eliminate some problems for us because we certainly don t want people sick in our jail the state has communicated with schools and local health officials about the program but it hasn t been more broadly publicized in the past two years of the state s covid 19 public service announcements none advertise a supply of rapid binaxnow tests or explain how to apply for shipments eligibility requirements for the free tests can be complex some school districts are ordering recurring shipments of tests for students and staff members but private child care centers and private employers have to obtain a federal waiver to administer certain kinds of tests and others who are eligible either don t know about the tests don t want them or are stretched too thin to add another burdensome covid task the result is an uneven distribution of the state s free tests state officials cited several reasons for that including the federal waiver restrictions a limited national supply chain also means officials must prioritize recipients but some public health officials see the gaps in test distribution as another indicator of an overwhelmed and under resourced public health system drenda niemann lewis and clark county s public health officer said many children and families in her county can get tested through school districts while other residents have few options when pharmacies sell out it s really hit or miss and we re just doing the best with the resources that we have niemann said there s no consistency montana s department of public health and human services said it distributed nearly 550 000 binaxnow rapid tests from october 2020 through this october dphhs sent 45 of those to hospitals and health clinics according to a montana free press and khn analysis of the state s data an additional 13 or about 73 000 tests went to assisted living and long term care facilities but only 5 or 26 500 tests went to a category titled other which includes group homes services for people with disabilities and child care centers that comes to slightly more than 70 tests a day for that entire category statewide during the same period fewer than 2 of all tests distributed approximately 11 000 went to dozens of state corrections facilities and jails other states comparatively have swung open the gates to testing tennessee created a program for interested businesses to obtain covid test kits free of charge with guidelines on how to qualify colorado is shipping binaxnow rapid tests directly to homes free of charge around the washington d c region libraries offer them at no cost both the trump and biden administrations have encouraged widespread distribution of rapid tests the biden administration aims to boost testing by increasing supplies to 200 million rapid tests a month in an ideal world you would have readily available testing much like we see in countries in europe where families can get 10 tests a day for their home said michael osterholm director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota in ordering abbott binaxnow tests montana is careful not to stockpile more than it can deliver before the tests expire after 12 months it sent 51 200 tests to colorado in may that were close to their expiration date the state doesn t track how many tests go unused after they ve been distributed montana gov greg gianforte spokesperson brooke stroyke said that testing is an important component of the state s pandemic response and that the state distributes tests to eligible vulnerable and underserved populations based on local health officials input after all local leaders know the needs of their communities best stroyke said missoula county is using rapid abbott id now tests the third kind of rapid covid test the state is distributing the abbott id now is not an antigen test but a molecular test similar to pcr tests the state has distributed an average of 3 120 of those tests a month matt volz khn a sign tells customers at the walgreens pharmacy in helena montana on oct 5 2021 that sales of at home covid 19 tests are being rationed those tests can be more reliable county officials said brian chaszar its covid 19 operations section chief said his county has access to plenty of tests and is able to get the word out about what s available he said some businesses and groups are bound to get missed in a large county and not every place will opt to receive tests whether it s because of the workload or potential backlash against covid precautions particularly in some school districts i have no envy for principals of those schools chaszar said some parents really want masking and testing other parents want to have nothing to do with it and refuse to participate in it with the rise of the contagious delta variant this fall the state increased distribution of tests to public and private k 12 schools that asked for them we would like as many k 12 schools to tap into these resources to help schools to stay open and be safe todd harwell the state health department s public health and safety administrator wrote in a september email to local and tribal health officials but dphhs spokesperson jon ebelt said supplying rapid tests directly to private businesses is complicated by federal regulations that require each business to receive a waiver to administer them ebelt said most of the state distributed tests are tethered by those federal rules which he said offer better reporting and quality control and are less expensive one of the two types of antigen tests the state receives from abbott doesn t need a federal waiver but it has a far more limited supply of them since june the state has doled out about 18 000 of those at home tests ebelt said the state s limited stock of the less regulated at home tests has been prioritized for other entities such as local health departments we were very concerned that we would not be able to secure enough tests from our supplier to expand distribution ebelt said although some businesses such as child care providers could apply for federal waivers to access more tests ebelt said dphhs did not think that was the best route because of the additional work for those already understaffed groups one former dphhs official disagreed with the department s interpretation of federal rules jim murphy formerly the state s lead epidemiologist said the state could find a way to distribute tests to day cares and other businesses if it provided proper training and oversight ideally murphy said the public health philosophy for navigating the pandemic should be focused on solutions rather than hurdles we shouldn t find obstacles here he said we should find ways to get these tests in the right hands one workaround offered by health officials in montana has been to connect child care centers with a federal pcr testing initiative operated through the u s department of health and human services the same program stanley lehman of billings used to order tests for her child care facility ebelt said the department knew of nine montana child care providers that had signed up to work with that program by early november as of this year montana had nearly 1 200 licensed child care facilities montanans access to tests varies by county partly because of how many tests local officials request and how they are used joe russell health officer for the flathead city county health department said that he knows people are struggling to find tests but that it s not all on the

selfridges new owners are taking control of a premium brand in a deal that will reunite the department store with its former boss the weston family owners of selfridges since 2003 have sold their european department stores to a thai conglomerate central retail group and an austrian property company signa holding which already jointly own upmarket department stores in italy germany and denmark through a division run by the former selfridges head vittorio radice the deal is the latest instalment of a rollercoaster history for the brand founded by a retail legend after more than 20 years rising through the ranks of the marshall field s store in chicago in 1906 the us entrepreneur harry gordon selfridge arrived in the uk with one intention to found a great department store by some accounts he was tempted to the uk by liverpudlian samuel j waring jr who had built up a string of furnishings stores in london and wanted someone to run a neighbouring shop to his new waring and gillow outlet on oxford street it was initially intended to be called selfridge waring store but selfridge took control when his partner hit financial difficulties and the new store opened in march 1909 under his name alone from the start selfridge embraced retail theatre and was determined his store would be a civic centre where friends can meet and buying is only a secondary consideration on the opening day which drew enormous crowds the store dazzled shoppers with live music abundant floral displays and copious lighting in its airy halls view image in fullscreen the opening of selfridges department store in oxford street in 1909 caused much excitement photograph print collector getty images the store sold a huge range of goods but out of respect for his early business partner not food or furnishings it housed a library a rest room for ladies a picture gallery and a restaurant linked to a roof garden selfridges set a new benchmark for uk department stores ditching the tradition of

u s sen elizabeth warren d mass decried high food prices in letters sent recently to the kroger co albertsons cos and publix super markets in the three letters all dated dec 14 warren claimed the supermarket chains could do more to mitigate increased grocery pricing boosted by inflationary pressures after they tallied big gains in sales and profit amid elevated consumer demand triggered by the covid 19 pandemic the senior senator addressed the letters to kroger chairman and ceo rodney mcmullen albertsons cos ceo vivek sankaran and publix ceo todd jones related u s consumers expect higher grocery spending in 2022 giant grocery store chains force high food prices onto american families while rewarding executives investors with lavish bonuses and stock buybacks i m demanding they answer for putting corporate profits over consumers and workers during the pandemic elizabeth warren senwarren december 20 2021 i am writing regarding my concerns about rising grocery prices for american consumers and the extent to which large grocery retailers are earning massive profits for company officials and investors while making it harder for american families to put food on the table while many americans faced the loss of jobs homes and loved ones during the covid 19 pandemic grocery companies like yours saw immense gains through record sales and profits warren said in the letters to kroger albertsons and publix related fmi sizes up pandemic s financial impact on food retailers citing various sources warren said kroger reported 2 6 billion in profit for 2020 up 5 6 year over year while albertsons totaled 1 89 billion in net earnings for 2020 versus 612 1 million in 2019 she also noted that publix reported 60 profit growth for the 2020 third quarter in 2021 these same companies continued to earn massive profits while pushing grocery cost increases onto consumers warren wrote i am writing today to request information on what steps your company has taken to protect consumers and how you will ensure that your company is not putting its profits over the needs of its customers amidst an unprecedented global crisis she added kroger albertsons and publix couldn t immediately be reached for comment fmi the food industry association a grocery retail and food industry trade group noted that supermarkets have grappled with a snarl of elevated operating expenses higher consumer packaged goods cpg and fresh food costs labor shortages and supply disruptions while working to keep products on shelves amid unprecedented demand and customers and employees safe from covid 19 what s more companies had to adapt to sudden changes and cost hikes on the fly fmi the food industry association america s food retailers and manufacturers continue their commitment to delivering the safest most abundant food supply in the world through coordination with consumers supply chain partners and lawmakers the industry overcame many of the concerns around shortages and runaway prices and fmi greatly appreciates the administration and congress continued engagement on these issues fmi said in a statement in response to warren s letters families have seen costs increase for almost all consumer goods including some items at the grocery store the trade group explained current price increases are due to a combination of supply chain challenges from labor and transportation shortages to higher fuel costs and increased consumer demand grocers are doing everything they can to absorb these cost increases and we ask consumers to continue working with us as we recalibrate our supply chains in november the consumer price index for food was up 6 1 year over year reflecting upticks of 6 4 for food at home and 5 8 for food away from home the u s bureau of labor statistics bls reported earlier this month bls noted that november s rise in the food at home index marked the largest 12 month gain since the period ending in december 2008 with increases in all six major grocery store food groups fmi in online resources about factors behind food pricing fmi noted that retailers absorbed abrupt cost increases in the pandemic s early months month to month the food index edged up 0 7 in november after rising 0 9 in both september and october the november increase reflected a 0 8 gain for the food at home index marking the third straight month of upticks in all six major grocery store food group indexes still u s consumers weekly grocery spend has largely held firm during the last year and the amount has decreased since the stockpiling phase in the pandemic s early months according to fmi the organization offers various online resources to illustrate the factors behind food pricing including the effects of supply and demand despite concerns about inflation average household grocery spending has held steady at an average of 144 week over the past year which is actually down from 161 week at the height of the pandemic proving america s consumers are remarkably resourceful and resilient fmi stated consumer demand for groceries surged 50 in 2020 lifting food retailer same store sales nearly 16 industrywide according to fmi s the food retailing industry speaks 2021 report released in september on average grocery retail comparable store sales rose 15 8 year over year in 2020 and more than 90 of food retailers polled reported higher same store sales for the year fmi the onset of covid 19 in 2020 shook up workforce dynamics for grocery retailers according to fmi meanwhile the u s food retail sector spent nearly 24 billion on covid 19 pandemic related costs according to fmi survey research released at the end of march that total included included 12 billion in payroll and incentive pay 5 billion in increased benefits 3 billion in cleaning sanitation supplies and labor 1 5 billion in technology and online delivery costs 1 billion in personal protective equipment ppe and related expenses and 1 billion in non monetary benefits and vaccine incentives fmi reported overall 63 of fmi retailers surveyed said they expect sales to decline in 2021 while 13 project flat sales and 23 anticipate increased sales on the earnings side 75 of respondents forecast lower profits in 2021 and just 10 expect increased profits in her letters warren asked kroger albertsons and publix to provide information on their profit goals during the pandemic average wholesale unit prices paid and consumer retail unit prices paid in eight product categories during fiscal 2021 and whether wages have been increased during the pandemic she said the information is being requested to address my concerns about your company s decisions during the pandemic and the impact of these decisions on your customers and workers and asked that it be provided by jan 7 your company and the other major grocers who reaped the benefits of a turbulent 2020 appear to be passing costs onto consumers to preserve your pandemic gains and even taking advantage of inflation to add greater burdens warren wrote to the three chains adding your companies had a choice they could have retained lower prices for consumers and properly protected and compensated their workers or granted massive payouts to top executives and investors it is disappointing that you chose not to put your customers and workers first though not cited in warren s letters fresh market grocery chain stew leonard s also has been dealing with elevated costs that have impacted pricing at the shelf according to president and ceo stew leonard jr i think elizabeth warren is wrong we are not raising pricing or anything we have to pass some prices on leonard said in a fox business video interview this week obviously we re dealing with a lot of small local american farmers right now just look at what happens when they go to fill up their tractor with fuel in the morning look at the fuel prices that are hitting them the feed prices are hitting them the labor every single one of our suppliers from our ranchers to our fishermen to our berry farmers are telling us that overall their costs have gone up we re trying to hold back as much as we can and not pass them along to the customer customer demand for food also has remained robust leonard noted in the interview pointing to his busy store in the background the norwalk conn based chain has seven stores in connecticut new york and new jersey i feel that half of the costs that people are really experiencing right now have to do with real life increases in fuel labor and feed prices he told fox business the other half i think has to do with just explosion of demand

your comments of the week image credit nasa jpl from denier on magnetism and the interstellar medium sorry to rain on everyone s parade but the interstellar medium at high speed is nasty not only is there intense cosmic ray radiation but a spacecraft striking random hydrogen atoms at anything over about 0 5c creates more radiation the level of magnetic shielding needed in that environment would wreak havoc on our biology it is not just the iron in our blood but even the water that makes up more than 60 of our bodies is magnetic sure a magnetic field of incredible magnitude for a long duration would be necessary at high speeds in the interstellar medium to prevent collisions with ions ionizing radiation at high speeds is dangerous and needs to be avoided so the standard idea is to generate a magnetic field outside the spacecraft and then to shoot any neutral atoms with a laser to ionize them but denier notes something bad could happen to you like for instance what happens to this frog at the national high magnetic field laboratory in tallahassee but just because you have a magnetic field outside of your spacecraft doesn t mean you need to have one inside one of the great properties of electromagnetism is that it has two types of charges positive and negative and so unlike with gravitation it s possible to shield yourself with the right electromagnetic configuration from both electric and magnetic fields as long as you create a more efficient path for the magnetic field lines to travel through the hull of your spacecraft rather than through the inhabited interior you won t have any problems to the humans inside i am well aware than not all of the problems associated with interstellar travel are easy to solve but i m pleased to inform you that this one is image credit nasa digital art by les bossinas cortez iii service corp 1998 from samuel j lawson on interstellar travel the section on warp drive doesn t make mention of the proposed albubierre sic drive of which at last reading harold white suggested the mass energy requirement may be only about 700kg so long as the solution to the problem of exotic matter and controlling the warp bubble from inside among a great many other problems are solvable it may still be impossible or very very improbable and likely requires a reconciliation between general relativity and quantum mechanics which heretofore has not been worked out there are problems yet to be solved but at the very least it seems to me that there has been more accomplished in this field than the author suggests if you are listening to what harold white is suggesting with no evidence and doing anything other than dismissing it with no concern you are going about this all wrong harold white has said and continues to say a lot of garbage without a lot of evidence if he were an engineer with any other job no one would pay attention to it because his job involves testing materials for nasa he is taken as seriously as the organization of nasa itself cut that out everything i mentioned about warp drive is true of the alcubierre drive the only difference is that the alcubierre spacetime is the one known solution to einstein s relativity that creates the spacetime conditions necessary for warp drive no there has not been more accomplished in this field than i suggest if you can find a relativist who thinks otherwise i ll happily do a 180 image credit nasa esa and g tremblay european southern observatory from eric on quantum computing my understanding is that the promise power of quantum computing has to do with its ability to solve more mathematical problems faster than a traditional computer of equivalent power another is that entanglement can improve signal compression and encryption over long transmission lines the fact that the computer will when all computation in finished eventually spit out a defined string of 0s and 1s does not obviate these points how a quantum computer can do more complex math faster i m not sure maybe someone else can answer that i am unsure as to how we got onto the topic of quantum computing from a post on a galaxy cluster but why not right here s the thing a traditional computer encodes information into bits 0 or 1 it has to store them access them and manipulate them and for that it requires a way to encode them an abacus uses beads a disk uses etchings a solid state drive post 2009 flash drive uses integrated circuit assemblies etc that s traditional computing image credit d wave systems inc under c c by s a 3 0 but quantum computing encodes information into qubits which can use something like a spinning electron to have something encoded into 0 1 or a superposition of 0 and 1 that special indeterminate state inherent to quantum computing it s a way to do probabilistic computing that provides an extra option and hence admits for often faster superior algorithms than traditional computing beyond that it allows for the theoretical maximum in information storage manipulation where a single quantum particle is the bit i hope this helps image credit nasa johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory southwest research

large scale structure there would be a great cosmic web of structure with small medium and large scale structures clumped together in certain patterns ethan this is completely untrue the cosmic web and large scale structure was a complete surprise and shock when technological advances began knocking out data in the late 1980 s this is exactly my area of expertise this is what my ph d was in what my research is in and what my educational sub focus was in although to be fair there were only a handful of people working on it quantitatively up through the early 1980s fortunately one of them happened to be my advisor jim fry and his advisor jim peebles who wrote the most influential book on the subject up until that point in 1980 prior to 1980 the argument was where the power would be images credit james schombert of the university of oregon via bottom up proponents like peebles contended that small imperfections in the cosmic structure would form first creating clusters then dwarf galaxies then large galaxies and finally clusters top down proponents like zel dovich argues for a pancake fragmentation model that saw galaxies forming from larger clusters down to smaller scales either way would mean the tilt to the scalar spectral index n_s would be large and so n_s would be far from 1 either much smaller or much larger image credit nasa wmap science team what inflation predicted is that the spectrum of initial fluctuations would be nearly scale invariant meaning we d see a combination of top down and bottom up in our universe for where the large scale power is and

ethan re gary s s question about antimatter galaxies see for a recent analysis of a slightly more complex domain wall analysis where the authors consider a smooth gaussian density interface between the hypothetical regions they first show that this model entirely escapes the best limits on domain wall type backgrounds from comptel back in the day but what i liked is that they go further and compute the apparent temperature effects from annihilation and compare that with planck data they end up with a 50 sigma discrepancy vs data chi 2 2400 which is a great exclusion this is a neat paper previously constraints like the one i talked about domain walls uniform structure and lack of gamma rays from annihilation were the strongest constraints but if one concocts a contrived model to evade those one can still get an even stronger constraint by looking at the now amazing cmb you cannot make the universe we see with equal amounts matter and antimatter and that s final here s looking

this article is more than 2 years old getty in recent years the story of irish whiskey was one of purely rebounding how after being a global whiskey powerhouse the country was down to only two operating distilleries in the 1970s and back up to 38 in 2019 like so many other sectors the pandemic complicated things quite a bit there s still a success story to tell but there were losses in sales in global travel retail one of the biggest markets for irish whiskey as well as a decline in visits to distilleries where many folks pick up a bottle according to the irish whiskey association the unfettered good news is that there s more choices for consumers than ever from craft distilleries and more luxury releases as legacy distillers expand their luxury options in fact according to the distilled spirits council of the united states since 2002 sales of high end premium and super premium irish whiskey grew a staggering 932 percent and 6000 percent respectively below is a collection of some of those new luxury releases as well as options from new craft distilleries in a variety of price ranges for your last minute shopping needs as well as some great dram ideas for 2022 courtesy redbreast redbreast iberian series px edition irish whiskey lustau a redbreast iteration that is a single pot still whiskey aged between 9 and 12 years and then finished in oloroso sherry butts has been one of my favorite redbreast expressions since it came out in 2016 so it s not surprising i d also like the pedro ximénez edition 125 which is the first limited edition whiskey to join the lustau in the new iberian series two things set the limited edition px apart from the permeant range lustau the type of sherry used in the finishing stage which is a darker and sweeter pedro ximénez and the time it spends in hogsheads which are half the size of normal sherry butts so there s more interaction with the sherry soaked wood the result is the px has a sweeter richer finish with less salinity but more toffee and caramelized nuts and a hint of orange bushmills bushmills 12 year old single malt this new release is just now hitting the united states and i m excited it slots into the range of single malts between the 10 year old which is aged in former sherry and bourbon casks and has lots of milk chocolate vibes and the 16 year old which along with the redbreast lustau is one of my all time favorites which is aged in ex bourbon and sherry and then finished for 9 months in port wine pipes and has lots of juicy red fruits nuts and spice the 12 year old continues the ex bourbon and sherry aging tradition of the series but then is finished in marsala barriques from sicily like the rest of the series there is a lush richness with deeper sweet brown sugar notes some tropical fruit and toasted nuts it s a great sipper on it s own but would pair well with desserts while this is a nice gift on its own 60 my idea of a pretty great holiday would be to try all three in a row or just go insane and also add in the 21 year old as well the deepening colors and flavors of the whiskeys show how much age and barrel finishes can impact a liquid and the range of flavor notes produced courtesy clonakilty clonakilty distillery single batch double oak whiskey the founders of the clonakilty distillery in county cork which opened in 2018 has been farming the land for nine generations the whiskey has an intense sense of place they use barley they grow on their farm and then age the whiskey on the waterfront property as the salt air interacts with the liquid the family also experiments with different cask finishes the single batch double oak whiskey 50 is aged in ex bourbon casks and finished in virgin american oak as well as former european red wine casks that have been shaved toasted and re charred the result is for vanilla lovers which is the predominate flavor with delicate pepper and ginger spices and a toffee finish mcconnell s mcconnell s irish whisky mcconnell s is a brand which dates back to 1776 in belfast and was popular in the united states from the late 1800s until prohibition like other irish distilleries it faced economic troubles during the early 20th century and eventually shuttered in 1958 until it was revived last year by conecuh brands who is behind clyde may s whiskey and prospero tequila the whiskey is currently sourced by great northern distillery which is owned by john teeling a powerhouse in irish whiskey history who at one time owned cooley distillery and kilbeggan and is the father of jack and stephen teeling who are behind teeling whiskey in dublin eventually it will be distilled at the crumlin road jail in belfast a former jail that houses political prisoners and is now a tourist attraction the current release 33 is five year old whisky aged in ex bourbon barrles and hits those familiar irish whisk e y notes mcconnell s spells it without the e to stay true to the original name it s light and approachable with lots of vanilla cereal and bread notes and a touch of pepper zima photos teeling 30 year old single malt whiskey teeling has been aging and bottling stock they got from cooley distillery see above entry for the family history there and been winning a lot of whiskey awards in the process the latest release they have in this line in a 30 year old that was aged in ex bourbon casks for 21 years and finished in sauternes casks for the last nine the result is a brain bustlingly complex whiskey that has smoke from a bit of peated malt used in the creation of the whiskey and the many years spent in wood juxtaposed with the sweet fruit notes that come from the dessert wine it s a smart way to compensate for the fruit notes lost as the whiskey gets older and it creates a great sweet savory mix there s a lot of fruit here of all varieties ripe apricots raisins even pineapple a bunch of caramel a bit of salt the oily whiskey has a long sweet finish you ll need a few drams to soften the sticker shock there are only 4 000 bottles in the world it s currently in ireland and the u s price is set at 2 200 when it gets here in january courtesy limavady limavady irish whiskey this irish whiskey started making headlines earlier this year when vermont based whistlepig acquired it at the helm of the project is darryl mcnally a former bushmills distiller who was born in limavady in northern ireland and discovered his hometown had irish whiskey roots dating back to 1750 making whiskey has never just been a job it s my passion when i started researching the history of the limavady distillery and traced my family roots back to realize that we were a part of it that was it i knew there was only one way forward mcnally said in a press release it s currently sourced whiskey while the distillery gets online just like whistlepig was back in its early days limavady is made from 100 irish barley and is small batch triple distilled in a copper pot still it s aged in ex bourbon barrels and then finished in px sherry casks which add some dried fruit and baking spices to the mix it s then bottled from a single cask the 50 whiskey is in a handful of states will roll out to more in coming months and is also available to 28 states via caskers com courtesy two stacks two stacks irish whiskey dram in a can in a pandemic inspired move two stacks irish whiskey debuted dram in a can an adorable 100 ml serving of whiskey in well a tiny can 19 for 4 the founders said they wanted people to be able to share more easily with friends in a variety of situations from a dinner party to camping or tailgating one can is enough to share with a friend or nurse yourself for a bit the whiskey is much tastier than whiskey you d expect to find in a can smooth light with stone fruit and brown sugar it s also more complex because it s a blend of five different styles grain whiskey aged in virgin oak and bourbon casks pot still whiskey aged in sherry butts malt whiskey in bourbon casks and just a touch of peated malt aged in bourbon casks giving it a hint of smoke it s a great stocking stuffer andrea sudati the busker single pot still single pot still is a uniquely irish style of whiskey it comes from the practice of using both malted and unmalted barley it emerged as a reaction to a tax in the late 1700s on malted barley the solution was to use green or unmalted barley in the mix to pay less tax the unmalted barley tends to give single pot still whiskey a fruiter flavor and creamier mouthfeel for those that want to try the style this is one of the most affordable options 30 it s made at the royal oak distillery in eastern ireland in county carlow part of a wave of new distilleries that have opened in recent years as irish whiskey grows in popularity this whiskey aged in ex bourbon and sherry barrels it is not as fruity as some other pot still whiskeys out there but is an interesting dram it s an oilier whiskey with a thicker mouthfeel that starts out with a bit of funk and grass that gets sweeter as it opens up with bready aromas baking spices and a peppery finish busker also makes a single malt whiskey a single grain whiskey and a blend of the three called triple cask triple smooth 25 which is aged in former bourbon sherry and marsala wine casks which is sweeter and less spicy than the single pot still courtesy grace o malley grace o malley blended irish whiskey fans sometimes joke that irish whiskey is a breakfast whiskey because it s light approachable and has lots of cereal notes this newcomer to the scene 37 definitely fits that bill and is made from whiskey sourced from great northern distillery master blender paul caris a former winemaker creates the blend using a combination of various age statement whiskeys aged in a different casks including ex bourbon and rum barrels it s also the first irish whiskey to my knowledge named after a woman 16th century irish pirate queen grace o malley the seafaring head of a family dynasty in western ireland and folklore hero courtesy the dubliner the dubliner whiskey honeycomb irish liqueur the dubliner an existing brand which opened a distillery in the liberties section of dublin in 2019 revamped their brand this year with a new look to appeal to a younger audience two permanent offerings including a 3 year old bourbon cask finish 30 and a rotating selection of beer cask finishes the whiskey honeycomb irish liqueur 30 is a good bet for the person in your life that likes to sip on something sweeter or an option for irish coffee if you want to skip the step of adding simple syrup

live richer reviewed by experts trusted by millions of readers if your retirement dreams include making a home in a new land you re in good company in the post pandemic world 12 of america now aspires to live abroad when they re done working according to the aegon retirement readiness survey 2021 find out while that might sound like a pipe dream for people who feel like they re not even prepared to retire where they are a little can go a long way once you leave the states many parts of the world allow you to retire comfortably on much less than you could in the u s but it s not all peaches and cream growing old in another country comes with quite a few cons if you re part of the growing slice of america with overseas retirement dreams here s what you need to know financial rewards of retiring abroad while you should always look to stretch your dollars once your earning years have passed never retire abroad for the sole purpose of saving money there are plenty of cheap countries to live in outside of the u s but the tradeoff is almost always a change in the day to day standard of living if you re only going to save money and you want the place you go to be just like the u s you are not going to be happy said jennifer stevens executive editor at international living if you are up for embracing a new lifestyle on the other hand then it is possible to plan for a low cost retirement overseas you might be able to live on social security alone with the exceptions of cuba north korea and a handful of other countries mostly central asian countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan you can still collect social security while living overseas in many countries you can even have your check directly deposited into an account said sally hurme author of aba aarp wise moves checklist for where to live what to consider and whether to stay or go considering that the average monthly retirement benefit is just 1 613 77 social security alone is not enough to sustain you in retirement in the u s and it was never meant to that s not the case however in some other countries you can have a decent respectable life on your social security said akaisha kaderli who retired with her husband billy at age 38 and writes about their experiences at retireearlylifestyle com the message given in the states is you can t retire it s going to be the pits for you no one ever mentions there are other places to go you can live better on less if you do have enough money saved to retire comfortably in the u s then you might be able to live like a rich person overseas according to stevens you could live very well on 4 000 or 5 000 per month in countries like mexico costa rica cambodia and thailand she said for example you could hire a housekeeper gardener or nurse in guatemala at 25 percent of the cost you d pay in the u s said pauline paquin who writes about early retirement at reachfinancialindependence com she left the corporate world at age 29 became financially independent through saving and real estate investing around 32 and now lives in guatemala you can get a full time staff for around 300 a month paquin said adding that you can hire a live in nurse to provide round the clock care for about 500 a month the median cost of a home health aide in the u s is 3 813 according to seniorcare com healthcare might be cheaper the lure of inexpensive healthcare is one of the top reasons for living abroad even working americans travel to other countries for medical procedures to save money billy kaderli said both he and his wife have benefited from low cost quality medical care overseas for example he said paid 320 to have a colonoscopy done in thailand which included a private taxi ride home after the procedure as part of the cost the average price for a colonoscopy in the u s is about 3 600 and can exceed 8 000 according to health affairs in mexico he paid 250 for a dental x ray and porcelain crown replacement in the u s the average cost for a porcelain crown is 1 000 3 500 per tooth according to the consumer guide to dentistry in general the care the kaderlis have received outside the u s has been better he said the doctors speak english and there is often no wait to see a specialist according to billy kaderli he and his wife are able to pay out of pocket because the costs are low you ll save money on transportation the annual cost to own and operate a car in the u s is 9 666 according to aaa when you retire abroad you might not need a car because public transit is more common and reliable there are all sorts of ways to get around that are easier than in the states akaisha kaderli said adding that the costs are low even private transportation like taxis costs less in many countries you can take a taxi across town for 1 50 stevens said because many foreign cities are more pedestrian friendly than u s cities americans who retire abroad walk more and lose weight stevens said as a result their health improves and they can stop taking some medications which reduces healthcare costs long term care can be cheaper you could wipe out your savings paying for long term care in the u s unless you have long term care insurance to help cover the cost the median yearly cost for an assisted living facility is 51 600 according to the genworth cost of care survey the median cost for a private nursing home room is 105 850 per year in the states assisted living and long term care is a huge expense akaisha kaderli said in mexico where she and her husband live now there are several assisted living facilities that charge 1 500 to 2 000 per month she said see financial risks of retiring abroad retiring abroad doesn t guarantee a lower cost of living of course where you decide to live will greatly affect how much you spend on housing and other basic needs as well as on things like entertainment here are the financial considerations you need to be aware of when planning for retirement abroad you can t escape us taxes if you think you ll lower your tax bill by retiring overseas think again you still have to pay u s taxes even if you move your assets to accounts in your new country you will be required to file an annual tax return according to the u s department of state you might also have to pay taxes in your new country hurme said the u s does have treaties with some countries including canada and mexico that prevent double taxation but the country you want to retire to might not you need to know in advance what the potential requirement for paying taxes in the new country will be hurme said she recommends hiring an accountant or financial advisor in the country where you want to retire or look for a u s professional who has experience working with americans living overseas helpful visa and residency requirements and costs vary if you want to spend just part of the year living abroad or are willing to move from country to country most countries offer a three month tourist visa in some places such as mexico you can get a six month tourist visa stevens said this route usually isn t expensive or complicated if you want to set up permanent residence abroad however you might have to jump over more hurdles and pay more this depends on where you want to retire for example it s much more difficult and expensive to get a long term visa in europe than in countries that are enticing retirees to move there like mexico or panama stevens said some countries even require retirees to show they have a regular source of income to get a residence visa hurme said check with the embassy of the country where you want to live to see what the requirements are she said paquin cautions that you might need to hire an immigration attorney to help you with the process which can be expensive you can t use medicare overseas no matter your medicare eligibility age you can t use this government run health insurance plan overseas your healthcare is not going to follow you hurme said of course there are various kinds of u s health insurance plans for international health coverage hurme said and some countries have national healthcare systems you might be able to take advantage of or private insurance you can buy nonetheless if you don t plan to pay for care entirely out of pocket you need to know what health insurance is going to be available to replace your medicare coverage hurme said if you decide to return to the u s after living abroad you might have to pay a penalty if you want to enroll in medicare hurme said the monthly premium for medicare part b which covers doctor visits services like lab tests and surgeries and medical supplies goes up 10 for every year you could have had it but didn t sign up if you re thinking you re coming back to the united states you re going to have issues and expense getting medicare coverage back unless you want to continue to pay your medicare premium while you re out of the country hurme said see you have to consider currency exchange and foreign transaction fees you likely won t have trouble accessing your money in a foreign country thanks to atms hurme said however if you travel often then you know it is possible to incur foreign transaction fees on top of atm withdrawals if your bank or credit card charges foreign transaction fees consider switching to ones that don t before moving overseas you might also want to open an account with a bank in your new country hurme said you ll want an account that lets you transfer money easily from your u s accounts but you probably won t want to transfer all of your money that s because u s law requires you to report if you have more than 10 000 in an overseas account on any one calendar day in a year she said keep in mind that cash is king in many countries and it s better to deal in the local currency even if stores and establishments allow credit cards some will add an extra charge some as high as 20 according to billy kaderli you ll need new estate planning documents if you own property or have assets in your new country you ll likely need to hire an attorney in that country to help draft an estate plan hurme said that s because any documents that you had drafted in the u s such as a will trust or power of attorney might not have any effect overseas you re going to need legal advice both in the u s and your new country as to how your assets are going to be distributed at your death she said that s an added cost and complication you need to consider when planning for retirement overseas also realize that not all countries recognize a healthcare power of attorney which gives someone the right to make healthcare decisions if you can t and many countries don t have a living will concept hurme said the doctor decides whether you should get life prolonging treatment remember even if you feel the financial rewards outweigh the risks you should not move abroad just for a lower cost of living you can live cheaply in the midwest and not have to uproot yourself paquin said and while it is possible to live better for less in some other countries being far from friends and family is something to take into account she said more from

lahore sukkur london pml n president shahbaz sharif thursday said he was foreseeing pakistan s downfall if the pti led government was not sent home god forbid if this government is not sent packing we might see pakistan s khuda hafiz so gear up he said while addressing a party function held on the death anniversary of khwaja rafique father of pml n leaders khwaja saad rafique and khwaja salman rafique at a lahore hotel the seminar was also addressed by khwaja asif liaquat baloch ayaz sadiq khwaja saad rafique senior journalist mujeeb ur rehman shami and others the time has come to remove the pti government which was formed as a result of rigging shehbaz said adding that quaid e azam must be turning in his grave slamming the pti for its policies he said i had revealed this three years ago that a nab niazi nexus exists they have mortgaged the country to the international monetary fund imf taking a jibe at prime minister imran khan he said if the premier liked unveiling projects so much he should have informed him as he would award him a plaque for unveiling so many plaques now the time has come when the people will start grabbing them by their collars he said claimants of millions of jobs have made millions of people jobless he said adding that politics were the name of public service and sharing the pain and suffering of the people shehbaz said day and night work was done on 1 360mw coal power project in sahiwal under cpec and in the history of the world sahiwal project was completed in the shortest time speaking from london over phone pml n quaid and former prime minister muhammad nawaz sharif thursday said the country was facing inflation from inside and diplomatic isolation from outside the green passport has lost its honour we said goodbye to the imf programme he said adding that the nation was waiting when he will commit suicide for taking loans from the imf nawaz said pakistan was not even offered a chair on the security council adding that a world leader was not attending imran khan s calls while another leader was not calling him he said the country s reputation at the international level was that a country confiscated our ship and another seized our hotel those who destroyed the national airline should not be spared he added remembering khwaja rafiq nawaz said his departure created a vacuum and his absence was still felt in the country s politics i am happy that his sons khwaja saad and khwaja salman are following in the footsteps of their father he said adding that khwaja rafiq endured prisons and faced hardships but never bowed to the oppressors my nephew yusuf abbas told me how both the khwaja brothers faced hardships in jails but they didn t leave their narrative he maintained giving example of the sharif family nawaz said political revenge was taken on him and his family in the name of accountability the ex premier said he along with his daughter was jailed while shehbaz sharif and hamza shehbaz and their families too faced jails on account of fake allegations thank god that we remained steadfast the nation gave us mandate three times we brought prosperity and employment the best roads have been built from islamabad gwadar and gilgit to skardu we have built a new pakistan which has reached its completion we promised to end load shedding and we fulfilled that promise he stated nawaz claimed it was not possible to end loadshedding in five years but due to the hard work of shehbaz sharif the pmln government ended loadshedding in three years terrorism was eradicated from pakistan where terrorist attacks were taking place every day he said adding we made pakistan the cradle of peace and established peace in karachi praising shehbaz sharif nawaz said shehbaz and his team built best hospitals and educational institutions in punjab but some hidden forces stole the election in 2018 and the country was handed over to an incompetent gang they raised the slogan of naya pakistan but destroyed the old pakistan the stock market was destroyed today dollar is of 180 rupees imran khan is being called a puppet in afghanistan the american media is calling him the mayor of islamabad millions of people have reached the brink of destruction the children of the poor are in a bad condition due to hunger how can a labourer earning around rs20 000 live in these conditions he remarked he continued to grill the government and said who will be responsible for the sighs of the poor facing high petrol prices highest ever electricity bills gas shortage high prices of edibles and joblessness nawaz said the rulers had taken away the happiness of the children of the nation where is the country going there is only one question on everyone s mind the law is becoming a nose of wax and the state remains above the state the constitution the country and democracy have been betrayed again and again he said and added that the only way to fight the current situation is to stand up against the government no one has the right to block your opinion a nation which does not learn from its past can never move forward he concluded ppp co chairman and former president asif ali zardari thursday said he will now pitch a party camp in lahore where he will organize people and lodge a protest for the rights of the people we have tried to heal the wounds of everyone and worked for development and prosperity of pakistan we ventured into the issues of khyber pakhtunkhwa and balochistan he said while addressing party workers at the zardari house in nawabshah and tando allahyar they have made pakistan their fiefdom and decide who should be in power and who should not be i will pitch a camp in lahore and wage a decisive battle for the rule of law and prosperity of my motherland he said zardari said the ppp always worked for welfare of the people and will continue to serve them led by bilawal and asifa bhutto there are issues between the federal government and us that keep going now is the time to cope with them zardari further said they gave constitution to pakistan and will defeat those powers with the power of the people talking about the performance of ppp during its tenure zardari said they always worked twice and thrice than the others it s a journey of life with ups and downs i spent an eid in jail it keeps happening it s a legacy of ppp we continue our struggle on this journey the people have seen that the ppp never made false promises in its manifesto the former president continued recalling the 2018 elections zardari said the ppp got trapped in engineered elections and they elected their own people it s ok zardari said the ppp never made big claims but made big things by making small claims he said from the first day he had been telling the rulers to show their work as there was poverty and the people s condition was apathetic he said soon the reins of the country will again be in the hands of ppp with the power of votes of the people this change has destroyed the country we will take it out of destruction because this country is ours we have oil gas and coal despite all the minerals wrong government policies have damaged the economy he further said this time such a master plan has been made that the country will be on the path of development and prosperity adding that only sindh province can run the whole country he said during his tenure everything was going bad but he made corrections you need to look at how to take the next step how to move forward and how to move the country speaking on the occasion pml n leader and former federal minister khawaja saad rafique predicted imran khan s political death in the near future saad called on pml n and ppp to join hands and initiate a political struggle as he claimed that imran khan was not a part of the political fraternity the ex federal minister said joining hands was the only option to take the country forward and noted that pulling each other s legs would not help them progress the state faces threats from within we will have to think that we will be safe only if the country exists so do not play with its integrity the pml n leader warned rafique advised the state to not patronise anyone and not fall when a group stages a sit in if we mobilize the parliamentary board then we will see the funeral of imran khan s politics coming out he said be it the judiciary the establishment the political leadership or the people of the media everyone had to think about how to move the state forward instead of taking revenge from each other khawaja saad rafique further said that general ayub was the first person to be pushed into the american quagmire on the basis of malice and the character of those who spoke the word of truth started decaying pakistan got freedom on paper but it has not been delivered to the common man he claimed if we want to put pakistan back on the track then all political parties have to be taken on board he maintained he said if half a million people come on the streets then no one can apply martial law resolutions were also presented in the session which were approved by the participants with a show of hands pml n leader khawaja asif said the pti led government had tuned politics into obscenity as he said imran khan had established some new traditions we have seen several things in the last three and a half years shabbar zaidi and razak dawood are saying that the country is bankrupt if the government does not accept its wrongdoing how will the process of forgiveness begin he questioned former speaker national assembly sardar ayaz sadiq said khawaja muhammad rafique gave his time for democracy he said that imran khan should wear the shoes of democracy he said truth was told in the state of madina but in the time of imran niazi only false accusations were leveled ayaz sadiq said like khyber pakhtunkhwa punjab will also respond to the local bodies elections in a similar manner the romance that the youth had with imran khan is now over he taunted and said their vehicle was punctured and their audios and videos were being leaked ayaz said he will go to london again next month to meet nawaz sharif nawaz sharif has left his decision to the court of allah and the result is coming soon he said without giving any clarity about what he meant he claimed that nawaz sharif was coming back to pakistan soon he said whoever brought imran khan should think that keeping him in power would be a national catastrophe as long as imran remains in the government the country would be in danger he added mujeeb ur rehman shami said that the feudal system could not end in pakistan nothing has been proved against khawaja saad rafique and despite all hardships he did not leave the path of his father he said the present government which was protecting the nab rules will also come under its grip after turning of the tables deputy amir of jamaat e islami liaquat baloch said the bus built in peshawar does not run but burns rs20 billion has been spent on one kilometer of brt baloch said adding that he never thought that khawaja muhammad rafiq would be brutally killed khawaja muhammad rafiq was the beginning of targeted killing in politics he said adding that the country was currently suffering from ideological cultural and moral crisis which could only be overcome by a real democracy he said the electoral crisis was deepening the election of 2018 was rigged and now the government and the establishment were announcing that they were on the same page the biggest crisis was that the state institutions themselves have been in great danger for their very existence he said and maintained that kashmir was sold
