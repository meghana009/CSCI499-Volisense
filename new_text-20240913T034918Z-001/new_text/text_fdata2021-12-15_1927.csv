when she was apartment hunting for her family in 2009 heidi leno was thrilled to find a spacious unit in an older building on union street in littleton available for rent but weeks after she moved in with husband charles 6 year old daughter courtney and twins matthew and maureen not yet two years old something started to seem terribly wrong with matthew the toddler who had previously been sounding out his first words suddenly stopped speaking he was constantly constipated he had terrors that would leave him screaming in the middle of the night and unable to go back to sleep i lived off of two hours of sleep every day leno recalls a doctor s visit showed that matthew had blood lead levels of 4 6 micrograms per deciliter and maureen 3 7 months later the levels had risen to 17 for matthew and 18 for maureen at the time the u s centers for disease control and prevention considered lead levels of 10 or higher to be of concern though experts commonly say there s no safe level of lead exposure in young children the lenos moved out and for the past 11 years have been engaged in a lawsuit with the landlord claiming that lead poisoning is responsible for the developmental disabilities with which matthew still struggles now 13 he has been found to have an iq of between 40 and 65 his doctors say he will likely never drive or hold a job he is now attending virtual school because the bullying he experienced during in person classes gave him suicidal thoughts according to his mother he is far from alone while new hampshire has made progress on the issue in the past half decade 580 children were found to have elevated blood lead levels in 2019 no definitive standards the burden falls disproportionately on more vulnerable families including those living in poverty children enrolled in medicaid made up fewer than 30 percent of those tested in 2019 but represented about half of kids found to have blood lead levels above 5 or 10 micrograms per deciliter according to the new hampshire department of health and human services young children living in poverty are at especially high risk of lead poisoning on average income status and housing age are the strongest predictors of heightened risk of lead exposure in new hampshire said beverly drouin section administrator of healthy homes and environment at the agency similarly at a national level the centers for disease control and prevention says children in low income households and in pre 1978 homes face the greatest risk because of poor housing some black children are at higher risk for lead exposure according to the cdc nationwide their data shows that black children and children from low income families are more likely to have blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per deciliter this mirrors the trend in new hampshire where nh dhhs data shows that black children made up 2 4 percent of those tested in 2019 but 7 1 percent and 8 9 percent respectively of those with lead levels above 5 or 10 micrograms per deciliter and the cdc says u s homes built before 1978 are likely to have at least some lead based paint the lenos former landlord declined to comment for this story but court documents show she denies responsibility for his condition with her lawyer arguing that studies on elevated blood levels and intelligence indicate his exposure would in no way account for the severity of his disabilities on the other hand a report by the lenos psychology expert dr peter isquith concludes it is more likely than not that the lead exposure is a substantial contributing factor to matthew s deficits while no definitive standards exist for assessing the connection between lead exposure and neurological damage in individual cases dr alan woolf a professor of pediatrics at harvard medical school and expert on lead poisoning says experts can make probable correlations in an individual child you can t tell what caused what but you can certainly suspect it he says woolf explains that children especially preschoolers are particularly susceptible to the effects of lead because their organ systems notably their brains and nervous systems are still developing the most concerning effects are neurological he says adding that exposure to lead is associated with later development of attention deficit disorder hyperactivity and learning disabilities some studies have also shown an association with lower iqs he notes lead containing paint dust is the usual mode of entry in children woolf says with actions like opening windows or doors releasing contaminated dust that toddlers pick up on their hands and feet then ingest at about nine months they start standing and walk holding on he says and if they re holding on to a wall or a windowsill that s when they re going to get exposed children with autism are at particular risk because they continue to put their hands in their mouths longer than other children a comorbidity for lead poisoning is iron deficiency woolf says because toddlers run out of the store of iron they received from their mothers in the womb by the time they reach the age of eight or nine months lead and iron are absorbed the same way in the gut he explains kids who are iron deficient are particularly vulnerable to lead poisoning because they run out of maternal stores of iron one of the reasons we have universal screening in new hampshire is they can present with higher lead levels and have few if any symptoms a real knowledge gap lead exposure used to be a far bigger problem in the united states in the late 1970s 88 percent of children ages one to five had blood lead levels of 10 micrograms per deciliter or higher phasing out leaded gasoline resulted in huge declines by 2015 2016 that number was 0 2 percent today the primary cause of lead poisoning is lead paint which still lingers in many homes built before it was banned in 1978 that s a particular concern in places like new hampshire where more than half of homes were constructed before that date according to dhhs about one fifth of those homes house a child under 6 meaning tens of thousands of kids may be living in structures with lead hazards for years new hampshire had a real knowledge gap about how large the risk of lead exposure was and whom to test for lead poisoning says gail gettens a child development specialist with dhhs lead poisoning prevention program in 2015 the year she joined the program just 52 6 percent of 1 year olds and 26 3 percent of 2 year olds in new hampshire were tested for blood lead levels there were two main barriers according to an article gettens later co authored with her colleague beverly drouin insufficient awareness and a cumbersome testing process at the time medical providers in the state mostly relied on venous blood draws to test for lead often that meant pediatricians would refer parents to labs at other locations where they d have to deal with an already cranky 2 year old being stuck with a needle that lowered follow through you had to leave my office i had to put in the order for you then you had to go from my office to the lab in order to get it done says dr erik shessler a manchester pediatrician and president of the new hampshire chapter of the american academy of pediatrics and if i ve already given your kid a bunch of shots today and they re already mad and upset a lot of families wouldn t do it the same day and then they d forget to come back a patchwork of requirements universal testing in some places a targeted approach in others also made it confusing for doctors according to gettens in 2016 dhhs rolled out a strategy to improve lead testing rates by educating providers about lead poisoning and promoting point of care testing a much more convenient option done right in the doctor s office over the course of the year 25 training sessions reached more than 300 pediatricians nurses and other staff in the state s highest risk areas dhhs also used federal money to buy 10 point of care testing machines for community health centers around the state and distributed educational materials that year about 2 100 more children were tested than the year before a jump of 15 percent and 2017 saw another rise meanwhile the issue was gaining steam in the state legislature in 2015 lawmakers created a commission to study lead poisoning and testing rates three years later they passed senate bill 247 which mandated universal testing for one and two year old children lowered the blood lead level that triggers intervention and created a loan fund to help pay for lead removal in homes that legislation was just a monumental step forward in moving the public health needle to get children tested and to do more to prevent lead exposure in the first place gettens says statewide test rates continued to rise after the universal testing requirement in 2019 about 73 percent of 1 year olds and 62 percent of 2 year olds were screened for blood lead levels the increase for 2 year olds is especially important gettens says even if a child s lead level isn t elevated as a one year old they should still be tested again at age two she says changes in their behavior like becoming more mobile mean they can become newly exposed to lead at that age that 2 year old test is critical she says and so the trajectory that we ve had for our two year olds is just something we should be really proud of testing rate variations testing rates continue to vary across the state however according to the most recent available data from dhhs while 80 percent of 1 year olds were tested in the monadnock region and greater nashua area in 2019 the rates were 66 percent in carroll county 64 percent in the north country and 44 percent in the central new hampshire public health region which covers eastern grafton county the 2 year old testing rates show similar disparities just 30 percent of children that age in central new hampshire were tested according to the dhhs data while point of care testing has been key to boosting uptake some families still face barriers to accessing health care in the first place shessler says that affects a child s likelihood of getting a blood lead test and other primary care whether i have a point of care test or whether i have the lab do it i can only test your lead if i can see you he says meanwhile external factors have hindered progress on screening kids for lead in the last two years testing for blood lead levels like so much other routine health care dropped during the covid 19 pandemic as practices closed and then even after they reopened concerns about the virus kept many families away according to preliminary dhhs data about 3 100 fewer granite state children were tested in 2020 compared to 2019 then this year the company that makes the widely used leadcare point of care testing machines issued a recall of many test kits due to a significant risk of falsely low results the issue remains unresolved three quarters of blood lead testing in new hampshire is done on leadcare equipment gettens says new hampshire has the recent experience and data to know if our only option is to back to a venous draw our testing rates will drop nh lead abatement programs sullivan county is home to one of four lead abatement grant programs in the state when it comes to removing lead paint hazards from new hampshire homes kate kirkwood who oversees sullivan county s lead abatement grant program says more money than ever is being spent we ve all got more money than we ve ever had before she says sullivan county the cities of manchester and nashua and the new hampshire housing finance authority currently have u s department of housing and urban development grants totaling more than 16 million the programs offer aid to landlords and homeowners to remove lead from their properties those grants can be paired with zero interest deferred loans from the state fund established by sb 247 in 2018 the federal grants and state loans are limited to homes with residents earning at or below 80 and 90 percent of area median income respectively sullivan county s program which has received 1 7 million from hud to remove lead from 60 homes over three years grew out of local efforts in claremont to deal with the city s lead problem the program has seen strong interest kirkwood says as of late september 10 units had been completed and 11 were in progress with 12 more in the application phase nhhfa is also seeing high demand for its program which covers all of new hampshire outside sullivan county and manchester and nashua says paul chalifour who manages the agency s lead and healthy homes program one reason for the demand relates to the changes implemented by sb 247 in 2018 not only are more children being tested but the bill also lowered the blood lead level at which children are considered poisoned from 10 micrograms per deciliter before the bill to 7 5 in 2019 and then 5 this past july when a child living in a rental unit has an elevated blood lead level and lead hazards are found in the home the landlord is ordered to abate the hazards before continuing to rent it we have a lot of applications rolling in chalifour says a lot more rental properties are being placed under orders of lead hazard reduction by dhhs and those owners are reaching out to us new hampshire housing aims to address lead in 226 homes in the current grant cycle prioritizing units where a child has had an elevated lead test that may seem like a drop in the bucket the agency estimated in 2017 that 250 000 units statewide contained lead hazards but money s not the only hurdle contractors are generally in short supply and lead abatement requires a specialized certification kirkwood says the sullivan county program has done okay between local contractors and contractors drawn in from massachusetts but that capacity needs to grow if the program is to expand she says we can get as much money as we can spend kirkwood says the limiting factor honestly is contractors we don t have enough contractors more than 60 percent of sullivan county s housing stock was built before the lead paint ban according to the county s hud grant application there s work here for me for the rest of my life and my kids and their kids kirkwood says this is not going away meanwhile the lenos and their attorney chris seufert say they expect a jury to hear their case sometime next year we don t want this happening to anybody else because we know what he had to go through heidi leno says of her son it s going

as we approach the end of the second year of our global covid 19 pandemic during this holiday season several television shows many filmed post lockdown have emerged around the theme of taking stock of our lives the pandemic has fundamentally altered some things in our social consciousness it exposed how quickly society as we know it can disappear and how even moving forward some aspects will never be quite the same while with vaccinations and masks we ve creaked back into a vague simulacrum of life as we knew it pre covid there remains fear and uncertainty and a now chronic and deep sense of vulnerability that we may never quite shake accordingly generation x often considered a forgotten generation sandwiched between the larger groups of the boomers and the millennials has officially entered older middle age with many of us mid 40s to mid 50s now we are not so old as to expect imminent functional limitations but not so young as to forget mortality around the corner and watching our aging parents many have children now in high school and college becoming independent gen z mouthpieces of their own and establishing a new cultural zeitgeist historical events largely simmered for our generation with ominous overtones but overall a strange detachment from frontline chaos the cold war imbued us with an overarching sense of existential dread but its relatively peaceful end left many of us solipsistic and confused the middle east became the next front for global catastrophes with the two persian gulf wars and 9 11 the one exception that burst our illusory sheltered reverie but still on a relatively smaller scale in terms of overall u s lives lost compared to ww2 or the vietnam war many of us instead grew up on a steady diet of virtual reality and technology numbed to the physical discomfort or labor communications slowly became instantaneous and individually masterminded we began typing and skyping away our lives to each other seeking stimulation within the boundaries of what was comfortable we kept tragedy at arms length as much as possible while a growing underclass suffered and took the brunt of society s need for convenience covid both ruptured and reinforced these assumptions the underclass was exploited more than ever sacrificed on the altar of instant gratification but we also knew so many were hanging in suspended animation in icus before ultimately dying that any vulnerability was mercilessly exploited by this virus that hundreds of thousands were gone even if these massive numbers remain coated with a certain media and societal numbness with an entrenched wing of straight up denial many of us know it s real these shows perhaps are attempting to hearken to the wistful innocence of simpler navel gazing of the joys of self gratification for its own sake the real world was the first reality tv show airing on the once revolutionary mtv channel now a vague corporatized shadow of its spirited artistic roots the real world homecoming aired in march of this year reuniting the original cast of the first season in nyc filmed in 1992 in their original loft during the height of the pandemic in fact one cast member ended up quarantined in a hotel after testing positive and had to participate virtually only this original cast was a groundbreaking combination of gen x archetypes the southern naif the grunge rocker the hip hop queen etc unlike subsequent generations of the show the participants genuinely had no clue what was happening in this experiment they were free from the gratuitous self promotion and preening of typical reality tv stars today the show becomes a heartwarming summary of where our generation is at today most of the cast with one notable exception is comfortable acknowledging how social mores and awareness have changed with regard to race sexuality gender and other important social justice issues raised today most are able to exhibit growth grace and dignity regarding tolerance and awareness of our need to value diversity and life experience in all its forms sadly in my view one cast member isn t able to shake the dark side of gen x our potential narcissism rebecca reverts to a defensive me first stance one that underscores a fundamental problem with many in our society who cannot shake that sense of ego and fragility in lieu of acknowledging systemic injustices and racial issues larger than any individual affronts at being called culpable another ongoing ensemble comedy show it s always sunny in philadelphia which recently started its 15th season has traditionally indulged in blinkered gen x comedy where edginess for its own sake was the modus operandi leading to some episodes having aged in a cringeworthy fashion at least they have always run from the baseline moral assumption that the characters are terrible people which helps ground some of their excesses trying to avoid the stodginess of other similar comedy comedians like south park or bill maher or even dave chappelle who claim their comedic freedom is being constrained by social justice awareness the newest episodes of sunny at best present a fresher attempt to incorporate that moral consciousness while still skewering with aplomb the pandemic is smoothly incorporated into their ongoing absurdist schemes sex and the city has also returned with a new series casting doubt on whether the essential premise of the original was ever liberating or just a new form of illusory solipsism as well the cast was always older gen x bridging to boomer so they present perhaps a greater generational gap to shift from in terms of their underlying ideas charlotte is jarringly dated when she tells miranda she needs to dye her hair for her return to grad school carrie is oddly prudish and uncomfortable discussing sexuality during a podcast miranda thoroughly embarrasses herself during her first class with racially iffy comments it remains to be seen how the characters cope with the modern world especially when mortality harshly intrudes into the picture overall gen x in these shows is trying to face the realities of where we stand in the current life cycle in the current state of historical upheaval we grew up during a sheltered 80s conservatism laced with simplistic narratives about progress and self creation bolstered by a concomitant technological boom that has not paused to breathe during our lifetimes until the pandemic in some ways it still has not paused as many workplaces abruptly now shift to all virtual platforms for better or worse in the meantime technology also permitted greater democratization of marginalized voices and greater exposure of systemic injustices like police brutality and sexual harassment while our national demographics also continue to shift in this global economy sadly the same technology has also permitted propaganda based manipulation of groups who also feel more disenfranchised and uncertain in this rapidly changing world and has led to dangerous political polarization and fears for our democracy our generation is now quietly approaching the helm of senior leadership in our society but with a very mixed set of values reflecting the various influences we grew up with some of us are inspired and open to listening to our progressive younger counterparts others of us are riding the coattails of toxic establishment demagogues at heart many of us were a lonely latchkey generation but optimistic and carefree in other ways with our quirky humor our creative music and our belief in a peaceful world perhaps that kindhearted laidback maturity is the best thing we can offer to the generations around us as we move forward in this brave new world

one of my financial planning clients was worried about inflation and how it might affect his investments i made the point that i thought it would trend down over 2022 and how we would not see inflation as big as what the us has been experiencing and today the afr runs with the headline why australia won t have a us style inflation spike that s nice reinforcing timing so i hope we re on the money intriguingly last friday the yanks got the worst inflation reading since 1982 6 8 for the year and 0 8 for the month of november and yields or interest rates fell on bonds and the us stock market rose if inflation was bad you d expect the opposite rates up and stocks down so what gives two things first that 0 8 was actually less than the doomsday merchants were predicting second there were signs that good indicators for future inflation were trending down for example the rise in the price of used cars which is only happening because new cars can t get microchips because of the pandemic has started to reduce at the core of the inflation problem is a supply chain problem because the coronavirus in its many forms has upset manufacturing transport and even raw materials which has added to costs a friend of mine who imports food from europe to sell in our major supermarkets and his own stores as well says even the wrapping paper of the products coming from overseas has gone up and has increased the overall cost of these imports the afr talked to ey s chief economist jo masters who is hosing down inflation here with our latest reading 3 compared to the us at 6 8 she thinks the big drivers of the change in our overall price level which inflation measures are likely to be temporary interestingly the us inflation spike was heavily driven by rent inflation which isn t an issue here the biggies for our inflation were 1 childcare 45 4 2 petrol 24 6 3 tobacco 9 8 4 motor vehicles costs 6 2 5 medical services 7 1 here rents were up only 0 4 while telco services were 1 3 cheaper tertiary education 1 6 cheaper and women s garments off a big 10 4 the latter probably reflects the fact more women are buying stuff online thanks to that damn virus and the lockdowns it brought by the way those staggered by the spike in childcare costs recall it went from being virtually free because of the lockdown challenges so that s a dodgy number in our inflation story which will therefore only be temporary i also believe that because we came out of lockdowns later than the us because our vaccination rates were slower to improve because of supply problems our demand for stuff has been slower to build up compared to the americans so their rising demand out of lockdowns was met by a bigger supply chain problem than we re going to experience which means our price spike should be less dramatic for example that observation that used car prices are now rising slower could mean new car supplies are rising as the microchip problem which was terrible in 2020 and for a lot of 2021 might now be better that said there are those who say the microchip shortage goes out to 2023 but of course there are always doomsday forecasters out there i m betting by mid year we ll see an improvement in the supply of microchips and new cars if i m wrong my forecast that inflation should dissipate by mid 2022 might have to be reworked however jo masters who used to be a regular guest on my old sky business tv show and who has contributed to this website over the years agrees with me even when it comes to how higher wages could push inflation up the labour market has tightened but wage growth is only just back to pre pandemic levels and at 2 2 per cent annually is consistent with low inflation faster wage growth is expected to slowly feed through and lift underlying inflation to the top half of the rba s target band over the latter half of 2022 and early 2023 but again this needs to be seen in context of higher but not worryingly high inflation go jo

washington president joe biden s pick to lead the food and drug administration drew praise from a top senate republican as well as critical questions from conservatives and others during a tuesday confirmation hearing dr robert califf fielded queries on his ties to the pharmaceutical industry the pandemic loosened rules around abortion drugs and frustrations involving covid 19 rapid tests califf 70 is familiar with the role he s been tapped for he ran the fda during the last year of the obama administration a cardiologist by training califf also served as the agency s deputy commissioner for medical products and tobacco before those stints with the fda he was a professor of medicine at duke university in north carolina where califf ran the duke translational medicine institute and the duke clinical research institute more recently he has served as an adviser to san francisco based verily life sciences and google health i m not sure you could write a resume of somebody more qualified to be considered for commissioner of the fda than rob califf said sen richard burr r n c the ranking member of the senate health education labor and pensions committee burr said that he will be urging his gop colleagues to back the biden nominee if confirmed by the evenly divided senate califf would become the first permanent head of the fda under the biden administration nearly one year after the president took office he would helm an agency that has faced mounting criticism for decisions throughout the pandemic with rebuilding public trust likely to be a key task criticism over pharma ties during tuesday s hearing califf s work with major pharmaceutical companies drew sharp words from sen bernie sanders i vt who fumed that nine out of the last 10 fda commissioners have gone on to work for the pharmaceutical industry unfortunately dr califf you are not the exception to that rule sanders said noting the nominee s consulting work and tallying up to 8 million in pharmaceutical stocks on his financial disclosure form how can the american people feel comfortable you re going to stand up to this powerful special interest califf responded by pointing to the biden administration s ethics pledge saying he s agreed to abide by strict ethics guidelines and will be held accountable if he falls short he also stated that he is on record with his support of allowing medicare to negotiate with drug manufacturers in an effort to reduce soaring prescription costs sanders isn t the only senator to have viewed califf s pharma ties skeptically sen joe manchin iii a west virginia democrat has said he will oppose califf s nomination manchin also opposed califf in 2016 because the senator believes correcting the culture at the fda is critical to changing the tide of the opioid epidemic according to the west virginia attorney general s office the state has one of the highest rates in the country of non medical use of prescription pain relievers among 19 to 25 year olds eased access to medication abortion several republican senators including sen roger marshall of kansas attempted to nail down califf on whether he supports continuing or undoing the easing of restrictions that allowed for mail order medication abortion during the covid 19 pandemic a lawsuit last year prompted the fda to suspend during the public health emergency a requirement that mifepristone must be dispensed in person marshall referred to the suspension as a casual attitude by the agency to making mifepristone available a review of the regulations surrounding those abortion drugs is currently underway and califf noted that he s not yet a part of any discussions i think the fda has to make this decision based on the latest data in the scientific principles he said adding that he trusts the agency staff to make good decisions sen patty murray d wash who is the panel s top democrat returned to the issue at the end of the hearing telling califf that she expects any decision on access to medication abortion to be governed by data not by politics rapid test availability much of the agency s work will remain focused for some time on snuffing out future variants of covid 19 and ensuring access to the vaccines and tests necessary for the nation to fully return to normal califf acknowledged the difficulties surrounding the lack of access to testing which the biden administration has proposed to ease through insurance reimbursement and free tests for those lacking insurance he offered few specific policy steps but described rapid testing as a personal issue for him his son sam had been feeling a little off ahead of traveling to d c but was able to get a rapid test at a pharmacy it was negative and then we all felt okay about sam getting on the plane califf said and so i think we really have got to redouble our efforts now with omicron califf also emphasized that more testing allows for catching infections earlier which can increase the effectiveness of newer antiviral treatments like a covid 19 pill touted by pfizer earlier on tuesday as highly protective against severe disease there s a saying in god we trust all others must bring data califf quipped adding that he looks forward to reading the agency s evaluation of the new antiviral pill

president biden s nominee for fda commissioner robert califf md fielded pointed questions about a variety of controversial topics during a hearing of the senate committee on health education labor and pensions on tuesday questions ranged from the agency s approval of oxycontin to risk mitigation protocols for mifepristone mifeprex as well as his close ties to the pharmaceutical industry in his opening statement califf said that his top priority should he be confirmed is to focus on emergency preparedness and response learning from what the pandemic has taught the country so far and applying those lessons other priorities include ensuring the safety of the food and drug supply curbing the opioid epidemic developing a systematic approach to evidence generation protecting children from tobacco products and attracting and retaining the agency s scientific workforce califf is the head of clinical and policy strategy for verily life sciences and was a professor of cardiology at the duke university school of medicine he was previously fda commissioner from february 2016 to january 2017 confirmed by the senate in a vote of 89 4 the committee s leaders on both sides of the aisle praised his experience and fitness for the role sen patty murray d wash noted that families trust the fda to ensure the foods they eat are safe and that the prescriptions they receive help rather than harm them the agency needs a strong hand to address public health emergencies like the covid 19 pandemic and the opioid crisis she said families also deserve to know they have an experienced leader at the fda who understands the many challenges our nation is facing and the importance of ensuring science comes first murray added when he last led the agency in 2016 2017 califf was confirmed with strong bipartisan support she noted ranking member richard burr r n c hailed califf as a wonderful father grandfather great doctor and great man i m not sure you could write a resume of somebody more qualified to be considered for commissioner of the fda than rob califf while underscoring the historic progress the agency has made over the last 2 years swiftly and safely authorizing three covid vaccines and more than 420 covid tests burr also stressed that the next commissioner cannot take their foot off the gas fda s role in the opioid crisis in response to questions from murray califf outlined the steps he plans to take to help address the opioid epidemic such as expanding efforts around prescriber education crack down on people who use opioids inappropriately or those who prescribe them inappropriately and strengthening efforts to develop alternative medications and behavioral health therapies for pain but sen maggie hassan d n h was more interested in what she viewed as a troubling lack of any acknowledgement by fda officials about their own role in exacerbating the opioid epidemic through mistakes in regulating oxycontin given that many people with substance use disorders first became addicted to opioids through legal prescriptions for oxycontin hassan asked whether the fda s initial approval of the drug and its 2001 decision to expand its indication to include the treatment of chronic pain were mistakes califf said that in hindsight approving a drug without any long term studies or assessment of its addictive potential is something that could have been done differently with regard to expanding the drug s indication to include long term use for chronic pain califf again said that long term studies should have been required before permitting use of the drug for long periods why didn t you take action to change the oxycontin label when you led the fda in 2016 hassan asked he did take certain measures califf said including supporting the long term studies that were needed to collect evidence about long term use and contracting with the national academy of medicine to overhaul the protocol for opioid evaluation usually the risk benefit calculus focuses solely on the individual to whom a drug is prescribed but opioids impact many other people in society califf noted arguing that the change to the evaluation process was successfully done however hassan pointed out that califf in his opening remarks mentioned a family member who had been given a 30 day prescription for opioids after a minor surgery and asked if there s a reason the fda should not be aggressively pursuing relabeling as more evidence is collected we are going to need to aggressively look at relabeling califf replied hassan citing the hundreds of thousands of deaths from overdoses strongly disagreed there is plenty of evidence about what we need to do about this epidemic and the fda needs to take the lead later in the hearing califf acknowledged that he had certainly made a number of mistakes adding that coordination among agencies is more human and complicated than you would think on the outside mifepristone restrictions the risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems for the abortion drug mifepristone was another flashpoint at the hearing with republican senators arguing that the rems protocol should not be relaxed sen mike braun r ind said the fda weakened the rems for mifepristone under califf s watch in 2016 and asked whether that relaxed kind of interpretation of the procedure was something he planned to pursue in april the fda unveiled a policy of enforcement discretion around the in person dispensing of mifepristone which enabled patients to receive the medication by mail in may the fda announced a review of the restrictions around the drug califf who cited a court document regarding a review of the data on mifepristone said a re evaluation of the rems for the drug is imminent while he will not be involved in the process califf said he knows the team responsible for the review and is confident that those individuals will be looking at the latest data and applying the best science and make the best possible decision braun ended his questioning by asking permission to submit testimony for the record from an individual who experienced complications resulting from a chemical abortion drug murray accepted the submission and also included her own submission to the record of a recent study on the safety of mifepristone from the new england journal of medicine ties to big pharma sen bernie sanders i vt raised concerns over the revolving door between the fda and pharmaceutical industry he flagged one person in particular curtis wright who served as a high ranking official after leaving the agency in the mid 1990s he received a 400 000 compensation package from purdue pharma less than a year after approved oxycontin with a label that said it was quote very rare end quote for patients to become addicted to that opioid since leaving the fda califf has made several hundred thousand dollars from pharmaceutical companies sanders noted and according to his own financial disclosure statements currently owns up to 8 million in stock of major pharmaceutical companies given these close industry ties sanders asked what reassurance califf could offer americans that he will be an independent and strong voice for the agency i am a physician first and foremost califf said citing his work in intensive care units in the early part of his career but sanders persisted calling out califf s work as a consultant in the pharmaceutical industry how can the american people feel comfortable you re going to stand up to this powerful special interest he asked califf urged sanders to look at his track record adding that the biden administration s ethics pledge is the most stringent ethics pledge in the history of administrations shifting gears sanders asked califf whether he believed medicare should be allowed to negotiate prescription drug prices i m on record of being in favor of medicare negotiating with the industry on prices califf responded shannon firth has been reporting on health

a year of transition or the great rebalancing but 2022 is probably better described as the year when central banks around the world particularly the fed had better get the balance right otherwise there will be significant economic costs to bear in the years that follow the inflation hawks who have largely been an outspoken minority for the past six years have been consistently harking back to the 1970s and warning that if central banks don t take immediate action the world could be headed back to this tough era of stagflation as the year draws to a close however the prospect of stagflation is largely absent from most major bank outlooks for 2022 but it does still hang around in the background as a potential worst case scenario if the central banks make a misstep in withdrawing monetary policy stimulus too quickly central banks are in the unenviable position of not knowing when inflation is likely to peak when supply problems will begin to subside or how disruptive omicron will prove to be that uncertainty is also taking root in consumer sentiment with the misery index created during the 1970s stagflation period to capture how respondents felt about inflation and employment levels now sitting at recession levels according to oxford economics the index created by economist arthur okun reached 19 9 in mid 1975 when inflation was 11 8 and unemployment 8 1 and went on to peak at 21 9 in early 1980 just three years later depeche mode s song get the balance right hit the charts and could well have been a rallying cry for 2022 with the lyrics when you think you ve got it all you haven t got a hold at all hopefully not a harbinger of things to come almost five decades later the misery reached a peak of 15 when the pandemic hit and now sits above 10 with concerns about inflation deepening after consumer price inflation reached a 39 year high oxford economics says inflation has become the number one problem in the minds of households and this extends to the fact that worker earnings although rising in a tightening market are not keeping up with inflation inflation adjusted wages fell again last month and are no higher now than they were in march 2020 despite a tumbling unemployment rate the economic consultancy adds that the fed now considers inflation as its number one problem over employment and that there is some concern that it may overreact and stifle growth it notes that this is evident in the bond market where the yield curve has flattened markedly in the past few weeks indicating that investors expect short term rates to catch up with long term rates when the fed starts hiking rates views on when the fed will begin hiking have been pulled forward to earlier next year perhaps at its march meeting however opinions are divided on how far the fed is likely to go with some expecting the official rate to rise to 1 75 and vanguard seeing it ending at a higher 2 5 to keep wage pressures under control and to keep inflation expectations stable there s also debate on whether there could be two or three hikes or whether the latter would be a step too far abn amro s macro research team also contemplate how 2022 will differ from the last rate hiking cycles in 2016 and 2019 pointing out that often the financial markets will do some of the work by pricing in potential rate hikes ahead of when they happen thus central banks need to be cautious in moving too quickly and risk overdoing it when it takes some time to see the full financial market impact of the latest rate hike the team explains that as the fed begins to raise interest rates financial markets tend to move preemptively to price in the tightening cycle with the result that bond yields rise possibly eroding investor sentiment financial conditions are a key transmission channel for monetary policy equity market moves have wealth effects and consumer confidence in the us is often heavily impacted by market moves while mortgage rates tend to track long term bond yields as such the fed is mindful of the reactions in markets globally as well as domestically as these moves can do much of the tightening work for it this was evident in the 2016 and 2019 rising rate cycles when the fed paused after the s p 500 fell 13 and 20 respectively in response to its rate hikes this time however circumstances are very different back then central banks were faced with inflation running below their targets while inflation rates are now multiple times targeted inflation according to the imf the expected average inflation rates in advanced economies for 2021 range from 7 in estonia to under 1 in switzerland and japan the us inflation rate is expected to average 5 in emerging markets rates are even higher with brazil at an 18 year high of 10 74 in november and expected to reach 12 by the end of the year and turkey s at 21 3 abn amro contends that although the fed is still likely to take into account the market s pre emptive moves and how these will help the central bank achieve its objectives in 2022 it would have to weigh this against likely risks of inflation rising further in that scenario the fed might well conclude that inflation is a bigger concern for the outlook than a major correction in equity markets this suggests the hit to global growth could be larger than in previous fed tightening cycles robeco strategist in the global macro team peter van der welle provides a useful distinction between good bad and ugly inflation saying the nature of inflation matters good inflation he notes is the non accelerating type that coincides with an economy that is operating in equilibrium bad inflation is what we are currently experiencing due to supply constraints and ugly inflation the type we are most worried about threatens because of the strength of the us labour market and the potential for this to turn into a wage price spiral in a recent s p global ratings assessment of the risks in the us labour market chief us economist beth ann bovino noted that the us economy is set to start 2022 on uneven ground because the labour market is recovering slower than expected the issue is that companies are having to increase wages to attract employees or persuade existing employees to stay in what she describes as a revolution of workers voluntarily leaving their jobs largely in search of better pay child care and working conditions this is evident in the 4 2 million americans who left their jobs in october which was a record according to bls data and recent jobs data has come in at less than half of the numbers expected if this continues says bovino it will take until the fourth quarter of 2025 for the us economy to regain the jobs lost during the pandemic even if employees are wooed by the better wages on offer they don t feel the benefit because their earnings are being eroded by higher inflation bovino says average hourly earnings increased by an astonishing 4 8 year on year in october from 0 3 the previous month but

getting your trinity audio player ready solar panels on the roof of a palo alto home on may 12 2021 photo by magali gauthier five years after palo alto adopted an ambitious goal of cutting carbon emissions by 80 by 2030 the city continues to lag well behind its target and is looking for new ways to accelerate its green efforts one place that palo alto is increasingly looking to for inspiration is ithaca a city in new york that is known for being both home to cornell university and for recently launching a program to decarbonize all 6 000 of its buildings the east coast city passed earlier this year a law banning new buildings from installing natural gas appliances in early november it followed suit with an even more ambitious proposal that would decarbonize all existing buildings by 2030 and help the city meet its goal of carbon neutrality palo alto meanwhile is proceeding at a far more methodical pace the city s new sustainability and climate action plan which the city council unanimously endorsed on monday lays out a three year strategy in which the first year or two are focused primarily on education community outreach and voluntary action the council adopted this approach in the face of projections showing that the city continues to fall well short of its 80 30 goal according to the city s sustainability manager christine luong the city is currently on a path to reduce its emission by 47 4 by 2030 with 1990 as the baseline year even if palo alto enhances telecommuting and greatly expands adoption of electric vehicles that would only bring the city to 52 2 reductions still well shy of the 80 target in order to scale up our emission reductions to achieve 80 30 we will need to consider much higher levels of intervention and the resources required to achieve those levels luong told the council monday during its discussion of the sustainability plan to determine the city s path forward a council ad hoc committee made up of vice mayor pat burt and council member alison cormack have been holding regular meetings and workshops over the past year on topics such as sustainable transportation and building electrification burt said these meetings have generated new ideas for the city to explore as it seeks to accelerate its electrification efforts burt lauded the ithaca approach which relies in part on funding from the financial markets and philanthropic organizations to fund its electrification plan the consortium in ithaca is led by the firm blocpower which aims to assess each of the city s roughly 6 000 buildings to determine ways to improve energy efficiency according to a report from ithaca s director of sustainability luis aguirre torres the effort will roll out in two stages with a special emphasis on low and middle income communities the main objective of the program is to gradually improve the overall energy performance of the city s building stock by assessing each individual building and determining potential energy efficiency improvements through energy retrofitting and the substitution of non electric thermal loads and air conditioning systems with air source and ground source heat pumps and the installation of efficient lighting photovoltaic and solar thermal systems onsite storage smart thermostats and smart meters the report states burt suggested that as palo alto continues to explore its own plan its conversation will similarly consider new funding methods and fresh approaches to permitting a historic source of frustration for palo alto homeowners and contractors doing business in the city both subjects will be discussed in upcoming meetings of the sustainability climate action plan ad hoc committee which has regularly attracted crowds of engaged residents burt said the city s 80 30 goal seen as aspirational at the time of its adoption in 2016 is now broadly viewed as essential for meeting the goals of the paris climate accord the proportionate share of responsibility has been elevated but as we ve all seen the pace of climate change the overwhelming indications are that it s accelerating that s the consensus of the international community burt said the committee is paying particularly close attention to the ithaca model burt noted that members and community advocates had a zoom meeting with aguirre torres to discuss the city s program the core of this plan is really about innovative financial models combining public and private and philanthropic resources in a really clever way and utilizing a new for profit firm as a backbone of implementation to channel those resources burt said we re in that engagement another supporter of the ithaca model is former mayor larry klein who urged the council on monday to take a similar approach to tackling climate change he urged the council to act boldly and to send city officials to ithaca to learn more about the program klein who had enjoyed two two term stints on the council also said that the city needs to reform its permitting process to encourage residents to convert to electric appliances i regret to point out that almost every city administration in my experience has said our permitting process is a problem none of them have succeeded i think we need to take dramatic action to make our permitting process move in an efficient swift manner klein said other residents urged the council to do more to educate residents about the city s 80 30 goal and what it will take for palo alto to get there susan chamberlain member of the advocacy group 350 silicon valley told the council that most people in the city have no clue what electrification is and why they should switch to electric in their homes i think it s incumbent on the utilities department to use their authority to inform them about what s coming chamberlain said the council also heard from numerous students from palo alto high gunn high and castilleja all of them had the same message the city needs to move faster amanda cheng a senior at castilleja and co leader of the school s green team said she is now waiting to hear back from colleges about her admission what should normally be an exciting period however is overshadowed by her anxieties about climate change she said at the rate we re currently taking action on climate change i simply cannot see a happy and hopeful future for me cheng said so i approach this milestone with intense hopelessness and anxiety about the state of our future and i m sure so many people my age feel the same way council members assured residents that the city will retain climate change as a high priority in the coming year this will entail difficult conversations about the city s gas utility which may be gradually phased out of existence mayor tom dubois said the city needs to explore the questions what is the path to shutting down the gas utility how do we accelerate that council member eric filseth agreed and suggested that to move the needle on the city s emissions it needs to focus on cars and natural gas in buildings the big emission sources are natural gas and transportation filseth said in order to hit 80 30 we basically have to turn off the gas and get rid of most non ev cars by 2030 cormack said the committee is hoping to accelerate action on climate change in part by diving deep into proposals for electrification and identifying the time and money it would take to turn these ideas into reality we re in the messy middle here cormack said i know it s frustrating i can feel it but i firmly believe this is going to continue to be a council priority next year i d be stunned if it s not related

accelerate its taper plans and will release projections for rates unemployment and inflation in its summary of economic projections federal reserve board chair jerome powell in recent testimony to congress said inflation should no longer be termed transitory and that the panel would look at speeding up its reduction of asset purchases at this meeting it is striking how quickly this reversal took place said peter cramer senior managing director insurance asset management at slc management after all it wasn t that long ago that the biggest question relative to inflation was why it remained so low and how the twin forces of technology and demographics were creating an insurmountable wall of deflation indeed inflation continues to be an issue that many believe the fed needs to get serious about the producer price index released tuesday showed prices soared 0 8 in november resulting in a 12 month gain of 9 6 the highest since the annual figures were collected beginning in november 2010 today s ppi release validates our view that run rate inflation currently exceeds 10 said jay hatfield founder and chief executive at infrastructure capital advisors the fomc is considering accelerating the pace of its taper and these numbers should give them further impetus while the fed s policy statement seps and chair powell s remarks at the press conference are expected to convey a hawkish tone monetary policy is far behind the curve and we expect the fed will need to eventually raise rates more than is currently priced into markets said berenberg capital markets chief economist for the u s americas and asia mickey levy who is a member of the shadow open market committee the market is pricing in five rate hikes through 2023 but gene tannuzzo global head of fixed income at columbia threadneedle investments said the fed will ultimately hike faster and higher in 2023 and 2024 this is the first hiking cycle in almost three decades in which the fed is chasing inflation higher when hiking in previous cycles recently the fed has been able to raise rates preemptively to prevent the possibility of inflation he said this is different and inflation pressures are here now if the curve continues to flatten we expect the fed may instead choose to sell assets of its balance sheet rather than continue hiking rates at the front end of the curve and the fed is under fire because it until recently termed inflation transitory it s now common knowledge that the fed is way behind the curve on inflation and a number of former fomc participants have been vocal about how high rates might go said jason brady president and ceo at thornburg investment management the reality of higher inflation and its longer persistence has hit markets hard with companies having trouble hiring employment and salaries should continue to grow next year said scott colbert executive vice president and chief economist at commerce trust co offsetting waning government stimulus and a more hawkish federal reserve that likely starts to raise interest rates over the second half of 2022 but the yield curve could be the most dynamic dashboard for the market according to dec mullarkey managing director investment strategic research initiatives at slc management over the last several months the picture has shifted dramatically back in september the aggregate investor wisdom was that the fed would wait until late next year to start hiking rates now conviction is growing it may need to get cracking before the summer the curve suggests quicker action would likely cool the economy sooner and help to avoid overheating he said the 30 year rate which provides a seasoned view on growth and inflation has dipped for now the yield curve seems content that the fed will deliver a soft

with the escalation of great power competition much attention has been given to the rise of traditional security or state based concerns the challenges in this sphere still largely reside in the what if space as in what if china were to do x or what does us china competition mean for country y these are clearly important questions to ask yet when discussing non traditional security or issues that go beyond purely state based conceptions of security stakeholders are dealing with challenges that are not a question of what if but mostly when in the indo pacific region cyclones and other natural disasters are a seasonal reality that climate change will only make more frequent and severe as the monsoon season strikes the bay of bengal causing displacement and fatalities it is an important time to reflect on what is working well in the region in terms of addressing non traditional security challenges from environmental change but also on what ongoing issues remain in the region bangladesh is a country that is especially prone to severe natural disasters including infamous cyclones that have required an international military response yet the country has devoted much attention to improving its disaster resilience by establishing coastal crisis management centres ccmcs and hundreds of cyclone shelters bangladesh s partnership with the united states us in establishing this capability was an important force multiplier in addition to improving its own resilience bangladesh has increased its disaster response capability and become a provider of relief to smaller south asian countries in 2016 for example the bangladesh navy delivered relief to sri lanka after widespread flooding and landslides bangladesh also delivered relief to the maldives during its 2014 water crisis disaster relief operations sometimes natural disasters are so severe that they require the provision of disaster relief by international military forces there are usually a clear set of steps and conditions under which leaders will permit foreign armed forces to operate in their country even under such circumstances after receiving a formal request from the host nation the foreign armed forces are expected to quickly get in and then leave just as quickly after achieving their relief mission s both india and the us have conducted successful disaster relief operations in the bay of bengal such as after the 1991 super cyclone and the 2004 boxing day tsunami yet some host nations have displayed discomfort with such offers of relief two cases in the bay of bengal demonstrate that when disaster relief is offered it is not necessarily accepted after cyclone sidr struck bangladesh in 2007 india s disaster relief appears to have been restricted to the port of chittagong and the international airport in dhaka india s minister of external affairs at the time pranab mukherjee told journalists that his country offered to deploy helicopters to conduct rescue operations in affected areas but bangladesh had declined while bangladesh was willing to accept relief in the naval domain and via fixed wing aircraft relief from india via rotary wing aircraft helicopters in remote areas was not accepted another example involves relief efforts after cyclone nargis struck myanmar in 2008 the military junta did not permit the provision of naval relief by the us even though the uss essex expeditionary strike group sat in waters near myanmar for nearly 22 days yet during this same period the leadership in myanmar trusted india and thailand to dispatch their medical teams to help affected citizens while us air force relief was permitted us naval relief was not demonstrating that how relief is offered is an important consideration by a host nation immediate and long term impacts these examples highlight the imperative of understanding host nation sensitivities in the aftermath of natural disasters yet natural disasters are only one non traditional security threat to the environment beyond the role that carbon emissions play in climate change stakeholders should pay greater attention to preventing other anthropogenic crises in the bay of bengal that have both immediate and long term impacts at the western edge of the indian ocean mauritius declared a state of environmental emergency in july 2020 after a ship ran aground and spilled oil not long afterward the bay of bengal experienced a similar disaster in september 2020 an oil tanker mv new diamond caught fire off the east coast of sri lanka and leaked diesel fuel over an area of 25 miles even worse in may 2021 a container ship mv express pearl caught fire and subsequently sank emptying its contents into the sea and ashore at present 400 pieces of debris are estimated to sit on the seabed off sri lanka s western coast also in 2021 debris from a chinese rocket fell into the indian ocean near maldives the environmental impacts of such human induced incidents are difficult to fully comprehend at this point beyond the environmental effects sri lanka and maldives depend economically on tourism which provides a much needed source of foreign exchange reserves fish stocks are similarly vital for the livelihoods of local populations the prevalence and importance of non traditional security challenges in the bay of bengal are already well understood and much progress has been made in building resilience still in the case of providing disaster relief major powers such as the us and india will need to continue being aware of the potential sensitivities of host nations in the aftermath of natural disasters furthermore immediate human factors such as shipping accidents pose significant but overlooked threats to environmental security being proactive in mitigating the potential for human miscalculation combined with increased disaster resilience will help ameliorate the existing non traditional security risks in the bay of bengal in the coming years nilanthi samaranayake is director of the strategy and policy analysis programme at the cna a non profit research organisation in washington dc usa she studies non traditional security issues including disaster relief and resilience

communicating with retail investors is a task mr aron is uniquely suited for his sprawling 40 year corporate résumé is littered with catchy marketing and loyalty programs that resonated with retail customers at airlines hotels cruise lines and ski resorts he helped created the worldpass a pioneering frequent flyer program at pan american airlines in the 1980s a few years later he launched one of the earliest hotel loyalty programs for hyatt at vail resorts business surged under his decade of leadership that ended in 2006 thanks in part to the unveiling of a popular subscription plan for skiing back in april when the company s meme stock status was still fresh mr aron and his team made a conscious decision to lean in to social media and embrace these new investors mr aron said that required an active twitter presence that transcended the traditional corporate speak he has embraced the new role with gusto amassing a colossal social media following by directly engaging with the self styled reddit apes and speaking their language which mr aron says humanises the connection between the investor and company they own he recently attracted the attention of elon musk mark cuban and millions more on twitter by polling followers about accepting cryptocurrencies such as dogecoin and shiba inu as payment i write all these tweets myself mr aron told insider that doesn t mean i don t send them around to be looked at or edited by others but this is not being done by a pr staff or social media staff advertisement amc also rolled out amc investor connect a program to communicate directly with shareholders and offer them perks such as free popcorn and exclusive screenings more than 425 000 people have signed up so far mr aron said the company been rewarded with a highly engaged group of shareholders who have held on to the stock and kept its share price uplifted far longer than wall street s establishment expected there is a tremendous amount of inbound commentary to the company from our shareholder base which is illuminating because it really helps us to understand what the owners of our company are thinking mr aron said aron uses social media as a sounding board for new ideas mr aron doesn t just read messages from investors he takes highly visible public action to demonstrate he s taking them seriously often gathering valuable intelligence in the process for instance mr aron was inundated with direct messages suggesting that amc accept cryptocurrency dogecoin but he wondered just how popular this idea was in actuality advertisement so he market tested the concept with a twitter poll at essentially no cost and had a resounding answer within 24 hours the poll garnered 140 000 votes 77 per cent in favour and more than 4 million views mr aron reported and amc is in the process of adding dogecoin to the list of cryptocurrencies it accepts as payment amc quarterly earnings calls which used to cater to wall street research analysts now revolve around retail investors and their ideas for the company which involve questions about crypto nfts amc merch esports and more playing with fire one of his most impressive achievements in investor relations and a testament to the currency he s earned with this new investor base has been his navigation of the thorny issue of amc executives himself included cashing in large portions of their shares among the meme stock crowd holding or increasing your shares is a virtue commonly referred to as diamond hands while selling your stake is a grievous faux pas and something mockingly referred to as having paper hands advertisement some analysts expected executives offloading their shares would infuriate the main street investors causing the stock to fall mr aron elected to get ahead of the issue this summer with transparency repeatedly alerting investors that he would sell a portion of his holdings over the coming months for estate planning purposes while vowing to remain heavily invested in the firm amc execs sold us55 million 77 million of shares last month us25 million by mr aron according to sec filings reviewed by insider via sentieo more will be sold in the coming months as part of a prearranged plan handled by his bank mr aron has said i can only imagine that naysayers and others who wish amc harm will try to spread fear uncertainty and doubt in this regard mr aron said on the company s november earnings call amc s stock remained stable through it all advertisement they came out unscathed said alicia reese a wedbush analyst who covers amc indeed the silverback as mr aron is admiringly called by many retail traders is as popular as ever at a special screening he hosted early this month for new movie being the ricardos stars javier bardem and nicole kidman made surprise appearances but mr aron was a star himself shaking hands signing autographs and taking selfies with the audience this story first appeared in business insider read it here

news analysis on dec 9 taiwan announced that a researcher working in a biosafety level 3 bsl 3 laboratory in taipei tested positive for the delta variant of covid 19 while experimenting on the virus in the lab chen shih chung the head of taiwan s central epidemic command center cecc confirmed that the female researcher had tested positive for covid 19 after being exposed to the pathogen during research that was conducted in mid november at the academia sinica s genomics research center in taipei notably taiwan hasn t experienced any recent cases of covid 19 a fact noted by chen who said we believe the possibility of infection from the workplace is higher because we have zero confirmed infections in the community it was later reported that the researcher had been bitten by a mouse during two separate incidents taipei deputy mayor huang shan shan who described the woman as a research assistant said she had been bitten by a laboratory mouse carrying the gamma strain of the virus on oct 15 but subsequently tested negative for infection taiwan minister of health and welfare chen shih chung arrives at a press conference at the headquarters of the centers for disease control in taipei on march 11 2020 sam yeh afp via getty images however a little more than a month later on nov 19 she was again bitten by a mouse in the lab this time for reasons that remain unknown the researcher didn t undergo testing after the second bite until well after she had developed physical symptoms according to taiwan news the woman developed a cough in late november which intensified during the first week of december but she didn t seek out testing until dec 8 james liao the president of academia sinica cited six separate failures that contributed to the infection incident these included the failure to duly report a scientist being bitten by lab mice not working with lab mice in a biosafety cabinet not following protocols in removing hazmat suits new personnel not receiving adequate training lack of supervision and monitoring during experiments and lax management in lab practices academia sinica s genomics research center in taipei taiwan on feb 6 2018 lysimachi cc by sa 4 0

taiwan s lab leak of covid 19 took place at a bsl 3 lab which mandates the use of personal protective equipment biosafety cabinet s sustained directional airflow without recirculation as well as self closing and interlocked doors by contrast the gain of function experiments being conducted on coronaviruses at the wuhan institute of virology were done at much less secure bsl 2 labs as context rutgers university biologist richard ebright has stated bsl 2 is the biosafety level of a us dentist s office i e lockable door screened windows sterilizer gown and gloves ebright told the financial times if work was happening it should definitely not have been happening at bsl 2 that is roughly equivalent to a standard dentist office the use of bsl 2 labs for gain of function experiments by the wuhan institute of virology has been heavily criticized by many scientists michael lin a bioengineer at stanford university told mit technology review that allowing work on potentially dangerous bat viruses at bsl 2 is an actual scandal and a prominent and early supporter of the natural origins narrative columbia university virologist ian lipkin changed his mind about the virus s origin after the wuhan institute admitted it conducted its coronavirus experiments at a bsl 2 lab it shouldn t have happened lipkin stated people should not be looking at bat viruses in bsl 2 labs taiwan leak response in stark contrast to ccp s wuhan response additionally the open and immediate manner in which the taiwanese government handled its lab leak incident contrasts sharply with china s handling of the covid 19 pandemic chinese communist party ccp officials refused to acknowledge the outbreak until taiwan lipkin said that he now considers a lab leak to be a viable theory saying that his view has changed additionally the open and immediate manner in which the taiwanese government handled its lab leak incident contrasts sharply with china s handling of the covid 19 pandemic chinese communist party ccp officials refused to acknowledge the outbreak until taiwan notified international authorities on dec 31 2019 but despite the ccp s refusal to acknowledge an outbreak there were earlier warnings from those stationed in wuhan a man wears a mask while walking in the street in wuhan china on jan 22 2020 getty images notably at the same time the outbreak in wuhan appeared to be reaching a critical juncture the wuhan center for disease control which was conducting coronavirus research alongside the wuhan institute of virology suddenly moved its lab s location on dec 2 2019 to a spot just a few hundred yards from the huanan seafood market which would initially be cited as the origin of the early covid 19 cases the cdc s new location for its lab was also directly adjacent to another hotspot of later covid 19 cases the union hospital where a group of doctors first became infected the genomic sequence of covid 19 was discovered no later than dec 27 2019 while chinese and western scientists obtained copies at that time under pressure from the ccp neither chinese nor western scientists shared the information publicly when a chinese scientist from shanghai finally released the sequence on jan 11 2020 the ccp shut down his lab the ccp s coverup and the capitulation by scientists allowed the virus to continue to spread at a critical time it also gave the ccp additional time to obfuscate the virus s origins and create a natural origin narrative centered around the huanan seafood market additionally although the world health organization s who initial report on the origins of the outbreak stated that a lab leak was extremely unlikely the lead investigator of that report peter ben embarek told a danish documentary team that the lab leak theory was probable and suggested that a chinese researcher could have been infected by a bat while taking samples in connection with research at a wuhan lab a sign at world health organization headquarters in geneva on april 24 2020 fabrice coffrini afp via getty images embarek also acknowledged that a deal had been struck between the who s investigative team and their chinese counterparts the lab leak theory could be mentioned in the who s final report but only on the condition the report didn t recommend any specific studies to further that hypothesis china s censorship has taken many forms recently peter daszak the president of ecohealth the body through which dr anthony fauci funded the wuhan institute of virology told the national institutes of health nih that he was unable to hand over requested genetic sequence data from his gain of function experiments to the nih because the data was going through an approval process by ccp authorities who team member peter daszak leaves his hotel after the world health organization team wrapped up its investigation into the origins of the covid 19 coronavirus in wuhan in china s hubei province on feb 10 2021 hector retamal afp via getty images this arrangement with the ccp is a breach of the terms and conditions of daszak s nih grant which specifically required that all genetic sequence data be made publicly available ccp oversight and control weren t part of daszak s agreement lab leaks common the incident in taiwan has renewed the debate over the origin of the pandemic the fact that genetic sequence data that may relate directly to the origin of the pandemic remains under the control of the ccp also raises questions about the claims of both daszak and nih that their wuhan experiments couldn t have caused the pandemic the incident in taiwan has renewed the debate over the origin of the pandemic according to yanzhong huang a chinese public health expert at the council on foreign relations if the lab worker is confirmed to have been infected at her workplace then this will add credibility to the lab leak theory although this case is raising new questions about the likelihood of a lab as the origin of the pandemic lab leaks aren t as rare as the media would have the public believe the 1918 spanish flu pandemic marked the first appearance of the h1n1 virus although the initial outbreak was natural the virus s sudden reappearance in the late 1970s was actually due to a laboratory leak of a stored strain of the h1n1 virus we know this because the genetic sequence of the virus in the 1970s outbreak was nearly identical to the sequences of decades old strains put another way the virus was not evolving during this time it was sitting in a lab indeed the nih notes that a biosafety lapse in a research laboratory is now most often cited as the cause of the 1977 1978 reemergence of the h1n1 influenza virus strain seattle policemen wear white cloth face masks during the spanish flu pandemic in december 1918 public domain in 1979 spores of anthrax leaked from a lab in the soviet union killing scores of people at the time soviet authorities covered up the origins of the outbreak claiming that it came from contaminated meat in a twist eerily reminiscent of the world health organization s covid 19 origins investigation a molecular biologist from harvard university matthew meselson was allowed to travel to the soviet union to investigate the outbreak upon his return he issued a report that backed the soviet version of events claiming that the outbreak started at a contaminated meat processing plant meselson stated that that explanation was plausible and consistent with what is known from medical literature and recorded human experiences with anthrax in another parallel to the natural origins narrative for covid 19 in which illegal wildlife markets were initially blamed for the pandemic meselson claimed that the outbreak was caused by the illegal sale of meat after the fall of the soviet union it was finally revealed in 1992 that the outbreak had in fact originated at a military research facility the original severe acute respiratory syndrome sars outbreak in 2003 made headlines across the world however a lesser known fact is that the sars virus has subsequently leaked out of various labs at least six times the first incident occurred in singapore a country known for its meticulousness and attention to detail shortly after the initial outbreak ended there were subsequent sars lab leaks in beijing as well as in taiwan in 2003 and 2004 the years 2013 and 2014 were particularly bad for lab accidents notably many of the accidents that happened during this period took place at the university of north carolina at chapel hill unc where lab mice escaped the university s lab on at least eight occasions including some infected with sars and h1n1 viruses in response the nih stated that it appears the measures taken by the university of north carolina to reduce the likelihood of these events have not been effective poor biosafety at unc is all the more notable in light of the fact that the university houses ralph baric s lab in 2015 baric a pioneer of gain of function experiments famously collaborated with the director of the wuhan institute of virology shi zhengli to create a hybrid version of a bat coronavirus that had been adapted to grow in mice and to mimic human disease chinese virologist shi zhengli is seen inside the p4 laboratory in wuhan capital of china s hubei province on feb 23 2017 johannes eisele afp via getty images rutgers s ebright who warned in 2015 that the only impact of gain of function work was the creation in a lab of a new non natural risk has stated that these prior leaks underscore the fact that it is eminently plausible that a wuhan laboratory worker handling sars related coronaviruses was infected and then transmitted the infection to the general public sparking the pandemic notably his 2015 warning was in response to the experiments carried out by baric and shi zhengli incidents of lab leaks in just the past 10 years have involved notably dangerous pathogens including dengue anthrax h5n1 smallpox ebola and zika although there are far too many incidents of lab leaks to list here one event is particularly relevant the november 2019 lab accident in china when nearly 200 staff members at the lanzhou veterinary research institute became infected with brucellosis also known as mediterranean fever subsequently thousands of residents of lanzhou reportedly also fell ill ccp authorities have denied that the veterinary research institute was responsible blaming the outbreak on polluted waste gas from a pharmaceutical facility which was allegedly carried by wind to the research institute ironically even if the ccp s version of events is accurate it would still have been a lab accident taiwan s leak refocuses debate on covid 19 origin the lanzhou outbreak which happened at almost exactly the same time as the wuhan outbreak should have served as an immediate red flag for anyone looking into the origins of covid 19 but the lanzhou outbreak has been largely ignored by the media the incident underscored not only that laboratory accidents happen with disturbing regularity but also that the ccp has a history of covering them up in 2019 yuan zhiming the vice director of the wuhan institute of virology wrote a review of the many safety deficiencies within china s many laboratories he noted that several high level bsls have insufficient operational funds for routine yet vital processes noting that many of china s bsl 3 laboratories run on extremely minimal operational costs or in some cases none at all just a year earlier in 2018 u s embassy officials visited the wuhan institute and warned the state department that there was inadequate safety at the lab which was conducting risky studies on coronaviruses from bats they also reported that there was a lack of trained staff at the wuhan facility fda commissioner designate scott gottlieb testifies during a senate health education labor and pensions committee hearing on capitol hill in washington on april 5 2017 zach gibson getty images former u s food and drug administration head scott gottlieb has stated that lab leaks happen all the time during a may 2021 interview on cbs s face the nation gottlieb noted in china the last six known outbreaks of sars 1 have been out of labs including the last known outbreak which was a pretty extensive outbreak that china initially wouldn t disclose that it came out of a lab gottlieb said that it was only disclosed finally by some journalists who were able to trace that outbreak back to a laboratory the transparency and responsiveness with which taiwan handled its recent biosafety lapse contrasts sharply with china s ongoing efforts to impede any investigation into the origin of the pandemic china s efforts to thwart any true investigation of the virus s origin also raise questions as to why the united states was providing technology and funding for gain of function experiments to a communist regime that s known for its lack of transparency former mi6 chief sir richard dearlove recently summed up china s approach to the pandemic when he told the australian i m pretty sure that the chinese after the outbreak in wuhan and they re very good at doing this sat down and developed their own information campaign and this was almost certainly driven by the ministry of state security and run out of the prc leadership to make sure that there was suppression of any suggestion that their narrative was not the correct one dearlove echoed the concerns of many when he ominously noted that what concerns me and what worries me is the extent to which the west went along with this views expressed in this article are opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of the epoch times

potentially elude vaccine protections while early data from south africa shows that the variant has led to fewer hospitalizations experts still stress that the dynamic might not be the same for every

young as age 16 as reported by the associated press but it s not yet clear if younger teens will need a booster and the centers for disease control and prevention must recommend that 16 and 17 year olds get the booster before they can actually get the shots the u s and many other nations already urge adults to get a booster to pump up their immunity months after initial vaccinations currently the pfizer vaccine is the only option approved for children and teenagers in the country 9 40 a m here s how we ll know when the pandemic is over there s no clear cut definition for when a pandemic starts and ends or how much of a threat the global outbreak poses for each country according to the associated press back in january 2020 the world health organization designated the coronavirus outbreak a global health crisis of international concern a couple of months later who described it as a pandemic reflecting the spread of the virus the pandemic may be widely considered over when who

vary 9 20 a m us vaccinates about 200 million people but hospitalizations still rising the u s has reached a covid 19 milestone of roughly 200 million fully vaccinated people but cases and hospitalizations are still spiking even in highly immunized pockets of the country like new england according to the associated press the situation is not as dire as last year s post holiday surge before the public had any access to vaccines still experts say that the roughly 60 of the u s population that is vaccinated is not enough to prevent hotspots the colder weather thanksgiving and

officials for recall geoff pallay with the election tracking website ballotpedia says 120 local officials in california have been the subject of a recall attempt this year that s nearly twice the annual average of 67 over the past decade pallay says covid 19 rules have played a major role in the uptick things like closing up schools or mask requirements or vaccine requirements covid related recalls have been a significant contributor to the overall rise in recalls nationwide pallay told california lawmakers at a hearing this week nationally 491 local recall attempts were filed in 2021 compared to an average of 324 per year in the decade prior pallay said school closures are at the center of a recall against three san francisco school board members set for february 2022 shasta

according to ballotpedia 9 of this year s local recall attempts in california have qualified though 32 are still in a signature gathering or review phase after the unsuccessful attempt to remove

approval 9 10 a m pfizer says their vaccine offers some protection against omicron pfizer says a booster dose of its covid 19 vaccine appears to offer important protection against the new omicron variant according to the associated press pfizer and its partner biontech tested how well vaccine produced antibodies could neutralize omicron in lab dishes and they found significant weakening after the standard two doses however a booster dose increased the antibody levels by 25 fold the companies said two doses still may protect against severe illness but they re working on developing an omicron specific vaccine in case it s needed together the companies announced the findings today in a press release the data is preliminary and hasn t undergone scientific review yet 8 49 a m federal judge blocks president biden s vaccine mandate a federal judge recently blocked president joe biden s administration from enforcing a covid 19 vaccine mandate for employees of federal contractors in a win for republican led states refusing to accommodate pandemic policies according to the associated press the judge issued a stay to bar enforcement of the mandate nationwide the order came in response to a lawsuit from several contractors and several states including alabama georgia idaho kansas south carolina utah and west virginia the stay applies across the country because one of those challenging the order is the trade group associated builders and contractors inc whose members do business nationwide separately biden has imposed vaccine requirements for the federal government and military employees the mandates are a key part of the administration s strategy to stop the spread of covid 19 which has killed more than 788 000 americans since last year tuesday december 7 4 30 p m no positive tests but omicron variant most likely present in sacramento county health officials say the new omicron variant of covid 19 is most likely present in sacramento health officials confirmed in a statement tuesday afternoon the announcement comes after stanford university researchers said they detected the variant in the region s wastewater as of tuesday no sacramento county resident has tested positive for the omicron variant during a weekly briefing last week county public health officer dr olivia kasirye said omicron would come to sacramento at some point because of how much travel happens during the holidays we just need to continue to be vigilant and do the things that we know will protect everyone like getting vaccinated getting tested and wearing masks she said the researchers from stanford university were conducting epidemiologic surveillance for covid 19 in several california counties and partnered with the sacramento regional sanitation district to test in sacramento the researchers gathered a sample of sacramento wastewater on nov 30 and found low concentrations of a mutation used as a marker for the omicron variant county officials said the county said it received the results of the study on friday and confirmed them on monday there is much we do not know at this time county spokeswoman janna haynes wrote in an email first it is unclear whether omicron is more transmissible than the delta variant second it is unknown whether omicron variant infection is associated with more severe disease the omicron variant first popped up in european and south african countries in november california health officials announced on dec 1 that one person in san francisco tested positive for the variant when they returned to the bay area from south africa cases have since popped up in at least 19 states according to the centers for disease control and prevention 10 21 a m university of the pacific sets up a nursing graduate program for non nursing backgrounds the university of the pacific has created an accelerated graduate program to help meet california and the country s critical nursing shortage while the pandemic has worsened the problem uop has started thinking about a program of this kind back in march 2020 nicoleta bugnariu the founding dean of uop s school of health sciences thinks the program could bring more people into the shrinking industry prior to the pandemic there was a shortage of nurses in california i don t pretend that we know at that point how long this pandemic will last and the impact but where we are now that shortage has increased bugnariu said according to uc san francisco california is experiencing a shortage of over 40 000 registered nurses while the situation has pre dated the pandemic things have only gotten worse bugnariu said that one of the primary goals is to help students deal with the stresses of the job through self assessment how do i address this what can i do for myself to bring myself to a healthier more grounded center if you want and then reach out to a network build that community so you don t do this alone she said these foundational skills need to be developed to help students stay in the nursing profession long term she said 10 13 a m a new type of covid 19 vaccine is almost finished with development there s another covid 19 vaccine ready to soon roll out to the world novavax and while it won t necessarily replace the current vaccinations we have it can make a huge impact on the course of the pandemic in lower resourced countries according to npr the inoculation will be what s called a protein subunit vaccine it works by injecting people with a tiny portion of the virus which in this case would be the spike protein critical for the virus to enter cells this could make a dent in the global unvaccinated population because protein subunit vaccines are often very stable and don t require freezers for storage since it ll just need a regular refrigerator it ll make disturbing the vaccines much easier 9 30 a m new covid 19 treatments show how pandemic has sped up drug and vaccine research two new drugs that treat patients with covid 19 are awaiting authorization from the food and drug administration merck makes one and the other is by pfizer while the merck drug has been in development for years pfizer s drug didn t even exist when the pandemic began the tale of two drugs could be an example of how the coronavirus pandemic has sped up the drug and vaccine development process however pfizer wasn t exactly starting from zero according to npr back in 2003 when the sars outbreak happened the company began searching for ways to combat that version of the coronavirus more about the development of coronavirus drugs here monday december 6 9 44 a m marin county parents knowingly sent child sick with covid 19 to in person school northern california parents knowingly sent their covid 19 positive child and a sibling to school last month

located in marin county said that the child tested positive for the virus during the week of nov 8 both children continued to attend school the rest of the week and into the following week the child and their sibling who later also tested positive are students in the district s neil cummins elementary school the parents could face a fine or a misdemeanor charge for violating marin county s health order 9 26 a m here s how you can protect yourself from the omicron variant to protect yourself against the omicron variant experts say to do what you would against any other variant getting vaccinated if you re not already getting a booster if you re eligible and stepping up other precautions you may have relaxed like mask wearing for all of the attention omicron is getting the overwhelming cause of infections in many places is still the delta variant according to the associated press as scientists work on learning more about omicron experts note the importance of layering protection that s especially true with holiday travel and gatherings around the corner a booster shot could be one of those protective layers 9 05 a m fauci says early reports from omicron are hopeful u s health officials say that while the omicron variant of the coronavirus is rapidly spreading in the country early indications suggest it may be less dangerous than delta the current scourge of hospitalization surges according to the associated press the country s chief medical adviser dr anthony fauci told cnn s state of the union that scientists need more information before drawing conclusions about omicron s severity but reports from south africa where it s becoming the dominant strain suggest hospitalization rates have not increased much omicron has been detected in about a third of u s states as of sunday fauci said the biden administration is considering lifting travel restrictions against noncitizens entering the u s from several african countries sunday december 5 12 10 p m convention business in downtown sacramento has been down but will likely increase in early 2022 as 2021 comes to a close at the end of this month many organizations are evaluating how the pandemic has affected their bottom lines despite a string of large scale events since june including friday s california international marathon in looking at how downtown may fare going into 2022 there s one significant wild card a possible lack of state office workers says mike testa president and ceo of visit sacramento there s a huge population of california state employees that were working in downtown every day and so many of them are working at home testa said if that continues there s great concern of the impact that will have on businesses because it s tens of thousands of people on a daily basis who just aren t in sacramento testa says compared with 2019 convention business is a bit down but several large events scheduled for early 2022 are signaling a likely increase in attendance friday december 3 11 48 a m omicron hasn t reached sacramento but it will county public officer says the omicron variant of covid 19 that s sweeping through several south african and european countries has made its way to california with cases popping up in san francisco and los angeles while sacramento has not seen any cases of the new variant county public health officer dr olivia kasirye says it s still a variant of concern she said that it s difficult to predict when the variant may spread to sacramento but with people traveling for the holidays it s only a matter of time we know it s going to happen at some point kasirye said so we just need to continue to be vigilant and do the things that we know will protect everyone like getting vaccinated getting tested and wearing masks as of now very little is known about omicron it s not clear how fast it spreads or how severe symptoms can be and of course that means we also need to look at for people that are vaccinated what is the level of protection kasirye said our hope is that our vaccines will hold up and the people that are vaccinated will continue to be protected kasirye said that it s difficult to predict when the variant may spread to sacramento but when it does she says her department will be able to detect it much sooner than they have in the past thanks to tools the county s lab just received in order to identify the variant you have to do the genome sequencing kasirye said so being able to do it in house increases our capacity to be able to continue the surveillance prior to getting access to the sequencing tools kasirye says the county was sending specimens to the state s lab which delayed identifying new cases of variants as of now she says delta is still the dominant variant in sacramento 9 27 a m california confirms second omicron case in los angeles california recently reported its second confirmed case of the omicron variant in los angeles county according to the associated press the county s public health department said a county resident is self isolating after apparently contracting the infection during a trip to south africa last month the u s recorded

was first identified a week ago in south africa and it s been spreading california isn t the only state with infections five other states including new york minnesota hawaii and colorado have all identified omicron variant cases experts have said that this shows how quickly mutations of the virus can circumnavigate the globe with speed and ease just one day after the first known u s case was found in california tests showed that the omicron variant had infected at least five people in new york city plus a man from minnesota who attended an anime convention in manhattan in late november officials reported another case in a colorado woman who had recently traveled to southern africa the variant was also confirmed in an unvaccinated hawaii resident with no recent travel history 9 23 a m unvaccinated nevada state workers will be charged an insurance premium nevada state workers enrolled in public employee healthcare plans will be charged up to 55 per month if they aren t fully vaccinated according to the associated press the nevada public employees benefits program board voted on thursday to impose a surcharge on unvaccinated workers to offset medical costs of those who

to impose premiums on state workers who aren t vaccinated nevada estimates roughly 5 000 state workers aren t vaccinated and hopes that the policy will convince more people to get their shots 9 20 a m latest studies suggest previous covid 19 infection may not fend off omicron variant south african scientists are warning that the new omicron variant may be causing more reinfections among covid 19 survivors than earlier virus mutations according to the associated press a research group has been tracking reinfections in south africa and they spotted a jump with the arrival of omicron saying the timing suggests substantial evidence that the variant can overcome the immunity protection provided by a prior infection more than the extra contagious delta variant the findings are preliminary and were posted online thursday before scientific review the researchers didn t say what portion of the reinfections were confirmed as omicron cases or examine how much protection against the new variant vaccines offer thursday december 2 11 33 a m status of covid 19 vaccine mandate is still up in the air the biden administration s covid 19 vaccine mandate in the u s is on hold because of legal challenges but employers can still require the shots according to the associated press the regulation says businesses with 100 or more employees need to require covid 19 vaccinations or have workers tested weekly for the virus it was set to take effect jan 4 2022 but has faced legal challenges from businesses republicans and others a federal appeals court put the rule on hold then all legal challenges were consolidated in another appeals court which is taking written arguments from parties that want to join the case 11 26 a m omicron and delta variants could spell the return of more restrictive safety measures governments worldwide are weighing new measures for those who may be tired of restrictions and vaccine mandates as the delta variant pushes up cases in europe and other parts of the world according to the associated press different countries have been turning to varying measures to get their populations vaccinated and healthy for example residents over 60 who refuse to get vaccinated will be hit with monthly fines of 100 euros 113 a month in greece potential carriers of omicron in israel could be tracked by the nation s domestic security agency in south africa restrictions include curfews and bans on alcohol sales however in the u s there is essentially no political willpower from either major party to enact any lockdowns or contact tracing even enforcing simple measures like mask wearing has become a political flashpoint governments are facing a thorny calculus made more difficult by the prospect of backlash increased social divisions and the fear of being voted out of office 10 47 a m while we re looking at omicron we can t forget the delta variant experts stress while all eyes are on the new and little understood omicron variant the delta form of the coronavirus isn t finished wreaking havoc in the u s sending record numbers of patients to the hospital in some states especially in the midwest and new england according to the associated press the u s recorded its first known omicron infection on wednesday in a fully vaccinated person who had returned to california from south africa where the variant was identified just over a week ago for now the extra contagious delta variant accounts for practically all cases in the u s and continues to inflict misery at a time when many hospitals are struggling with shortages of nurses and a backlog of patients the fear now is that the latest variant will foist more patients and perhaps sicker ones into more hospital beds wednesday december 1 11 43 a m first omicron variant case in nation detected in san francisco the first case of the covid 19 omicron variant in the u s was found in san francisco late last month according to state and local health officials dr anthony fauci said the person was a traveler who returned from south africa on nov 22 and tested positive on nov 29 the person was vaccinated but had not received a booster shot according to the associated press the news comes as scientists continue to study the risks posed by the new strain of the virus the biden administration moved late last month to restrict travel from southern africa despite the netherlands being the first country to identify an infection where the variant originated is still unclear but clusters of cases have also been identified in about two dozen other nations 11 42 a m mysteries of the omicron variant could take weeks to untangle scientists say it could be weeks before they better understand how dangerous the omicron variant is according to the associated press it s still unknown whether the newest coronavirus variant of concern spreads faster than delta or makes people sicker according to the associated press it also isn t clear how much protection is offered either by our vaccines or a person s immunity after recovering from another covid 19 variant there are lots of guesses but little hard evidence as scientists race to find answers amid scrutiny from an anxious public in the meantime scientists urge people to get vaccinated and take other public health measures such as masking indoors 11 35 a m supply chain woes hit toy giving charities during the

president joe biden s pick to become commissioner of the food and drug administration robert califf said the price of pharmaceuticals is way too high at a senate hearing on tuesday during the hearing vermont independent senator bernie sanders asked califf a question related to califf s relations with drug companies and his investments in pharmaceutical stocks what kind of comfort can you give to the american people when you have been so closely tied to the pharmaceutical industry yourself asked sanders i m totally with you the price of pharmaceuticals is way too high in this country califf responded califf who served as fda commissioner before the end of the obama administration promised that he would work to make prescription drugs more affordable use data to efficiently approve covid treatments and tests do a full review of the agency s management of opioid painkillers continue the focus on tobacco regulation and combat medical misinformation on social media if he were confirmed he is a cardiologist with strong connections to the pharmaceutical industry and academic research centers he worked at duke university for over 35 years creating a contract research organization that conducts studies for the world s largest drugmakers until he became fda commissioner since his stint at the fda he has been employed at google as a health policy adviser and has served as board director or adviser to more than half a dozen drug and biotech companies califf said that his reasoning for returning to the fda is public service saying that he is a 70 year old person with nothing to gain according to a federal disclosures form califf will resign from all his positions if confirmed robert califf the current nominee for food and drug administration commissioner promised that if confirmed he would work to make prescription drugs more affordable as well as use data to efficiently approve covid treatments and robert califf the current nominee for food and drug administration

hampshire democratic senator maggie hassan pressed califf on the need to change fda prescribing information for opioids to better reflect the risk of addiction the fda has been straining for months under a massive pandemic workload even as a series of scientific disputes including the approval of a controversial alzheimer s drug have marred its public reputation califf s nomination by biden last month was seen as a safe steady choice to guide the agency which hasn t had a permanent leader since january the fda regulates the vaccines drugs and tests used to combat covid 19 on top of its normal duties regulating a swath of consumer goods and medicines including prescription drugs medical devices tobacco and vaping products more than a year after authorizing the first covid 19 vaccines the fda still faces a string of key decisions including whether to expand booster shots to younger teens and children additionally as researchers learn more about the omicron variant the fda will play a deciding role in whether the shots should be updated to target the strain fda commissioners aren t typically involved in day to day scientific reviews but they serve as the go between from the agency s scientists to political decision makers in the white house that relationship came to a head this fall when the fda s two top vaccine reviewers publicly opposed the biden administration s plan to offer boosters to all american adults both have since retired from the agency after careers spanning decades giving califf an opportunity to choose key replacements last month the fda ultimately signed off on boosters for all adults as covid 19 cases surged again robert califf is a cardiologist who previously held the position of commissioner at the food and drug administration near the end

risks to teens under califf in 2016 the fda added bolstered warnings to prescription opioids and began publicly scrutinizing all new opioid drug applications but the agency has yet to implement many other steps recommended by experts including an overall review of whether opioid painkillers pose more risks than benefits for society at large the associated press contributed to this report
it all started when joe nocera moved into a house in the hamptons in 2010 the veteran journalist soon met isaac ike herschkopf a new york based therapist who appeared to own the home next to his marty markowitz who was often outside tending to the grounds of that house seemed to work for herschkopf but nocera untangled the apparent truth of their relationship over the next several years a twisty saga that he turned into a hit podcast which in turn became an apple tv series the shrink next door starring paul rudd as herschkopf and will ferrell as markowitz from a distance it looks like a writer s dream a story gets optioned and becomes a hit show and its author is rewarded with gobs of money and a halo of hollywood validation yet the story of how nocera s story made it onto the screen is almost as tortured and contentious as the relationship between markowitz and herschkopf that it portrays advertisement by the time the shrink next door debuted in november the award winning journalist had been fired by his most recent employer bloomberg news the media behemoth that helped shepherd his story to podcast fame on tuesday nocera filed a breach of contract lawsuit against bloomberg alleging that the company has denied him profits he is due for the tv series nocera s camp is casting him as a creative force done wrong by a major corporation profiting off his hard work whatever bloomberg gets from commercializing this story joe gets half of it said vivek jayaram nocera s attorney creatives can and should be empowered to benefit financially from the work they have created especially when they ve entered into agreements confirming that right kerri chyka a spokesperson for bloomberg news said mr nocera was treated fairly in all of his dealings with bloomberg we have honored and will continue to honor all of our contractual obligations with him advertisement this story is based on interviews with a dozen people familiar with nocera s experiences many of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to frankly discuss their employers colleagues friends and enemies when he first encountered herschkopf nocera was a columnist for the new york times with a remarkable gift for explaining business issues to a general audience according to bill keller the former executive editor of the times who had brought nocera to the paper five years earlier after a decade at fortune magazine nocera came to realize that markowitz who he assumed was herschkopf s groundskeeper was actually the owner of the house and that herschkopf was markowitz s therapist who had taken up residence in the hamptons home as part of a highly unconventional treatment plan markowitz would later allege that the psychiatrist had insinuated his way into his life over three decades persuading him to break away from friends and relatives taking control of his business affairs and even throwing parties at markowitz s home herschkopf who disputes the allegations lost his license to practice medicine in new york in april after a state health department panel found he had committed several professional violations advertisement nocera spent part of the next two years untangling the complex and troubling relationship and eventually pitched a story to the times magazine it was a thorny narrative and nocera was himself a character in it his lengthy draft was submitted to a drawn out editing process in 2013 but ultimately just as the piece was nearing publication times editors decided they just couldn t make it work and gave nocera a kill fee it was an ambitious personal story full of weird stuff but a lot of great magazine stories are like that i just wasn t in the position where i could go to bat for it said hugo lindgren editor of the magazine at the time who left the times a couple months later but nocera never forgot the story years later after he also left the times and joined bloomberg opinion as a columnist his adult son called him one day with the idea of turning his failed magazine story into a podcast nocera met with the academy award winning documentary filmmaker alex gibney who was intrigued by the story and wanted to turn it into a podcast about the incredible power to persuade gibney told the post gibney s recollection is that nocera s ties to bloomberg precluded him pursuing a partnership outside the company advertisement around the same time bloomberg news entered into discussions with podcast publisher wondery about potential subjects to pursue together bloomberg presented wondery with a number of ideas but nocera s was the most compelling from day one talking to joe and seeing the material he had from marty i knew it would be a great podcast recalled marshall lewy wondery s chief content officer lewy said that the project worked because markowitz had saved photos manuscripts letters and receipts that documented the strange nature of their relationship that s the only reason we could tell it because there was enough evidence bloomberg would not discuss nocera s specific claims but people familiar with nocera s work there have noted how the company supported the writer in producing the podcast giving him time off from his twice a week columns an editor to oversee the process and a fact checker to confirm the most sensitive details even though podcasts and the tale this one in particular told were both far outside bloomberg s chief concern of providing up to the minute business news and data for a core audience of investors and financial professionals but it paid off after it was released in may 2019 the initial 10 episode podcast quickly became a hit and was streamed more than any other new podcast on apple podcasts in 2019 eventually accruing nearly 35 million downloads yet despite the podcast s success nocera had already encountered difficulty elsewhere in his career at bloomberg after having to make high profile corrections to several of his columns and not long after the podcast started airing nocera wrote two columns that contributed to his downfall at the company advertisement the subject was a little known biotechnology company called mimedx that had become the focus of a short selling campaign by marc cohodes known in financial circles for his highly aggressive strategies of trying to drive down companies stock prices in august 2019 nocera wrote two columns one of which was later appended with a correction criticizing cohodes for continuing to publicly attack mimedx even after its stock had tanked and the company had ousted its chief executive in an attempt to clean house share this article share nocera wrote that cohodes had gone too far but his language in promoting his column on social media was far stronger the real fraud is the short selling campaign he tweeted a bloomberg lawyer warned the columnist to tone down his rhetoric according to a person familiar with the exchange nocera issued another tweet stating that he should have called the matter a tragedy instead of fraud but an incensed cohodes attacked nocera repeatedly on twitter sometimes in personal and vulgar terms and issued complaints to david shipley senior executive editor of bloomberg opinion that seemed to hint at potential litigation cohodes told the post he does not plan to sue advertisement nocera had been warned by the company s legal team not respond to cohodes but when the former chief executive of mimedx was found guilty of fraud late last year cohodes and others began needling nocera to retract his old columns then in september when a key mimedx product failed clinical trials cohodes and others demanded more apologies and retractions from nocera and nocera couldn t help himself what follows is a response to those insisting that i apologize for my 2019 columns about marc cohodes assault on he wrote on twitter sept 14 at the start of a lengthy thread i have nothing to apologize for i know it s pointless to get into a twitter battle with critics i think it s important to set the record straight he concluded with a jab at cohodes for continuing to press the issue what was the point he d won the war he d made money if he couldn t root for to succeed why couldn t he at least walk away not long after shipley called nocera and fired him according to two people familiar with the conversation advertisement after that nocera hired a lawyer who inquired with a bloomberg lawyer about the money nocera said the company owed him for the shrink next door nocera s lawsuit targets the proceeds from a 2019 deal that bloomberg and wondery struck with mrc studios the company that adapted the podcast into a television show under the agreement bloomberg and wondery agreed to split any revenue generated from mrc on a 50 50 basis according to the lawsuit bloomberg and nocera in turn agreed to split all revenue other than service related fees earned by bloomberg in connection with the exploitation of the by third parties according to a contract referred to in the lawsuit that was reviewed by the post it states that nocera would receive 100 percent of bloomberg s half of the initial option price for the series which amounted to 125 000 but according to his lawsuit when nocera inquired with the company about his earnings from the deal after he was fired he was told that bloomberg s stance was that journalists were not entitled to a share of advertising revenue generated by an adaptation and that none would be included in his agreement nocera s lawsuit alleges that this flies in the face of the all revenue language in the contract he s also asking for an accounting of all the money that bloomberg has earned from the shrink next door advertisement according to the complaint bloomberg acknowledged that mrc owed nocera 322 500 but that the bulk of that money had been paid out and the outstanding balance of what nocera would get was 35 000 bloomberg said it would pay nocera that money when it received it from mrc nocera claims he is owed much more jayaram his attorney said that nocera would be suing even if he were still employed by bloomberg he d be enforcing his rights under either circumstance days after nocera lost his job bloomberg opinion published a letter to the editor from cohodes in which the investor essentially took a victory lap denouncing several of nocera s claims and praising himself for exposing mimedx a stunned nocera took personal offense throughout two years of constant attacks from cohodes you were unwilling to do anything to defend my journalism he wrote to shipley but it now appears that his bullying has caused bloomberg opinion to allow him to further besmirch me at the very least you should have allowed me to respond to his letter shipley declined please know that i wish you every happiness and success going forward he concluded a little more than a month later the shrink next door would debut on apple tv to mixed reviews some of them musing that the tv series could do little to improve upon nocera s epic podcast nocera who has since inked a contract to make podcasts for british publisher blanchard house was there for the red carpet premiere mingling alongside rudd ferrell kathryn hahn casey wilson and the other actors at new york s morgan library museum the stars lavished particular attention on one vip guest marty markowitz himself but in an interview with the washington post markowitz turned the spotlight back to the writer he met in his yard a decade ago this story would never have seen the light of day without joe nocera he said there s no question about that alice crites contributed research for this story

greater than 2250 ounce in a given quarter general news nab released its business confidence report yesterday creditorwatch chief economist harley dale had this to say one might be forgiven for thinking that the result for the november nab business confidence index is a tad disappointing that would be overstating the result the update shows that business confidence remains well above the long term average and aggregate business conditions improved again conditions strengthened noticeably in the retail and transport sectors in november this is consistent with creditorwatch data which has already noted that the retail sector much maligned throughout extended lockdowns is bouncing back related sectors such as food and beverages are getting back into the groove but are still high in terms of payment arrears it will take time for those who survived to revive balance sheets customers and a covid normal trading environment we have a balance here an economic recovery is underway but while some industries and geographical jurisdictions will blossom heading into 2022 some will falter or go backwards before lifting later next year the outcome reflects the november results for the creditorwatch business risk index which highlighted that australia s economic recovery will take time patience and won t happen all at once there will be larger than normal industry discrepancies however it is very encouraging that australia is firmly heading in the right direction us markets all eyes are on the federal reserve which has kicked off its two day meeting the focus is on preventing higher inflation from becoming entrenched the wall street journal believes the fed s postmeeting statement which would generally indicate future policy could be overhauled by the end of the meeting on wednesday omicron s rise could have an impact on policy and investors are anxiously waiting to see what this impact may be investors are also waiting for any indication on how quickly interest rates will rise with experts flagging at least two rises next year on the good news front the us government will invest nearly us9 billion to increase lending to racial minorities and poorer

invested of which us3 1 billion will go to institutions controlled by minorities in america today deep racial disparities continue to hold people back from achieving all they can harris said when

necessary disclosures plaintiff asserts securities act claims against mutual fund for alleged non disclosure of closet indexing strategy on november 5 2021 an alleged purchaser the plaintiff of shares of the american century value fund the fund initiated a securities class action against the fund and its directors adviser and distributor in the u s district court for the northern district of california the complaint asserted that the fund s registration statements contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted to state other material facts in violation of the securities act in particular the plaintiff asserted that that the fund s registration statements disclosed the fund s adviser would employ an active value investment strategy by looking for stocks of companies that it believed were undervalued at the time of purchase the plaintiff claimed that the registration statements were misleading because the fund s true undisclosed strategy was like an index fund s to buy and sell stocks so that the fund s performance merely closely tracked the performance of its benchmark the russell 1000 value index according to the plaintiff the fund misrepresented that it employed an active value investment strategy that would seek to outperform the fund s benchmark index because in fact the fund employed an undisclosed closet indexing strategy to match that index in support of these claims the plaintiff asserted that the fund s performance throughout the relevant period barely strayed from the movement of its benchmark and that statistically the variance of the price of the shares of the fund was explained by the variance of its benchmark index in addition the plaintiff asserted during the relevant period i the adviser s management fees were excessive because the adviser did not engage in active management and ii the fund s trading activity was significantly greater than the trading activity of passive index funds that tracked the same benchmark as the fund resulting in the fund incurring excessive trading costs despite its fee related allegations however the complaint did not include any claims under section 36 b of the 1940 act limiting itself only to securities act disclosure based claims sec sues corporate insider using novel application of rule 10b 5 on august 17 2021 in the u s district court for the northern district of california the sec initiated a civil lawsuit against a former executive the defendant of medivation inc medivation asserting that the defendant had engaged in insider trading transactions in violation of exchange act section 10 b and rule 10b 5 thereunder while employed by medivation notably according to the sec the securities transactions in question did not involve securities issued by medivation but instead were issued by incyte corporation incyte a peer company to medivation in the biopharmaceutical industry the complaint further alleges medivation was a mid cap oncology focused biopharmaceutical company until it was acquired by pfizer inc pfizer on september 28 2016 at the time of the acquisition the defendant was an employee of medivation with the title of senior director of business development at the outset of his employment with medivation the defendant signed medivation s insider trading policy which prohibited employees from personally profiting from material nonpublic information concerning medivation by trading in medivation securities or in the securities of another publicly traded company including competitors of medivation during 2015 2016 in the course of his work with the investment banks advising medivation about its strategic options the defendant reviewed presentations authored by investment bankers in which the investment banks identified companies that were comparable to medivation in particular the bankers drew close parallels between medivation and incyte including that both were valuable mid cap oncology focused publicly traded companies with a profitable fda approved commercial stage drug on the u s market in 2016 just prior to the pfizer acquisition of medivation the defendant knew that i large cap pharmaceutical companies were interested in acquiring oncology focused mid cap biopharmaceutical companies with commercial stage drugs ii there were only a few such companies including medivation and incyte left to acquire and iii each such acquisition was material to the remaining companies because it made them potentially more valuable acquisition targets and could thus positively affect the stock price of those companies in august 2016 the defendant learned confidential information through his employment that medivation would be imminently acquired by pfizer at a significant premium to the company s stock price within minutes of receiving this highly confidential news from medivation s ceo the defendant is alleged to have misappropriated medivation s confidential information by purchasing from his work computer out of the money short term stock options in incyte over the course of the trading day on which medivation announced its acquisition by pfizer the price of medivation shares rose by approximately 20 that same day the stock price of incyte rose materially by approximately 8 on the news of medivation s acquisition and the value of the defendant s stock options roughly doubled by trading ahead of the announcement the defendant obtained profits of 107 066 the sec s suit is an attempt to extend the misappropriation theory of insider trading to a set of facts where the material non public information mnpi did not concern an issuer that was a party to an undisclosed transaction this type of trading has been termed shadow trading shadow trading transactions like those in which the defendant engaged present incremental difficulty to compliance personnel in detecting misuse of mnpi because of the difficulty of determining whether mnpi that an employee obtains about one issuer results in mnpi about other issuers sometimes the connection may be obvious e g mnpi about a large defense contractor winning a major department of defense contract is likely to affect the contractor s major subcontractors the connections in other fact patterns may be more difficult to detect sec opens door for more esg proposals by shareholders on november 3 2021 the staff of the sec division of corporate finance corpfin published new guidance in staff legal bulletin 14l slb 14l for companies and shareholders regarding shareholder proxy statement proposals made pursuant to rule 14a 8 under the exchange act among other things slb 14l rescinds prior staff legal bulletin nos 14i 14j and 14k the rescinded slbs and outlines corpfin s views on both rule 14a 8 i 7 the ordinary business exception and rule 14a 8 i 5 the economic relevance exception either exception may serve as the basis for a company to exclude from its proxy statement a shareholder proposal made pursuant to rule 14a 8 as described below slb 14l is likely to narrow the bases upon which management may exclude a shareholder proposal from proxy statements and may in particular narrow the application of the exceptions with respect to proposals concerning environmental social or governance esg issues ordinary business exception rule 14a 8 i 7 the ordinary business exception permits a company to exclude a shareholder proposal that deals with a matter relating to the company s ordinary business operations the purpose of the exception is to confine the resolution of ordinary business problems to management and the board of directors since it is impracticable for shareholders to decide how to solve such problems at an annual shareholders meeting 1 the sec has stated that the policy underlying the ordinary business exception rests on two premises the proposal s subject matter and the degree to which a proposal micromanages the company slb 14l addresses both premises significant social policy exception slb 14l states that corpfin will realign its approach for determining whether a proposal relates to ordinary business with the standard the sec initially articulated in 1976 and reaffirmed in 1998 2 that standard provided an exception to the ordinary business exception for certain proposals that raise significant social policy issues slb 14l states that corpfin will no longer focus on determining the nexus between a policy issue and the company instead corpfin will focus on the social policy significance of the issue that is the subject of the shareholder proposal in making this determination corpfin will consider whether the proposal raises issues with a broad societal impact such that they transcend the ordinary business of the company as an example slb 14l states that shareholder proposals squarely raising human capital management issues with a broad societal impact would not be subject to exclusion solely because the proponent did not demonstrate that the human capital management issue was significant to the company micromanagement exception slb 14l also states that corpfin has determined that its recent application of the micromanagement concept as outlined in rescinded slb nos 14j and 14k expanded the concept of micromanagement beyond the sec s policy directives the sec has stated that a proposal micromanages the company by probing too deeply into matters of a complex nature upon which shareholders as a group would not be in a position to make an informed judgment sln 14l states that the rescinded slbs may have been taken to mean that any limit on company or board discretion constitutes micromanagement and therefore served as a basis for a company to rely on the ordinary business exception prospectively slb 14l says corpfin will take a measured approach when evaluating companies micromanagement arguments recognizing that proposals seeking detail or seeking to promote timeframes or methods do not per se constitute micromanagement instead corpfin will focus on the level of granularity sought in the proposal and whether and to what extent it inappropriately limits discretion of the board or management as an example corpfin highlighted its recent denial of no action relief to an energy company3 that sought to exclude a shareholder proposal regarding greenhouse gas emissions targets the shareholder proposal requested that the company set emission reduction targets and it did not impose a specific method for doing so the corpfin staff concluded this proposal did not micromanage to such a degree as to justify exclusion under rule 14a 8 i 7 economic relevance exception rule 14a 8 i 5 another basis for a company to exclude a shareholder proposal from its proxy statement is the economic relevance exception which permits a company to exclude a proposal that relates to operations which account for less than 5 percent of the company s total assets at the end of its most recent fiscal year and for less than 5 percent of its net earnings and gross sales for its most recent fiscal year and is not otherwise significantly related to the company s business slb 14l states that corpfin will return to its long standing approach prior to the issuance of slb 14i of analyzing the economic relevance exception consistent with a federal district court s 1985 opinion 4 accordingly slb 14l states that proposals that raise issues of broad social or ethical concern related to the company s business may not be excluded even if the relevant business falls below the economic thresholds of rule 14a 8 i 5 other matters slb 14l also provides guidance on the use of email for shareholder proposal submissions and responses thereto separately slb 14l also restates guidance in rescinded slbs 14i and 14k regarding the use of graphics and images in shareholder proposals and proof of ownership letters with minor technical amendments observations slb 14l curtails the latitude given to management to exclude a shareholder proposal under rule 14a 8 from a company s proxy statement consequently beginning in the 2022 proxy season we expect that more proxy statements will contain shareholder proposals especially proposals concerning esg issues sec proposes to reverse its 2020 amendments to the proxy rules governing proxy voting advice background as described in this ropes gray alert on july 22 2020 the sec adopted amendments to its rules governing proxy solicitations and the filing exemptions for proxy voting advice the 2020 amendments with democratic commissioner lee dissenting then chairman clayton and the two republican commissioners closed the initial chapter in a more than decade long attempt to rein in the influence of proxy voting advice businesses proxy advisers the 2020 amendments conditioned the exemptions for reports issued by proxy advisers from the filing and information requirements of the federal proxy rules on compliance with disclosure and procedural requirements in addition the 2020 amendments codified in rule 14a 1 l s definition of solicitation the sec s longstanding view that proxy advisers reports are solicitations subject to the anti fraud provisions of the federal proxy rules what remains and the proposed changes on november 17 2021 chair gensler joined by the two democratic sec commissioners voted to propose changes to the 2020 amendments and issued a release the proxy proposals containing rule amendments that if adopted would eliminate some of the 2020 amendments requirements while leaving others unchanged the proxy proposals would leave unaffected the rule 14a 1 l codification within the definition of solicitation that proxy advisers reports are solicitations subject to the anti fraud provisions of the federal proxy rules the proxy proposals would not affect the 2020 amendments enhanced conflicts of interest disclosure requirements regarding any interest transaction or relationship of the proxy adviser or its affiliates that is material to assessing the objectivity of the proxy voting advice or the requirements regarding adoption and public disclosure of written policies and procedures used to identify and steps taken to address any such material conflicts of interest the proxy proposals would eliminate the 2020 amendments requirement that a proxy adviser adopt and publicly disclose written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that i registrants that are the subject of proxy voting advice have such advice made available to them at or prior to the time such advice is disseminated to the proxy adviser s clients and ii the proxy adviser provides its clients with a mechanism by which they can be expected to become aware of any written statements regarding its proxy voting advice by registrants that are the subject of such advice in a timely manner before the security holder meeting the 2020 amendments requirement that a proxy adviser adopt and publicly disclose written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that i registrants that are the subject of proxy voting advice have such advice made available to them at or prior to the time such advice is disseminated to the proxy adviser s clients and ii the proxy adviser provides its clients with a mechanism by which they can be expected to become aware of any written statements regarding its proxy voting advice by registrants that are the subject of such advice in a timely manner before the security holder meeting the proxy proposals would eliminate the 2020 amendments note e to rule 14a 9 the general antifraud rule applicable to proxy statements the note sets forth examples of what may depending on the particular facts and circumstances be misleading within the meaning of rule 14a 9 with respect to proxy voting advice according to the proxy proposals the note was merely intended to clarify the potential implications of rule 14a 9 for proxy voting advice and more generally proxy solicitations under existing law however the note appears to have unintentionally created a misperception that the addition of note e to rule 14a 9 purported to determine or alter the law governing rule 14a 9 s application and scope including its application to statements of opinion comment deadline comments on the proxy proposals must be received by the sec no later than december 27 2021 sec adopts universal proxy card registered investment companies and bdcs excluded at the november 17 2021 meeting described above the sec issued a release containing amendments of the federal proxy rules to require the use of a universal proxy card in all non exempt solicitations involving contested director elections the amendments will not affect director trustee elections involving registered investment companies and business development companies the universal proxy card will be required to include the names of both registrant and dissident nominees and it is intended to enhance the ability of shareholders to elect directors through the proxy process in a manner consistent with their ability to vote in person at a shareholder meeting the new rules become effective for any shareholder meeting featuring an election contest held after august 31 2022 sec proposes rule to enhance the transparency of securities lending market may impact large non agency lenders on november 18 2021 the sec issued a release the release containing proposed rule 10c 1 the rule under the exchange act if adopted the rule would require lenders of securities to report the material terms of their securities lending transactions in detail as well as information regarding the securities the lender has on loan and available to loan to a registered national securities association an rnsa currently finra is the only rnsa the rule is intended to supplement the publicly available information involving securities lending and to minimize information asymmetries between market participants the sec believes that the rule would increase market efficiency and lead to increased competition among providers of securities lending analytics services and to reduced administrative costs for broker dealers and lending programs rule requirements for each securities loan the rule would require any lender 5 to provide to an rnsa the detailed material terms of the transaction the 10c 1 information 6 in the format and manner required by rnsa within the fifteen minutes after the securities loan is effected or the terms of the loan are modified the rule would require that each rnsa make publicly available certain information about each transaction to provide to an rnsa the detailed material terms of the transaction the 10c 1 information in the format and manner required by rnsa within the fifteen minutes after the securities loan is effected or the terms of the loan are modified the rule would require that each rnsa make publicly available certain information about each transaction the rule also would require each lender to provide information about its securities available to loan and securities on loan be provided to an rnsa also 10c 1 information for each security about which the rnsa receives this information the rule would require the rnsa to make publicly available aggregate information for each security not later than the next business day reporting persons the rule would require any bank clearing agency or broker dealer that acts as an intermediary in a securities loan transaction a lending agent on behalf of the beneficial owner of the loaned securities to i provide the 10c 1 information to an rnsa on behalf of the beneficial owner in a timely manner or ii enter into a written agreement with a broker dealer a reporting agent to provide the 10c 1 information to an rnsa on behalf of the beneficial owner in a timely manner thus a beneficial owner itself would not be required to provide the 10c 1 information to an rnsa for any loan of securities intermediated by a lending agent however the release notes that if a beneficial owner does not employ a lending agent or enter into a written agreement with a reporting agent the beneficial owner would be responsible for complying with the rule s requirements to provide the 10c 1 information to an rnsa the release states that only large beneficial owners run their own lending programs without the assistance of a lending agent and if a beneficial owner is not using a lending agent the believes that it would likely enter into a written agreement with a reporting agent based on the number of investment companies that do not employ a lending agent which is based upon an sec review of form n cen reports filed the sec estimates that there would be 278 lenders that would not employ a lending agent of these 278 lenders the sec estimates that one half or 139 lenders will provide information to a reporting agent and the remaining 139 lenders would not rely on a reporting agent to provide the 10c 1 information to an rnsa self providing lenders the sec s estimates do not indicate the number of investment company complexes in its estimates or whether it anticipates that there are other types of institutional investors that do not employ a lending agent investment advisers and institutional investors that anticipate being a self providing lender under the rule may want to examine and comment upon the sec estimated costs of capturing and providing 10c 1 information to an rnsa similarly lenders not using a lending agent that anticipate entering into a written agreement with a reporting agent may wish to examine and comment on the sec estimated costs of capturing and providing 10c 1 information to a reporting agent comment deadline the release states that comments should be submitted to the sec no later than january 7 2022 electronic submission of applications for orders under the advisers act and the 1940 act confidential treatment requests for filings on form 13f and form adv nr amendments to form 13f on november 4 2021 the sec issued a release containing proposed rule amendments the proposals that if adopted would require the filing of certain applications confidential treatment requests and forms to be filed electronically through the edgar system the principal changes that would be effected by the proposals are summarized below advisers act applications for orders currently an applicant seeking 1940 act relief submits its application electronically to the sec via edgar while an applicant seeking advisers act relief submits its application as well as a proposed notice of application in paper form the proposals would require filing on edgar of applications for an order under any section of the advisers act thus the proposals would harmonize the requirements for submitting applications for orders under the advisers act with the requirements applicable to 1940 act applications these changes would allow for applications under both the 1940 act and the advisers act to be made in a single filing the proposals also would eliminate the requirements applicable to advisers act applications i to have verifications of applications and statements of facts notarized and ii that applicants include proposed notices as exhibits to applications confidential treatment requests the proposals would require electronic filing of confidential treatment requests for filings made under section 13 f of the exchange act each a ctr through the edgar system as a separate non public filing this would replace existing practice whereunder ctrs are submitted to the sec in paper typically through the mail or by express delivery the proposals state that the sec staff would work to design controls and systems for the handling of ctrs and associated confidential data form 13f changes the proposals re propose certain amendments to form 13f that the sec proposed in july 2020 specifically the proposals would i require each form 13f filer each a manager to include its crd number and sec file number if any ii modify an instruction within form 13f s confidential treatment instructions requiring the manager to demonstrate that the information is customarily and actually kept private by the manager and that failure to grant the ctr would be likely to harm the manager7 and iii modify the form 13f summary page to add a requirement for a manager seeking confidential treatment to indicate that fact on the summary page the sec is not re proposing the amendments to raise the reporting thresholds for form 13f that it proposed in july 2020 8 form adv nr the proposals would require the electronic submission of form adv nr by non resident general partners and non resident managing agents of investment advisers domestic or non resident form adv nr is filed with or in connection with an adviser s initial form adv submission and requires a non resident general partner or managing agent of an investment adviser to appoint an agent for service of process in the u s currently form adv nr must be filed as a paper filing submission the proposals would require these form adv nr filings to be made through the iard system comment deadline comments on the proposals must be received by the sec no later than december 20 2021 regulatory priorities corner the following brief updates exemplify certain trends and areas of current focus of relevant regulatory authorities sec issues risk alert regarding advisers that provide electronic investment advice on november 9 2021 the sec division of examinations the de published a risk alert the risk alert to raise awareness of compliance issues the de staff observed while conducting examinations of advisers providing or claiming to provide robo advisory services including advisers that operate recommend or sponsor discretionary investment advisory programs the de staff examined advisers that provide their investment advisory services online by mobile applications or both robo advisers that i provided robo advisory services to employer sponsored retirement plans retirement plans and or retail investors including retirement plan participants ii sold or licensed or otherwise granted interactive digital platform access to third parties such as advisers broker dealers and banks and or iii provided advisory or sub advisory services to an interactive digital investment platform the de staff also examined robo advisers that were relying on advisers act rule 203a 2 e the internet adviser exemption and 1940 act rule 3a 4 the safe harbor from the definition of investment company the risk alert states that nearly all of the examined advisers received a deficiency letter with observations most often noted in the areas of i compliance programs including policies procedures and testing ii portfolio management including but not limited to an adviser s fiduciary obligation to provide advice that is in each client s best interest and iii marketing performance advertising including misleading statements and missing or inadequate disclosure the risk alert also details de staff observations regarding commendable compliance practices by robo advisers and ways to improve compliance tailored policies and procedures the risk alert suggests that advisers can improve compliance by adopting implementing and following written policies and procedures that are tailored to the adviser s practices in particular the risk alert stated that advisers with compliance programs that appeared to be adequate and effective were not cited for deficiencies related to i portfolio management e g best interest advice best execution and practices being inconsistent with disclosures ii custody and iii required books and records moreover the risk alert states that such advisers also rarely had deficiencies related to marketing performance advertising or billing practices the risk alert suggests that advisers can improve compliance by adopting implementing and following written policies and procedures that are tailored to the adviser s practices in particular the risk alert stated that advisers with compliance programs that appeared to be adequate and effective were not cited for deficiencies related to i portfolio management e g best interest advice best execution and practices being inconsistent with disclosures ii custody and iii required books and records moreover the risk alert states that such advisers also rarely had deficiencies related to marketing performance advertising or billing practices testing algorithms periodically to ensure that they are operating as expected the risk alert states that where algorithm related testing was performed at least quarterly the de staff observed the following practices testing was performed by the advisers algorithm developers but rarely in isolation most testing included one or more other groups in their testing process such as portfolio management compliance internal audit and information technology it staff where compliance was included in the testing process compliance staff performed independent testing and also relied on work performed by others use of exception reports or other reporting mechanisms reports often were reviewed by algorithm developers and compliance staff but many robo adviser firms also had portfolio management staff and or it staff review them the risk alert states that where algorithm related testing was performed at least quarterly the de staff observed the following practices safeguarding algorithms the risk alert

forget the partridge and the pear tree that s so 12th day of christmas it s the 13th day one has to worry about while cats christmas tree fetishes are well documented on the internet one pair of fascinated felines likely saved a south african family from a very dark holiday indeed a few hours after rob and marcela wild decorated their christmas tree they noticed their cats staring intently at the branches this is normal kitty behavior around christmastime but you never know boomslang snake the cats were peering into the tree and my wife said there s probably a mouse in there somewhere rob wild a british stock market trader told cnn when they investigated further they realized their crafty kitties may well have averted disaster tucked among the baubles and tinsel adorning the artificial tree was a snake this was no cute appearance on a par with last year s adorable owl in the rockefeller center christmas tree in new york city nor was it the cuddly koala that an australian family inadvertently hosted this was a boomslang one of the most venomous snakes in africa i didn t know what it was at the time but then i googled what snakes are in our area and it came up immediately as a boomslang rob wild 55 told cnn i thought holy moses this is the king of all poisonous snakes they immediately called snake catcher gerrie heyns who was able to get there an hour or two later he said the snake a female was between four and five feet long he almost didn t go he told cnn at first sight of the photos they sent with their request for assistance he thought he was being pranked but after rob wild followed up with a phone call heyns realized it was true i received a call for a snake in someone s home on a farm heyns wrote on facebook they sent me two photos and i couldn t believe my eyes yes boomslang in their christmas tree boomslang is afrikaans for tree snake according to the south african national biodiversity institute the reptile is known as shy biting only when threatened its nip can be deadly as the venom is a hemotoxin which destroys red blood cells disrupts the clotting mechanism and often damages organs and tissue the venom is so potent that even a scratch could cause serious symptoms the biodiversity institute said on its website the snake s haemotoxic venom is slow acting and may take 24 48 hours to produce serious symptoms symptoms include internal and external bleeding headaches nausea sleepiness and mental disorders antivenom can treat the bite but one has to know they ve been mortally wounded and that isn t always apparent mcgill university s office for science and society said on its website perhaps what is most surprising is that this venom has the ability to make the victim bleed from every possible orifice mcgill said it is not uncommon for blood to seep out of the victim from the gums nostrils urine saliva stools vomit and even through the tiniest of cuts this is extremely unfortunate because the victim will continue to bleed until death and death from internal bleeding is a slow and lingering process that can take anywhere from three to five days none of that happened to the wilds though once the snake was caught it did jazz up christmas a bit in the wild household once i had it under control the family came right up to see the snake heyns told cnn it didn t try to bite or be defensive because i gave it no reason to a scary moment turned into an exciting moment for the children

established around 1816 today s dorset union store is an extraordinary food and shopping experience enjoyed by both residents and visitors its past is worth noting as vermonters have a special relationship filled with respect and admiration with our general stores especially those that have lasted for more than 200 years the role played by vermont s general stores is perhaps more relevant

the federal reserve in washington dc the consumer price index in the united states rose 6 8 percent year on year in november the highest year on year increase since june 1982 according to us labor department data the record inflation rate has not had any consequences so far despite the intraday plunge in the dollar index and treasury yields on the day the data were released stocks ended the week on a strong note with the s p 500 gaining 1 percent on friday to make a 3 8 percent weekly gain and the nasdaq composite index gaining 0 7 percent for a 3 6 percent weekly gain some analysts said that since the high inflation data did not exceed expectations related risks did not have much impact on the current market trend federal reserve chairman jerome powell s remarks at the end of november that inflation is not temporary and it is appropriate to end the asset purchase program a few months earlier can be seen as a warning for the us market the us authorities play down the crucial change in monetary policy from ultra loose to contractible diverting market attention to the timing and pace of rise in interest rate inflation is on the rise in the us and will continue until at least 2023 driven by strong demand rising wages and supply chain bottlenecks according to a recent survey of economists by the national association for business economics but the us authorities are wary of reining in inflation as the covid 19 pandemic veers out of control in the us the mishandling of interest rates will not only disrupt the us economic recovery due to monetary flooding but also put considerable downward pressure on the us stock market both the fed s guidance on inflation expectations and its repeated delays in tightening policy reflect the us authorities cautious approach to the capital market the us must taper its ultra loose policy to avoid runaway inflation and delay policy tightening as long as possible to avoid a stock market crash and economic downturn the market s reaction to inflation has been muted but the us public has felt the impact of rising inflation the joe biden administration is likely to ask the fed to raise interest rates if inflation drags on and threatens to affect midterm elections next year if this leads to a change in the pace of interest rate rises the risk induced should not be underestimated economic daily
listen to this article listen to this article bryanrenbaum the state s fiscal outlook appears to be very bright over the next two years even as the covid 19 pandemic continues to bring about considerable economic uncertainty bureau of revenue estimates director andrew schaufele said tuesday his remarks were made at a virtual board of revenue estimates bre meeting the three member board is comprised of comptroller peter franchot treasurer nancy kopp and budget secretary david brinkley kopp is stepping down on friday after nearly two decades as treasurer and will be succeeded by del dereck davis d prince george s and schuafele will soon vacate his current position to assume the office of deputy comptroller at tuesday s meeting the board unanimously voted to revise upwards by 1 billion the state s general fund revenue projections for fy 2022 and fy 2023 in the former year general fund revenues are projected to total about 22 billion which is about 495 million more than was projected in september in the latter year general fund revenues are expected to total about 23 billion which is about 543 million more than was projected in september the extra funds are the result of upticks in sales tax receipts and tobacco taxes as well as a federal stimulus i am very very bullish about the economy and our revenues in this two year picture schaufele said there is absolutely uncertainty there always is it is probably heightened right now because of the revenue on the high income earners but i think we should be quite bullish here he added schuafele said he anticipates the nationwide surge in inflation to be transitory and noted that inflation itself is not necessarily a bad thing for state budgets inflation can be directly positive for revenues even if inflation is going up which it is absolutely is that is boosting our revenues it is going to show in the sales tax it is going to show in the income tax but schaufele cautioned lawmakers not to go overboard in spending the extra funds we have to be careful also on the expenditure side it is probably going to creep slower into the expenditure side but just as revenues go up i would expect that everything that the state has been buying to go up as well it is not to say that we are going to have a ton more purchasing power it is something that needs to be monitored shaufele said investors should not be surprised if a stock market correction occurs in the near future given that stock prices are at an all time high schaufele said that although maryland s labor market has made a rapid recovery from its pandemic low last year the state is still about 91 000 jobs short of pre pandemic levels and that two thirds of the vacant jobs are in the hospitality sector franchot pointed out that although the state s economy is strong many marylanders who are on the lower end of the wage scale are still struggling we know that so many of our fellow marylanders and thousands of small businesses continue to struggle and still feel the economic consequences of this pandemic franchot proposed a one time payment of 2 000 for struggling marylanders as well as an aid package for small businesses that were shuttered during the early days of the pandemic kopp strongly emphasized that she too is concerned about rising economic inequality the difference between the impact on the top 1 the middle and the lowest is just painfully dramatic and while the federal infusion of funds did help very significantly those who needed the help that money can run through very quickly people need money for rent and for daily living and i do think that we have an obligation as a community to try to narrow that gap it is not a good sign that the gap is growing

peak mine and 20km from argosy s tonopah lithium project it indicates that the geological and geochemical conditions present in fish lake valley are favourable for the formation of a lithium boron potassium in brine type deposit in early december 2021 ajm commenced an initial passive seismic survey and data collection program with two regions identified for data collection the passive seismic geophysical survey will assist in the definition of the subsurface lithology units including potential mineralised beds and conduit fault structures present within the fish lake valley basin it says ajm is also investigating the use of direct lithium extraction at fish lake valley a process which produces cheap high quality environmentally friendly lithium the company raised about 8 5m prior to

part strategy for increasing the firm s cash flow he aims to trim costs and to accelerate sales photo by chris roussakis bloomberg article content like so many entrepreneurs before them sébastien st louis and adam miron spent years trying just to keep their venture alive hexo the cannabis firm originally known as hydropothecary contemplated death in 2014 when it failed at first to secure a medical marijuana sales licence from health canada then again in 2016 when a promised purchase by canadian cannabis corp never materialized faced with not being able to make payroll the founders sent out pleas to dr michael munzar an early investor and rajan govindarajan a relative of miron s hexo staff accepted 50 per cent pay cuts to stretch out the day of reckoning we apologize but this video

julie beun and published earlier this year article content in 2017 after achieving a stock listing on the tsx venture exchange hexo was nearly felled by a product recall st louis kept pushing the envelope and the company s attendant risks he returned to the stock markets again and again for funds to finance hexo s aggressive expansion after the federal liberals signalled they would legalize recreational marijuana author beun recounts a revealing moment in june 2019 when st louis is piloting his 200 000 powerboat near his cottage on lac mcgregor north of gatineau to really make a difference globally we need to be a fortune 500 corporation st louis is saying we need to stay at the helm accelerate and keep driving hexo becoming a 5 billion or 10 billion company is happening with or without us fast forward to dec 14 when hexo under new management unveiled plans to once more stave off imminent disaster on the plus side new ceo scott cooper noted the company posted net revenues of 50 2 million for the first fiscal quarter ended oct 31 for a year over gain of 70 per cent yes much of the growth was contributed by newly acquired firms but it nevertheless represented a solid base advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content on the other hand there was plenty of evidence of hexo s financial distress a condition that owed much to st louis s unfulfilled ambition before he stepped down as ceo on oct 18 st louis had orchestrated the acquisitions of three cannabis firms zenabis global 48north cannabis and niagara region based redecan with the goal of making hexo a dominant force in the industry the company s first quarter results bore the scars the operating loss 155 million included 24 million in expenses related to getting those deals done and 51 million in impairment charges for facilities no longer needed more worrisome is the impact of the debt incurred unlike its smiths falls rival canopy growth which in 2018 secured a 5 billion equity investment from beer wine and spirits giant constellation brands hexo lacked a significant cash buffer to pay for its acquisitions hexo relied on debt and issuing company shares to close the deal with redecan earlier this year hexo shelled out 400 million in cash and nearly 70 million shares worth an estimated 214 million hexo raised the cash by issuing debt that is convertible into shares at a future date advertisement 4 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content however the owners of that debt have the right to insist on monthly redemptions in cash if hexo does not meet certain conditions such as keeping its share price on new york s nasdaq exchange above us 1 50 hexo shares closed tuesday below us 0 90 the company s auditor pwc warned that the potential cash redemptions combined with other demands on the company s cash resources meant there was substantial doubt about hexo s ability to continue as a going concern pwc did not mean this was a certainty merely that if hexo did nothing to address its financial weakness it could fail cooper on tuesday unveiled his plan for relieving the financial pressure the first part involves trying to renegotiate or pay down some of the company s debt something that could involve issuing even more shares investors won t be happy with that considering hexo s share count exploded from 153 million to 356 million between july 31 and dec 14 on the other hand if further share dilution can save the company that may be a price worth paying cooper also detailed what amounts to a two part strategy for increasing the firm s cash flow he aims to trim costs and to accelerate sales advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content the first is to be accomplished by streamlining hexo s organization cooper says there are too many overlapping jobs in the wake of the acquisitions and excess facilities hexo is already closing operations in stellarton n s kirkland lake and brantford it is examining other potential cuts too the second part of the strategy is be accomplished by dropping less profitable products and doubling down on popular product lines such as pre rolled marijuana joints the company on tuesday suggested it could achieve positive earnings in the current quarter after excluding non cash items such as amortization and depreciation if it does that will certainly help but hexo is obviously a long long way from the 5 billion a year colossus forecast by st louis and as for that billion dollar start up yes hexo briefly ascended above 2 billion in market value during the height of cannabis mania on tuesday its shares on the tse were worth less than 350 million when the founders started out in 2013 that would have been beyond their wildest dreams now it is the basis for someone else s potential comeback article content share this article in your social network read next latest national stories
