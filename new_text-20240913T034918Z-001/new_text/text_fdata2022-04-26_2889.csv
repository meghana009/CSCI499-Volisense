when cryptocurrency is the consideration to be paid on a contract and the contract is breached how should a court calculate damages that was the issue confronted by judge wallace in a case of first impression in diamond fortress technologies inc v everid inc c a no n21c 05 048 del super ct april 14 2022 the underlying case s facts are relatively simple everid sought to introduce a new cryptocurrency via an initial coin offering ico everid contracted with diamond fortress technologies to develop everid s cryptocurrency trading platform and mobile application the parties contract called for everid to pay coins in the newly issued cryptocurrency to diamond fortress technologies after services were rendered everid proceeded with its ico and began distributing its new cryptocurrency unfortunately everid failed to pay diamond fortress sued in delaware superior court everid never responded to the lawsuit or defended against diamond fortress claims the court entered a default judgment for diamond fortress finding everid repudiated the contract and was in total breach the court then held a damages hearing on the appropriate methodology and value source for reckoning a damages judgment the court recognized it was a case of first impression for the classification and valuation of cryptocurrency and the calculation of damages resulting from the breach of a cryptocurrency paid contract the court first grappled with the classification of cryptocurrencies are they a security investment contract a commodity a property or a currency the commodity futures trading commission treats cryptocurrencies as commodities the securities and exchange commission defines cryptocurrencies to be securities after analyzing current regulations proposed new regulations and the handful of decisions from across the country the court concluded that a cryptocurrency s characteristics at a given time best determine their classification at the ico stage cryptocurrencies are securities once the market matures they become commodities because diamond fortress services were directly linked to everid s ico the court concluded that everid s non payment involved a security the court then moved onto the question of damages as to the valuation source of cryptocurrencies the court found that coinmarketcap was the most reliable cryptocurrency valuation tool available to the court it found the media s use of coinmarketcap s valuations and congress identification of it as an appropriate publicly available website to be compelling next in the court s analysis was the amount of damages using the well established securities framework the court found diamond fortress damages to be the highest value within a reasonable time specifically the court found the measure of damages was the higher of 1 its value at the time of the conversion or 2 its highest intermediate value between notice of the conversion and a reasonable time thereafter during which could have been replaced citing other securities cases the court found that three months was a reasonable period to replace the cryptocurrency the highest value of everid s cryptocurrency during that three month period was 2 01 the court multiplied by the 12 500 000 in coins diamond fortress was supposed to receive to arrive at its 25 125 000 damages award the court also tacked on pre and post judgment interest key takeaways the court s distinction between security and commodity was vital if the court deemed everid coins a commodity the court likely would have concluded diamond fortress was entitled by contract to a delivery of the specific cryptocurrency according to coinmarketcap everid coins currently have a value of 016 that s the difference between receipt of coins worth 2 million and a 25 125 000 damages award parties wanting to receive cryptocurrency in exchange for services should go into a deal with eyes wide open absent a specific contractual provision stating otherwise if the work concerns an ico or similar early stage matter damages will be calculated similarly to a withheld security you ll get monetary damages calculated at the highest value within a reasonable time if it s post ico and after the cryptocurrency s market is mature damages will be in the form of specific performance and the non breaching party will receive the contracted for cryptocurrency cryptocurrency valuation can vary wildly from day to day let alone month to month in a single week in may 2021 bitcoin lost 53 of its value wiping out 1 trillion in market capitalization that begs the question of whether traditional valuation methodologies comparing publicly traded stocks with cryptocurrencies are fair or appropriate as this nascent area of the law develops it s worth monitoring whether securities concepts will continue to be applied to cryptocurrencies this case is a good example if a contract or deal calls for payment in cryptocurrency the parties should pay heightened attention to breach and damages provisions think through potential breach scenarios and negotiate how damages will be calculated in the event of such a breach be precise in how contractual damages are calculated if the parties have not specifically agreed on methodologies the courts will fall back on well worn damages principles that may or may not be appropriate the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances

after downgrading the risk level of many of the world s top destinations last week in conjunction with an overhaul of its travel assessments the us centers for disease control and prevention added just one location to its high risk category on monday the tiny caribbean island of saba a special municipality of the netherlands known for its rugged hiking terrain and having the world s shortest commercial runway was moved up to level 3 the level 3 high risk category is now the top rung in terms of risk level level 2 is considered moderate risk and level 1 is low risk saba had been at level 1 level 4 is now reserved only for special circumstances under the new system no destinations have been placed at level 4 so far the overhaul comes against a backdrop of us government agencies and the public continuing to react and adapt to an ever changing pandemic and sometimes in sharp disagreement last week a federal judge struck down the federal mask mandate for transportation that sent off a quick chain of reactions and the cdc has asked the department of justice to appeal in the meantime masks are largely optional for now on planes trains and public transportation some airports and transit systems have their own masking rules level 3 in the cdc s new system the level 3 high risk category applies to destinations that have had more than 100 cases per 100 000 residents in the past 28 days saba is hardly alone on this level however much of europe is still lodged there with the summer travel season not too far away on april 25 those popular nations included france germany greece ireland italy portugal spain united kingdom it s not just european favorites that find themselves at level 3 other popular travel spots around the world at high risk include brazil canada egypt malaysia mexico south korea thailand there are almost 120 destinations at level 3 this week a small drop from the previous week and accounting for just over half of roughly 235 places total monitored by the cdc the cdc advises that you be up to date with your covid 19 vaccines before traveling to a level 3 destination up to date includes not only the full initial vaccinations but any boosters for which you re eligible the cdc does not include the united states in its list of advisories but on its color coded map of the world the cdc had it at level 3 on monday level 2 destinations carrying the level 2 covid 19 moderate designation reported 50 to 100 covid 19 cases per 100 000 residents in the past 28 days four destinations were moved to this level on monday they are el salvador indonesia oman united arab emirates all four of these places had been at level 3 last week the cdc had only 13 destinations worldwide at the moderate risk level on monday you can view the cdc s risk levels for any global destination on its travel recommendations page in its broader travel guidance the cdc has recommended avoiding all international travel until you are fully vaccinated if you re concerned about a health situation not related to covid 19 check here level 1 to be in level 1 covid 19 low a destination must have 49 or fewer new cases per 100 000 residents over the past 28 days three destinations were added on april 25 armenia azerbaijan libya the drop was most impressive for libya which had been at high risk level 3 armenia and azerbaijan both in the mountainous caucasus region where asia and europe meet had been at level 2 this level is dominated by destinations in africa including kenya rwanda and senegal level 1 had about 55 entries total this week unknown finally there are destinations for which the cdc has an unknown risk because of a lack of information usually but not always these are small remote places or places with ongoing warfare or unrest there was one new entry to this category on monday the gambia a small nation in west africa attracting their fair share of visitors in this category are the azores cambodia and nicaragua the cdc advises against travel to these places precisely because the risks are unknown a medical expert weighs in on risk levels transmission rates are one guidepost for travelers personal risk calculations according to cnn medical analyst dr leana wen we ve moved into a phase in the pandemic where people need to make their own decisions based on their medical circumstances as well as their risk tolerance when it comes to contracting covid 19 said wen who is an emergency physician and professor of health policy and management at the george washington university milken institute school of public health there are other factors to weigh in addition to transmission rates according to wen another is what precautions are required and followed in the place that you re going and then the third is what are you planning to do once you re there are you planning to visit a lot of attractions and go to indoor bars that s very different from you re going somewhere where you re planning to lie on the beach all day and not interact with anyone else that s very different those are very different levels of risk vaccination is the most significant safety factor for travel since unvaccinated travelers are more likely to become ill and transmit covid 19 to others wen said and it s also important to consider what you would do if you end up testing positive away from home where will you stay and how easy will it be to get a test to return home the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
it s official elon musk is set to buy twitter the social media giant confirmed monday the tesla ceo and billionaire will acquire the company in a deal worth 44 billion once the deal is complete which is expected by this year twitter will become a privately held company free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated musk tweeted to his 84 million followers i also want to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans shares of twitter rose more than 5 in afternoon trading monday twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world its ceo parag agrawal said in a tweet deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important the deal comes nearly three months after musk started buying twitter shares with his stake growing from 5 to more than 9 and serious overtures that he wanted to control the social media platform musk s acquisition also comes nearly five months after founder and ceo jack dorsey stepped aside as ceo and named agrawal as his replacement late monday dorsey tweeted his approval of musk s taking over twitter saying he was happy that twitter will continue to serve the public conversation around the world while dorsey said in principle that he doesn t believe anyone should own or run twitter as the platform wants to be a public good at a protocol level not a company but in terms of twitter being an actual company dorsey said musk is the singular solution i trust and as well as musk s mission to extend the light of consciousness elon s goal of creating a platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is the right one this is also paraga s goal and why i chose him dorsey said thank you both for getting the company out of an impossible situation this is the right path i believe it with all my heart earlier monday musk tweeted i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means the tweet has received more than 1 4 million likes last week musk said he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter and had been continuing to negotiate with the company twitter under elon musk what twitter would look like if tesla and spacex billionaire ceo was running it exclusive asian women are shut out of leadership at america s top companies our data shows why inflation s impact this economist bucks conventional wisdom on curbing inflation his solution isn t easy musk has criticized how strictly twitter moderates content on its platform free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle he tweeted this month eventually musk scooped up that 9 stake in the company earlier this month which made him one of twitter s largest shareholders twitter responded by announcing plans to have musk join its board of directors that deal would have prevented musk from owning more than 14 9 of twitter s outstanding stock for as long as he s a board member and for 90 days after days later agrawal tweeted that musk had decided not to join the board musk then confirmed in a regulatory filing that he planned to acquire the company i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy musk said in the proposal however since making my investment i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form twitter needs to be transformed as a private company despite its cultural influence twitter with an estimated 416 million weekly users as of april 16 according to data ai a mobile data and analytics platform the platform has lagged behind social media rivals including the meta owned facebook and instagram snapchat and tiktok other experts have twitter at around 200 million users still far less than tiktok s 1 billion users according to backlinko com twitter s lag includes being behind rivals in several key metrics including monthly active users and the number of weekly app downloads globally data ai said twitter is a struggling company sara silver a business journalism professor at quinnipiac university said in a statement it lost money the last two years and was only profitable in two of the last five this contrasts sharply with facebook owner meta alphabet s google and other highly profitable social media platforms silver said twitter s board had no choice but to take musk s offer seriously with no profits twitter could not raise its stock price enough to satisfy investors this gives a hefty premium to shareholders of at least 35 percent over its price before the offer and despite all of musk s boasting about free speech and content moderation he may have an opportunity to monetize a good product said callie cox an analyst for etoro who has more than 25 000 twitter followers profitability is what twitter shareholders have been waiting for new leadership could provide new thoughts on how to improve and monetize the platform said cox who considers herself a power user on twitter and with such a high stake in the business he could be under more pressure to perform delete twitter here s a step by step guide to permanently remove your account will trump return to twitter it s been widely speculated that if musk got control of twitter and take the platform private he would reinstate the accounts of certain voices including former u s president donald trump but trump appears to be not interested i am not going on twitter i am going to stay on truth trump told fox news before musk s deal was announced i hope elon buys twitter because he ll make improvements to it and he is a good man but i am going to be staying on truth trump also told fox news he will begin truthing over the next week trump was suspended permanently not only from twitter but also from facebook instagram and snapchat following the capitol riot on jan 6 2021 twitter banned trump citing several of his tweets in connection to the deadly riot as inflammatory and warned of the risk of further incitement of violence meanwhile in the nation s capital white house press secretary jen psaki said monday that she would not comment on a specific transaction when asked about musk s purchase no matter who owns or runs twitter the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms the power they have over our everyday lives psaki said she said the president has long argued that tech platforms must be held accountable for harms they cause and supports reforms to section 230 the law that undergirds much of how social media operates in the u s and new antitrust reforms to require more transparency psaki declined to say whether the white house has concerns about whether twitter under musk s leadership could reinstate trump s twitter access or lead to the dissemination of more election disinformation at this point we don t have any sense of what the policies will look like she said however naacp president derrick johnson has a stern message for musk if he considers letting trump back on twitter do not allow 45 to return to the platform do not allow twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy johnson said in a statement sent to usa today protecting our democracy is of utmost importance especially as the midterm elections approach mr musk lives are at risk and so is american democracy and sen elizabeth warren d mass apparently agrees she tweeted monday that musk s acquisition of twitter is dangerous for our democracy even musk s space rival and fellow billionaire amazon and blue origin founder jeff bezos tweeted something interesting question did the chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square cox the etoro analyst said while she welcomes innovation as a woman on twitter she s also experienced a good deal of harassment and have colleagues who have even received death threats she hopes musk will be able to curtail that while one of twitter s strengths is the ability to curate looser content moderation could threaten the safety of minority demographics cox said ultimately a hostile platform could create a chilling effect on free speech which is the opposite scenario elon musk is angling for congressman jim jordan r ohio tweeted monday before musk s acquisition how crazy will the left go if they accept his bid jordan later tweeted after the deal free speech is making a comeback the house judiciary gop s twitter account echoed a similar sentiment elon twitter freedom congresswoman marjorie taylor greene r ga whose personal account was permanently banned from twitter for

get done within the next 24 hours if not sooner it all came down to no other bidders or white knights emerging in the mergers and acquisitions process and twitter s board back was against the wall

it s official elon musk is set to buy twitter the social media giant confirmed monday the tesla ceo and billionaire will acquire the company in a deal worth 44 billion once the deal is complete which is expected by this year twitter will become a privately held company free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated musk tweeted to his 84 million followers i also want to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans shares of twitter rose more than 5 in afternoon trading monday twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world its ceo parag agrawal said in a tweet deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important the deal comes nearly three months after musk started buying twitter shares with his stake growing from 5 to more than 9 and serious overtures that he wanted to control the social media platform musk s acquisition also comes nearly five months after founder and ceo jack dorsey stepped aside as ceo and named agrawal as his replacement late monday dorsey tweeted his approval of musk s taking over twitter saying he was happy that twitter will continue to serve the public conversation around the world while dorsey said in principle that he doesn t believe anyone should own or run twitter as the platform wants to be a public good at a protocol level not a company but in terms of twitter being an actual company dorsey said musk is the singular solution i trust and as well as musk s mission to extend the light of consciousness elon s goal of creating a platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is the right one this is also paraga s goal and why i chose him dorsey said thank you both for getting the company out of an impossible situation this is the right path i believe it with all my heart earlier monday musk tweeted i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means the tweet has received more than 1 4 million likes last week musk said he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter and had been continuing to negotiate with the company twitter under elon musk what twitter would look like if tesla and spacex billionaire ceo was running it exclusive asian women are shut out of leadership at america s top companies our data shows why inflation s impact this economist bucks conventional wisdom on curbing inflation his solution isn t easy musk has criticized how strictly twitter moderates content on its platform free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle he tweeted this month eventually musk scooped up that 9 stake in the company earlier this month which made him one of twitter s largest shareholders twitter responded by announcing plans to have musk join its board of directors that deal would have prevented musk from owning more than 14 9 of twitter s outstanding stock for as long as he s a board member and for 90 days after days later agrawal tweeted that musk had decided not to join the board musk then confirmed in a regulatory filing that he planned to acquire the company i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy musk said in the proposal however since making my investment i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form twitter needs to be transformed as a private company despite its cultural influence twitter with an estimated 416 million weekly users as of april 16 according to data ai a mobile data and analytics platform the platform has lagged behind social media rivals including the meta owned facebook and instagram snapchat and tiktok other experts have twitter at around 200 million users still far less than tiktok s 1 billion users according to backlinko com twitter s lag includes being behind rivals in several key metrics including monthly active users and the number of weekly app downloads globally data ai said twitter is a struggling company sara silver a business journalism professor at quinnipiac university said in a statement it lost money the last two years and was only profitable in two of the last five this contrasts sharply with facebook owner meta alphabet s google and other highly profitable social media platforms silver said twitter s board had no choice but to take musk s offer seriously with no profits twitter could not raise its stock price enough to satisfy investors this gives a hefty premium to shareholders of at least 35 percent over its price before the offer and despite all of musk s boasting about free speech and content moderation he may have an opportunity to monetize a good product said callie cox an analyst for etoro who has more than 25 000 twitter followers profitability is what twitter shareholders have been waiting for new leadership could provide new thoughts on how to improve and monetize the platform said cox who considers herself a power user on twitter and with such a high stake in the business he could be under more pressure to perform delete twitter here s a step by step guide to permanently remove your account will trump return to twitter it s been widely speculated that if musk got control of twitter and take the platform private he would reinstate the accounts of certain voices including former u s president donald trump but trump appears to be not interested i am not going on twitter i am going to stay on truth trump told fox news before musk s deal was announced i hope elon buys twitter because he ll make improvements to it and he is a good man but i am going to be staying on truth trump also told fox news he will begin truthing over the next week trump was suspended permanently not only from twitter but also from facebook instagram and snapchat following the capitol riot on jan 6 2021 twitter banned trump citing several of his tweets in connection to the deadly riot as inflammatory and warned of the risk of further incitement of violence meanwhile in the

sadeugra istock via getty images franceâ s emmanuel macron comfortably won another five year term as president this past weekend against far right candidate marine le pen but the election investors should be keeping their eye on what is happening next month in colombia on may 29 the south american country could elect its very first leftist president should gustavo petro receive a majority of the vote a runoff election could determine the final winner the former congressman and mayor of the capital city of bogotã petro is an unabashed admirer of u s senator bernie sanders a self proclaimed â democratic socialist â and hugo chã vez the hardline socialist president of venezuela from 1999 to 2013 when he died of cancer the two south american leaders were close friends in fact and petro reportedly attended chã vezâ s funeral but the alarming similarities donâ t end there chã vez and petro cut from the same cloth before entering politics both chã vez and petro were members of militant rebel groups as a candidate chã vez vowed to end the expansion of venezuelaâ s oil sector despite it sitting on the worldâ s largest proven reserves petro 61 similarly has promised to take an adversarial stance against the mining industry saying in 2018 that companies involved in oil and gas â will not find a friendly governmentâ if he becomes president this would devastate colombiaâ s economy crude oil represents about half of its total exports and around 10 of its national income that revenue could disappear overnight with no replacement to pick up the slack itâ s hard to imagine now but at the time of chã vezâ s election 23 years ago venezuela was the worldâ s fifth largest crude producer and the top exporter of petroleum products to the u s today under the nicolã s maduro regime its oil industry is practically nonexistent in january the country produced an estimated 668 000 barrels per day bpd a far cry from the 3 5 million bpd it regularly produced in 1998 you can see the tragic results below facing worsening violence hyperinflation and a poverty rate as high as 96 some 4 5 million venezuelans fled their country between 2015 and 2019 making them the worldâ s second largest refugee population at the time after syrians approximately half of these freedom seekers poured into neighboring colombia where about 4 of the population is now venezuelan born up from close to 0 just a few years earlier venezuelan population in colombia has surged since maduro took power heih population census a wolf in sheepâ s clothing as former u k prime minister margaret thatcher once quipped â the trouble with socialism is that eventually you run out of other peopleâ s money â venezuelans have learned this lesson the hard way and it troubles me that voters in colombia who have witnessed the influx of refugees fleeing poverty might now elect a man who would institute the very policies that led to such poverty investors are understandably worried and petroâ s advisers have been in damage control trying to ease their concerns earlier this month the candidate signed a document stating he wouldnâ t nationalize property if elected but as many have pointed out the document is not legally binding itâ s strictly political theater the same goes for petroâ s suggestion that colombia could mine bitcoin using waterfalls bitcoin is private property something for which petro a socialist has not shown much respect bitcoin and gold are incredibly undervalued i hope colombian voters make the right choice next month especially since authoritarianism is steadily making gains worldwide according to freedom house nearly 40 of the global population now live in countries without basic freedoms including financial freedoms thatâ s the highest proportion since 1997 itâ s these people who could benefit the most from bitcoin i believe as an open source decentralized digital asset bitcoin transcends borders and can bypass even the most restrictive currency controls allowing peer to peer remittances to be made for this reason and more venezuela has among the highest â cryptoâ adoption rates with some 3 million people or 10 3 of the population holding unspecified cryptocurrencies according to coinmarketcap other emerging countries with elevated inflation including sudan lebanon syria and turkey also report having comparatively high levels of crypto adoption forty percent of the worldâ s population is about 3 2 billion people meanwhile the 19 millionth bitcoin was mined earlier this month if you do the math that comes out to one bitcoin per 170 people living in repressive regimes having said that i believe bitcoin is incredibly undervalued at 40 000 i also believe gold is undervalued at 1 900 an ounce you can see the precious metalâ s true value when you price it in a currency thatâ s undergone astronomical inflation including the turkish lira had someone in turkey bought gold one year ago they would have seen it double in value as of today citizens of colombia who fear a petro presidency might want to consider picking up some gold coins or 24 karat gold jewelry gold priced in the turkish lira has doubled in the past 12 months wgc gold coins sales had their best quarter since 1999 gold had a solid first quarter for many of the same reasons as bitcoin namely high inflation and geopolitical risk the metalâ s price rose 8 in the first three months of the year its best quarter since the second quarter of 2020 inflows into gold backed etfs totaled 17 billion according to the world gold council wgc u s investors appeared to be most interested in physical gold however the u s mint recorded the second highest first quarter sales of gold american eagle coins on record following 1999â s first quarter sales when combined with american buffalo coins which were introduced in 2006 sales still came in second place demand for u s mint gold coins in the first quarter of 2022 was highest since 1999 u s mint wgc as always i recommend a 10 weighting in gold with 5 in physical gold and 5 in high quality gold mining stocks and etfs i believe a 1 to 2 weighting in bitcoin and ether also makes sense for more on bitcoin and ether watch the replay of my panel on crypto mining at the bitcoin 2022 conference by clicking here

the deal is expected to close sometime this year but shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter operates example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video washington twitter s acceptance of elon musk s roughly 44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire tesla ceo one step closer to owning the social media platform the deal is expected to close sometime this year but before that shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter does business before the deal is completed questions also remain about what exactly could change about the platform what could change for twitter users musk has not released an official list of changes but he has expressed interest in a number of updates musk has also suggested a need for long form tweets replying on a twitter thread my most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that twitter is way overdue for long form tweets perhaps most notably musk has blasted west coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech and in his most recent ted talk said that he would limit what twitter would moderate beyond what is required by the laws of the countries it operates in offer accepted now what the process is off to a good start for musk given that twitter s board has unanimously approved his offer and is recommending shareholders do the same upon announcing the deal monday twitter noted that the bid which represents a 38 premium to the company s closing stock price on april 1 is a substantial cash premium and would be the best path forward for twitter s stockholders when twitter s board adopted an anti takeover provision known as a poison pill just 10 days ago the move was widely seen as a telltale sign that the directors were gearing up to rebuff musk s opening offer or perhaps seek another suitor willing to pay more but the battleground shifted dramatically late last week when musk disclosed he had lined up 46 5 billion including 21 billion of his personal fortune to pay for the purchase musk said other investors could contribute to the financing the locked in financing not only underscored the seriousness of musk s pursuit but also appeared to open the door to other large twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the san francisco company the details of those conversations aren t known but musk could point to a more than 20 year history building and running several businesses most notably as the longtime ceo of tesla the electric car maker is currently valued at 1 trillion roughly 25 times more than twitter i think there is nothing better for twitter than elon musk buying it and ideally replacing the board and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue generating sources said john meyer a technology entrepreneur and investor musk has the track record that he can do the impossible it would be easy to see why other twitter shareholders might welcome a shake up as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment before musk disclosed his 9 stake in twitter earlier this month the shares were trading below 40 not that much more it its 26 price when twitter went public in november 2013 since then the tech driven nasdaq has more than tripled even after a recent downturn twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising google and facebook meanwhile tesla s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010 and after struggling to make money for more than a decade the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of 3 3 billion during the first three months of this year alone what happens next as is customary once a company agrees to be acquired the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren t any red flags that haven t come up via the company s public filings this step in the process isn t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal said angelo zino tech analyst at cfra he s acquiring this company not from a financial perspective zino said he s going to do what he wants with it and he s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company what say could regulators have last year twitter generated 5 billion in revenue with 2 8 billion from the u s and the rest earned overseas zino said the federal trade commission in the u s or the european commission in the eu are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed twitter buyout the main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry or whether it violates antitrust laws these reviews can take months or longer but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining or in the case of a single buyer whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry neither tesla nor musk s other company space exploration technologies or spacex are social media platforms so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal analysts said we do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with musk owning twitter wedbush analyst daniel ives wrote in a research note monday when do shareholders get to vote the deal is expected to close in 2022 subject to the approval of twitter shareholders twitter hasn t announced the timing of a shareholder vote though the company s annual meeting is set for may 25 which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders a company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover
it s official elon musk is set to buy twitter the social media giant confirmed monday the tesla ceo and billionaire will acquire the company in a deal worth 44 billion once the deal is complete which is expected by this year twitter will become a privately held company free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated musk tweeted to his 84 million followers i also want to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans shares of twitter rose more than 5 in afternoon trading monday twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world its ceo parag agrawal said in a tweet deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important the deal comes nearly three months after musk started buying twitter shares with his stake growing from 5 to more than 9 and serious overtures that he wanted to control the social media platform musk s acquisition also comes nearly five months after founder and ceo jack dorsey stepped aside as ceo and named agrawal as his replacement late monday dorsey tweeted his approval of musk s taking over twitter saying he was happy that twitter will continue to serve the public conversation around the world while dorsey said in principle that he doesn t believe anyone should own or run twitter as the platform wants to be a public good at a protocol level not a company but in terms of twitter being an actual company dorsey said musk is the singular solution i trust and as well as musk s mission to extend the light of consciousness elon s goal of creating a platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is the right one this is also paraga s goal and why i chose him dorsey said thank you both for getting the company out of an impossible situation this is the right path i believe it with all my heart earlier monday musk tweeted i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means the tweet has received more than 1 4 million likes last week musk said he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter and had been continuing to negotiate with the company twitter under elon musk what twitter would look like if tesla and spacex billionaire ceo was running it exclusive asian women are shut out of leadership at america s top companies our data shows why inflation s impact this economist bucks conventional wisdom on curbing inflation his solution isn t easy musk has criticized how strictly twitter moderates content on its platform free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle he tweeted this month eventually musk scooped up that 9 stake in the company earlier this month which made him one of twitter s largest shareholders twitter responded by announcing plans to have musk join its board of directors that deal would have prevented musk from owning more than 14 9 of twitter s outstanding stock for as long as he s a board member and for 90 days after days later agrawal tweeted that musk had decided not to join the board musk then confirmed in a regulatory filing that he planned to acquire the company i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy musk said in the proposal however since making my investment i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form twitter needs to be transformed as a private company despite its cultural influence twitter with an estimated 416 million weekly users as of april 16 according to data ai a mobile data and analytics platform the platform has lagged behind social media rivals including the meta owned facebook and instagram snapchat and tiktok other experts have twitter at around 200 million users still far less than tiktok s 1 billion users according to backlinko com twitter s lag includes being behind rivals in several key metrics including monthly active users and the number of weekly app downloads globally data ai said twitter is a struggling company sara silver a business journalism professor at quinnipiac university said in a statement it lost money the last two years and was only profitable in two of the last five this contrasts sharply with facebook owner meta alphabet s google and other highly profitable social media platforms silver said twitter s board had no choice but to take musk s offer seriously with no profits twitter could not raise its stock price enough to satisfy investors this gives a hefty premium to shareholders of at least 35 percent over its price before the offer and despite all of musk s boasting about free speech and content moderation he may have an opportunity to monetize a good product said callie cox an analyst for etoro who has more than 25 000 twitter followers profitability is what twitter shareholders have been waiting for new leadership could provide new thoughts on how to improve and monetize the platform said cox who considers herself a power user on twitter and with such a high stake in the business he could be under more pressure to perform delete twitter here s a step by step guide to permanently remove your account will trump return to twitter it s been widely speculated that if musk got control of twitter and take the platform private he would reinstate the accounts of certain voices including former u s president donald trump but trump appears to be not interested i am not going on twitter i am going to stay on truth trump told fox news before musk s deal was announced i hope elon buys twitter because he ll make improvements to it and he is a good man but i am going to be staying on truth trump also told fox news he will begin truthing over the next week trump was suspended permanently not only from twitter but also from facebook instagram and snapchat following the capitol riot on jan 6 2021 twitter banned trump citing several of his tweets in connection to the deadly riot as inflammatory and warned of the risk of further incitement of violence meanwhile in the nation s capital white house press secretary jen psaki said monday that she would not comment on a specific transaction when asked about musk s purchase no matter who owns or runs twitter the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms the power they have over our everyday lives psaki said she said the president has long argued that tech platforms must be held accountable for harms they cause and supports reforms to section 230 the law that undergirds much of how social media operates in the u s and new antitrust reforms to require more transparency psaki declined to say whether the white house has concerns about whether twitter under musk s leadership could reinstate trump s twitter access or lead to the dissemination of more election disinformation at this point we don t have any sense of what the policies will look like she said however naacp president derrick johnson has a stern message for musk if he considers letting trump back on twitter do not allow 45 to return to the platform do not allow twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy johnson said in a statement sent to usa today protecting our democracy is of utmost importance especially as the midterm elections approach mr musk lives are at risk and so is american democracy and sen elizabeth warren d mass apparently agrees she tweeted monday that musk s acquisition of twitter is dangerous for our democracy even musk s space rival and fellow billionaire amazon and blue origin founder jeff bezos tweeted something interesting question did the chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square cox the etoro analyst said while she welcomes innovation as a woman on twitter she s also experienced a good deal of harassment and have colleagues who have even received death threats she hopes musk will be able to curtail that while one of twitter s strengths is the ability to curate looser content moderation could threaten the safety of minority demographics cox said ultimately a hostile platform could create a chilling effect on free speech which is the opposite scenario elon musk is angling for congressman jim jordan r ohio tweeted monday before musk s acquisition how crazy will the left go if they accept his bid jordan later tweeted after the deal free speech is making a comeback the house judiciary gop s twitter account echoed a similar sentiment elon twitter freedom congresswoman marjorie taylor greene r ga whose personal account was permanently banned from twitter for repeatedly violating the platform s misinformation policy for her tweets about covid 19 said monday on her congressional twitter account that i should get my personal twitter account restored how will musk deal affect twitter users experts are still trying to figure out what musk actually wants to do with twitter wedbush securities analyst dan ives told usa today on monday thought that a deal would get done within the next 24 hours if not sooner it all came down to no other bidders or white knights emerging in the mergers and acquisitions process and twitter s board back was against the wall once musk detailed his 46 billion in financing last week to get pen to paper on this deal ives said we do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with musk owning twitter ives added that the twitter board bought some extra time with the poison pill but ultimately had to get to the negotiation table with musk to get this deal done as the clock struck midnight on twitter s history as a public company scott kessler global sector lead for technology media at third bridge said in a statement that it seems that major changes are ahead for twitter if musk succeeds but the specifics at this point are pretty lacking musk has tweeted about the importance of free speech and an edit button kessler added he wants people with big twitter followings to become more active on the platform he favors monetization through subscriptions versus advertising angelo carusone the president of media matters for america a politically left leaning nonprofit media watchdog group said in a statement that musk buying twitter would be a victory for disinformation and the people who peddle it carusone believes that musk could unleash a wave of toxicity and harassment and undo twitter s efforts to increase quality engagement and attempts to make the platform safer for users handing musk the reins to twitter will undoubtedly unleash the conspiracy theories that the platform has attempted to squelch and any attempt to use the platform for legitimate information sharing will be overshadowed by a toxic cesspool of misinformation carusone said he added the only thing worse than twitter re platforming the likes of donald trump and alex jones as well as reversing course in dealing with disinformation and extremists is the perverse pressure it ll create on other major social media platforms effectively igniting a race to the bottom contributing joseph garrison scott gleeson maria jimenez moya and the associated press

musk s free speech advocacy seems to apply mostly to his own speech or that of his fans and promoters when it comes to his employees free speech musk demonstrates little tolerance musk has repeatedly sought control over what journalists bloggers analysts and other researchers say about his businesses their products and himself tesla and spacex ceo elon musk the world s wealthiest person on paper is buying twitter the social media platform he has relied on for years to promote his interests and shape his public image free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated said mr musk in a statement when the deal was announced monday get tri state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox sign up for nbc new york newsletters musk has characterized himself as a first amendment and free speech advocate for years for example in defending himself in a defamation lawsuit after calling a critic a pedo guy musk won and to argue that the sec infringed on his rights in a settlement agreement they struck and revised after the agency charged him with securities fraud in 2018 starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint sorry to be a free speech absolutist elon musk elonmusk march 5 2022 but as the atlantic bloomberg and others have pointed out musk s free speech advocacy seems to apply mostly to his own speech or that of his fans and promoters techdirt argues that musk lacks a serious understanding of free speech and even less about content moderation workers speech when it comes to his employees free speech musk demonstrates little tolerance under his leadership when tesla has laid off employees it s asked them to sign separation agreements including a strong non disparagement clause with no end date these kinds of agreements are not uncommon in the industry but musk is far from a free speech absolutist here a copy of one such agreement from tesla shared with cnbc by a former employee laid off in 2018 who did not sign the agreement said you agree not to disparage tesla the company s products or the company s officers directors employees shareholders and agents affiliates and subsidiaries in any manner likely to be harmful to them or their business business reputation or personal reputation in the same document tesla required laid off employees to keep details about the separation agreement itself hidden other than from their own lawyer accountant or immediate family not even other workers the provisions of this agreement will be held in strictest confidence by you and will not be publicized or disclosed in any manner whatsoever the agreement said in particular and without limitation you agree not to disclose the terms of this agreement to any current or former company employee or contractor like most large companies tesla also requires workers to sign an arbitration agreement upon employment that means to speak freely in court where their speech will become part of a public record workers need to get an exemption from the arbitration agreement from a judge first under musk s leadership of tesla scores of workers have alleged racist sexist and other types of harassment discrimination and unsafe working conditions many have also alleged retaliation after they spoke out about problems these allegations have been in the spotlight recently because of a newly revealed probe by the eeoc and a lawsuit by the california civil rights agency but the company has a long track record in august 2018 a former tesla security employee karl hansen filed a complaint with the u s securities and exchange commission saying he was wrongfully terminated from his job as an investigator at the company s battery plant in sparks nevada after sounding the alarm about the theft of tens of millions of dollars worth of raw materials there tesla hid the theft from shareholders he alleged even though it represented a material amount of money to the automaker at the time in november 2020 former tesla employee stephen henkes said he was fired from his job at tesla on aug 3 2020 after raising safety concerns internally then filing formal complaints with government offices when the company failed to fix and communicate accurately with customers over what he said were unacceptable fire risks in the company s solar installations both the cpsc and sec are considering henkes complaints as evidence free press musk has repeatedly sought control over what journalists bloggers analysts and other researchers say about his businesses their products and himself memorably the tesla ceo berated and cut off an analyst on an earnings call in 2018 excuse me next next boring bonehead questions are not cool the ceo said after a question about his company s capital requirements the automaker had just posted its worst quarterly loss in its history musk later apologized for this and now sometimes skips speaking on tesla earnings calls musk and tesla have also asked reporters to sign ndas or show story drafts to the company to obtain approvals before publishing i was once invited to visit spacex s facility on kwajalein following interviews i was told elonmusk had to review all articles prior to publication i explained journalism doesn t work that way his current tweets come as no surprise sharon weinberger weinbergersa may 24 2018 he has brazenly called on followers to edit his biography on wikipedia just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane musk tweeted btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing he said his legions of followers obliged editing the page to de emphasize his investments just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing elon musk elonmusk december 22 2019 musk even takes umbrage with fan blogs when they write about tesla s shortcomings at his direction tesla stopped inviting some electrek staff to company events after the site which has evolved into more of an electric vehicle blog in recent years published a story with this headline tesla is charging owners 1 500 for hardware they already paid for the story was accurate if humiliating to musk because it addresses his company s failure in the race to deliver autonomous vehicle tech to long waiting customers customers speech musk and tesla have also sought not always successfully to silence customers for example tesla used to compel customers to sign agreements containing non disclosure clauses as a prerequisite to have their vehicles repaired in 2021 tesla asked customers to agree not to post critically to social media about fsd beta an experimental driver assistance software package that some tesla owners could test out using their own cars and unpaid time to do so in an agreement that tesla sent to drivers earlier this year for fsd beta access the company asked them to keep your experiences in the program confidential and not to share any information about this program with the public including by taking screenshots creating blog posts or posting to social media sites tesla named facebook instagram reddit tiktok snapchat and youtube as sites where owners should not share info about their use of fsd beta according to a copy of the full agreement obtained by cnbc musk later lifted tesla s terms for access to fsd beta saying nobody was obeying the agreement anyway but the practice caused a probe by the federal vehicle safety authority nhtsa given that nhtsa relies on reports from consumers as an important source of information in evaluating potential safety defects any agreement that may prevent or dissuade participants in the early access beta release program from reporting safety concerns to nhtsa is unacceptable nhsa wrote in a letter to tesla in october 2021 meanwhile in china tesla has sued customers who complained about safety issues with their cars and sued a social media influencer there for defamation the influencer xiaogang xuezhang posted a video demonstrating issues with tesla s and another automakers automated emergency braking systems redaction tesla and musk attorneys have also consistently filed confidential treatment requests for legal and business filings in the us among other things tesla sought to hide from the public view vehicle safety information that federal auto regulators sought from the company as a routine investigative practice and business information tesla used to apply for tax subsidies from the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority attorneys on behalf of tesla and musk have also tried to keep transcripts and videos of employee and executive testimony hidden in cases before the delaware chancery court and other courts free speech for me musk has certainly exercised free speech rights for himself and his companies recently he said spacex satellite internet service starlink would keep russian news sources online despite what musk said were calls to block these by un named governments amid putin s brutal invasion of ukraine starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint musk wrote sorry to be a free speech absolutist on the labor front musk is also fighting an administrative court ruling which said he must remove a tweet from his feed because it violates workers rights the tweet posted in 2018 said nothing stopping tesla team at our car plant from voting union could do so tmrw if they wanted but why pay union dues give up stock options for nothing at tesla musk has shirked the requirement to have a securities law expert pre approve some of his tweets before posting them despite the settlement agreement he struck with the sec after it charged him with civil securities fraud musk told lesley stahl in a 2018 interview that generally his tweets are not supervised even though a court had ordered him to have some of them pre approved by securities law compliance experts at tesla if they contained information likely to impact tesla s stock price during that interview he said hello first amendment free speech is fundamental assuming he truly believes that then musk s free speech absolutism is only aspirational but by controlling the social network musk can protect his ability to keep using twitter to promote his companies investments and himself as he wants to be seen

cars elon musk to buy twitter for 44b and take it private file tesla and spacex ceo elon musk arrives on the red carpet for the axel springer media award in berlin on dec 1 2020 hannibal hanschke pool photo via ap file the associated press elon musk reached an agreement to buy twitter for roughly 44 billion on monday promising a more lenient touch to policing content on the social media platform where he the world s richest person promotes his interests attacks critics and opines on a wide range of issues to more than 83 million followers the outspoken tesla ceo has said he wanted to own and privatize twitter because he thinks it s not living up to its potential as a platform for free speech musk said in a joint statement with twitter that he wants to make the service better than ever with new features while getting rid of automated spam accounts and making its algorithms open to the public to increase trust advertisement free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated the 50 year old musk said adding hearts stars and rocket emojis in a tweet that highlighted the statement the more hands off approach to content moderation that musk envisions has many users concerned that the platform will become more of a haven for disinformation hate speech and bullying something it has worked hard in recent years to mitigate wall street analysts said if he goes too far it could also alienate advertisers the deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 stake in the platform musk said last week that he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter putting pressure on the company s board to negotiate a deal twitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022 pending regulatory sign off and the approval of shareholders shares of twitter inc rose more than 5 monday to 51 70 per share on april 14 musk announced an offer to buy twitter for 54 20 per share while the stock is up sharply since musk made his offer it is well below the high of 77 per share it reached in february 2021 advertisement musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist but is also known for blocking or disparaging other twitter users who question or disagree with him in recent weeks he has proposed relaxing twitter content restrictions such as the rules that suspended former president donald trump s account while ridding the platform of fake spambot accounts and shifting away advertising as its primary revenue model musk believes he can increase revenue through subscriptions that give paying customers a better experience possibly even an ad free version of twitter asked during a recent ted interview if there are any limits to his notion of free speech musk said twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world beyond that he said he d be very reluctant to delete posts or permanently ban users who violate the company s rules it won t be perfect musk added but i think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible after the deal was announced the naacp released a statement urging musk not to allow trump the 45th president back onto the platform do not allow 45 to return to the platform the civil rights organization said in a statement do not allow twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy advertisement as both candidate and president trump made twitter a powerful megaphone for speaking directly to the public often using incendiary and divisive language on hot button issues he was permanently banned from the service in the aftermath of the jan 6 storming of the capitol advertisers currently twitter s main customers have also pushed for the stronger content rules musk has criticized keeping them happy requires moderation limiting hate speech so that brands aren t trying to promote their products next to calls for genocide said siva vaidhyanathan a media studies professor at the university of virginia if musk either fires or drives away the team at twitter that s committed to keeping it clean and making it less hate filled he ll see an immediate drop in user activity said vaidhyanathan i think he s going to find pretty fast that inviting the bigots back in is bad for business some users said monday that they were planning to quit the platform if musk took it over to which he responded on twitter i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means musk has also run into trouble with federal officials as a result of his own tweets some of which he s used to taunt regulators at the securities and exchange commission in one august 2018 tweet for instance musk asserted that he had the funding to take tesla private for 420 a share although a court has ruled that it wasn t true that led to an sec investigation that musk is still fighting more recently musk appeared to have violated sec rules that required him to disclose that he d acquired a 5 stake in twitter instead he waited until he had more than 9 experts say these issues aren t likely to affect his twitter acquisition advertisement while twitter s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as facebook and tiktok the service is popular with celebrities world leaders journalists and intellectuals musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts last week he said in sec documents that the money would come from morgan stanley and other banks some of it secured by his huge stake in tesla the electric vehicle company he runs musk has a fortune of nearly 268 billion much of which is tied up in tesla stock and spacex his privately held space company it s unclear how much cash musk holds musk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold zip2 an online mapping and business directory to compaq for 307 million he used his share to create what would become paypal an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly it was sold to ebay for 1 5 billion in 2002 that same year musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex after finding that cost constraints were limiting nasa s interplanetary travel the company eventually developed cost effective reusable rockets in 2004 musk was courted to invest in tesla then a startup trying to build an electric car eventually he became ceo and led the company to astronomical success as the world s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles musk s pledge to make twitter a haven for free speech could dim the appeal of donald trump s troubled truth social app which the former president has touted as a competitor to twitter that would cater to conservatives truth social is part of trump s new media company which has agreed to be taken public by digital world acquisition corp shares of dwac dropped 16 2 monday and are down 46 since musk

billionaire elon musk has reached an agreement to acquire twitter for approximately 44 billion the company said the outspoken tesla ceo the world s wealthiest person has said he wants to buy twitter because he thinks it s not living up to its potential as a platform for free speech he says it needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with users and do better at serving what he calls the societal imperative of free speech twitter said it will become a privately held company after the sale is closed twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world its ceo parag agrawal said in a tweet deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important musk describes himself as a free speech absolutist although he hasn t been exactly clear what he means by that in a recent ted interview the billionaire said he d like to see twitter err on the side of allowing speech instead of moderating it he said he d be very reluctant to delete tweets and would generally be cautious about permanent bans he also acknowledged that twitter would have to abide by national laws governing speech in markets around the world musk himself though regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and has used the platform to bully reporters who have written critical articles about him or his company twitter s board at first enacted an anti takeover measure known as a poison pill that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive but when musk outlined the financial commitments he d lined up to back his offer of 46 5 billion and no other bidders emerged the board opened negotiations with him this is a breaking news update ap s earlier story follows below elon musk s bid to buy twitter is gaining steam and could be announced as early as monday according to media reports about the social media company s late stage negotiations with the tesla ceo who has offered more than 40 billion to privatize the platform and pledged to be more lenient when it comes to policing users speech twitter and musk spoke sunday and into the early hours monday the new york times reported less than two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 percent stake in the platform that he uses to promote his interests attack critics and opine on social and economic issues to his more than 83 million followers musk said last week that he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter putting pressure on the company s board to negotiate a deal musk hasn t commented on the negotiations but on monday waded into the buzz about them on twitter where some users are promising to quit the platform if he takes over i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means he tweeted musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist but is also known for blocking or disparaging other twitter users who question or disagree with him in recent weeks he has voiced a number of proposed changes for the company from relaxing its content restrictions such as the rules that suspended former president donald trump s account to ridding the platform of fake and automated accounts and shifting away from its advertising based revenue model twitter s board has flexibility in judging musk s proposal not just on the finances but also the specifics of his business plan and how it could affect users advertisers and employees some of whom might leave said kevin kaiser a finance professor at the wharton school at the university of pennsylvania what s critical for the board is whether they think it s in the best interest of the company kaiser said that can come from many many factors kaiser said the board could decide that musk s plan has too many negative impacts but that would be a hard case to make given how much musk is offering to pay asked during a recent ted talk if there are any limits to his notion of free speech musk said twitter or any forum is obviously bound by the laws of the country that it operates in so obviously there are some limitations on free speech in the us and of course twitter would have to abide by those rules beyond that though he said he d be very reluctant to delete things and in general be cautious about permanent bans it won t be perfect musk added but i think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible twitter had initially enacted an anti takeover measure known as a poison pill that could make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive but the board decided to negotiate after musk updated his proposal last week to show he had secured financing according to the wall street journal which was first to report the negotiations were underway a rival bidder to musk may not be stepping up any time soon fearful of the byzantine task of moderating content on the platform something that musk has vowed to do less of the twitter board could not find a white knight and with musk s financing detailed the clock has essentially struck midnight for the board which is why negotiations have begun to get a deal done said dan ives who follows twitter for wedbush securities the times citing people with knowledge of the situation who it did not identify said the two sides were discussing details including a timeline and fees if an agreement was signed and then fell apart the people said the situation was fluid and fast moving while twitter s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as facebook and tiktok the service is popular with celebrities world leaders journalists and intellectuals musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts shares of twitter inc rose 5 monday to 51 50 per share on april 14 musk announced an offer to buy the social media platform for 54 20 per share or about 43 billion but did not say at the time how he would finance the acquisition last week he said in documents filed with u s securities regulators that the money would come from morgan stanley and other banks some of it secured by his huge stake in tesla twitter has not commented musk is the world s wealthiest person according to forbes with a nearly 279 billion fortune but much of his money is tied up in tesla stock he owns about 17 of the electric car company according to factset which is valued at more than 1 trillion and spacex his privately held space company it s unclear how much cash musk has musk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold zip2 an online mapping and business directory to compaq for 307 million he used his share to create what would become paypal an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly it was sold to ebay for 1 5 billion in 2002 that same year musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex after finding that cost constraints were limiting nasa s interplanetary travel the company eventually developed cost effective reusable rockets in 2004 musk was courted to invest in tesla then a startup trying to build an electric car eventually he became ceo and led the company to astronomical success as the world s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles
it s official elon musk is set to buy twitter the social media giant confirmed monday the tesla ceo and billionaire will acquire the company in a deal worth 44 billion once the deal is complete which is expected by this year twitter will become a privately held company free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated musk tweeted to his 84 million followers i also want to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans shares of twitter rose more than 5 in afternoon trading monday twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world its ceo parag agrawal said in a tweet deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important the deal comes nearly three months after musk started buying twitter shares with his stake growing from 5 to more than 9 and serious overtures that he wanted to control the social media platform musk s acquisition also comes nearly five months after founder and ceo jack dorsey stepped aside as ceo and named agrawal as his replacement late monday dorsey tweeted his approval of musk s taking over twitter saying he was happy that twitter will continue to serve the public conversation around the world while dorsey said in principle that he doesn t believe anyone should own or run twitter as the platform wants to be a public good at a protocol level not a company but in terms of twitter being an actual company dorsey said musk is the singular solution i trust and as well as musk s mission to extend the light of consciousness elon s goal of creating a platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is the right one this is also paraga s goal and why i chose him dorsey said thank you both for getting the company out of an impossible situation this is the right path i believe it with all my heart earlier monday musk tweeted i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means the tweet has received more than 1 4 million likes last week musk said he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter and had been continuing to negotiate with the company twitter under elon musk what twitter would look like if tesla and spacex billionaire ceo was running it exclusive asian women are shut out of leadership at america s top companies our data shows why inflation s impact this economist bucks conventional wisdom on curbing inflation his solution isn t easy musk has criticized how strictly twitter moderates content on its platform free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle he tweeted this month eventually musk scooped up that 9 stake in the company earlier this month which made him one of twitter s largest shareholders twitter responded by announcing plans to have musk join its board of directors that deal would have prevented musk from owning more than 14 9 of twitter s outstanding stock for as long as he s a board member and for 90 days after days later agrawal tweeted that musk had decided not to join the board musk then confirmed in a regulatory filing that he planned to acquire the company i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy musk said in the proposal however since making my investment i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form twitter needs to be transformed as a private company despite its cultural influence twitter with an estimated 416 million weekly users as of april 16 according to data ai a mobile data and analytics platform the platform has lagged behind social media rivals including the meta owned facebook and instagram snapchat and tiktok other experts have twitter at around 200 million users still far less than tiktok s 1 billion users according to backlinko com twitter s lag includes being behind rivals in several key metrics including monthly active users and the number of weekly app downloads globally data ai said twitter is a struggling company sara silver a business journalism professor at quinnipiac university said in a statement it lost money the last two years and was only profitable in two of the last five this contrasts sharply with facebook owner meta alphabet s google and other highly profitable social media platforms silver said twitter s board had no choice but to take musk s offer seriously with no profits twitter could not raise its stock price enough to satisfy investors this gives a hefty premium to shareholders of at least 35 percent over its price before the offer and despite all of musk s boasting about free speech and content moderation he may have an opportunity to monetize a good product said callie cox an analyst for etoro who has more than 25 000 twitter followers profitability is what twitter shareholders have been waiting for new leadership could provide new thoughts on how to improve and monetize the platform said cox who considers herself a power user on twitter and with such a high stake in the business he could be under more pressure to perform delete twitter here s a step by step guide to permanently remove your account will trump return to twitter it s been widely speculated that if musk got control of twitter and take the platform private he would reinstate the accounts of certain voices including former u s president donald trump but trump appears to be not interested i am not going on twitter i am going to stay on truth trump told fox news before musk s deal was announced i hope elon buys twitter because he ll make improvements to it and he is a good man but i am going to be staying on truth trump also told fox news he will begin truthing over the next week trump was suspended permanently not only from twitter but also from facebook instagram and snapchat following the capitol riot on jan 6 2021 twitter banned trump citing several of his tweets in connection to the deadly riot as inflammatory and warned of the risk of further incitement of violence meanwhile in the nation s capital white house press secretary jen psaki said monday that she would not comment on a specific transaction when asked about musk s purchase no matter who owns or runs twitter the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms the power they have over our everyday lives psaki said she said the president has long argued that tech platforms must be held accountable for harms they cause and supports reforms to section 230 the law that undergirds much of how social media operates in the u s and new antitrust reforms to require more transparency psaki declined to say whether the white house has concerns about whether twitter under musk s leadership could reinstate trump s twitter access or lead to the dissemination of more election disinformation at this point we don t have any sense of what the policies will look like she said however naacp president derrick johnson has a stern message for musk if he considers letting trump back on twitter do not allow 45 to return to the platform do not allow twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy johnson said in a statement sent to usa today protecting our democracy is of utmost importance especially as the midterm elections approach mr musk lives are at risk and so is american democracy and sen elizabeth warren d mass apparently agrees she tweeted monday that musk s acquisition of twitter is dangerous for our democracy even musk s space rival and fellow billionaire amazon and blue origin founder jeff bezos tweeted something interesting question did the chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square cox the etoro analyst said while she welcomes innovation as a woman on twitter she s also experienced a good deal of harassment and have colleagues who have even received death threats she hopes musk will be able to curtail that while one of twitter s strengths is the ability to curate looser content moderation could threaten the safety of minority demographics cox said ultimately a hostile platform could create a chilling effect on free speech which is the opposite scenario elon musk is angling for congressman jim jordan r ohio tweeted monday before musk s acquisition how crazy will the left go if they accept his bid jordan later tweeted after the deal free speech is making a comeback the house judiciary gop s twitter account echoed a similar sentiment elon twitter freedom congresswoman marjorie taylor greene r ga whose personal account was permanently banned from twitter for repeatedly violating the platform s misinformation policy for her tweets about covid 19 said monday on her congressional twitter account that i should get my personal twitter account restored how will musk deal affect twitter users experts are still trying to figure out what musk actually wants to do with twitter wedbush securities analyst dan ives told usa today on monday thought that a deal would get done within the next 24 hours if not sooner it all came down to no other bidders or white knights emerging in the mergers and acquisitions process and twitter s board back was against the wall once musk detailed his 46 billion in financing last week to get pen to paper on this deal ives said we do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with musk owning twitter ives added that the twitter board bought some extra time with the poison pill but ultimately had to get to the negotiation table with musk to get this deal done as the clock struck midnight on twitter s history as a public company scott kessler global sector lead for technology media at third bridge said in a statement that it seems that major changes are ahead for twitter if musk succeeds but the specifics at this point are pretty lacking musk has tweeted about the importance of free speech and an edit button kessler added he wants people with big twitter followings to become more active on the platform he favors monetization through subscriptions versus advertising angelo carusone the president of media matters for america a politically left leaning nonprofit media watchdog group said in a statement that musk buying twitter would be a victory for disinformation and the people who peddle it carusone believes that musk could unleash a wave of toxicity and harassment and undo twitter s efforts to increase quality engagement and attempts to make the platform safer for users handing musk the reins to twitter will undoubtedly unleash the conspiracy theories that the platform has attempted to squelch and any attempt to use the platform for legitimate information sharing will be overshadowed by a toxic cesspool of misinformation carusone said he added the only thing worse than twitter re platforming the likes of donald trump and alex jones as well as reversing course in dealing with disinformation and extremists is the perverse pressure it ll create on other major social media platforms effectively igniting a race to the bottom contributing joseph garrison scott gleeson maria jimenez moya and the associated press

twitter s acceptance of elon musk s roughly 44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire tesla ceo one step closer to owning the social media platform the deal is expected to close sometime this year but before that shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter does business before the deal is completed offer accepted now what the process is off to a good start for musk given that twitter s board has unanimously approved his offer and is recommending shareholders do the same get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters upon announcing the deal monday twitter noted that the bid which represents a 38 premium to the company s closing stock price on april 1 is a substantial cash premium and would be the best path forward for twitter s stockholders when twitter s board adopted an anti takeover provision known as a poison pill just 10 days ago the move was widely seen as a telltale sign that the directors were gearing up to rebuff musk s opening offer or perhaps seek another suitor willing to pay more but the battleground shifted dramatically late last week when musk disclosed he had lined up 46 5 billion including 21 billion of his personal fortune to pay for the purchase musk said other investors could contribute to the financing the locked in financing not only underscored the seriousness of musk s pursuit but also appeared to open the door to other large twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the san francisco company the details of those conversations aren t known but musk could point to a more than 20 year history building and running several businesses most notably as the longtime ceo of tesla the electric car maker is currently valued at 1 trillion roughly 25 times more than twitter i think there is nothing better for twitter than elon musk buying it and ideally replacing the board and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue generating sources said john meyer a technology entrepreneur and investor musk has the track record that he can do the impossible it would be easy to see why other twitter shareholders might welcome a shake up as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment before musk disclosed his 9 stake in twitter earlier this month the shares were trading below 40 not that much more it its 26 price when twitter went public in november 2013 since then the tech driven nasdaq has more than tripled even after a recent downturn twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising google and facebook meanwhile tesla s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010 and after struggling to make money for more than a decade the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of 3 3 billion during the first three months of this year alone elon musk announced thursday morning that he wants to buy twitter what would his purchase of the social media platform mean for our society and what does it say about the growing power and influence of the billionaire class in our world what happens next as is customary once a company agrees to be acquired the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren t any red flags that haven t come up via the company s public filings this step in the process isn t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal said angelo zino tech analyst at cfra he s acquiring this company not from a financial perspective zino said he s going to do what he wants with it and he s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company what say could regulators have last year twitter generated 5 billion in revenue with 2 8 billion from the u s and the rest earned overseas zino said the federal trade commission in the u s or the european commission in the eu are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed twitter buyout the main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry or whether it violates antitrust laws these reviews can take months or longer but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining or in the case of a single buyer whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry neither tesla nor musk s other company space exploration technologies or spacex are social media platforms so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal analysts said we do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with musk owning twitter wedbush analyst daniel ives wrote in a research note monday white house press secretary jen psaki said president biden is concerned about the power of social media platforms but declined to comment specifically on elon musk s pending buyout of twitter when do shareholders get to vote the deal is expected to close in 2022 subject to the approval of twitter shareholders twitter hasn t announced the timing of a shareholder vote though the company s annual meeting is set for may 25 which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders a company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover

is buying twitter the social media platform he has relied on for years to promote his interests and shape his public image free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated said mr musk in a statement when the deal was announced monday get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters musk has characterized himself as a first amendment and free speech advocate for years for example in defending himself in a defamation lawsuit after calling a critic a pedo guy musk won and to argue that the sec infringed on his rights in a settlement agreement they struck and revised after the agency charged him with securities fraud in 2018 starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint sorry to be a free speech absolutist elon musk elonmusk march 5 2022 but as the atlantic bloomberg and others have pointed out musk s free speech advocacy seems to apply mostly to his own speech or that of his fans and promoters techdirt argues that musk lacks a serious understanding of free speech and even less about content moderation workers speech when it comes to his employees free speech musk demonstrates little tolerance under his leadership when tesla has laid off employees it s asked them to sign separation agreements including a strong non disparagement clause with no end date these kinds of agreements are not uncommon in the industry but musk is far from a free speech absolutist here a copy of one such agreement from tesla shared with cnbc by a former employee laid off in 2018 who did not sign the agreement said you agree not to disparage tesla the company s products or the company s officers directors employees shareholders and agents affiliates and subsidiaries in any manner likely to be harmful to them or their business business reputation or personal reputation in the same document tesla required laid off employees to keep details about the separation agreement itself hidden other than from their own lawyer accountant or immediate family not even other workers the provisions of this agreement will be held in strictest confidence by you and will not be publicized or disclosed in any manner whatsoever the agreement said in particular and without limitation you agree not to disclose the terms of this agreement to any current or former company employee or contractor like most large companies tesla also requires workers to sign an arbitration agreement upon employment that means to speak freely in court where their speech will become part of a public record workers need to get an exemption from the arbitration agreement from a judge first under musk s leadership of tesla scores of workers have alleged racist sexist and other types of harassment discrimination and unsafe working conditions many have also alleged retaliation after they spoke out about problems these allegations have been in the spotlight recently because of a newly revealed probe by the eeoc and a lawsuit by the california civil rights agency but the company has a long track record in august 2018 a former tesla security employee karl hansen filed a complaint with the u s securities and exchange commission saying he was wrongfully terminated from his job as an investigator at the company s battery plant in sparks nevada after sounding the alarm about the theft of tens of millions of dollars worth of raw materials there tesla hid the theft from shareholders he alleged even though it represented a material amount of money to the automaker at the time in november 2020 former tesla employee stephen henkes said he was fired from his job at tesla on aug 3 2020 after raising safety concerns internally then filing formal complaints with government offices when the company failed to fix and communicate accurately with customers over what he said were unacceptable fire risks in the company s solar installations both the cpsc and sec are considering henkes complaints as evidence free press musk has repeatedly sought control over what journalists bloggers analysts and other researchers say about his businesses their products and himself memorably the tesla ceo berated and cut off an analyst on an earnings call in 2018 excuse me next next boring bonehead questions are not cool the ceo said after a question about his company s capital requirements the automaker had just posted its worst quarterly loss in its history musk later apologized for this and now sometimes skips speaking on tesla earnings calls musk and tesla have also asked reporters to sign ndas or show story drafts to the company to obtain approvals before publishing i was once invited to visit spacex s facility on kwajalein following interviews i was told elonmusk had to review all articles prior to publication i explained journalism doesn t work that way his current tweets come as no surprise sharon weinberger weinbergersa may 24 2018 he has brazenly called on followers to edit his biography on wikipedia just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane musk tweeted btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing he said his legions of followers obliged editing the page to de emphasize his investments just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing elon musk elonmusk december 22 2019 musk even takes umbrage with fan blogs when they write about tesla s shortcomings at his direction tesla stopped inviting some electrek staff to company events after the site which has evolved into more of an electric vehicle blog in recent years published a story with this headline tesla is charging owners 1 500 for hardware they already paid for the story was accurate if humiliating to musk because it addresses his company s failure in the race to deliver autonomous vehicle tech to long waiting customers customers speech musk and tesla have also sought not always successfully to silence customers for example tesla used to compel customers to sign agreements containing non disclosure clauses as a prerequisite to have their vehicles repaired in 2021 tesla asked customers to agree not to post critically to social media about fsd beta an experimental driver assistance software package that some tesla owners could test out using their own cars and unpaid time to do so in an agreement that tesla sent to drivers earlier this year for fsd beta access the company asked them to keep your experiences in the program confidential and not to share any information about this program with the public including by taking screenshots creating blog posts or posting to social media sites tesla named facebook instagram reddit tiktok snapchat and youtube as sites where owners should not share info about their use of fsd beta according to a copy of the full agreement obtained by cnbc musk later lifted tesla s terms for access to fsd beta saying nobody was obeying the agreement anyway but the practice caused a probe by the federal vehicle safety authority nhtsa given that nhtsa relies on reports from consumers as an important source of information in evaluating potential safety defects any agreement that may prevent or dissuade participants in the early access beta release program from reporting safety concerns to nhtsa is unacceptable nhsa wrote in a letter to tesla in october 2021 meanwhile in china tesla has sued customers who complained about safety issues with their cars and sued a social media influencer there for defamation the influencer xiaogang xuezhang posted a video demonstrating issues with tesla s and another automakers automated emergency braking systems redaction tesla and musk attorneys have also consistently filed confidential treatment requests for legal and business filings in the us among other things tesla sought to hide from the public view vehicle safety information that federal auto regulators sought from the company as a routine investigative practice and business information tesla used to apply for tax subsidies from the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority attorneys on behalf of tesla and musk have also tried to keep transcripts and videos of employee and executive testimony hidden in cases before the delaware chancery court and other courts free speech for me musk has certainly exercised free speech rights for himself and his companies recently he said spacex satellite internet service starlink would keep russian news sources online despite what musk said were calls to block these by un named governments amid putin s brutal invasion of ukraine starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint musk wrote sorry to be a free speech absolutist on the labor front musk is also fighting an administrative court ruling which said he must remove a tweet from his feed because it violates workers rights the tweet posted in 2018 said nothing stopping tesla team at our car plant from voting union could do so tmrw if they wanted but why pay union dues give up stock options for nothing at tesla musk has shirked the requirement to have a securities law expert pre approve some of his tweets before posting them despite the settlement agreement he struck with the sec after it charged him with civil securities fraud musk told lesley stahl in a 2018 interview that generally his tweets are not supervised even though a court had ordered him to have some of them pre approved by securities law compliance experts at tesla if they contained information likely to impact tesla s stock price during that interview he said hello first amendment free speech is fundamental assuming he truly believes that then musk s free speech absolutism is only aspirational but by controlling the social network musk can protect his ability to keep using twitter to promote his companies investments and himself as he wants to be seen

billionaire elon musk has reached an agreement to acquire twitter for approximately 44 billion the company said the outspoken tesla ceo the world s wealthiest person has said he wants to buy twitter because he thinks it s not living up to its potential as a platform for free speech he says it needs to be transformed as a private company in order to build trust with users and do better at serving what he calls the societal imperative of free speech twitter said it will become a privately held company after the sale is closed twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world its ceo parag agrawal said in a tweet deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important musk describes himself as a free speech absolutist although he hasn t been exactly clear what he means by that musk himself though regularly blocks social media users who have criticized him or his company and has used the platform to bully reporters who have written critical articles about him or his company twitter s board at first enacted an anti takeover measure known as a poison pill that could have made a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive but when musk outlined the financial commitments he d lined up to back his offer of 46 5 billion and no other bidders emerged the board opened negotiations with him nj congresswoman criticizes deal u s rep bonnie watson coleman d n j 12th district reacted to the news by calling for a billionaire minimum income tax german chancellor olaf scholz dietmar woidke minister president of the state of brandenburg and elon musk tesla ceo from left attend the opening of the tesla factory berlin brandenburg in gruenheide germany tuesday march 22 2022 the first european factory in gr nheide designed for 500 000 vehicles per year is an important pillar of tesla s future strategy patrick pleul pool via ap asked during a recent ted talk if there are any limits to his notion of free speech musk said twitter or any forum is obviously bound by the laws of the country that it operates in so obviously there are some limitations on free speech in the us and of course twitter would have to abide by those rules beyond that though he said he d be very reluctant to delete things and in general be cautious about permanent bans it won t be perfect musk added but i think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible shares of twitter inc rose 5 monday to 51 50 per share on april 14 musk announced an offer to buy the social media platform for 54 20 per share or about 43 billion but did not say at the time how he would finance the acquisition last week he said in documents filed with u s securities regulators that the money would come from morgan stanley and other banks some of it secured by his huge stake in tesla tesla ceo elon musk attends the opening of the tesla factory berlin brandenburg in gruenheide germany tuesday march 22 2022 elon musk is taking a 9 2 stake in twitter musk purchased approximately 73 5 million shares according to a regulatory filing patrick pleul pool via ap file musk is the world s wealthiest person according to forbes with a nearly 279 billion fortune but much of his money is tied up in tesla stock he owns about 17 of the electric car company according to factset which is valued at more than 1 trillion and spacex his privately held space company it s unclear how much cash musk has musk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold zip2 an online mapping and business directory to compaq for 307 million he used his share to create what would become paypal an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly it was sold to ebay for 1 5 billion in 2002 that same year musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex after finding that cost constraints were limiting nasa s interplanetary travel the company eventually developed cost effective reusable rockets in 2004 musk was courted to invest in tesla then a startup trying to build an electric car eventually he became ceo and led the company to astronomical success as the world s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles inside scarlett johansson s 1 8m nyc penthouse take a look inside scarlett johansson s longtime new york city penthouse which she sold for 1 8 million unbelievably expensive divorces

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the deal is expected to close sometime this year but shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter operates washington twitter s acceptance of elon musk s roughly 44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire tesla ceo one step closer to owning the social media platform the deal is expected to close sometime this year but before that shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter does business before the deal is completed questions also remain about what exactly could change about the platform what could change for twitter users musk has not released an official list of changes but he has expressed interest in a number of updates musk has also suggested a need for long form tweets replying on a twitter thread my most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that twitter is way overdue for long form tweets perhaps most notably musk has blasted west coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech and in his most recent ted talk said that he would limit what twitter would moderate beyond what is required by the laws of the countries it operates in offer accepted now what the process is off to a good start for musk given that twitter s board has unanimously approved his offer and is recommending shareholders do the same upon announcing the deal monday twitter noted that the bid which represents a 38 premium to the company s closing stock price on april 1 is a substantial cash premium and would be the best path forward for twitter s stockholders when twitter s board adopted an anti takeover provision known as a poison pill just 10 days ago the move was widely seen as a telltale sign that the directors were gearing up to rebuff musk s opening offer or perhaps seek another suitor willing to pay more but the battleground shifted dramatically late last week when musk disclosed he had lined up 46 5 billion including 21 billion of his personal fortune to pay for the purchase musk said other investors could contribute to the financing the locked in financing not only underscored the seriousness of musk s pursuit but also appeared to open the door to other large twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the san francisco company the details of those conversations aren t known but musk could point to a more than 20 year history building and running several businesses most notably as the longtime ceo of tesla the electric car maker is currently valued at 1 trillion roughly 25 times more than twitter i think there is nothing better for twitter than elon musk buying it and ideally replacing the board and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue generating sources said john meyer a technology entrepreneur and investor musk has the track record that he can do the impossible it would be easy to see why other twitter shareholders might welcome a shake up as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment before musk disclosed his 9 stake in twitter earlier this month the shares were trading below 40 not that much more it its 26 price when twitter went public in november 2013 since then the tech driven nasdaq has more than tripled even after a recent downturn twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising google and facebook meanwhile tesla s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010 and after struggling to make money for more than a decade the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of 3 3 billion during the first three months of this year alone what happens next as is customary once a company agrees to be acquired the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren t any red flags that haven t come up via the company s public filings this step in the process isn t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal said angelo zino tech analyst at cfra he s acquiring this company not from a financial perspective zino said he s going to do what he wants with it and he s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company what say could regulators have last year twitter generated 5 billion in revenue with 2 8 billion from the u s and the rest earned overseas zino said the federal trade commission in the u s or the european commission in the eu are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed twitter buyout the main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry or whether it violates antitrust laws these reviews can take months or longer but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining or in the case of a single buyer whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry neither tesla nor musk s other company space exploration technologies or spacex are social media platforms so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal analysts said we do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with musk owning twitter wedbush analyst daniel ives wrote in a research note monday when do shareholders get to vote the deal is expected to close in 2022 subject to the approval of twitter shareholders twitter hasn t announced the timing of a shareholder vote though the company s annual meeting is set for may 25 which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders a company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover

cenntro successfully became a publicly traded company on nasdaq capital market through a stock purchase transaction with naked brand group making a significant milestone in cenntroâ s history that opened a new chapter for us at the closing of transaction the company concurrently divested the remainder of nakedâ s historic clothing business and has the more than 250 million cash on hand that can support production expansion and accelerate the future business growth our mission is to lead the transformation in the automotive industry and become a leader in the electric commercial vehicle sector providing electrical commercial vehicles from class 1 to class 4 mainly for use in urban delivery and urban services with that mission in mind we have developed vehicle models for each of our target markets in america europe and asia we are pleased to announce that we achieved improved operational performance for 2021 we had vehicle sales volume of 918 units representing growth of 29 8 from the previous year this is a testament to our capability for producing and selling a continuously growing number of electrical commercial vehicles despite the global supply chain crisis and the shipping disruption and the resulting material cost increases as demand for our vehicles remains very strong our priority is to overcome the challenges of the supply chain crisis ramping up the production to expand our market share we have made meaningful progress on this front to support target long term growth last month we completed a strategic acquisition of a 65 equity interest in tropos motors europe tme a wholly owned subsidiary of mosolf se and one of our largest channel partners the tme has a distribution network of 50 dealers in germany and the 13 importers in europe across 16 countries and also sales directly to major fleet operators we expect the acquisition will expand our european assembly capabilities with the tmeâ s facility in herne germany which will produce some of our vehicles that are targeted for the european market we believe the acquisition combined with our distribution effort in europe will address growing local markets need in the region in december we selected jacksonville florida for our new u s based manufacturing facility this 100 000 square foot facility is expected to be capable of assembling up to 10 000 vehicles per year once fully operational in addition we plan for further expansion to support additional vehicles and the launching battery packaging operations the site provides efficiency for materials logistics and also support the export needs of a finished vehicle for our partners and the customer network besides the two additional plants we are also planning to expanding our existing production capability through acquisition of additional production space in chongqing china currently we have three vehicle plants for production and assembly and we also outsource production and assembly of our new vehicles model to the third party oems as we scale up our production we hope the further increasing economies of scale will reduce material production costs having secured needed working capital from our stock purchasing transaction with naked brand group we intend to put a more effort to develop our network of distributors and service providers to strengthen our marketing and sales capabilities the acquisition of a 65 equity interest in tme has quickly increased our vehicle distribution capabilities in europe especially in germany we continue to develop new vehicle models to meet ever growing demand and to improve vehicle quality and add vehicle features that respond to our customer needs 2022 will be a challenging year for all the industry sectors given the backdrop of ongoing supply chain shortages the global economy the continuously evolving covid pandemic and associated regional lockdowns and the russia ukraine conflict we expect both the cost of logistics and the cost of materials of our critical components including steel and batteries to continue to increase while near term industrial condition are fluid our focus on leading commercial vehicle electrification remains strong we are building a global brand to address growing needs and we believe we currently have adequate cash to navigate the challenging environment looking ahead we believe we will maintain our solid growth to capture the vast demand for electric commercial vehicles as we strive to become a pioneer and a frontrunner in the automotive industry transformation now let me turn the call over to our cfo edmond cheng who will provide details on our 2021 financial performance edmond edmond cheng thank you peter thank you everyone for joining our call today i will now go over our key financial results for the year ended december 31 2021 for the full details of our financial results please refer to our earnings press release we are very delighted to have delivered record revenue and gross margin improvement led by increased vehicle sales and other service income the performance demonstrated our ability to manage an increased supply despite higher raw material and shipping costs additionally in support of further revenue growth we continue to step up sales and marketing efforts and boost production importantly with the closing of the stock purchase agreement with naked brand group we solidified our balance sheet with a strong cash position which gives us additional strength to fill our next phase of business development moving on to our results our net revenue for the year ended december 31 2021 was 8 6 million representing an increase of 57 1 over 2020 driven by growth in sales of our vehicles and other service income within that revenue in 2021 vehicle sales accounted for 85 with another 13 from other service income and the remainder from spare part sales geographically we generated 51 of our revenue from europe and 40 from united states with the remainder from asia and others compared to 2020 our cost of goods sold rose 44 7 to 7 1 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in the number of vehicles sold to our channel partners despite higher costs resulting from supply chain and logistics disruption we were able to improve our gross profit we were able to generate gross profit of 1 5 million up 163 7 from 0 6 million in the previous year in addition our gross margin was up 710 basis points year over year to 17 5 primarily driven by an increase in vehicle sales and an increase in service revenue meanwhile total operating expenses increased 60 3 to 18 million the increase is largely due to an increase in selling and marketing expenses due to higher freight costs and increases in general and administrative expenses relating to transaction expenses in connection with cenntroâ s combination with naked brand group and its proposed ipo and also on the expansion of its u s operations selling and marketing expenses rose 32 to 1 million general and administrative expenses increased 71 5 to 15 million and r d expenses were up 8 3 to 1 5 million in 2021 as a result net loss was 16 4 million compared with net loss of 5 2 million in 2020 adjusted ebitda after adding back non recurring expenses related to the combination with naked brand group and the proposed ipo was negative 7 million compared with negative 5 6 million in 2020 upon the completion of the stock purchase transaction with naked brand group we were able to enhance our balance sheet in 2021 laying a strong foundation for the expansion of our manufacturing capacity and product portfolio as of the end of december 2021 our cash cash equivalents and restricted cash were 261 1 million compared with 4 5 million a year earlier now let me turn the call back to our ceo peter wang for his closing remarks peter wang thanks edmond looking ahead we believe our strong financial position coupled with a robust product roadmap and an advanced technologies well positioning us to address this market of a broader perspective and driving higher revenue and profit level in long run while creating value for our shareholder we have made a strong progress against the backdrop of pervasive global and industry challenges we introduced the four new product lines we made a strategic acquisition and we are adding new capacities on three continents all of which have positioned us for growth and market share gains to that we like almost all other ev companies are concerned with the challenges in the global supply chain and in shipping sectors while we believe we can navigate these challenges we continue to exercise a strong degree of caution and continue to incorporate localization into our supply chain that concludes our prepared remarks letâ s now open the call for questions operator please go ahead question and answer session operator thank you our first question comes from the line of bruce chan of stifel your line is open bruce chan thank you operator and good afternoon to you peter edmond and marianne iâ m going to max out my three question allotment here if i may first one you stated in the release that december was your highest volume production month so far which i think is great news can you maybe help us to extrapolate that number to what 2022 production could look like and how thatâ s influenced by the china covid shutdowns the ukraine situation and the supply chain issues that you mentioned and i guess specifically what iâ m curious about is whether weâ re going to continue to see that 600 vehicle per month number and then how that changes once jacksonville comes fully on line peter wang okay thank you bruce yes in the last year 2021 the last month we produced 628 vehicles and due to the supply chain issue and others but of course so we have also encountered the shipping issues and this year weâ ll continue to dissuade and we will continue as weâ re adding our new product line adding our capacity so we are very confident weâ re going to maintain this pace but we also as the supply chain comes as especially very recently it happened and the chip supply and the battery is our main issue and also the shipping and the internal lockdown because most of our current supply chain is made in china so thatâ s hurting us a little bit and so we are going to maintain that and also in order to counter this thing so we have ordered three monthsâ battery for our shortened inventory and to co produce things and also weâ re going to as our jacksonville facility is operational we are going to pack our batteries in united states so thatâ s the thing so we still weâ re extremely cautious how weâ re going to deal with that weâ re prepared ourselves but at this moment we cannot give the number and how weâ re going to have them because the whole situation is still developing we really donâ t know bruce chan okay thatâ s really helpful and actually that was going to be my second question about the battery supply issues so thatâ s encouraging to hear so maybe jumping to the third question then and this one probably is for you edmond i noticed that you had a press release towards the end of the year talking about a change in your auditor just want to see whether there are any concerns or implications to read from that auditor change edmond cheng yes bruce marcum was previously our sec auditor for the cenntro group prior to the stock purchase transaction with the naked brand group in end of 2021 and due to the nature of the transaction the historical financial statements of the cenntro group became the financial statements of the company so with the audit committeeâ s approval we appointed marcum as our auditor for the sec purposes separately also the company is an australian public limited company it is required to file ifrs audit financial statements with the australian securities and investments commission for the purposes of the compliance with the australian law we appointed wis australia to conduct an audit under ifrs and file the required reports with australian authorities i wonder if i have answered your question bruce bruce chan you did that thatâ s very helpful i appreciate those answers and iâ ll jump back into queue for any additional questions operator thank you our next question comes from michael shlisky of d a davidson company your line is open michael shlisky hello good afternoon can you hear me okay peter wang yes michael shlisky great thank you just for having me on the call iâ ve got a couple of quick ones here maybe not so quick maybe if we first start off with talking about your current sales pipeline can you give us a sense as to the current selling environment are people unwilling to even speak with any ev companies given supply chain challenges are you seeing a lot of large orders versus like kind of one off smaller business orders give us a sense as to who you are selling to who you are talking with today and kind of how itâ s been going that couple of months given all the global issues that youâ ve been seeing peter wang okay hi michael so first of all overall the market demand for electrical commercial vehicle space remains very very strong in the europe and also in united states and especially the europe and japan there is very strong demand and the issue is not getting the order and is how we going to supply our product and with aftermarket support so thatâ s very very important so this year we spent so much time to develop our local distributor network and after sales network and also the spare parts supply so that is very good so for the customer we are right now we are targeting the mid tier and also the small business as our market targeted customer instead of big market fleet because those big fleets take time and also require nationwide after market support but we usually donâ t give the purchase indication and we only confirm the order knowing that we can deliver on time and we donâ t take and confirm any orders if we donâ t know exactly when we can deliver so currently we are not announcing any backlog of the orders we do have a lot of so called backlog the interest indication and in this moment we our key is to make sure we can deliver on time and to answer your question the demand is not an issue the order is not really the issue issueâ s how we can deliver the product with quality with time and with the aftermarket to support michael shlisky got it and it actually leads to my other question can you give us some sense as to how the 2021 vehicles that were delivered maybe how they performed relative to promised expectations as far as range as far as performance and this is going to be in the filing but can you give us any sense as to what the warranty experience has been on those produced and delivered vehicles so far here in 2022 peter wang so what do we do so we purposely build our vehicle which is targeted for urban delivery and urban services mostly they donâ t require long range but we have provided them a sufficient range for the daily use and we also because the nature of commercial vehicle you have to make sure that vehicle is operational 24 hours a day you donâ t want to stop it because it will hurt their business so we have to make sure that the aftermarket support capabilities there and also our warranty and in europe and the regulation requires minimum two years of warranty but actually we provide the warranty much longer than our competitors or our counterparts in europe for example the battery we provide a warranty for five years and also a five year or 100 000 kilometers or we also provide our powertrain our motor and controller with eight years warranty and with 200 000 kilometers so which one comes first and so we are very confident in our quality and so weâ ll provide that our warranty is longer or better than other competitors operator our next question comes from karl birkenfeld of american trust investment your question please karl birkenfeld okay great presentation thank you very much on the call there peter wang and edmond cheng the question i have is on the recent lockdowns of shanghai how will they affect the overall gross margins in 2022 peter wang yes okay so we this is it is very hard to see where this will ultimately go but it is hard not to see their continuation of the lockdown especially in china could have a big impact on the factories you as i touched many aspects of the shipping the supply chain shortage and we do not know how significant it might be since the situation is still developing there is a little we can do about besides we have placed the order of major parts and components for next three months so that in other words for next three months we should be okay if the situation is deteriorating because weâ re already warehousing the three months the key components so and also weâ re going to continue to develop a supply chain source in our local markets that means we are going to in near future we are going to pack our battery in jacksonville in our facility home facility now how thatâ s going to impact on us i think the impact is obvious just like anybody else we cannot avoid but at this moment at this situation and i think we should be able to implement our plan as we planned but we do have to be very cautious how theyâ re going to go and if the situation continues or deteriorated then we will see our gross margin going to be deteriorating a little bit and also we are going to see the revenue going to hurt because the shipping is very crucial for us because we are global supply right now we supply to europe we supply to the u s we supply to asia so the vehicle shipping is it will be the problem because how weâ re going to realize the effects not only on production production wise i donâ t see there were big impacts but the sales re realization it may be if the shipping situation continues to deteriorate and so i think in this moment and we cannot really project how the guidance will be and we will see how the monitor the situation karl birkenfeld okay well thank you that was a great answer as far as making the supply chain localized and i guess youâ re preparing for three months stock correct peter wang yes karl birkenfeld thatâ s great thatâ s a good solution thank you sir for answering my questions operator thank you our next question comes from bruce chan of stifel your line is open bruce chan all right i appreciate that double dip here and iâ m not sure if i missed this earlier on the call but i wanted to ask about capital allocation so you just wrapped up a major acquisition or majority purchase of tropos you mentioned that you still have about 250 million in dry powder on the balance sheet how are you thinking about priorities for capital here jacksonville is asset light and i assume fully funded at this point so are you going to be more focused on battery development or new model development distribution is m a still on the table for you peter wang edmond could you answer that edmond cheng yes bruce in the near future what weâ re looking at is there are two priorities that we are focusing on one priority we are focusing on is what peter has mentioned is to secure enough supplies so investing in needed inventory especially key parts and components is key for us so our first priority is to allocate enough money for securing our working capital thatâ s very important piece for the inventory another piece of it is although jacksonville is funded from that sense but we still need to look into a continuation of capex and also r d development from that sense in terms of new product development so those are the two key focuses that we have to secure to continue on our technology leadership as well as our new product developments for future revenue stream bruce chan okay terrific and then just a final question here you mentioned the geographic split as roughly 51 europe 40 u s do you expect that to remain the case going forward edmond cheng peter you want me to answer that peter wang yes orâ edmond cheng okay go ahead marianne marianne mcinerney we do believe that europe will continue to be the biggest market for our products in 2022 while we are not in a position to offer guidance for the future period due to the evolving situation we are excited by the response that our products have received in the u s and other new developing markets so we do anticipate that europe will remain at least 50 as we move forward at this time again itâ s very difficult to provide specific guidance for this period due to the uncertainties and the evolving situations with the supply chain and covid and geopolitical issues bruce chan okay understood well received well thank you all so much for your time i appreciate it operator thank you if you have any other questions please contact us via email this concludes the call you may now disconnect peter wang thank you

twitter s acceptance of elon musk s roughly 44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire tesla ceo one step closer to owning the social media platform the deal is expected to close sometime this year but before that shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter does business before the deal is completed offer accepted now what the process is off to a good start for musk given that twitter s board has unanimously approved his offer and is recommending shareholders do the same upon announcing the deal monday twitter noted that the bid which represents a 38 premium to the company s closing stock price on april 1 is a substantial cash premium and would be the best path forward for twitter s stockholders when twitter s board adopted an anti takeover provision known as a poison pill just 10 days ago the move was widely seen as a telltale sign that the directors were gearing up to rebuff musk s opening offer or perhaps seek another suitor willing to pay more but the battleground shifted dramatically late last week when musk disclosed he had lined up 46 5 billion including 21 billion of his personal fortune to pay for the purchase musk said other investors could contribute to the financing the locked in financing not only underscored the seriousness of musk s pursuit but also appeared to open the door to other large twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the san francisco company the details of those conversations aren t known but musk could point to a more than 20 year history building and running several businesses most notably as the longtime ceo of tesla the electric car maker is currently valued at 1 trillion roughly 25 times more than twitter i think there is nothing better for twitter than elon musk buying it and ideally replacing the board and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue generating sources said john meyer a technology entrepreneur and investor musk has the track record that he can do the impossible it would be easy to see why other twitter shareholders might welcome a shake up as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment before musk disclosed his 9 stake in twitter earlier this month the shares were trading below 40 not that much more it its 26 price when twitter went public in november 2013 since then the tech driven nasdaq has more than tripled even after a recent downturn twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising google and facebook meanwhile tesla s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010 and after struggling to make money for more than a decade the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of 3 3 billion during the first three months of this year alone file in this photo illustration the twitter logo is displayed on a smartphone with elon musk s official twitter profile rafael henrique sopa images lightrocket via getty images expand what happens next as is customary once a company agrees to be acquired the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren t any red flags that haven t come up via the company s public filings this step in the process isn t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal said angelo zino tech analyst at cfra he s acquiring this company not from a financial perspective zino said he s going to do what he wants with it and he s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company what say could regulators have last year twitter generated 5 billion in revenue with 2 8 billion from the u s and the rest earned overseas zino said the federal trade commission in the u s or the european commission in the eu are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed twitter buyout the main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry or whether it violates antitrust laws these reviews can take months or longer but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining or in the case of a single buyer whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry neither tesla nor musk s other company space exploration technologies or spacex are social media platforms so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal analysts said we do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with musk owning twitter wedbush analyst daniel ives wrote in a research note monday when do shareholders get to vote the deal is expected to close in 2022 subject to the approval of twitter shareholders twitter hasn t announced the timing of a shareholder vote though the company s annual meeting is set for may 25 which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders a company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover what about twitter leadership at this early stage it s unclear what will happen to twitter s current board or management team if the deal is completed but musk has made it abundantly clear that he believes the company has been poorly run that assessment is a strong indication that musk s makeover will also include a purge of twitter s top ranks
monitorships are assuming an increasingly important role in corporate crime enforcement in the united kingdom before the introduction of deferred prosecution agreements dpas to the uk legal system monitors were appointed under negotiated settlements entered into between cooperating corporate entities and enforcement authorities but the statutory foundations for their appointment were less solid and appointments were largely the product of prosecutorial improvisation monitors were perceived squarely as a feature of the us corporate crime enforcement landscape and their appointment in the united kingdom drew significant judicial opprobrium indeed lord garnier qc the architect of the statutory scheme introducing dpas in the united kingdom has made clear that ensuring that dpas provided and were seen to provide a mechanism for cooperating corporates to address historic misconduct constructively and efficiently was a key objective for the uk government in the parliamentary debates that preceded the introduction of the legislation the use of an independent monitor was one of the tough requirements cited as something to which a company may be required to adhere to avoid prosecution recalling the lengthy discussions leading to their introduction lord garnier emphasised that the uk government had to strike a careful balance it was at pains to avoid encouraging the development of any perceived gravy train for professional services firms which would have seriously undermined public and judicial confidence but recognised the useful part that could be played by monitors to ensure that corporates followed up on the promises they made during settlement discussions the introduction of dpas cleared a path for monitorships to become a more common way of concluding criminal investigations involving corporate entities in the united kingdom as may be expected given her previous experience as a us prosecutor and a monitor in private practice lisa osofsky the director of the uk s serious fraud office sfo appointed in september 2018 has spoken about the holistic approach available through dpas and monitorships to improve corporate integrity stating in september 2020 that the direction of travel for deferred prosecution agreements is to use to the full the unique leverage dpas give us to drive better corporate citizenship in effect to make better companies dpas are not only a way of incentivising cooperating companies and avoiding collateral damage to employees suppliers investors and customers they are also a way also of ensuring companies admit their fraud and corruption and turn their attention to cleaning house a conviction and a fine do not reap the same benefits if companies violate the terms of the dpa their admission of wrongdoing in the statement of facts can be used against them in a subsequent prosecution this is invaluable the agreement with outsourcing giant g4s earlier this summer was a step change a dpa with teeth that dpa means that a major government supplier will be the subject of close scrutiny over the upcoming years to ensure its house stays in order and that uk taxpayers get the value they should from these very substantial contracts it should not be assumed that monitorships in the united kingdom will become as prevalent as they are in the united states or that where they are used they will be as extensive in scope as their us counterparts however it is worth noting lisa osofsky s comments in june 2021 on using dpas to improve corporate citizenship in cooperating corporates dpas encourage offending companies to uphold the law and become good corporate citizens they can also prevent unnecessary economic damage where a conviction could put the company out of business and destroy jobs dpas demand full co operation in short companies have to come out with their hands up they must demonstrate a commitment to rooting out wrongdoing and fulfil all the obligations by a deadline with such a focus on corporate integrity from lisa osofsky and the sfo it can be expected that the place of corporate monitorships in uk corporate crime enforcement practice will solidify indeed as detailed later in this chapter there are some indications that the sfo may be moving towards a more routine use of monitorships in cases when dpas mandate improvements to corporate organisations compliance arrangements if the sfo is not satisfied that monitorship or quasi monitorship arrangements put in place during the course of the investigation or dpa negotiation process are sufficient this chapter identifies the various statutory and other contexts in which monitorships or equivalent arrangements may arise in the united kingdom examines the shape they may take and lessons that may be drawn from analogous longer established arrangements and considers some specific issues that may be encountered in practice the nature and scope of uk monitorships the appointment of a monitor at the conclusion of an investigation into corporate misconduct by uk enforcement authorities is less routine than in the united states where monitors are appointed in the united kingdom the scope of their engagement is typically significantly narrower than under corresponding us arrangements in the united kingdom improvements to compliance arrangements and changes to key personnel are effectively preconditions to the commencement of dpa or other negotiations and court approval of proposed settlements corporate entities seeking to demonstrate a clean break with historic misconduct will commonly have put in place arrangements akin to those that may be ordered under monitorship programmes in other jurisdictions long before agreements are made with enforcement authorities or ratified by courts this differs significantly from the position in the united states the threshold applied by the us department of justice us doj when deciding whether corporate entities have cooperated sufficiently to expect realistically to enter into a negotiated settlement is lower than that expected by the sfo and the crown prosecution service cps in the united kingdom in the united states remediation follows once a deal has been finalised the crime and courts act 2013 cca and the accompanying guidance permit and contemplate the possible appointment of monitors in appropriate cases but stop significantly short of prescribing or even encouraging it the deferred prosecution agreements code of practice the dpa code which the sfo and the cps are required to take into account when negotiating applying to the court for dpas and overseeing dpas sets out the roles duties and mechanics of appointing monitors as a term of a dpa the dpa code sounds a note of caution in this regard stating an important consideration for entering into a dpa is whether already has a genuinely proactive and effective corporate compliance programme the use of monitors should therefore be approached with care the appointment of a monitor will depend upon the factual circumstances of each case and must always be fair reasonable and proportionate this guidance reflects the comments of lord justice thomas as he then was who in r v innospec in 2010 expressed significant concerns about the costs of what he considered an expensive corporate probation order the fact that a settlement incorporating a three year monitorship had been agreed between uk and us prosecutors meant that he was constrained from giving effect to his concerns but made clear his profound scepticism about the need for the imposition of a monitor at all he pointed in particular to the steps already taken to address the root causes of historic misconduct including replacing key senior executives and the fact that the company s auditors were aware of wrongdoing statutory frameworks for monitorships in the united kingdom in the united kingdom a monitorship or an arrangement similar to a monitorship can arise pursuant to various statutory and contractual frameworks as already touched upon the most recent and high profile of these is the cca which enables them to be used to oversee a compliance programme imposed under a dpa a review of the monitorships imposed under the cca is set out below it is not the only scheme that may be used however the other statutory and contractual frameworks in which monitorships or similar arrangements may arise are discussed in more detail below deferred prosecution agreements monitors appointed under uk dpas have been and are likely to continue to be deployed in a more targeted manner than has been the case under us dpas to date consistent with the guidance set out in the dpa code and the concerns expressed by thomas lj in r v innospec the monitorship components of settlements agreed to date summarised in the table below could more accurately be described as quasi monitorships date company summary of conduct monitorship elements

and justice services uk ltd between august 2011 and may 2012 the company dishonestly misled the ministry of justice as to the extent of its profits this was to avoid contractual obligations to share the value of any cost reductions which would have negatively affected the company s revenues although the dpa recognised the steps the company had made in improving its compliance controls it nevertheless required g4s to adopt or modify existing controls policies and procedures in order to 1 ensure the making and keeping of fair and accurate books records and accounts and 2 effectively prevent and detect violations of applicable fraud and abc laws create and fill a group level head of internal audit and compliance role with an individual who is appropriately resourced and reports to

fleet plane refurbishment contracts none the company stopped trading in 2018 and is now dormant it was kept open to facilitate the sfo s investigation and to discharge the requirements of the dpa as such the dpa does not include any compliance remediation and only has a one year term july 2021 amec foster wheeler energy limited between 1996 and 2014 the company was responsible for using corrupt agents and intermediaries in the oil and gas sector the dpa relates to 10 offences in nigeria saudi arabia malaysia india and brazil none although the company had deficiencies in its corporate compliance programme it was acquired in 2017 by john wood group plc which it was recognised had made substantial changes to the company in terms of controls policies procedures and culture however in conjunction with the dpa john wood group was required to give an undertaking that it would report annually to the sfo on its group wide ethics and compliance programme and continually review and if necessary amend its ethics and compliance programme in a manner consistent with the company s obligations under the dpa july 2021 two unnamed uk based companies although reporting restrictions currently apply according to the sfo press release both dpas share a common statement of facts the charges relate to offences under sections 1 and 7 of the uk bribery act 2010 with bribes paid in respect of multimillion pound contracts in the united kingdom according to the sfo press release a parent company in both dpas is required to report to the sfo at regular intervals on compliance and has also undertaken to support a comprehensive compliance programme the dpa code states that a monitor s primary responsibility is to assess and monitor internal controls advise of necessary compliance improvements that will reduce the risk of future recurrence of the conduct subject to the dpa and report specified misconduct to if the dpa requires a company to agree to implement a compliance programme or change its existing compliance programme the prosecutor needs to be able to assess and the company needs to satisfy the prosecutor of the company s compliance with the terms of the dpa mandating such reforms according to the sfo s guidance on evaluating compliance programmes published and incorporated into its operational handbook in january 2020 a monitor appointed at the company s expense is likely in such circumstances this has been interpreted in some quarters as an indication that lisa osofsky is seeking to bring to bear her previous experience as an investigator and prosecutor in cases pursued in the united states and as a monitor in private practice on her role as director of the sfo whether this indication translates into greater numbers of monitors being appointed under dpas in the united kingdom will become clearer as more investigations during which the sfo applies this guidance come to fruition however the number of cases in which a monitor is appointed to oversee adherence by corporate organisations to the terms of dpas may be limited clearly whether it is deemed necessary to appoint a monitor to verify and report back to the sfo on prescribed improvements to compliance arrangements will be a matter for negotiation in every case and corporate organisations and their advisers will in many cases be able to make strong arguments that such a step is unnecessary and disproportionate the cps has not issued corresponding specific guidance on how it will evaluate compliance programmes and when it may consider it necessary for a monitor to be appointed cases in which it will be dealing with these types of questions are likely to be relatively rare when these questions do arise in cases handled by the cps it may draw on the guidance it has published in relation to the appointment of authorised monitors under serious crime prevention orders see section on these orders below the specific tasks of monitors appointed under dpas will vary widely and typically will be set out in the terms of the dpa but can include the monitoring of any facet of the company s compliance programme the appointment of a monitor however will not absolve the company s board of directors from the ultimate responsibility for identifying assessing and addressing risks the terms of the dpa will usually require the company to consent to the monitor s cooperation with the prosecuting authority the dpa code requires corporates to afford monitors complete access to all relevant aspects of the company s business during the course of the monitoring period as requested by the monitor the terms of the dpa typically will require that the company permits the monitor to have access to any material the monitor could reasonably request to fulfil his or her function the dpa code acknowledges though that a corporate subject to a monitoring arrangement may not be required to produce material subject to legal professional privilege whether to the monitor or anyone else the reports produced by the monitor are confidential with disclosure restricted to the prosecution authority the company and the court unless otherwise permitted by law whether corporate entities entering into agreements with enforcement authorities that contain monitorship components should expect to be asked to produce privileged documents to monitors and indeed the extent to which they are required to produce such documents in response to requests from monitors is discussed more fully below the extent to which monitors may be able or required to make onward disclosure of material provided to them in the course of their engagement is also considered below the dpa code affords corporates and their representatives a much greater role in identifying appropriate candidates to act as monitors than was contemplated under previous legislation as part of the dpa negotiations corporates provide to the relevant prosecuting authority details of three potential monitors including their relevant qualifications specialist knowledge and experience disclose any associations the potential monitors have had with the company and identify their preferred monitor the dpa code directs the cps and the sfo that they should ordinarily accept the company s preferred monitor but confirms that the relevant authority may reject the choice if it considers that there may be a potential conflict of interest or that the preferred candidate does not have sufficient experience or authority although not identical these and other provisions of the dpa code are reflective of guidance on the selection of monitors under us dpas and non prosecution agreements if it is proposed that a monitorship be a feature of a dpa once agreement is reached on the identity of the monitor the relevant prosecuting authority and the corporate entity will provisionally agree a detailed work plan for the first year including the proposed method of review and frequency of reporting to the prosecutor an outline work plan will be agreed to govern the monitor s activities for the remainder of the monitorship period the work plan and outline work plan will also need to address costs of the monitorship since these costs including reasonable costs associated with monitorships incurred by the prosecuting authority are paid by the corporate some of the practical aspects of measuring the progress of ongoing monitorships and managing costs are discussed below the length of the monitorship will be agreed in the dpa following negotiations between the company and the prosecuting authority initially it may be shorter than the term of the dpa itself but can never exceed the term of the dpa the monitor can recommend terminating or suspending the monitorship if the company s policies and procedures are functioning properly without the need for further monitoring or the monitor can recommend extending the monitorship if the company has been or will be unable to satisfy its obligations successfully by the end of the monitorship period the decision to terminate suspend or extend the monitorship will be taken by the prosecuting authority an important feature of the dpa regime is that the dpa including any monitorship proposed must be approved by the court sir brian leveson noted when reviewing and ultimately approving the proposed dpa between the sfo and standard bank that in the united kingdom a dpa requires the informed independent opinion of a judge before it can be effected the agreement of the parties is not enough and that the court will consider the prospective terms of the dpa individually and collectively in order to determine whether to grant a declaration that entering into it is likely to be in the interests of justice and that its proposed terms are fair reasonable and proportionate serious crime prevention orders serious crime prevention orders scpos are governed by part i of the serious crime act 2007 sca they were added to the statute book substantially before the introduction of the uk dpa regime but were not specifically directed towards corporate crime although they have been used to impose restrictions on individuals in some cases in respect of the activities of corporate entities following conviction mainly in cases concerning serious and organised crime there are no reported instances of authorities using them to resolve white collar investigations against corporates under the sca when a corporate defendant is convicted of a serious offence which includes fraud bribery and money laundering offences the crown court can on the application of the sfo or the cps in england and wales impose an scpo enabling the authority to contract with a person to provide monitoring services the authorised monitor an scpo can also be imposed without there having been a criminal trial if the high court of england and wales is satisfied that a corporate has been involved in serious crime which means committing or facilitating a serious offence whether in england and wales or elsewhere and where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the order would protect the public by preventing restricting or disrupting the company s involvement in serious crime an scpo may require the person subject to it to provide information or documents to the authorised monitor or answer questions posed by the authorised monitor if deemed appropriate by the court the person subject to the scpo may also be required to pay all or some of the costs associated with the authorised monitor s engagement any documents or information produced to the authorised monitor under the scpo will be retained by the relevant enforcement authority for as long as it considers necessary scpos are available to various enforcement authorities but have principally been used by the cps although there have been examples of their use by the financial conduct authority fca in cases concerning unauthorised business it is possible that the sfo and other authorities may explore their potential application in larger scale cases although they would only be made as a part of the sentencing process following conviction rather than as part of a negotiated settlement civil recovery orders civil recovery orders cros under part 5 of the proceeds of crime act 2002 poca are civil orders available to the cps sfo fca and other enforcement authorities as a tool to conclude criminal investigations whether or not there has been a parallel prosecution they allow enforcement authorities to recover property obtained as a result of unlawful conduct as civil remedies the hurdles to be overcome by enforcement authorities are considerably lower than in criminal proceedings property is still susceptible to a cro even if the unlawful conduct was carried out by another person as it is only necessary for authorities to establish facts to the civil standard and there is no necessity to show from which particular offence or offences the property in question has been generated before the introduction of dpas cros were seen by enforcement authorities and cooperating corporate entities as a relatively attractive way of concluding investigations through negotiation there is no equivalent to the dpa code in respect of cros and no constraints on the appointment of monitors under them beyond those required to settle any civil proceedings namely acceptable wording for a consent order and associated settlement documents as noted in the table below in some cases involving monitors the latitude the cro framework has afforded to cooperating corporate entities to negotiate settlements perceived as relatively favourable to them and the limited extent to which the court may influence the contents of agreements has drawn significant judicial criticism date company summary of conduct amount recovered monitorship october 2008 balfour beatty plc irregularities concerning payments made as part of a joint venture bid to secure 22 5 million of work on the construction of the alexandria library in egypt 2 25 million included a form of external monitoring for an agreed period july 2011 macmillan publishers limited improper payments were made in relation to a tender to supply educational books to south sudan 11 3 million recovered through a cro external monitor imposed to report to sfo and world bank july 2012 oxford publishing limited two subsidiaries of oxford publishing operating in kenya and tanzania made facilitation payments in connection with tenders for school books 1 9 million recovered through a cro in addition to a 2 million voluntary payment to sub saharan african non profit groups external monitor imposed to report to sfo and world bank the appointment of monitors was acknowledged in the cros referred to above by way of relatively bland clauses included in consent orders in contrast to the comparatively detailed provisions of the dpa code there is very little information in the public domain about the processes by which monitors appointed under cros have been selected the extent of any input allowed by the companies concerned and whether any agreement was reached in relation to the circumstances in which monitorship arrangements may be either terminated early or extended outside scotland where dpas are not available as a tool to conclude investigations cros involving the appointment of monitors are now likely to be a thing of the past at least to conclude investigations concerning offences in respect of which dpas are now available and more likely to be used it is possible that cros incorporating monitorships could be used in different contexts for example to date there have been no publicised orders made since the definition of unlawful conduct was amended for the purposes of the civil recovery regime in part 5 of poca to include gross human rights abuses or violations under the magnitsky amendment introduced in the united kingdom through the criminal finances act 2017 these orders are expected to be few and far between if indeed any are made at all there are no indications to date that enforcement authorities are contemplating using cros based on this provision to recover property in the hands of corporate entities it is conceivable though particularly given the breadth of the definition of gross human rights abuses or violations that applications for any such orders may be an area in which authorities could seek the appointment of monitors appointment of skilled persons by the uk financial services regulators the fca and the prudential regulation authority pra have the supervisory power conferred by sections 166 and 166a of the financial services and markets act 2000 to appoint or to require firms they regulate to appoint an external third party a skilled person to undertake a review of a particular business area of that firm or to examine a particular issue the power has been heavily used historically by the fca in particular and the former financial services authority from which the fca and the pra emerged published data shows a steady decline in the number of skilled persons appointed from 95 in 2010 2011 and a spike of 113 in 2012 2013 to 34 in 2018 2019 it is possible that the decline was attributable at least in part to the controversy surrounding the publication of a section 166 report in february 2018 following intervention by the treasury committee however the number of skilled persons appointed has since begun to rise again with 57 in 2019 2020 and 68 in 2020 2021 which may be attributable to a greater focus on financial crime firms controls and risk management frameworks and conduct of business issues the appointment of a skilled person is a supervisory tool rather than part of the enforcement processes of the fca or the pra for example between september 2012 and september 2014 more than 95 per cent of fca ordered skilled person reviews did not lead to enforcement action rather the purpose of appointing a skilled person is to diagnose monitor limit or reduce identified risk or remedy crystallised risk the appointing firm bears the cost of the skilled person s work which is typically significant the total cost incurred by firms subject to skilled person reviews in 2020 2021 was 39 4 million skilled persons are usually appointed from specialist panels maintained by the regulators relevant guidance indicates that the fca will normally contact the before finalising its decision to require a report or the updating or collection of information by a skilled person to provide an opportunity for discussion about the appointment whether an alternative means of obtaining the information would be better what the scope of a report should be who should be appointed who should appoint and the likely cost however in practice the scope for firms to influence the identity of the skilled person or the scope of their engagement is usually relatively limited the skilled person s obligation is to cooperate with and ultimately report to the fca or pra as the case may be as a matter of practice the skilled person will give the firm an opportunity to comment on the drafts of the review before it is finalised contractual monitoring arrangements arrangements similar to monitorships can arise in other contexts consistent with regulatory guidance on mitigating anti corruption anti money laundering and trade compliance risks equity investors will usually seek to negotiate the inclusion of contractual compliance protections in deal documents where specific and material compliance concerns are identified during the pre investment stage investors may seek to include robust compliance undertakings that will govern a corporate entity s post acquisition compliance programme these undertakings could require an investee company to work with an investor s external compliance counsel to adopt compliance policies and procedures develop a compliance function staffed by appropriately qualified compliance personnel conduct a forensic audit and take any other steps to address identified compliance concerns in these situations the investor s external compliance counsel will effectively assume a quasi monitorship role by taking the lead to drive the investee company s satisfaction of the compliance undertakings and addressing identified risk areas practical points as monitorships are still a comparative rarity in the united kingdom there is not yet an established body of practice relating to when and how monitors should be appointed and how they should carry out their engagements as in the united states each situation in which a monitor has been or may be appointed will raise specific questions and issues careful analysis at the outset to identify and explicitly deal with questions likely to arise during the course of the monitorship will minimise and mitigate uncertainty and friction during the life of the monitorship some of the questions likely to arise are addressed below cross border monitorships can or should a monitor be appointed under a settlement with more than one enforcement authority nothing prevents enforcement authorities from appointing a single monitor to oversee compliance arrangements in multiple jurisdictions this course has been taken in numerous settlements with us authorities however enforcement authorities are increasingly recognising the benefits of retaining specialists in different jurisdictions privilege can a monitor require access to legally privileged material no the dpa code acknowledges any legal professional privilege that may exist in respect of investigating compliance issues that arise during the monitorship is unaffected by this dpa code or a dpa in many instances this will not cause particular problems as monitors will be less concerned with the content of legal advice than the fact that it has been taken and appropriate action taken in response to it enforcement authorities or monitors are not precluded of course from requesting that corporate entities provide privileged material voluntarily whether on a limited waiver basis or more generally although in most cases they and their representatives will be reluctant to do so as they are likely to have concerns about waiver given in particular the potential for material to be disclosed further and used in or to precipitate further litigation or investigations can a monitor assert privilege in connection with his or her engagement yes although monitors are often themselves lawyers it will usually be necessary and prudent for them to seek specialist advice on particular aspects of their engagement communications passing between a monitor and his or her advisers may be subject to privilege in the same way as those passing between any lawyer and a client data protection considerations what are monitors obligations in relation to data particularly in the context of fact finding aspects of their appointments monitors are likely to have to gather and review corporate documents employee emails data stored on work devices and other company data that data could include personal data of which collection storage and processing could be subject to the data protection act 2018 and the retained general data protection regulation or equivalents in other jurisdictions the monitor will need to assess his or her role under applicable data protection laws and may need to work with the corporate entity to ascertain an appropriate basis for the monitor s receipt processing and storage of the personal data where relevant data is located in jurisdictions outside the united kingdom the monitor will need to work with the corporate entity to determine which data privacy laws may affect the data transfer to the united kingdom and ensure that there is an appropriate basis under local law for the transfer processing and storage of data it will usually be prudent for the monitor to seek specialist advice in the particular jurisdictions in which he or she is operating and to document in writing the corporate entity s and monitor s rights and obligations including any appropriate indemnities in relation to personal data managing the relationship between monitor and subject entity how should monitors deal with the senior management of the company in most instances whether pursuant to a dpa or a skilled person review the corporate entity concerned will not have anticipated a monitorship some degree of resistance from the company s senior management who may regard dealing with a monitor as an expensive distraction from running the business is therefore to be expected the company is likely to treat the monitor as an unwelcome guest particularly if it has already expended significant resources in investigating misconduct and bolstering its compliance programme as part of the settlement negotiations with the enforcement authority the monitor will have a clear mandate enshrined in the terms of his or her appointment and should focus on carrying it out diligently but the monitor should be sensitive in doing so and cognisant of the remedial steps the company has taken to date the monitor should take time in the initial phase of the monitorship to understand the steps that the company has taken and is planning to take to improve the pertinent aspects of its compliance programme as those facts should inform the monitor s work plan and formulate a basis for the organic self sustaining growth of the company s compliance programme if a monitor s approach is perceived to be too intrusive a company s management may accuse the monitor of impeding the company s business or at best be less receptive to recommendations however the nature and purpose of tasks inherent in a monitorship may not always seem congruent with the objectives and priorities of senior executives who owe duties to shareholders and others to maximise commercial performance there may be particular tensions when monitors are installed in financial services firms as senior executives subject to individual accountability regimes may seek particular information or assurances from monitors to satisfy themselves and regulators that they are complying with their personal regulatory obligations transparent and effective communication by monitors is key to striking an appropriate balance in monitoring the pertinent areas of the corporate entity s business objectively and on one hand discharging obligations to the prosecuting authority and on the other avoiding unnecessary friction with the company to the extent permitted by the terms of his or her appointment the monitor should give the company advance notice of and an opportunity to comment on any recommendations findings or reports that the monitor will make to the enforcement authority the monitor should also aim to be transparent and up front with the company about his or her working methods including fees and expenses for example this involve giving the company sufficient advance notice of any proposed meetings document requests or employee interviews the monitor should alleviate the company s concerns about the potential costs of the monitorship considering in advance the proposed staffing and likely associated expenses identifying cost efficiencies and offering cost solutions is likely to lead to a better working relationship between the company and the monitor there will be occasions when it is necessary for details of the tasks being undertaken by a monitor and the reasons for them to be kept confidential from senior executives however to the greatest extent possible a constructive working relationship should be fostered by the release of as much information as is appropriate in the particular circumstances of each engagement to enable senior executives to understand the progress of the monitorship any areas where they may be able to assist with resources or information and the reasons why the monitor requires details about particular aspects of the business both monitors and corporate entities should bear in mind that the engagement will proceed more smoothly is likely to be concluded more quickly and will result in more sustainable improvements to compliance systems and controls if all parties adopt an appropriately collaborative approach what should monitors do if the relationship with the subject deteriorates the monitor should work to repair the relationship with the company but also critically assess why it may be deteriorating if the relationship is being undermined by the company s perceived unwillingness to cooperate with the monitor s reasonable performance of his or her duties e g by resisting disclosure to the monitor of information that reasonably would help in the performance of the monitor s mandate the monitor should evaluate whether those are matters that may have to be reflected in his or her reports to the enforcement authorities the monitor should be mindful however that his or her report to the enforcement authorities is a powerful tool that should be used only when genuine need demands it the monitor should understand that he or she is not appointed to impose his or her will on the company rather the monitor s role is to aid the company s journey towards developing robust compliance policies and procedures that address the deficiencies in culture and controls that led to the original misconduct and that work for that particular company s business model in many cases external reporting to the enforcement authority of perceived friction or disagreements will not be necessary for example lack of cooperation when seeking information from junior or middle ranking staff is likely to be dealt with more effectively in the first instance at least by a report to senior executives of the corporate entity and joint steps by the corporate entity and the monitor to explain adequately to the affected staff the purpose of the monitorship and the benefits of collaborating with reasonable requests made by the monitor similarly a company s perceived reluctance or struggle to change certain practices or adopt certain procedures should prompt the monitor to assess the suitability of the proposed course of action and the strength of buy in from all relevant parts of business for that course of action the monitor should work with key stakeholders in the company to formulate an approach that fits the company s operations and risk profile that process may require the monitor to encourage the company to work with him or her collaboratively to come up with appropriate compliance solutions rather than adopting off the shelf policies and procedures the monitor should also work with key stakeholders in the company to educate all relevant parts of the business about the company s compliance risks and the benefits of investing in compliance how should monitors deal with auditors the purpose of an audit is to provide an objective and independent examination and evaluation of a corporate entity s financial statements if the monitor encounters issues during the term of the monitorship that may affect the accuracy of financial statements it is likely that the monitor would be bound by confidentiality obligations to the corporate entity and would not be able to disclose the matter to auditors in this situation the prudent course of action is for the monitor to urge the company to investigate the matter and if necessary work with the company to bring the matter to the auditor s attention the monitor should also assess whether the issue is one that would need to be included in the monitor s report to the enforcement authority pursuant to the terms of the monitorship how should monitors deal with the media the monitor will owe confidentiality obligations to the company and the enforcement authority unless there are exceptional circumstances as a matter of professionalism the monitor should avoid engaging with the press information gathering what steps should monitors take to ensure that relevant documents are preserved and when monitors evidence preservation plans and priorities will be similar to those applicable to conducting an internal investigation or responding to a regulatory investigation the monitor may have to work with the company to preserve data for example by disabling automatic email deletion and amend or disapply the company s document retention policies or issue document hold notices in respect of categories of documents relevant to the scope of his or her engagement if the monitor has been appointed pursuant to a settlement with enforcement authorities it is likely that document preservation measures will already have been implemented when the company conducted its own internal investigation the monitor should assess with the company whether those preservation measures need to be kept in place during the term of the monitorship when should monitors conduct fact finding interviews depending on the terms of the appointment the monitor may need to conduct fact finding interviews with the company s employees those interviews could focus on particular compliance incidents or aspects of the company s compliance programme when compliance incidents occur or even if none has occurred if it is part of the monitor s stated task to conduct spot checks to ensure the effectiveness of particular compliance functions or systems the monitor may want to conduct interviews with personnel with relevant first hand knowledge these interviews are quite separate from interviews conducted by the corporate entity s in house or external counsel and are conducted for a different purpose are the subjects of interviews entitled to separate representation neither the monitor nor the corporate entity will be able to preclude the employees from engaging their own counsel at their own expense separately however the corporate entity is likely to wish to ensure that the company s legal representative is present during the monitor s interview with an employee to ensure that the corporate entity s privileged information is not disclosed the monitor will need to consider however to what extent the presence of company s counsel at interviews may stifle an employee s candidness and willingness to express their concerns are monitors required to give the subjects of interviews upjohn or similar warnings although the monitor is not required to give an upjohn or similar warning to an employee at the beginning of an interview the monitor should nonetheless take care to clarify his or her role and the purpose of the interview and remind the employee of the confidentiality of the interview confidentiality and market obligations to whom do monitors owe duties of confidentiality what is the extent of these duties under the dpa regime monitors reports are confidential with disclosure limited to the company in question the prosecuting authority and the court monitors owe a duty of confidentiality to all three but this duty can be overridden if permitted by law for example if required pursuant to disclosure in civil litigation monitors reports are exempt from disclosure under the freedom of information act 2000 currently there are no reported examples of instances of claimants in separate civil litigation seeking or obtaining disclosure of monitors reports such as those seen in some cases in the united states however this is not to say that the confidentiality of reports prepared by monitors in the united kingdom is unassailable or that attempts of this kind will not be made in future one particular factor for monitors and corporate entities alike to bear in mind is that the uk parliament has shown itself to be willing to publish confidential documents when it considers it to be in the public interest to do so particularly when all or some of the content of reports has previously been leaked what practical steps should the company and monitors take to protect inside information if the company s shares are listed on a stock exchange the company will have obligations with respect to the management and disclosure of inside information the company may have to place the monitor on an insider list owing to the nature of the information to which the monitor will have access during the term of his or her appointment the company will also need to ensure that the monitor has systems in place to maintain strict confidentiality in respect of inside information that if disclosed could prejudice the company s legitimate interests reporting the outcome of monitorships what format should monitors reports take the monitor should discuss with the prosecuting authority at the outset of the monitorship the format the monitor s reports should take the prosecuting authority may find it preferable to receive periodic informal reports with a formal report delivered at agreed milestones the monitor should supplement any written report with offers to guide the authority through the report by phone or during a face to face meeting should the monitor share his or her draft report with the company to the extent permitted by the terms of his or her appointment the monitor should give the company advance notice of any reports that the monitor will make to the enforcement authority the monitor should explain his or her findings and recommendations to the company and allow it to comment on those findings and recommendations although the monitor has an independent duty to the enforcement authority to provide an objective report the monitor should strive to avoid surprising the company with his or her findings and formulate recommendations in collaboration with the company that achieve the objectives of the monitorship and that can be owned by the company long after the monitor s mandate is

musk s free speech advocacy seems to apply mostly to his own speech or that of his fans and promoters when it comes to his employees free speech musk demonstrates little tolerance musk has repeatedly sought control over what journalists bloggers analysts and other researchers say about his businesses their products and himself tesla and spacex ceo elon musk the world s wealthiest person on paper is buying twitter the social media platform he has relied on for years to promote his interests and shape his public image free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated said mr musk in a statement when the deal was announced monday get dfw local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc dfw newsletters musk has characterized himself as a first amendment and free speech advocate for years for example in defending himself in a defamation lawsuit after calling a critic a pedo guy musk won and to argue that the sec infringed on his rights in a settlement agreement they struck and revised after the agency charged him with securities fraud in 2018 starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint sorry to be a free speech absolutist elon musk elonmusk march 5 2022 but as the atlantic bloomberg and others have pointed out musk s free speech advocacy seems to apply mostly to his own speech or that of his fans and promoters techdirt argues that musk lacks a serious understanding of free speech and even less about content moderation workers speech when it comes to his employees free speech musk demonstrates little tolerance under his leadership when tesla has laid off employees it s asked them to sign separation agreements including a strong non disparagement clause with no end date these kinds of agreements are not uncommon in the industry but musk is far from a free speech absolutist here a copy of one such agreement from tesla shared with cnbc by a former employee laid off in 2018 who did not sign the agreement said you agree not to disparage tesla the company s products or the company s officers directors employees shareholders and agents affiliates and subsidiaries in any manner likely to be harmful to them or their business business reputation or personal reputation in the same document tesla required laid off employees to keep details about the separation agreement itself hidden other than from their own lawyer accountant or immediate family not even other workers the provisions of this agreement will be held in strictest confidence by you and will not be publicized or disclosed in any manner whatsoever the agreement said in particular and without limitation you agree not to disclose the terms of this agreement to any current or former company employee or contractor like most large companies tesla also requires workers to sign an arbitration agreement upon employment that means to speak freely in court where their speech will become part of a public record workers need to get an exemption from the arbitration agreement from a judge first under musk s leadership of tesla scores of workers have alleged racist sexist and other types of harassment discrimination and unsafe working conditions many have also alleged retaliation after they spoke out about problems these allegations have been in the spotlight recently because of a newly revealed probe by the eeoc and a lawsuit by the california civil rights agency but the company has a long track record in august 2018 a former tesla security employee karl hansen filed a complaint with the u s securities and exchange commission saying he was wrongfully terminated from his job as an investigator at the company s battery plant in sparks nevada after sounding the alarm about the theft of tens of millions of dollars worth of raw materials there tesla hid the theft from shareholders he alleged even though it represented a material amount of money to the automaker at the time in november 2020 former tesla employee stephen henkes said he was fired from his job at tesla on aug 3 2020 after raising safety concerns internally then filing formal complaints with government offices when the company failed to fix and communicate accurately with customers over what he said were unacceptable fire risks in the company s solar installations both the cpsc and sec are considering henkes complaints as evidence free press musk has repeatedly sought control over what journalists bloggers analysts and other researchers say about his businesses their products and himself memorably the tesla ceo berated and cut off an analyst on an earnings call in 2018 excuse me next next boring bonehead questions are not cool the ceo said after a question about his company s capital requirements the automaker had just posted its worst quarterly loss in its history musk later apologized for this and now sometimes skips speaking on tesla earnings calls musk and tesla have also asked reporters to sign ndas or show story drafts to the company to obtain approvals before publishing i was once invited to visit spacex s facility on kwajalein following interviews i was told elonmusk had to review all articles prior to publication i explained journalism doesn t work that way his current tweets come as no surprise sharon weinberger weinbergersa may 24 2018 he has brazenly called on followers to edit his biography on wikipedia just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane musk tweeted btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing he said his legions of followers obliged editing the page to de emphasize his investments just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing elon musk elonmusk december 22 2019 musk even takes umbrage with fan blogs when they write about tesla s shortcomings at his direction tesla stopped inviting some electrek staff to company events after the site which has evolved into more of an electric vehicle blog in recent years published a story with this headline tesla is charging owners 1 500 for hardware they already paid for the story was accurate if humiliating to musk because it addresses his company s failure in the race to deliver autonomous vehicle tech to long waiting customers customers speech musk and tesla have also sought not always successfully to silence customers for example tesla used to compel customers to sign agreements containing non disclosure clauses as a prerequisite to have their vehicles repaired in 2021 tesla asked customers to agree not to post critically to social media about fsd beta an experimental driver assistance software package that some tesla owners could test out using their own cars and unpaid time to do so in an agreement that tesla sent to drivers earlier this year for fsd beta access the company asked them to keep your experiences in the program confidential and not to share any information about this program with the public including by taking screenshots creating blog posts or posting to social media sites tesla named facebook instagram reddit tiktok snapchat and youtube as sites where owners should not share info about their use of fsd beta according to a copy of the full agreement obtained by cnbc musk later lifted tesla s terms for access to fsd beta saying nobody was obeying the agreement anyway but the practice caused a probe by the federal vehicle safety authority nhtsa given that nhtsa relies on reports from consumers as an important source of information in evaluating potential safety defects any agreement that may prevent or dissuade participants in the early access beta release program from reporting safety concerns to nhtsa is unacceptable nhsa wrote in a letter to tesla in october 2021 meanwhile in china tesla has sued customers who complained about safety issues with their cars and sued a social media influencer there for defamation the influencer xiaogang xuezhang posted a video demonstrating issues with tesla s and another automakers automated emergency braking systems redaction tesla and musk attorneys have also consistently filed confidential treatment requests for legal and business filings in the us among other things tesla sought to hide from the public view vehicle safety information that federal auto regulators sought from the company as a routine investigative practice and business information tesla used to apply for tax subsidies from the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority attorneys on behalf of tesla and musk have also tried to keep transcripts and videos of employee and executive testimony hidden in cases before the delaware chancery court and other courts free speech for me musk has certainly exercised free speech rights for himself and his companies recently he said spacex satellite internet service starlink would keep russian news sources online despite what musk said were calls to block these by un named governments amid putin s brutal invasion of ukraine starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint musk wrote sorry to be a free speech absolutist on the labor front musk is also fighting an administrative court ruling which said he must remove a tweet from his feed because it violates workers rights the tweet posted in 2018 said nothing stopping tesla team at our car plant from voting union could do so tmrw if they wanted but why pay union dues give up stock options for nothing at tesla musk has shirked the requirement to have a securities law expert pre approve some of his tweets before posting them despite the settlement agreement he struck with the sec after it charged him with civil securities fraud musk told lesley stahl in a 2018 interview that generally his tweets are not supervised even though a court had ordered him to have some of them pre approved by securities law compliance experts at tesla if they contained information likely to impact tesla s stock price during that interview he said hello first amendment free speech is fundamental assuming he truly believes that then musk s free speech absolutism is only aspirational but by controlling the social network musk can protect his ability to keep using twitter to promote his companies investments and himself as he wants to be seen
twitter s acceptance of elon musk s roughly 44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire tesla ceo one step closer to owning the social media platform the deal is expected to close sometime this

profitable with net income of 3 3 billion during the first three months of this year alone elon musk announced thursday morning that he wants to buy twitter what would his purchase of the social media platform mean for our society and what does it say about the growing power and influence of the billionaire class in our world what happens next as is customary once a company agrees to be acquired the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren t any red flags that haven t come up via the company s public filings this step in the process isn t likely to cause any

look to make significant changes to the business model of the company what say could regulators have last year twitter generated 5 billion in revenue with 2 8 billion from the u s and the rest earned overseas zino said the federal trade commission in the u s or the european commission in the eu are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed twitter buyout the main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry or whether it violates antitrust laws these reviews can take months or longer but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining or in the case of a single buyer whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry neither tesla nor musk s other company space exploration technologies or spacex are social media platforms so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal analysts said we do not

this video example video title will go here for this video washington twitter s acceptance of elon musk s roughly 44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire tesla ceo one step closer to owning the social media platform the deal is expected to close sometime this year but before that shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter does business before the deal is completed questions also remain about what exactly could change about the platform what could change for twitter users musk has not released an official list of changes but he has expressed interest in a number of updates musk has also suggested a need for long form tweets replying on a twitter thread my most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that twitter is way overdue for long form tweets perhaps most notably musk has blasted west coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech and in his most recent ted talk said that he would limit what twitter would moderate beyond what is required by the laws of the countries it operates in offer accepted now what the process is off to a good start for musk given that twitter s board has unanimously

dramatically late last week when musk disclosed he had lined up 46 5 billion including 21 billion of his personal fortune to pay for the purchase musk said other investors could contribute to the financing the locked in financing not only underscored the seriousness of musk s pursuit but also appeared to open the door to other large twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the san francisco company the details of those conversations aren t known but musk could point to a more than 20 year history building and running several businesses most notably as the longtime ceo of tesla the electric car maker is currently valued at 1 trillion roughly 25 times more than twitter i think there is nothing better for twitter than elon musk buying it and ideally replacing the board and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue generating sources said john meyer a technology entrepreneur and investor musk has the track record that he can do the impossible it would be easy to see why other twitter shareholders might welcome a shake up as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment before musk disclosed his 9 stake in twitter earlier this month the shares were trading below 40 not that much more it its 26 price when twitter went public in november 2013 since then the tech driven nasdaq has more than tripled even after a recent downturn twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising google and facebook meanwhile tesla s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010 and after struggling to make money for more than a decade the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of 3 3 billion during the first three months of this year alone elon musk announced thursday morning that he wants to buy twitter what would his purchase of the social media platform mean for our society and what does it say about the growing power and influence of the billionaire class in our world what happens next as is customary once a company agrees to be acquired the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren t any red flags that haven t come up via the company s public filings this step in the process isn t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal said angelo zino tech analyst at cfra he s acquiring this company not from a financial perspective zino said he s going to do what he wants with it and he s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company what say could regulators have last year twitter generated 5 billion in revenue with 2 8 billion from the u s and the rest earned overseas zino said the federal trade commission in the u s or the european commission in the eu are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed twitter buyout the main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry or whether it violates antitrust laws these reviews can take months or longer but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining or in the case of a single buyer whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry neither tesla nor musk s other company space exploration technologies or spacex are social media platforms so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal analysts said we do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with musk owning twitter wedbush analyst daniel ives wrote in a research note monday white house press secretary jen psaki said president biden is concerned about the power of social media platforms but declined to comment specifically on elon musk s pending buyout of twitter when do shareholders get to vote the deal is expected to close in 2022 subject to the approval of twitter shareholders twitter hasn t announced the timing of a shareholder vote though the company s annual meeting is set for may 25 which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders a company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover
twitter has struck a deal with elon musk handing the world s richest man control of a social network that has far reaching influence on politics and society musk will pay about 44 billion or 54 20 a share to take the social media company private according to an announcement from twitter the agreement comes less than two weeks after musk first offered to buy twitter sending the company s board and management into crisis mode as they scrambled to figure out whether musk was serious and whether his offer fairly valued the company musk has vowed to unlock twitter s potential by loosening what he sees as unfair restrictions on free speech free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated he said in monday s announcement the maverick entrepreneur is a prolific user and outspoken critic of twitter where he has more than 83 million followers and regularly posts memes boosts his companies tesla and spacex and squabbles with critics musk began accumulating twitter shares in january on april 4 he revealed that he d accumulated a 9 stake making him the company s biggest individual shareholder he began calling for changes to the platform including loosening its rules over what users are allowed to post banning bots that post spam and making its algorithm public twitter employees have lots of questions about the deal if the deal goes through as expected musk will have the power to reshape the company and platform as he pleases but many questions remain unanswered including how much of his own time musk who s already ceo of both tesla and spacex will spend on twitter as well as who will lead the social media company at a company wide meeting on monday afternoon twitter ceo parag agrawal told employees much about the future is up to musk according to a person who attended agrawal will remain ceo until the deal closes but it s unclear what will happen after that point twitter is not currently planning layoffs the ceo said the company plans to bring in musk to answer employees many questions about what the deal means for them asked whether musk might reinstate the account of former president donald trump who was banned after the jan 6th capitol riot agrawal said that was a question for musk once the deal closes we don t know which direction the platform will go the ceo said musk tweeted on monday before the deal was unveiled i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means but some observers say if musk relaxes content rules twitter could be overrun by misinformation and toxic posts a platform that moderated only illegal speech would quickly be overcome by spam and garbage said jameel jaffer with the knight first amendment institute at columbia university that kind of platform wouldn t work for anyone whatever their political views other experts including paul barrett at nyu s stern school for business and human rights have similar concerns without vigorous content moderation the platform musk seeks to own would be swamped by spam porn anti vaccination misinformation qanon conspiracies and fraudulent campaigns to undermine the midterms and 2024 presidential election barrett said poison pill afforded twitter more time to consider offer after accepting and then rejecting an invitation to join twitter s board musk dropped a new bombshell on april 14th with his unsolicited 54 20 a share offer to buy the whole company and take it private but lack of details about how musk would finance the deal left many doubting he was serious twitter s board quickly adopted a so called poison pill which served essentially as a speed bump a way to slow down musk from acquiring more shares in the public market as company leadership weighed the offer the board got some extra time with the poison pill but ultimately had to get to the negotiation table with musk to get this deal done as the clock struck midnight on twitter s history as a public company said dan ives an analyst at wedbush securities last week musk announced he had lined up the money to take twitter private in a regulatory filing he said morgan stanley bank of america and several other banks promised to lend 25 5 billion backed in part by some of musk s tesla shares and that he would provide up to 21 billion in cash those details may have shifted the board s view while twitter s stock hit highs above 70 a share last year the company s shares had fallen below 40 in recent months amid lingering questions over its ability to grow the twitter board conducted a thoughtful and comprehensive process to assess elon s proposal with a deliberate focus on value certainty and financing the proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium and we believe it is the best path forward for twitter s stockholders said bret taylor twitter s chairman in a statement

chicago illinois april 25 tweets by elon musk are shown on a computer april 25 2022 in chicago illinois it was announced today that twitter has accepted a 44 billion bid from musk to acquire the company photo illustration by scott olson getty images scott olson via getty images tesla and spacex ceo elon musk added twitter to his stable of companies on monday purchasing the social media platform for 44 billion dollars whether he made this purchase to finally realize his aspirations as a free speech absolutist or just did it to put an end to his nemesis elonjet once and for all remains to be seen but changes are abound for the internet s third favorite hellsite engadget s reporters have some thoughts on what those might be there are only two predictions i feel confident making twitter will get an edit button and employees are going to head for the door even under the best of circumstances big acquisitions tend to result in a fair amount of employee turnover and executive shakeup and for many tweeps musk taking over is very far from the best of circumstances musk rankled the twitter rank and file before the deal was even official with tweets about whether twitter was dying and whether the company s hq should be converted into a homeless shelter but now they have much more to worry about than his usual trolling musk s bid has already negatively impacted recruiting efforts according to the new york times and current employees still don t have clear answers on how musk s acquisition will affect their stock packages a significant portion of their total compensation there are also real existential questions about how musk s questionable views on content moderation will affect the company and the direction of the service as ceo parag agrawal reportedly told employees following the news once the deal closes we don t know what direction the platform will go karissa bell senior reporter it can t get much worse right while i m sure twitter s moderation policy will get watered down it s hard to imagine the doomsday scenarios where it turns into some kind of 4chan stormfront cesspool twitter is an international company with international advertisers and international users it s broadly bound to ensure its content is in line with the laws of the countries in which it operates which severely limits the ability to create the free speech oasis of musk s dreams at least if he also would like it to be a functional broadly breakeven company at the same time the company s moderation of its platform is already terrible and people either make do by going private blocking people or hi give up on the whole tweeting thing altogether so i m expecting more of the same which is to say i m expecting it to be mostly awful aaron souppouris executive editor i ve covered elon musk in his roles as both head of tesla and spacex for a few years now witnessing his sneering contempt for journalism transparency basic ethics and accountability up close and in person i ve sat through his easily disproved boasts his myriad empty promises and publicity stunts this is a man who belittles society s most vulnerable members to gain the panting adoration of 4chan trolls who demonizes the helpers to boost his own fragile ego a man who would declare himself god emperor of mars before paying his income taxes is this your king i dread the effects this sale will have not just for twitter itself but the internet writ large the destabilizing effects social media amplification has on societal and democratic norms have been well studied since the 2016 elections what is not yet fully understood is what happens when we hand control over that mechanism to the world s wealthiest contrarian as such my advice to you are the same wise words samuel l jackson had for us in jurassic park hold onto your butts andrew tarantola senior reporter i think the biggest challenge about trying to predict an elon musk led twitter is separating the guy s online persona from his business practices musk catches a lot of flak often deservedly for dumb or insensitive tweets something most other ceos know or have been trained to avoid but at the same time elon is a rather shrewd businessman separately helming what has become the world s biggest ev carmaker alongside the most successful private space aerospace company with tesla and spacex there s a clear pattern of high risk high reward behavior which due to a combination of luck and smarts has worked out so far musk gives the impression of being a move fast and break stuff type and his latest disruption looks to be bringing free speech or his version of it to twitter regardless of how that might impact others this potentially greenlights every tweet that s not explicitly inciting violence or distributing sensitive info like the plans for a nuclear bomb or whatever in the short term must will look to help boost twitter s bottom line which the company desperately needs after losing more than 200 million in 2021 engagement both good and bad sells and turning twitter into an even bigger battleground would almost certainly result in a quick spike in users musk might even do something silly like raise the limit on tweets to 420 characters down the line musk s plan to authenticate all humans sounds a lot like a different flavor of sam altman s troubled worldcoin endeavor and i d bet

on april 13 the reserve bank raised its official cash rate by 0 5 so it now sits at 1 5 compared with the record low of 0 25 in place from march 2020 until october last year the need for a cut in interest rates was clear because of the dire economic outlook associated with the global pandemic and closure of our borders but from over a year ago it was clear that our economy was not still shrinking that house prices were booming house construction soaring and people were spending on things like spas and couches as if there were no tomorrow the reserve bank should have started taking away the emergency 0 75 cut in its official cash rate early last year now they are having to raise interest rates rapidly not just because the economy does not need the extra stimulus but because inflation has surged on the back of supply chain disruptions and now russia s war against ukraine our central bank is playing catch up and the same period of accelerated interest rate rises is also getting underway in many other countries the one of greatest importance to us is the united states over there expectations of rapid interest rate rises have caused medium to long term interest rates to jump rapidly higher this has fed through into new jumps in our own medium to long term interest rates to put it more accurately the fixed rate costs to banks of borrowing money to lend at fixed interest rates have soared in recent weeks that is why we are still seeing fixed mortgage rates go up even though they have already risen a lot since this time a year ago in anticipation of the reserve bank picking up the pace on tightening monetary policy for the moment it remains cheaper to fix one year than for all other terms in fact fixed rates continue to rise the longer the term as yet the curve showing these rates is not flattening out what that means is that the gap between the likes of fixing three years and five years is not yet closing up three months ago the gap between the best rates offered by major lenders for three and five year periods was 0 26 and now it is 0 7 the gap between the one year and three year fixed mortgage has held steady near 1 but at some stage these gaps will shrink that generally happens when traders in the financial markets start thinking about when monetary policy will be eased rather than thinking only about the upcoming tightening we are not quite at that point in new zealand but potential for further rises in the five year fixed rate is diminishing by the week especially as the markets look to have got ahead of themselves picking that the cash rate will go to 4 my pick has long been 3 and i am sticking with it the reserve bank s pick is 3 25 or just above that at some point markets will adjust their time horison and become less worried about inflation when that happens the curve of fixed mortgage rates will start to flatten out and shortly after we will see the five year rate potentially falling while floating and short term fixed rates continue to rise i will write a lot about that when it happens because some people will look to jump from fixing one year or floating to locking in a five year rate but that will be a mistake and i will explain a lot more why that is the case when we get to that situation developing for now more and more people are shifting back to fixing one year feeling they have missed the boat on at least the three to five year rates many people are still fixing two years but that will ease off probably well before the end of this year to sign up to either my free weekly tony s view publication or weekly tview premium plus extras go to www tonyalexander nz
and now we know how the deal that cost 44 billion got done elon musk is the new owner over at twitter and the social media platform is set to change in a big way under his leadership as the deal enters its final stages before formal completion the brass at twitter are locking it down to prevent foul play and we re getting a look at what made the board accept the 44 billion offer it s been an interesting story since musk bought up some 9 percent of publicly available stocks earlier this month initially it looked like musk would become part of the board but that fell through next the board adopted a so called poison pill to discourage those seeking more than a 15 percent stake in the company and now they ve decided to accept elon s best and final offer of 54 20 per share and yes musk just had to throw in that 4 20 reference in there according to the announcement made by twitter itself certainty and financing had a large part to do with accepting the bid while musk was very clear about how much he was willing to pay about a 20 percent premium on the stock price before he acquired a stake there were concerns that he didn t actually have the cash to complete the sale read also elon musk s text feud with saudi fund show why you should get business done in writing once he made it clear through public filings that he did indeed have that money things came together quickly according to bloomberg the sale is such a sure thing at this point that the higher ups at twitter have locked the system down in a large way to keep employees who may be miffed about the deal from going rogue while musk was understandably excited and posted the above tweet ford spokesperson mike levine took a jab by posting a 2016 story that focused on how elon canceled the order of a super rude customer after the customer published a blog post that was critical of tesla let s hear it for free speech on twitter he remarked henrik fisker who has a long standing feud with elon musk apparently shut down his account upon hearing the takeover news henrik fisker no friend of elon has already deleted his twitter account fsr pic twitter com juvaipnfku john rosevear john__rosevear april 25 2022 it will be interesting to see how this acquisition affects the other brands that musk is so heavily involved with he is notorious for spending countless hours at both tesla and spacex so much so that he s been documented sleeping on the job site just to cut down on time away from the businesses themselves for what it s worth some have compared this acquisition to that of other billionaires who have bought newspapers jeff bezos owns the washington post laurene powell jobs has the atlantic and of course warren buffett owns a number of regional daily papers hey maybe now that musk owns an entire social media platform he can employ some pr people for tesla

chicago illinois april 25 tweets by elon musk are shown on a computer april 25 2022 in chicago illinois it was announced today that twitter has accepted a 44 billion bid from musk to acquire the company photo illustration by scott olson getty images scott olson via getty images tesla and spacex ceo elon musk added twitter to his stable of companies on monday purchasing the social media platform for 44 billion dollars whether he made this purchase to finally realize his aspirations as a free speech absolutist or just did it to put an end to his nemesis elonjet once and for all remains to be seen but changes are abound for the internet s third favorite hellsite engadget s reporters have some thoughts on what those might be there are only two predictions i feel confident making twitter will get an edit button and employees are going to head for the door even under the best of circumstances big acquisitions tend to result in a fair amount of employee turnover and executive shakeup and for many tweeps musk taking over is very far from the best of circumstances musk rankled the twitter rank and file before the deal was even official with tweets about whether twitter was dying and whether the company s hq should be converted into a homeless shelter but now they have much more to worry about than his usual trolling musk s bid has already negatively impacted recruiting efforts according to the new york times and current employees still don t have clear answers on how musk s acquisition will affect their stock packages a significant portion of their total compensation there are also real existential questions about how musk s questionable views on content moderation will affect the company and the direction of the service as ceo parag agrawal reportedly told employees following the news once the deal closes we don t know what direction the platform will go karissa bell senior reporter it can t get much worse right while i m sure twitter s moderation policy will get watered down it s hard to imagine the doomsday scenarios where it turns into some kind of 4chan stormfront cesspool twitter is an international company with international advertisers and international users it s broadly bound to ensure its content is in line with the laws of the countries in which it operates which severely limits the ability to create the free speech oasis of musk s dreams at least if he also would like it to be a functional broadly breakeven company at the same time the company s moderation of its platform is already terrible and people either make do by going private blocking people or hi give up on the whole tweeting thing altogether so i m expecting more of the same which is to say i m expecting it to be mostly awful aaron souppouris executive editor i ve covered elon musk in his roles as both head of tesla and spacex for a few years now witnessing his sneering contempt for journalism transparency basic ethics and accountability up close and in person i ve sat through his easily disproved boasts his myriad empty promises and publicity stunts this is a man who belittles society s most vulnerable members to gain the panting adoration of 4chan trolls who demonizes the helpers to boost his own fragile ego a man who would declare himself god emperor of mars before paying his income taxes is this your king i dread the effects this sale will have not just for twitter itself but the internet writ large the destabilizing effects social media amplification has on societal and democratic norms have been well studied since the 2016 elections what is not yet fully understood is what happens when we hand control over that mechanism to the world s wealthiest contrarian as such my advice to you are the same wise words samuel l jackson had for us in jurassic park hold onto your butts andrew tarantola senior reporter i think the biggest challenge about trying to predict an elon musk led twitter is separating the guy s online persona from his business practices musk catches a lot of flak often deservedly for dumb or insensitive tweets something most other ceos know or have been trained to avoid but at the same time elon is a rather shrewd businessman separately helming what has become the world s biggest ev carmaker alongside the most successful private space aerospace company with tesla and spacex there s a clear pattern of high risk high reward behavior which due to a combination of luck and smarts has worked out so far musk gives the impression of being a move fast and break stuff type and his latest disruption looks to be bringing free speech or his version of it to twitter regardless of how that might impact others this potentially greenlights every tweet that s not explicitly inciting violence or distributing sensitive info like the plans for a nuclear bomb or whatever in the short term must will look to help boost twitter s bottom line which the company desperately needs after losing more than 200 million in 2021 engagement both good and bad sells and turning twitter into an even bigger battleground would almost certainly result in a quick spike in users musk might even do something silly like raise the limit on tweets to 420 characters down the line musk s plan to authenticate all humans sounds a lot like a different flavor of sam altman s troubled worldcoin endeavor and i d bet there s way more crypto integration coming to the platform in general the big concern is that some of twitter s issues regarding harassment and abuse will continue to go unaddressed though that actually might be a feature moderation costs money and by pushing twitter down the free speech path elon conveniently might be able to absolve the company of having to protect its users while

musk s free speech advocacy seems to apply mostly to his own speech or that of his fans and promoters when it comes to his employees free speech musk demonstrates little tolerance musk has repeatedly sought control over what journalists bloggers analysts and other researchers say about his businesses their products and himself tesla and spacex ceo elon musk the world s wealthiest person on paper is buying twitter the social media platform he has relied on for years to promote his interests and shape his public image free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated said mr musk in a statement when the deal was announced monday feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here musk has characterized himself as a first amendment and free speech advocate for years for example in defending himself in a defamation lawsuit after calling a critic a pedo guy musk won and to argue that the sec infringed on his rights in a settlement agreement they struck and revised after the agency charged him with securities fraud in 2018 starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint sorry to be a free speech absolutist elon musk elonmusk march 5 2022 but as the atlantic bloomberg and others have pointed out musk s free speech advocacy seems to apply mostly to his own speech or that of his fans and promoters techdirt argues that musk lacks a serious understanding of free speech and even less about content moderation workers speech when it comes to his employees free speech musk demonstrates little tolerance under his leadership when tesla has laid off employees it s asked them to sign separation agreements including a strong non disparagement clause with no end date these kinds of agreements are not uncommon in the industry but musk is far from a free speech absolutist here a copy of one such agreement from tesla shared with cnbc by a former employee laid off in 2018 who did not sign the agreement said you agree not to disparage tesla the company s products or the company s officers directors employees shareholders and agents affiliates and subsidiaries in any manner likely to be harmful to them or their business business reputation or personal reputation in the same document tesla required laid off employees to keep details about the separation agreement itself hidden other than from their own lawyer accountant or immediate family not even other workers the provisions of this agreement will be held in strictest confidence by you and will not be publicized or disclosed in any manner whatsoever the agreement said in particular and without limitation you agree not to disclose the terms of this agreement to any current or former company employee or contractor like most large companies tesla also requires workers to sign an arbitration agreement upon employment that means to speak freely in court where their speech will become part of a public record workers need to get an exemption from the arbitration agreement from a judge first under musk s leadership of tesla scores of workers have alleged racist sexist and other types of harassment discrimination and unsafe working conditions many have also alleged retaliation after they spoke out about problems these allegations have been in the spotlight recently because of a newly revealed probe by the eeoc and a lawsuit by the california civil rights agency but the company has a long track record in august 2018 a former tesla security employee karl hansen filed a complaint with the u s securities and exchange commission saying he was wrongfully terminated from his job as an investigator at the company s battery plant in sparks nevada after sounding the alarm about the theft of tens of millions of dollars worth of raw materials there tesla hid the theft from shareholders he alleged even though it represented a material amount of money to the automaker at the time in november 2020 former tesla employee stephen henkes said he was fired from his job at tesla on aug 3 2020 after raising safety concerns internally then filing formal complaints with government offices when the company failed to fix and communicate accurately with customers over what he said were unacceptable fire risks in the company s solar installations both the cpsc and sec are considering henkes complaints as evidence free press musk has repeatedly sought control over what journalists bloggers analysts and other researchers say about his businesses their products and himself memorably the tesla ceo berated and cut off an analyst on an earnings call in 2018 excuse me next next boring bonehead questions are not cool the ceo said after a question about his company s capital requirements the automaker had just posted its worst quarterly loss in its history musk later apologized for this and now sometimes skips speaking on tesla earnings calls musk and tesla have also asked reporters to sign ndas or show story drafts to the company to obtain approvals before publishing i was once invited to visit spacex s facility on kwajalein following interviews i was told elonmusk had to review all articles prior to publication i explained journalism doesn t work that way his current tweets come as no surprise sharon weinberger weinbergersa may 24 2018 he has brazenly called on followers to edit his biography on wikipedia just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane musk tweeted btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing he said his legions of followers obliged editing the page to de emphasize his investments just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing elon musk elonmusk december 22 2019 musk even takes umbrage with fan blogs when they write about tesla s shortcomings at his direction tesla stopped inviting some electrek staff to company events after the site which has evolved into more of an electric vehicle blog in recent years published a story with this headline tesla is charging owners 1 500 for hardware they already paid for the story was accurate if humiliating to musk because it addresses his company s failure in the race to deliver autonomous vehicle tech to long waiting customers customers speech musk and tesla have also sought not always successfully to silence customers for example tesla used to compel customers to sign agreements containing non disclosure clauses as a prerequisite to have their vehicles repaired in 2021 tesla asked customers to agree not to post critically to social media about fsd beta an experimental driver assistance software package that some tesla owners could test out using their own cars and unpaid time to do so in an agreement that tesla sent to drivers earlier this year for fsd beta access the company asked them to keep your experiences in the program confidential and not to share any information about this program with the public including by taking screenshots creating blog posts or posting to social media sites tesla named facebook instagram reddit tiktok snapchat and youtube as sites where owners should not share info about their use of fsd beta according to a copy of the full agreement obtained by cnbc musk later lifted tesla s terms for access to fsd beta saying nobody was obeying the agreement anyway but the practice caused a probe by the federal vehicle safety authority nhtsa given that nhtsa relies on reports from consumers as an important source of information in evaluating potential safety defects any agreement that may prevent or dissuade participants in the early access beta release program from reporting safety concerns to nhtsa is unacceptable nhsa wrote in a letter to tesla in october 2021 meanwhile in china tesla has sued customers who complained about safety issues with their cars and sued a social media influencer there for defamation the influencer xiaogang xuezhang posted a video demonstrating issues with tesla s and another automakers automated emergency braking systems redaction tesla and musk attorneys have also consistently filed confidential treatment requests for legal and business filings in the us among other things tesla sought to hide from the public view vehicle safety information that federal auto regulators sought from the company as a routine investigative practice and business information tesla used to apply for tax subsidies from the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority attorneys on behalf of tesla and musk have also tried to keep transcripts and videos of employee and executive testimony hidden in cases before the delaware chancery court and other courts free speech for me musk has certainly exercised free speech rights for himself and his companies recently he said spacex satellite internet service starlink would keep russian news sources online despite what musk said were calls to block these by un named governments amid putin s brutal invasion of ukraine starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint musk wrote sorry to be a free speech absolutist on the labor front musk is also fighting an administrative court ruling which said he must remove a tweet from his feed because it violates workers rights the tweet posted in 2018 said nothing stopping tesla team at our car plant from voting union could do so tmrw if they wanted but why pay union dues give up stock options for nothing at tesla musk has shirked the requirement to have a securities law expert pre approve some of his tweets before posting them despite the settlement agreement he struck with the sec after it charged him with civil securities fraud musk told lesley stahl in a 2018 interview that generally his tweets are not supervised even though a court had ordered him to have some of them pre approved by securities law compliance experts at tesla if they contained information likely to impact tesla s stock price during that interview he said hello first amendment free speech is fundamental assuming he truly believes that then musk s

musk s free speech advocacy seems to apply mostly to his own speech or that of his fans and promoters when it comes to his employees free speech musk demonstrates little tolerance musk has repeatedly sought control over what journalists bloggers analysts and other researchers say about his businesses their products and himself tesla and spacex ceo elon musk the world s wealthiest person on paper is buying twitter the social media platform he has relied on for years to promote his interests and shape his public image free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated said mr musk in a statement when the deal was announced monday get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters musk has characterized himself as a first amendment and free speech advocate for years for example in defending himself in a defamation lawsuit after calling a critic a pedo guy musk won and to argue that the sec infringed on his rights in a settlement agreement they struck and revised after the agency charged him with securities fraud in 2018 starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint sorry to be a free speech absolutist elon musk elonmusk march 5 2022 but as the atlantic bloomberg and others have pointed out musk s free speech advocacy seems to apply mostly to his own speech or that of his fans and promoters techdirt argues that musk lacks a serious understanding of free speech and even less about content moderation workers speech when it comes to his employees free speech musk demonstrates little tolerance under his leadership when tesla has laid off employees it s asked them to sign separation agreements including a strong non disparagement clause with no end date these kinds of agreements are not uncommon in the industry but musk is far from a free speech absolutist here a copy of one such agreement from tesla shared with cnbc by a former employee laid off in 2018 who did not sign the agreement said you agree not to disparage tesla the company s products or the company s officers directors employees shareholders and agents affiliates and subsidiaries in any manner likely to be harmful to them or their business business reputation or personal reputation in the same document tesla required laid off employees to keep details about the separation agreement itself hidden other than from their own lawyer accountant or immediate family not even other workers the provisions of this agreement will be held in strictest confidence by you and will not be publicized or disclosed in any manner whatsoever the agreement said in particular and without limitation you agree not to disclose the terms of this agreement to any current or former company employee or contractor like most large companies tesla also requires workers to sign an arbitration agreement upon employment that means to speak freely in court where their speech will become part of a public record workers need to get an exemption from the arbitration agreement from a judge first under musk s leadership of tesla scores of workers have alleged racist sexist and other types of harassment discrimination and unsafe working conditions many have also alleged retaliation after they spoke out about problems these allegations have been in the spotlight recently because of a newly revealed probe by the eeoc and a lawsuit by the california civil rights agency but the company has a long track record in august 2018 a former tesla security employee karl hansen filed a complaint with the u s securities and exchange commission saying he was wrongfully terminated from his job as an investigator at the company s battery plant in sparks nevada after sounding the alarm about the theft of tens of millions of dollars worth of raw materials there tesla hid the theft from shareholders he alleged even though it represented a material amount of money to the automaker at the time in november 2020 former tesla employee stephen henkes said he was fired from his job at tesla on aug 3 2020 after raising safety concerns internally then filing formal complaints with government offices when the company failed to fix and communicate accurately with customers over what he said were unacceptable fire risks in the company s solar installations both the cpsc and sec are considering henkes complaints as evidence free press musk has repeatedly sought control over what journalists bloggers analysts and other researchers say about his businesses their products and himself memorably the tesla ceo berated and cut off an analyst on an earnings call in 2018 excuse me next next boring bonehead questions are not cool the ceo said after a question about his company s capital requirements the automaker had just posted its worst quarterly loss in its history musk later apologized for this and now sometimes skips speaking on tesla earnings calls musk and tesla have also asked reporters to sign ndas or show story drafts to the company to obtain approvals before publishing i was once invited to visit spacex s facility on kwajalein following interviews i was told elonmusk had to review all articles prior to publication i explained journalism doesn t work that way his current tweets come as no surprise sharon weinberger weinbergersa may 24 2018 he has brazenly called on followers to edit his biography on wikipedia just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane musk tweeted btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing he said his legions of followers obliged editing the page to de emphasize his investments just looked at my wiki for 1st time in years it s insane btw can someone please delete investor i do basically zero investing elon musk elonmusk december 22 2019 musk even takes umbrage with fan blogs when they write about tesla s shortcomings at his direction tesla stopped inviting some electrek staff to company events after the site which has evolved into more of an electric vehicle blog in recent years published a story with this headline tesla is charging owners 1 500 for hardware they already paid for the story was accurate if humiliating to musk because it addresses his company s failure in the race to deliver autonomous vehicle tech to long waiting customers customers speech musk and tesla have also sought not always successfully to silence customers for example tesla used to compel customers to sign agreements containing non disclosure clauses as a prerequisite to have their vehicles repaired in 2021 tesla asked customers to agree not to post critically to social media about fsd beta an experimental driver assistance software package that some tesla owners could test out using their own cars and unpaid time to do so in an agreement that tesla sent to drivers earlier this year for fsd beta access the company asked them to keep your experiences in the program confidential and not to share any information about this program with the public including by taking screenshots creating blog posts or posting to social media sites tesla named facebook instagram reddit tiktok snapchat and youtube as sites where owners should not share info about their use of fsd beta according to a copy of the full agreement obtained by cnbc musk later lifted tesla s terms for access to fsd beta saying nobody was obeying the agreement anyway but the practice caused a probe by the federal vehicle safety authority nhtsa given that nhtsa relies on reports from consumers as an important source of information in evaluating potential safety defects any agreement that may prevent or dissuade participants in the early access beta release program from reporting safety concerns to nhtsa is unacceptable nhsa wrote in a letter to tesla in october 2021 meanwhile in china tesla has sued customers who complained about safety issues with their cars and sued a social media influencer there for defamation the influencer xiaogang xuezhang posted a video demonstrating issues with tesla s and another automakers automated emergency braking systems redaction tesla and musk attorneys have also consistently filed confidential treatment requests for legal and business filings in the us among other things tesla sought to hide from the public view vehicle safety information that federal auto regulators sought from the company as a routine investigative practice and business information tesla used to apply for tax subsidies from the california alternative energy and advanced transportation financing authority attorneys on behalf of tesla and musk have also tried to keep transcripts and videos of employee and executive testimony hidden in cases before the delaware chancery court and other courts free speech for me musk has certainly exercised free speech rights for himself and his companies recently he said spacex satellite internet service starlink would keep russian news sources online despite what musk said were calls to block these by un named governments amid putin s brutal invasion of ukraine starlink has been told by some governments not ukraine to block russian news sources we will not do so unless at gunpoint musk wrote sorry to be a free speech absolutist on the labor front musk is also fighting an administrative court ruling which said he must remove a tweet from his feed because it violates workers rights the tweet posted in 2018 said nothing stopping tesla team at our car plant from voting union could do so tmrw if they wanted but why pay union dues give up stock options for nothing at tesla musk has shirked the requirement to have a securities law expert pre approve some of his tweets before posting them despite the settlement agreement he struck with the sec after it charged him with civil securities fraud musk told lesley stahl in a 2018 interview that generally his tweets are not supervised even though a court had ordered him to have some of them pre approved by securities law compliance experts at tesla if they contained information likely to impact tesla s stock price during that interview he said hello first amendment free speech is fundamental assuming he truly believes that then musk s free speech absolutism is only aspirational but by controlling the social network musk can protect his ability to keep using twitter to promote his companies investments and himself as he wants to be seen
elon musk the world s richest man reaches deal to buy twitter for 44b in this photo illustration news about elon musk s bid to takeover twitter is tweeted on april 25 2022 in chicago illinois it was announced today that twitter has accepted a 44 billion bid from musk to acquire the company photo illustration by scott olson getty images new york united states elon musk the world s richest man struck a deal monday to buy twitter for 44 billion capping a saga complete with hostile takeover threats before delivering him personal control of one of the most influential social media platforms on the planet twitter famously served as a megaphone for former us president donald trump before the platform banned him and musk a self proclaimed free speech absolutist has said he wants to reform what he sees as the platform s over zealous content moderation free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated musk said in a statement released by twitter i also want to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans however advocacy groups were wary of the type of content musk might allow on the platform and derrick johnson president of the naacp civil rights organization tweeted do not allow twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech misinformation or disinformation protecting our democracy is of utmost importance at the white house press secretary jen psaki said no matter who owns or runs twitter president joe biden himself a twitter user is concerned about the power of large social media platforms twitter stock closed 5 6 percent higher in new york trading back against the wall musk bought a nine percent stake in twitter earlier in april then offered to buy the whole company outright citing a mission of preserving free speech while the firm s board initially said it was reviewing his offer it later rebuffed him and adopted a poison pill plan that would have made it harder for musk to acquire a controlling position but last week musk whose immense wealth stems from the popularity of tesla electric vehicles as well as other ventures said he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing comprised of debt a margin loan and his personal fortune dan ives an analyst at wedbush securities predicted earlier in the day that since the board could not find another buyer it would likely accept his offer this basically put their back against the wall they had to come to the negotiation table he said in an interview on cnbc the publicly traded firm will now become a private company owned by musk who negotiated a purchase price of 54 20 per share twitter said twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important the company s ceo parag agrawal said in a tweet trump downplays return musk s efforts have raised hopes about the commercial potential of twitter which has struggled to achieve profitable growth despite its important spot in culture and politics under agrawal who took over as twitter ceo late last year the company has made progress on new monetization features such as subscription products truist securities said in a note adding that short term musk s involvement at this stage runs the risk of disrupting those efforts progressive groups were particularly concerned that musk may permit a return to the platform by trump who was banned from twitter after last year s assault on the us capitol by his supporters seeking to overturn the 2020 presidential election result the sale of twitter to elon musk would be a victory for disinformation and the people who peddle it musk could unleash a wave of toxicity and harassment and undo twitter s efforts to increase quality engagement and make its platform safer for users angelo carusone president of media matters for america said in a statement in an interview with fox news trump said i am not going on twitter preferring instead to stay on his truth social media network i hope elon buys twitter because he ll make improvements to it and he is a good man but i am going to be staying on truth he said

twitter s acceptance of elon musk s roughly 44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire tesla ceo one step closer to owning the social media platform the deal is expected to close sometime this

substantial cash premium and would be the best path forward for twitter s stockholders when twitter s board adopted an anti takeover provision known as a poison pill just 10 days ago the move was widely seen as a telltale sign that the directors were gearing up to rebuff musk s opening offer or perhaps seek another suitor willing to pay more but the battleground shifted dramatically late last week when musk disclosed he had lined up 46 5 billion including 21 billion of his personal fortune to pay for the purchase musk said other investors could contribute to the financing the locked in financing not only underscored the seriousness of musk s pursuit but also appeared to open the door to other large twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the san francisco

income of 3 3 billion during the first three months of this year alone elon musk announced thursday morning that he wants to buy twitter what would his purchase of the social media platform mean for our society and what does it say about the growing power and influence of the billionaire class in our world what happens next as is customary once a company agrees to be acquired the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren t any red flags that haven t come up via the company s public filings this step in the process isn t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal said angelo zino tech analyst at cfra he s acquiring this company not from a financial perspective zino said he s going to do what he wants with it and he s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company what say could regulators have last year twitter generated 5 billion in revenue with 2 8 billion from the u s and the rest earned overseas zino said the federal trade commission in the u s or the european commission in the eu are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed twitter buyout the main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry or whether it violates antitrust laws these reviews can take months or longer but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining or in the case of a single buyer whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry neither tesla nor musk s other company space exploration technologies or spacex are social media platforms so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal analysts said we do not expect any major

jewellery industry it also raises a number of ethical and control issues note this article was originally published in 2013 to read more about recent developments about lab created and natural diamonds please see jeweller s great diamond debate part i and part ii where industry experts weigh in on the discussion when jeweller spoke with stephen lux in late october 2012 lux sounded excited the ceo of gemesis diamond company was discussing the company s visit to the international jewellery fair sydney ijfs to promote the addition of lab created colourless diamonds and a luxury jewellery line to the group s new direct to public website it seemed a positive end to what had been a mixed year for the florida based group that claimed to be the world s principal producer of gem quality lab created diamonds and jewellery in the october interview lux listed the group s 2012 highlights as perfecting our fancy yellow colour which has previously been an orange ish colouration but is now very clearly a vivid fancy yellow and bringing colourless diamonds to market using chemical vapour deposition cvd technology gemesis was the first company to do so and lux called the news the most significant development for us this year he also talked about the group s plans to increase production of type iia colourless diamonds gems with no measurable nitrogen impurities at sizes of between 0 40 carats and 1 35 carats colour grades between g and m and clarity grades between vvs1 and si2 he pointed out that the new sizes represented a huge leap forward from the maximum size of 0 75 carats that the group could produce when it first announced its cvd breakthrough in november 2010 natural vs man made the heated debate cvd gives us the ability to make a purer higher quality diamond lux said when we first announced colourless diamonds 75 points was large for us now we re up to 1 3 carats so the technology is evolving quickly and we should be incrementing upwards for some time a change in direction the mood of the october 2012 interview was overwhelmingly positive and lux detailed gemesis plans for the future with great enthusiasm however two months later stephen lux was gone stepping down as ceo while i can t get into too many specifics as to the reasons for my decision to leave it is fair to conclude that the joy of building something special with the growing sales of the lab created diamonds has been overshadowed by the other distractions lux told jck the internal situation had made it difficult to focus on the long term objectives of the company the distractions included the inference made by de beers diamond trading company dtc that gemesis may have been behind the circulation of a sample of undisclosed synthetic diamonds that was discovered by an igi laboratory in antwerp in may 2012 this discovery came at a time when gemesis was celebrating outstanding test results for its colourless diamonds at the gemological institute of america gia it was march 2012 when gemesis began marketing in earnest its lab created colourless diamonds using cvd a less expensive technology than the high pressure high temperature hpht method the company uses to manufacture fancy coloured diamonds prior to this the gia purchased 16 of these cvd created round brilliant colourless diamonds for testing in sizes ranging from 0 24 carats to 0 86 carats the ensuing report titled 2012 the year synthetic diamonds made their mark ruled that the stones were comparable to top natural diamonds most were near colourless and were graded f g on the gia 4cs d z scale for diamond colour the report specifies three were graded i j and the largest 0 90 carat was a rectangle cut graded l all of the stones were high clarity vvs or vs one was graded internally flawless lux said back in october that the result was not unexpected we were ecstatic with gia s findings but not surprised although we were surprised that they were so candid about the high quality we were particularly happy with the way the report was phrased because it truly told the consumer that what we re creating is the same as what comes out of the ground testing concerns the ability of colourless lab created diamonds to pass as mined diamonds raises all manners of ethical concerns mainly what would happen if they are ever sold as naturally formed diamonds and introduced into the market undetected such concerns were tested in may 2012 when the igi laboratory in antwerp belgium received a package of around 1 000 stones marked as natural polished diamonds and fully priced as such subsequent testing showed more than 600 of the diamonds to be lab created and also of a high quality vvs vs clarity with excellent and very good polish and symmetry furthermore igi determined that the presence of impurities such as feathers pinpoints and small dark crystals were intentionally introduced and that the diamonds appeared to be created to defraud leading global diamond expert chaim even zohar remarked in a report on the israeli diamond industry website titled synthetics specifically made to defraud that the sample came from a stock selection many times larger meaning it was possible that the number of undisclosed synthetics already released into the market may run into many thousands of stones worth many millions of dollars in a letter written to even zohar at the time lux stated with 100 per cent certainty that the undisclosed cvd diamonds did not come from his company and that other companies exist that are capable of supplying quantities of cvd diamonds equal to the amount discovered in antwerp lux also dismissed claims that gemesis cvd diamonds were more recognisable than cvd diamonds created in other laboratories cvd diamonds whether made by gemesis or others will be indistinguishable from each other he wrote adding just because an unscrupulous supplier may have cvd diamonds that demonstrate the high quality of gemesis does not mean they are gemesis the issue intensified further with news reported in january 2013 that steven lux didn t resign but was terminated from his position lux is now suing his former employer for wrongful termination the legal papers carry the revelation that 100 per cent of gemesis was acquired by power capital ventures ltd pcv on 31 october 2012 previously it has been reported that gemesis was owned by jatin r mehta the principal of india s winsome diamonds formerly su raj diamonds mehta is reported to have invested us 8 4m in return for 50 1 per cent of the group when gemesis was approaching bankruptcy in 2010 and later acquired the remaining shareholders by october 2012 under mehta the gemesis corporation changed names to gemesis diamond company and shifted its diamond manufacturing operations from florida to malaysia in a bid to lower production costs and better protect the company s intellectual property according to a may 2012 report by even zohar titled the mystery of two gemesis companies under one hat e commerce sales model the company also flagged ambitions to move to a direct to public e commerce sales model something that eventuated in 2012 with the launch of gemesis com adding further intrigue the true origin of the 600 or so lab created but undisclosed gems that arrived in antwerp remains inconclusive but even zohar reported that the trail of invoices involved in the transaction led back to the new york office of mehta s own su raj diamonds and jewellery usa now winsome diamonds this does not guarantee that the diamonds are in any way associated with gemesis and any connection between the two companies remains opaque if existent at all more confusion a further source of much industry confusion came with the emergence of a second gemesis company based in singapore that features an entirely different board to that of gemesis american operations in fact even zohar reported no connection at all between the two companies except for the involvement of investor mehta and who does not occupy a board seat recruitment advertisements placed by each firm suggest singapore specialises in cvd technology for the purposes of growing rectangular crystals for industrial use and gems for jewellery use while malaysia gemesis us operations specialises in gems created using hpht technology it s all a little confusing as well as inconclusive and jeweller stresses that none of this is any proof that the company has been acting improperly what is clearer is that the mere allegation of gemesis involvement in the igi scandal has unequivocally undermined the group s big 2012 developments colourless gems and a new online website both of which had the power to dramatically boost gemesis reputation and sales could the company have been tarred with the wrong brush by an industry nervous about the emergence of the gia report the group s production levels are comparably low suggesting any such paranoia would be misplaced and gemesis penetration of the global consumer diamond markets remains modest at best and almost non existent here in australia how many diamonds but the question remains just how many diamonds does gemesis have lux was quick to point out that gemesis production levels as of october 2012 presented no threat to the natural diamond sector this is not going to threaten the mined diamond industry it will be generations before there are such quantities during his tenure lux remained determined to assure the industry that gemesis had a non negotiable policy utmost transparency full disclosure has been and will continue to be one of our very basic tenants lux said in october we inscribe all of our diamonds to ensure they are unmistakably gemesis and every diamond on our website carries a pdf certificate that can be viewed immediately in consumer terms what the gia report really says is that lab created diamonds can now achieve a comparable quality to natural diamonds it also throws into question nomenclature surrounding lab created diamonds and specifically the industry s insistence upon the term synthetic which is correctly applied here if referring to a diamond not of natural origin but not necessarily correctly applied here if intended to mean artificial furthermore the gemesis group s consistent achievement of vvs and vs type iia diamonds within the 0 40 carat to 1 30 carat range sends a clear message to the industry that the company can now comfortably and confidently provide direct competition in the young bridal market sweet spot of 40 points to 1 carat for the first time consumers retailers and designers present within this range now have a legitimate choice between two types of colourless diamond products natural and lab created at two fairly different price points not cheaper throughout the interview lux worked hard to play down suggestions that the price of lab created gems was not significantly cheaper than their mined counterparts claiming instead that the complex processes of lab creation kept prices up and that the ecological and ethical benefits of hpht diamonds injected value that was accurately reflected in the price these diamonds are never going to be cheap to produce because we re re creating what was done in nature and it has to be done the same way for a consumer to appreciate the beauty that comes out lux said we can t use price as the only offering to the customer and we haven t had to do that anyway because people now recognise multiple benefits when looking at our diamonds the process is far more energy efficient that what it takes to move tonnes of earth and the origin of each diamond is absolutely known before leaving the company lux listed gemesis central 2013 goal as boosting consumer education stating that the aim in the coming year was to inform consumers that lab created diamonds were indeed real diamonds gemesis consumers know they come away with a diamond it s not a question that it is a diamond and that it is conflict free they also have the assurance of a diamond certificate our generous return policy eco friendly comfort and an attractive price ultimately it s hard for someone to sit there and say they disagree with all those points the future of gemesis diamond company remains unclear but recent company statements have denied rumours of instability ignored questions about ownership and assured the industry that it is business as usual while the company may not currently have the production capacity to impact the industry 95 000 fans on the group s facebook page exist as solid proof that the word is spreading synthetic diamonds make their mark gia dubbed 2012 the year that synthetic diamonds made their mark after the lab s own test results further dismantled the industry s long held and anecdotal argument that lab created diamonds must be inferior in clarity carat cut and colour but there are many more issues to be overcome if nothing else gia s report heralds a fundamental message the technology has arrived irrespective of who is around to control it indeed amidst the hullabaloo surrounding gemesis another company washington diamonds threw its hat into the ring in september 2012 claiming it would produce 150 one carat stones per month for a total production run of more than 2 200 diamonds a year and sell the diamonds directly to the public online for about 25 per cent less than comparable mined diamonds consumer reluctance and the sale of boston based apollo diamonds to scio diamond technologies in september 2011 would suggest that more companies will follow it seems the barriers to any increase in the popularity and longevity of lab created diamonds in the open marketplace are no longer technological but related to the prohibitive cost and difficulty of large scale production and a general consumer reluctance to adopt lab created diamonds as equals in the meantime whatever moves the industry can make to encourage or enforce transparency remain of utmost importance gemesis diamond company now operates under the trading name pure grown diamonds the most current statement released by pure grown diamonds stated it was a privately held company based in new york and founded in 2013 view latest updates on this topic to download pdf version click here the great diamond debate issues
it s official elon musk is set to buy twitter the social media giant confirmed monday the tesla ceo and billionaire will acquire the company in a deal worth 44 billion once the deal is complete which is expected by this year twitter will become a privately held company free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated musk tweeted to his 84 million followers i also want to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans shares of twitter rose more than 5 in afternoon trading monday twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world its ceo parag agrawal said in a tweet deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important the deal comes nearly three months after musk started buying twitter shares with his stake growing from 5 to more than 9 and serious overtures that he wanted to control the social media platform musk s acquisition also comes nearly five months after founder and ceo jack dorsey stepped aside as ceo and named agrawal as his replacement late monday dorsey tweeted his approval of musk s taking over twitter saying he was happy that twitter will continue to serve the public conversation around the world while dorsey said in principle that he doesn t believe anyone should own or run twitter as the platform wants to be a public good at a protocol level not a company but in terms of twitter being an actual company dorsey said musk is the singular solution i trust and as well as musk s mission to extend the light of consciousness elon s goal of creating a platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is the right one this is also paraga s goal and why i chose him dorsey said thank you both for getting the company out of an impossible situation this is the right path i believe it with all my heart earlier monday musk tweeted i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means the tweet has received more than 1 4 million likes last week musk said he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter and had been continuing to negotiate with the company twitter under elon musk what twitter would look like if tesla and spacex billionaire ceo was running it exclusive asian women are shut out of leadership at america s top companies our data shows why inflation s impact this economist bucks conventional wisdom on curbing inflation his solution isn t easy musk has criticized how strictly twitter moderates content on its platform free speech is essential to a functioning democracy do you believe twitter rigorously adheres to this principle he tweeted this month eventually musk scooped up that 9 stake in the company earlier this month which made him one of twitter s largest shareholders twitter responded by announcing plans to have musk join its board of directors that deal would have prevented musk from owning more than 14 9 of twitter s outstanding stock for as long as he s a board member and for 90 days after days later agrawal tweeted that musk had decided not to join the board musk then confirmed in a regulatory filing that he planned to acquire the company i invested in twitter as i believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe and i believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy musk said in the proposal however since making my investment i now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form twitter needs to be transformed as a private company despite its cultural influence twitter with an estimated 416 million weekly users as of april 16 according to data ai a mobile data and analytics platform the platform has lagged behind social media rivals including the meta owned facebook and instagram snapchat and tiktok other experts have twitter at around 200 million users still far less than tiktok s 1 billion users according to backlinko com twitter s lag includes being behind rivals in several key metrics including monthly active users and the number of weekly app downloads globally data ai said twitter is a struggling company sara silver a business journalism professor at quinnipiac university said in a statement it lost money the last two years and was only profitable in two of the last five this contrasts sharply with facebook owner meta alphabet s google and other highly profitable social media platforms silver said twitter s board had no choice but to take musk s offer seriously with no profits twitter could not raise its stock price enough to satisfy investors this gives a hefty premium to shareholders of at least 35 percent over its price before the offer and despite all of musk s boasting about free speech and content moderation he may have an opportunity to monetize a good product said callie cox an analyst for etoro who has more than 25 000 twitter followers profitability is what twitter shareholders have been waiting for new leadership could provide new thoughts on how to improve and monetize the platform said cox who considers herself a power user on twitter and with such a high stake in the business he could be under more pressure to perform delete twitter here s a step by step guide to permanently remove your account will trump return to twitter it s been widely speculated that if musk got control of twitter and take the platform private he would reinstate the accounts of certain voices including former u s president donald trump but trump appears to be not interested i am not going on twitter i am going to stay on truth trump told fox news before musk s deal was announced i hope elon buys twitter because he ll make improvements to it and he is a good man but i am going to be staying on truth trump also told fox news he will begin truthing over the next week trump was suspended permanently not only from twitter but also from facebook instagram and snapchat following the capitol riot on jan 6 2021 twitter banned trump citing several of his tweets in connection to the deadly riot as inflammatory and warned of the risk of further incitement of violence meanwhile in the nation s capital white house press secretary jen psaki said monday that she would not comment on a specific transaction when asked about musk s purchase no matter who owns or runs twitter the president has long been concerned about the power of large social media platforms the power they have over our everyday lives psaki said she said the president has long argued that tech platforms must be held accountable for harms they cause and supports reforms to section 230 the law that undergirds much of how social media operates in the u s and new antitrust reforms to require more transparency psaki declined to say whether the white house has concerns about whether twitter under musk s leadership could reinstate trump s twitter access or lead to the dissemination of more election disinformation at this point we don t have any sense of what the policies will look like she said however naacp president derrick johnson has a stern message for musk if he considers letting trump back on twitter do not allow 45 to return to the platform do not allow twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy johnson said in a statement sent to usa today protecting our democracy is of utmost importance especially as the midterm elections approach mr musk lives are at risk and so is american democracy and sen elizabeth warren d mass apparently agrees she tweeted monday that musk s acquisition of twitter is dangerous for our democracy even musk s space rival and fellow billionaire amazon and blue origin founder jeff bezos tweeted something interesting question did the chinese government just gain a bit of leverage over the town square cox the etoro analyst said while she welcomes innovation as a woman on twitter she s also experienced a good deal of harassment and have colleagues who have even received death threats she hopes musk will be able to curtail that while one of twitter s strengths is the ability to curate looser content moderation could threaten the safety of minority demographics cox said ultimately a hostile platform could create a chilling effect on free speech which is the opposite scenario elon musk is angling for congressman jim jordan r ohio tweeted monday before musk s acquisition how crazy will the left go if they accept his bid jordan later tweeted after the deal free speech is making a comeback the house judiciary gop s twitter account echoed a similar sentiment elon twitter freedom congresswoman marjorie taylor greene r ga whose personal account was permanently banned from twitter for repeatedly violating the platform s misinformation policy for her tweets about covid 19 said monday on her congressional twitter account that i should get my personal twitter account restored how will musk deal affect twitter users experts are still trying to figure out what musk actually wants to do with twitter wedbush securities analyst dan ives told usa today on monday thought that a deal would get done within the next 24 hours if not sooner it all came down to no other bidders or white knights emerging in the mergers and acquisitions process and twitter s board back was against the wall once musk detailed his 46 billion in financing last week to get pen to paper on this deal ives said we do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with musk owning twitter ives added that the twitter board bought some extra time with the poison pill but ultimately had to get to the negotiation table with musk to get this deal done as the clock struck midnight on twitter s history as a public company scott kessler global sector lead for technology media at third bridge said in a statement that it seems that major changes are ahead for twitter if musk succeeds but the specifics at this point are pretty lacking musk has tweeted about the importance of free speech and an edit button kessler added he wants people with big twitter followings to become more active on the platform he favors monetization through subscriptions versus advertising angelo carusone the president of media matters for america a politically left leaning nonprofit media watchdog group said in a statement that musk buying twitter would be a victory for disinformation and the people who peddle it carusone believes that musk could unleash a wave of toxicity and harassment and undo twitter s efforts to increase quality engagement and attempts to make the platform safer for users handing musk the reins to twitter will undoubtedly unleash the conspiracy theories that the platform has attempted to squelch and any attempt to use the platform for legitimate information sharing will be overshadowed by a toxic cesspool of misinformation carusone said he added the only thing worse than twitter re platforming the likes of donald trump and alex jones as well as reversing course in dealing with disinformation and extremists is the perverse pressure it ll create on other major social media platforms effectively igniting a race to the bottom contributing joseph garrison scott gleeson maria jimenez moya and the associated press

elon musk buys twitter for 44b and will privatize company matt rourke ap elon musk reached an agreement to buy twitter for roughly 44 billion on monday promising a more lenient touch to policing content on the social media platform where he the world s richest person promotes his interests attacks critics and opines on a wide range of issues to more than 83 million followers the outspoken tesla ceo has said he wanted to own and privatize twitter because he thinks it s not living up to its potential as a platform for free speech musk said in a joint statement with twitter that he wants to make the service better than ever with new features while getting rid of automated spam accounts and making its algorithms open to the public to increase trust free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated the 50 year old musk said adding hearts stars and rocket emojis in a tweet that highlighted the statement the more hands off approach to content moderation that musk envisions has many users concerned that the platform will become more of a haven for disinformation hate speech and bullying something it has worked hard in recent years to mitigate wall street analysts said if he goes too far it could also alienate advertisers the deal was cemented roughly two weeks after the billionaire first revealed a 9 stake in the platform musk said last week that he had lined up 46 5 billion in financing to buy twitter putting pressure on the company s board to negotiate a deal twitter said the transaction was unanimously approved by its board of directors and is expected to close in 2022 pending regulatory sign off and the approval of shareholders shares of twitter inc rose more than 5 monday to 51 70 per share on april 14 musk announced an offer to buy twitter for 54 20 per share while the stock is up sharply since musk made his offer it is well below the high of 77 per share it reached in february 2021 musk has described himself as a free speech absolutist but is also known for blocking or disparaging other twitter users who question or disagree with him in recent weeks he has proposed relaxing twitter content restrictions such as the rules that suspended former president donald trump s account while ridding the platform of fake spambot accounts and shifting away advertising as its primary revenue model musk believes he can increase revenue through subscriptions that give paying customers a better experience possibly even an ad free version of twitter asked during a recent ted interview if there are any limits to his notion of free speech musk said twitter would abide by national laws that restrict speech around the world beyond that he said he d be very reluctant to delete posts or permanently banning users who violate the company s rules it won t be perfect musk added but i think we want it to really have the perception and reality that speech is as free as reasonably possible after the deal was announced the naacp released a statement urging musk not to allow trump the 45th president back onto the platform do not allow 45 to return to the platform the civil rights organization said in a statement do not allow twitter to become a petri dish for hate speech or falsehoods that subvert our democracy as both candidate and president trump made twitter a powerful megaphone for speaking directly to the public often using incendiary and divisive language on hot button issues he was permanently banned from the service in the aftermath of the jan 6 storming of the capitol advertisers currently twitter s main customers have also pushed for the stronger content rules musk has criticized keeping them happy requires moderation limiting hate speech so that brands aren t trying to promote their products next to calls for genocide said siva vaidhyanathan a media studies professor at the university of virginia if musk either fires or drives away the team at twitter that s committed to keeping it clean and making it less hate filled he ll see an immediate drop in user activity said vaidhyanathan i think he s going to find pretty fast that inviting the bigots back in is bad for business some users said monday that they were planning to quit the platform if musk took it over to which he responded on twitter i hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech means musk has also run into trouble with federal officials as a result of his own tweets some of which he s used to taunt regulators at the securities and exchange commission in one august 2018 tweet for instance musk asserted that he had the funding to take tesla private for 420 a share although a court has ruled that it wasn t true that led to an sec investigation that musk is still fighting more recently musk appeared to have violated sec rules that required him to disclose that he d acquired a 5 stake in twitter instead he waited until he had more than 9 experts say these issues aren t likely to affect his twitter acquisition while twitter s user base of more than 200 million remains much smaller than those of rivals such as facebook and tiktok the service is popular with celebrities world leaders journalists and intellectuals musk himself is a prolific tweeter with a following that rivals several pop stars in the ranks of the most popular accounts last week he said in sec documents that the money would come from morgan stanley and other banks some of it secured by his huge stake in tesla the electric vehicle company he runs musk has a fortune of nearly 268 billion much of which is tied up in tesla stock and spacex his privately held space company it s unclear how much cash musk holds musk began making his fortune in 1999 when he sold zip2 an online mapping and business directory to compaq for 307 million he used his share to create what would become paypal an internet service that bypassed banks and allowed consumers to pay businesses directly it was sold to ebay for 1 5 billion in 2002 that same year musk founded space exploration technologies or spacex after finding that cost constraints were limiting nasa s interplanetary travel the company eventually developed cost effective reusable rockets in 2004 musk was courted to invest in tesla then a startup trying to build an electric car eventually he became ceo and led the company to astronomical success as the world s most valuable automaker and largest seller of electric vehicles musk s pledge to make twitter a haven for free speech could dim the appeal of donald trump s troubled truth social app which the former president has touted as a competitor to twitter that would cater to conservatives truth social is part of trump s new media company which has agreed to be taken public by digital world acquisition corp shares of dwac dropped 16 2 monday and are down 46 since musk revealed his stake in twitter __

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video the deal is expected to close sometime this year but shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter operates washington twitter s acceptance of elon musk s roughly 44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire tesla ceo one step closer to owning the social media platform the deal is expected to close sometime this year but before that shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter does business before the deal is completed questions also remain about what exactly could change about the platform what could change for twitter users musk has not released an official list of changes but he has expressed interest in a number of updates musk has also suggested a need for long form tweets replying on a twitter thread my most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that twitter is way overdue for long form tweets perhaps most notably musk has blasted west coast high tech as the de facto arbiter of free speech and in his most recent ted talk said that he would limit what twitter would moderate beyond what is required by the laws of the countries it operates in offer accepted now what the process is off to a good start for musk given that twitter s board has unanimously approved his offer and is recommending shareholders do the same upon announcing the deal monday twitter noted that the bid which represents a 38 premium to the company s closing stock price on april 1 is a substantial cash premium and would be the best path forward for twitter s stockholders when twitter s board adopted an anti takeover provision known as a poison pill just 10 days ago the move was widely seen as a telltale sign that the directors were gearing up to rebuff musk s opening offer or perhaps seek another suitor willing to pay more but the battleground shifted dramatically late last week when musk disclosed he had lined up 46 5 billion including 21 billion of his personal fortune to pay for the purchase musk said other investors could contribute to the financing the locked in financing not only underscored the seriousness of musk s pursuit but also appeared to open the door to other large twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the san francisco company the details of those conversations aren t known but musk could point to a more than 20 year history building and running several businesses most notably as the longtime ceo of tesla the electric car maker is currently valued at 1 trillion roughly 25 times more than twitter i think there is nothing better for twitter than elon musk buying it and ideally replacing the board and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue generating sources said john meyer a technology entrepreneur and investor musk has the track record that he can do the impossible it would be easy to see why other twitter shareholders might welcome a shake up as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment before musk disclosed his 9 stake in twitter earlier this month the shares were trading below 40 not that much more it its 26 price when twitter went public in november 2013 since then the tech driven nasdaq has more than tripled even after a recent downturn twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster revenue growth compared to the two dominant forces in digital advertising google and facebook meanwhile tesla s stock is now worth nearly 300 times more than when it went public in 2010 and after struggling to make money for more than a decade the automaker is now extremely profitable with net income of 3 3 billion during the first three months of this year alone what happens next as is customary once a company agrees to be acquired the buyer gets to take a closer look at its books to make sure there aren t any red flags that haven t come up via the company s public filings this step in the process isn t likely to cause any obstacles for the deal said angelo zino tech analyst at cfra he s acquiring this company not from a financial perspective zino said he s going to do what he wants with it and he s probably going to look to make significant changes to the business model of the company what say could regulators have last year twitter generated 5 billion in revenue with 2 8 billion from the u s and the rest earned overseas zino said the federal trade commission in the u s or the european commission in the eu are among regulatory agencies that may review the proposed twitter buyout the main issues the agencies generally focus on are how the sale of a company could affect competition in an industry or whether it violates antitrust laws these reviews can take months or longer but generally represent more of a potential hurdle when two companies in the same industry are combining or in the case of a single buyer whether ownership already has a large stake in companies within the same industry neither tesla nor musk s other company space exploration technologies or spacex are social media platforms so antitrust concerns are not expected to arise when regulators review the deal analysts said we do not expect any major regulatory hurdles to the deal getting done as this soap opera now ends with musk owning twitter wedbush analyst daniel ives wrote in a research note monday when do shareholders get to vote the deal is expected to close in 2022 subject to the approval of twitter shareholders twitter hasn t announced the timing of a shareholder vote though the company s annual meeting is set for may 25 which could offer a convenient time to poll shareholders a company can elect to hold a shareholder vote at any time even before regulators have finished reviewing a proposed takeover

twitter s acceptance of elon musk s roughly 44 billion takeover bid brings the billionaire tesla ceo one step closer to owning the social media platform the deal is expected to close sometime this year but before that shareholders still have to weigh in as well as regulators in the u s and in countries where twitter does business before the deal is completed offer accepted now what the process is off to a good start for musk given that twitter s board has unanimously approved his offer and is recommending shareholders do the same upon announcing the deal monday twitter noted that the bid which represents a 38 premium to the company s closing stock price on april 1 is a substantial cash premium and would be the best path forward for twitter s stockholders when twitter s board adopted an anti takeover provision known as a poison pill just 10 days ago the move was widely seen as a telltale sign that the directors were gearing up to rebuff musk s opening offer or perhaps seek another suitor willing to pay more but the battleground shifted dramatically late last week when musk disclosed he had lined up 46 5 billion including 21 billion of his personal fortune to pay for the purchase musk said other investors could contribute to the financing the locked in financing not only underscored the seriousness of musk s pursuit but also appeared to open the door to other large twitter shareholders interested in hearing more about his plans for the san francisco company the details of those conversations aren t known but musk could point to a more than 20 year history building and running several businesses most notably as the longtime ceo of tesla the electric car maker is currently valued at 1 trillion roughly 25 times more than twitter i think there is nothing better for twitter than elon musk buying it and ideally replacing the board and also doubling down on investments into products and new revenue generating sources said john meyer a technology entrepreneur and investor musk has the track record that he can do the impossible it would be easy to see why other twitter shareholders might welcome a shake up as well as an opportunity to cash out of their investment before musk disclosed his 9 stake in twitter earlier this month the shares were trading below 40 not that much more it its 26 price when twitter went public in november 2013 since then the tech driven nasdaq has more than tripled even after a recent downturn twitter has been a laggard because the company has struggled to consistently post profits while generating lackluster
