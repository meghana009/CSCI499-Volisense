listen to this article listen to this article lawsuits are piling up less than a week after the deadly crowd crush at the astroworld concert and legal experts say the risk is mounting that juries could decide against rapper travis scott and the companies behind the tragic event in houston several legal experts told the associated press that scott s past incitement of concertgoers offers a history that could make it easier to pursue negligence claims against companies that planned and managed the show which killed eight people and left hundreds injured and although the investigations have just begun experts expect dozens more lawsuits seeking damages that could climb into hundreds of millions of dollars at the center of the legal maelstrom is scott a 30 year old rapper famous for whipping fans into a frenzy who has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges tied to stirring up crowds at previous concerts this put everyone on notice this is what has happened and there is no reason it can t happen again said john werner a lawyer in beaumont texas who is not involved in astroworld cases they know this is a situation that can get out of hand this tragedy was months if not years in the making wrote houston lawyer steve kherkher in a lawsuit demanding more than 1 million for a man trampled in the melee which he said was predictable and preventable given the rapper s history more than a dozen lawsuits have been filed so far against scott and several companies including entertainment giant live nation concert promoter scoremore a nonprofit managing the houston owned venue the complaints allege that organizers failed to take simple crowd control steps to staff properly and to act on early signs of trouble at the sold out concert at nrg park that attracted 50 000 fans the way the concert was set up planned organized and the way things were handled once there was a problem it boggles the mind lawyer tony buzbee said this week in announcing that he was suing on behalf of three dozen victims including 21 year old axel acosta who died buzbee s news conference played directly to the court of public opinion with the tone of an opening statement complete with slides and video clips he and other attorneys have seized on an early clue of trouble that came hours before the concert began when throngs of fans rushed past security and metal detectors through a fence whatever security they had was wholly insufficient said former federal prosecutor philip hilder a houston lawyer not involved in any astroworld case the crowd went right through hilder also criticized the event s 56 page planning document which was submitted to the city for approval he said the plans were boilerplate with too few details about the safety of the parking lot where the performance was held which had no seating or aisles and no pens to contain the crowds several lawyers say litigation is also likely to focus on an unexplained delay between the time city officials declared a mass casualty event and when the concert organizers finally stopped the show a 37 minute gap during which fans kept pushing toward the stage collapsing and getting crushed the band kept going on and on long after the problem existed said frank branson a personal injury lawyer in dallas it s hard to believe that wasn t a conscious disregard to the audience to safety and welfare aside from scott the biggest legal target is live nation a publicly traded company whose stock has soared as fans rush to more concerts and festivals now that many pandemic restrictions have been lifted the company has declined to comment on what went wrong but issued a statement monday that it is helping police with a criminal investigation and will address all legal matters at the appropriate time the company reported it held 4 6 billion in cash as of september suing houston and harris county for negligence would be difficult given that both enjoy broad protection under the doctrine of sovereign and government immunity but there are exceptions several lawyers said

furthest in the future the new inflation report showed surging prices for beef electricity and many other items undermining the claim from the fed and the white house that high inflation rates are transitory and will soon subside george mateyo chief investment officer of key private bank in cleveland said the term transitory should be eliminated the case is closed that inflation is likely to be

electric automaker rivian hit public markets with a big splash rivian shares surged in their first day of trading on wednesday after the company completed one of the largest initial public offerings in u s history the shares have settled slightly after the initial pop but the company is still valued at close to 100 billion a larger market capitalization than ford or general motors has although not as high as tesla s mind boggling 1 trillion valuation it s a lot for a company that has built only a couple of hundred vehicles and hasn t turned a profit yet but rivian is hoping to echo tesla s vertiginous rise from automotive startup to mass market manufacturer it plans to sell pickup trucks suvs and a delivery vehicle and it counts amazon and ford as some of its key shareholders here s why rivian is attracting so much buzz electric vehicles are hot companies may disagree about how quickly a transition to electric vehicles will happen but the entire industry is embracing the idea that battery powered vehicles are the future at the cop26 climate talks on wednesday dozens of governments and companies embraced a target of selling only zero emission vehicles by 2040 or 2035 in major markets it essentially means replacing every new gas or diesel powered vehicle with an electric one spencer platt getty images getty images the interior of rivian s all electric pickup truck r1t as it sits at one of the automaker s facilities in brooklyn n y on nov 9 the company has started deliveries of the r1t the scale of that transition is huge posing a big challenge for existing automakers and an opening for new entrants in the market there s a lot of opportunity says stephanie brinley an analyst with ihs markit and of course the meteoric rise of tesla has whetted the appetite for who can do it again tesla is currently the world s most valuable automaker despite producing fewer vehicles than its rivals rivian won the race to build the first electric pickup truck americans love pickup trucks and drop a lot of money on them so automakers were competing to bring the first battery powered truck to market rivian won that race starting deliveries of its r1t this fall the r1t starts at 67 500 and is marketed toward outdoor enthusiasts one optional feature is a pullout kitchen with an induction stovetop and a sink designed for cooking at campsites it pairs adventure oriented specs with a luxurious interior cnn called it a glamper s dream truck rivian may have been the first electric pickup to market but it won t be the last established automakers are launching electric versions of their pickup trucks including ford the maker of the bestselling pickup in america it will be challenging for rivian to compete with the bigger cheaper ford f 150 lightning when it becomes available and the competition in the space will grow even fiercer as gm is also expected to unveil its all electric silverado at ces next year says jessica caldwell executive analyst at edmunds referring to a popular technology trade conference but for now rivian has the advantage of timing and the vehicle s performance is getting good reviews including a glowing assessment from edmunds on road testing team jeff kowalsky afp via getty images afp via getty images ford unveiled its new electric f 150 lightning pickup outside its headquarters in dearborn mich on may 19 ford like other legacy automakers plans to sell electric versions of many of its popular models it s also targeting the commercial delivery market rivian has another major advantage it has a huge deal with amazon to build electric delivery trucks amazon invested a lot of cash in the startup and owns a sizable stake in rivian the retail giant has committed to buying 100 000 delivery vehicles from rivian a big deal for the fledgling automaker that s as many vehicles as tesla is due to deliverto rental car company hertz in a deal that sent shares in the electric automaker sharply higher other electric automakers have stumbled a bunch of startups have tried to re create the tesla magic with spotty success hydrogen truck company nikola and electric pickup maker lordstown have been investigated by the securities and exchange commission after fraud allegations while other companies have just disappointed with repeated delays in their promised vehicles and with their underperforming stocks some analysts think rivian is better positioned than its rivals particularly because it has demonstrated it can build its product rivian for the most part has kind of been a little bit more nose to the grindstone and doing the work and getting it done brinley from ihs markit says one other electric vehicle startup can say the same lucid which went public this year through a different route also started deliveries of its luxury electric sedan it currently has a market cap of around 70 billion patrick t fallon afp via getty images afp via getty images a lucid air grand touring electric luxury car is displayed at lucid motors studio and service center in beverly hills calif on feb 25 lucid is another electric startup attracting a lot of buzz still scaling up will be a huge challenge for rivian delivering a vehicle to consumers was a major achievement for rivian but volumes are still small rivian has tens of thousands of preorders but expects to deliver only 1 000 vehicles by the end of 2021 the company

million or 33 3 for the three months ended september 30 2021 to 84 2 million as compared to 63 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2020 primarily driven by an increase in remediation and compliance services revenue from the commencement of new project work partially offset by a decrease in fossil services revenue due to project completions and a slight decrease in byproduct sales due to the dissolution of our ash venture llc joint venture in the second quarter of 2021 and decreases in supply from international sources due to increases in shipping rates partially offset by increased plant production as utility customers production recovered from the impacts of the pandemic and the 2020 hurricanes gross profit increased 1 1 million or 13 4 for the three months ended

ended september 30 2020 the decreased loss was primarily due to i a decrease in impairment expense ii gains on sales of property and equipment net of 3 0 million resulting from the commencement of operations at the gibbons creek ert project in 2021 and the completion of an asset purchase agreement with a third party for the sale of certain grinding related assets iii a gain on aro settlements of 1 1 million representing differences between the estimated costs used in the measurement of the fair value of the company s aros and the actual expenditures incurred for specific remediation tasks performed at the gibbons creek ert project and iv the previously mentioned increase in gross profit these favorable drivers were partially offset by a 7 1 million reduction in expense related to the

compared to 22 0 million for the nine months ended september 30 2020 the decreased loss was primarily due to i the decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from the absence of 8 6 million

nine months ended september 30 2020 business developments new business awards to date in 2021 we have won 805 million of new awards including approximately 120 million awarded since our second quarter 2021 earnings release in august although the timing of new business awards is not within our control based on our assessment of our competitive position with respect to pending bids we expect that new business awards for the full year will exceed the year to date level of 805 million the most recent awards included two ash pond closure contracts and an ash pond stabilization contract with a longstanding southeastern utility customer we also were awarded a five year byproduct sales and marketing contract with associated electric cooperative for 150 000 tons annually of fly ash bottom ash and boiler slag from the thomas hill energy center and a five year contract with the gavin power plant for 35 000 to 60 000 tons annually of fly ash under both contracts we will be responsible for the environmentally friendly recycling of these byproducts and marketing of them for use in ready mix concrete as an economic replacement for portland cement we will be targeting regional markets using our multisource materials network for distribution ert services we continue to evaluate opportunities to leverage our innovative and sustainable ert solutions further to meet the evolving and increasingly complex needs of utilities and power generation companies as they seek to retire and decommission older or less economically viable generating assets while minimizing costs and maximizing the value of the assets and improving the environment our unique ability to provide a single source solution for large scale complex environmental challenges continues to position us as a strong partner for existing and potential new customers we are very pleased with our performance at our ongoing ert projects and we continue to believe that charah solutions possesses unique competitive advantages and benefits for our utility customers compared to other alternatives gibbons creek we achieved a major milestone by completing the planned implosion and demolition of the plant in october remediation efforts at the project continue to progress on plan and below budget we expect remediation of the ash and scrubber ponds to be substantially complete by year end with remediation work on the landfill still to be performed as planned with demolition completed we expect scrap sales to accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue into 2022 we are nearing completion on parcel redevelopment for the site and expect to see parcel sales accelerating in early 2022 b c cobb this project for consumers energy involved remediation of the existing ash ponds and repurposing of the site to natural wetlands along the shore of lake michigan work is progressing well and is expected to be substantially completed by year end avon lake we expect to close on the acquisition of the avon lake generating station and adjacent property from genon in april 2022 when the plant ceases operation we have commenced planning for the environmental remediation and sustainable redevelopment of the property and will begin physical work once the full transfer occurs we have retained a third party to provide real estate advisory development and brokerage services to oversee the redevelopment of the property in an environmentally conscious manner and future sale of the remediated property we are working with the local community to position the property to expand economic activity and benefit the surrounding area through job creation remediation and compliance work is progressing well on several previously announced large remediation projects including a coal ash reclamation project for dominion energy and two long term ash pond closure by removal projects for another longstanding southeastern utility customer the projects are on schedule and on budget the first phase of the dominion project is expected to be substantially completed by year end with an expected ramp of the second phase beginning in 2022 we also began work on three new ash pond remediation contracts that were awarded recently by the above referenced large southeastern utility customer byproduct sales byproduct sales decreased in the first half of this year likely attributable to the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on power generation levels and construction activity as well as a change in the sales mix however the third quarter 2021 level was approximately level with a year ago and showed sequential improvement from the first two quarters of this year as the economy continues its recovery we expect to see continued sequential improvement in byproduct sales although the full year 2021 result is likely to be below the level of 2020 primarily due to a change in sales mix recently enacted infrastructure legislation is expected to be beneficial to this business over a multiyear period with an expected increase in demand for concrete esg reporting during the first quarter of 2021 we issued our first annual esg report to showcase charah solutions significant leadership in fulfilling our esg commitments and sustainably preserving our natural resources for the betterment of our planet our communities and our customers through our various businesses we reduce greenhouse gas emissions decrease landfill disposal remediate land for community and business use conserve natural resources and protect our waterways our ert business provides innovative environmentally conscious solutions to utilities and power generation companies seeking to decommission older or less economically viable generating plants and communities seeking to ensure that redevelopment of the property brings economic benefits to the area our envirosource technology offers resource conservation and recovery through the beneficial recycling of coal ash into a product that can substitute for portland cement our remediation and compliance business ensures the secure closure of ash impoundment facilities in our initial esg report we laid out 2021 objectives in the key areas of environmental data acquisition and reporting capabilities diversity and inclusion and safety we are on track or ahead of plan with respect to these goals in the area of safety for example our total recordable incident rate for 2021 to date was 0 22 significantly better than our goal of 0 46 or better lower we have had zero lost time injuries this year to date during the third quarter we were recognized as a leader in construction safety for the fourth year in a row by the annual associated general contractors of america we also received seven employee safety awards from the north carolina department of labor for our outstanding record of employee safety in 2020 the ninth year that we have been recognized for our safety record financing activities stock purchase agreement on august 6 2021 we executed a stock purchase agreement with b riley financial under which we issued approximately 2 9 million shares of common stock at 4 50 per share in a private placement for total proceeds of 13 million senior notes issuance on august 25 2021 we issued 135 0 million of 8 50 unsecured senior notes the notes with a maturity date of august 31 2026 net proceeds to us after debt issuance costs were 123 1 million we used the net proceeds from this offering and the proceeds from our equity issuance to b riley to repay all loans and borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and revolver which totaled 126 5 million following this repayment the credit facility was terminated the letters of credit outstanding under the revolver at termination were cash collateralized with the proceeds from a 17 9 million promissory note we issued to b riley on august 25 2021 this refinancing provides us with greater financial flexibility relative to the credit facility as the notes do not have financial covenants thus we will not be required to comply with net leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios on a quarterly basis as we were under our previous credit facility in addition the notes are bullet maturities and thus do not require amortization of principal prior to maturity unlike the credit facility interest expense on the notes is comparable the level we incurred on the credit facility but cash used for debt service is lower on the notes as there is no amortization of principal with a 2026 maturity date the notes improve our maturity profile relative to the credit facility which would have matured in 2022 new credit agreement on november 9 2021 we closed on a new credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank n a the credit agreement provides for a four year senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 30 million plus an additional 5 million of capacity that is available for letters of credit which are supported by cash collateral provided by the company availability under the credit agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculated based on the value of certain eligible inventory accounts receivable and equipment of the company we are not subject to any financial covenants under the new facility unless available liquidity falls below a minimum level in which case we would be required to ensure that the fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement is not less than 1 00 to 1 00 in keeping with our strong esg focus we were invited to participate in jpmorgan s sustainability linked pricing structure under this innovative incentive charah solutions will receive facility fee and interest rate reductions from jpmorgan based on meeting certain esg metrics as defined by the company and consistent with the one and five year goals in our inaugural esg report issued earlier this year we do not expect to draw under the new facility we do expect to reissue and replace existing letters of credit under the new facility upon reissuance and cancellation of the existing letters of credit the cash collateral securing the existing letters of credit will be released and will be used to repay the 17 9 million promissory note to b riley in full 2021 guidance we provide mission critical services to a diversified base of customers a majority of whom are investment grade regulated utilities that must continue to operate their power plants reliably despite the challenges presented by the covid 19 pandemic to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business due to the pandemic however the ongoing pandemic and potential for significant business disruptions beyond our control have created a high level of uncertainty including but not limited to the potential impacts on demand driven power generation and the level of construction activity each of which affects our byproduct sales there are also timing uncertainties associated with the startup of recently announced customer awards including ert awards unfavorable weather including hurricanes excessive rain or moderate temperatures which may temper power generation and therefore ash production levels could adversely affect results at any or all of our businesses results for the fourth quarter of this year should benefit from an increased contribution from our gibbons creek ert project and the continued ramping of recent new awards including large remediation and compliance projects based on our results year to date and our current expectations for the fourth quarter of the year we now expect to be in the upper half of our initial 2021 guidance ranges for revenues adjusted ebitda 2 and adjusted free cash flow 2 and have narrowed these ranges as follows revenues of 280million to 300 million previously 260 million to 300 million net loss attributable to charah solutions inc of 5 million to 0 million unchanged adjusted ebitda 2 of 37 million to 40 million previously 35 million to 40 million of 37 million to 40 million previously 35 million to 40 million adjusted free cash flow 2 of 35 million to 38 million previously 33 million to 38 million this guidance is based on our current expectations of no material worsening of the covid 19 pandemic specifically including but not limited to no material customer work stoppages no significant employee absences no government mandated quarantines and no material worsening of supply chain issues that could potentially affect our byproduct sales revenue any worsening of the covid 19 pandemic could materially affect our 2021 outlook this guidance also assumes that we do not experience material adverse weather in the fourth quarter of 2021 2 the forward looking measures of 2021 adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow are non gaap financial measures that cannot be reconciled to net loss attributable to charah solutions inc and cash flows from operating activities respectively as the most directly comparable gaap financial measure without unreasonable effort primarily because of the uncertainties involved in estimating forward looking measures conference call charah solutions will host a conference call at 8 30 a m et on thursday november 11 2021 to discuss its third quarter 2021

discontinued operations net of tax interest expense net loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization equity based compensation impairment expense and transaction related expenses and other items adjusted ebitda margin represents the ratio of adjusted ebitda to total revenue management believes adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are useful performance measures because they allow for an effective evaluation of our operating performance compared to our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure management excludes the items listed above from net loss attributable to charah solutions inc in arriving at adjusted ebitda because these amounts are either non recurring or can vary substantially within charah solutions industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net loss attributable to charah solutions inc determined according to gaap certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets none of which are reflected in adjusted ebitda charah solutions adjusted ebitda presentation should not be construed as an indication that the company s results will be unaffected by the items excluded from adjusted ebitda charah solutions computations of adjusted ebitda may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies charah solutions uses adjusted ebitda margin to measure the company s business s success in managing its cost base and improving profitability a reconciliation between adjusted ebitda to net loss attributable to charah solutions inc charah solutions most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap along with a calculation of the company s adjusted ebitda margin is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release adjusted net loss

related expenses and other items management excludes the items listed above to provide a more meaningful comparison of the company s operating performance when compared to prior periods adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per basic diluted share should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net loss attributable to common stockholders or loss per basic diluted share determined in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per basic diluted share to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release adjusted free cash flow is not a financial measure determined in accordance with gaap we define adjusted free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities cash and restricted cash received from ert transactions and proceeds from the sales of property and equipment less cash used for capital expenditures we include cash and restricted cash received from ert transactions and proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and exclude capital expenditures because we consider them to be a necessary component of our ongoing operations we consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for investing in our business and strengthening our balance sheet but it is not intended to represent the amount of cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non discretionary expenditures such as mandatory debt service requirements are not deducted from this measure the company uses non gaap measures internally as a key performance measure of the results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance these measures facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and help investors to better understand the operating results of the company by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core business or operating results the company believes the use of these measures enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period the company s operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner the non gaap measures are a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income or earnings per basic diluted share as determined in accordance

this past year has provided retailers with the unexpected opportunity to adapt their pricing strategies cowen retail analyst oliver chen said tuesday in a research note the dual forces of supply chain

current environment to adjust the consumer mindset to no longer shop for promotions can the federal reserve fix this this might be beyond the fed s reach normally the federal reserve would increase interest rates to rein in inflation but that might not strike at the heart of the problem rate hikes might not be enough to reverse inflation because the sources of inflation involve supply chain

years disproportionately affects the poor and working class americans in the bottom one third of income distribution feel the pressure of higher costs the most according to zandi because they have less of a financial cushion that reality is compounded by the fact that inflation affects pocketbook expenses such as food and gas although low income americans built up some savings through coronavirus relief checks and biden s child tax credits zandi said rising inflation forced them to spend that money quickly those most affected often include families of color or rural white americans

electric automaker rivian hit public markets with a big splash rivian shares surged in their first day of trading on wednesday after the company completed one of the largest initial public offerings in u s history the shares have settled slightly after the initial pop but the company is still valued at close to 100 billion a larger market capitalization than ford or general motors has although not as high as tesla s mind boggling 1 trillion valuation it s a lot for a company that has built only a couple of hundred vehicles and hasn t turned a profit yet but rivian is hoping to echo tesla s vertiginous rise from automotive startup to mass market manufacturer it plans to sell pickup trucks suvs and a delivery vehicle and it counts amazon and ford as some of its key shareholders here s why rivian is attracting so much buzz electric vehicles are hot companies may disagree about how quickly a transition to electric vehicles will happen but the entire industry is embracing the idea that battery powered vehicles are the future at the cop26 climate talks on wednesday dozens of governments and companies embraced a target of selling only zero emission vehicles by 2040 or 2035 in major markets it essentially means replacing every new gas or diesel powered vehicle with an electric one spencer platt getty images getty images the interior of rivian s all electric pickup truck r1t as it sits at one of the automaker s facilities in brooklyn n y on nov 9 the company has started deliveries of the r1t the scale of that transition is huge posing a big challenge for existing automakers and an opening for new entrants in the market there s a lot of opportunity says stephanie brinley an analyst with ihs markit and of course the meteoric rise of tesla has whetted the appetite for who can do it again tesla is currently the world s most valuable automaker despite producing fewer vehicles than its rivals rivian won the race to build the first electric pickup truck americans love pickup trucks and drop a lot of money on them so automakers were competing to bring the first battery powered truck to market rivian won that race starting deliveries of its r1t this fall the r1t starts at 67 500 and is marketed toward outdoor enthusiasts one optional feature is a pullout kitchen with an induction stovetop and a sink designed for cooking at campsites it pairs adventure oriented specs with a luxurious interior cnn called it a glamper s dream truck rivian may have been the first electric pickup to market but it won t be the last established automakers are launching electric versions of their pickup trucks including ford the maker of the bestselling pickup in america it will be challenging for rivian to compete with the bigger cheaper ford f 150 lightning when it becomes available and the competition in the space will grow even fiercer as gm is also expected to unveil its all electric silverado at ces next year says jessica caldwell executive analyst at edmunds referring to a popular technology trade conference but for now rivian has the advantage of timing and the vehicle s performance is getting good reviews including a glowing assessment from edmunds on road testing team jeff kowalsky afp via getty images afp via getty images ford unveiled its new electric f 150 lightning pickup outside its headquarters in dearborn mich on may 19 ford like other legacy automakers plans to sell electric versions of many of its popular models it s also targeting the commercial delivery market rivian has another major advantage it has a huge deal with amazon to build electric delivery trucks amazon invested a lot of cash in the startup and owns a sizable stake in rivian the retail giant has committed to buying 100 000 delivery vehicles from rivian a big deal for the fledgling automaker that s as many vehicles as tesla is due to deliverto rental car company hertz in a deal that sent shares in the electric automaker sharply higher other electric automakers have stumbled a bunch of startups have tried to re create the tesla magic with spotty success hydrogen truck company nikola and electric pickup maker lordstown have been investigated by the securities and exchange commission after fraud allegations while other companies have just disappointed with repeated delays in their promised vehicles and with their underperforming stocks some analysts think rivian is better positioned than its rivals particularly because it has demonstrated it can build its product rivian for the most part has kind of been a little bit more nose to the grindstone and doing the work and getting it done brinley from ihs markit says one other electric vehicle startup can say the same lucid which went public this year through a different route also started deliveries of its luxury electric sedan it currently has a market cap of around 70 billion patrick t fallon afp via getty images afp via getty images a lucid air grand touring electric luxury car is displayed at lucid motors studio and service center in beverly hills calif on feb 25 lucid is another electric startup attracting a lot of buzz still scaling up will be a huge challenge for rivian delivering a vehicle to consumers was a major achievement for rivian but volumes are still small rivian has tens of thousands of preorders but expects to deliver only 1 000 vehicles by the end of 2021 the company s factory in normal ill can hypothetically produce hundreds of thousands of vehicles but brinley says to be truly sustainable rivian will need to expand to more plants let s not put the cart before the horse says asad hussain a mobility analyst with pitchbook i think the real challenge is going to be ramping up that manufacturing capacity the ipo should help its listing brought in nearly 12 billion for rivian a cash infusion the company will use to tackle that challenging problem of scaling up copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

video has emerged of president joe biden s nominee to lead the office of the comptroller of the currency saule omarova saying she wants oil and gas companies to go bankrupt we want them to go bankrupt if we want to tackle climate change right the soviet born omarova said in a clip that was shared online by the conservative leaning american accountability foundation she made the comments in february when appearing at the jain family institute s social wealth seminar where she was making the case for a national investment authority which would pull resources from the treasury department and the federal reserve to allocate public and private capital for green infrastructure projects the resurfaced clip could hinder omarova s ability to get all 50 democrats to support her nomination as every republican is expected to vote against the cornell university law professor video has emerged of president joe biden s nominee to lead the office of the comptroller of the currency saule omarova

reported sunday axios reported sunday that at least three senate democrats have aired concerns about her nomination moderate sens jon tester of montana kyrsten sinema of arizona and joe manchin of west virginia manchin in particular has not been supportive in the past of comments made about the demise of the fossil fuel industry looking out for west virginia s coal industry the senate banking committee s ranking member pennsylvania sen pat toomey told axios republicans will overwhelmingly oppose this self described radical last month toomey demanded she turn over a copy of her university

industries we want them to go bankrupt if we want to tackle climate change pic twitter com lumr2hemk9 bidennoms a project of aaf bidennoms november 9 2021 dailymail com reported that a top russian university destroyed its only copy of omarova s thesis on marxism republicans on the senate banking committee expressed outrage that omarova refused to turn over her moscow state university dissertation and dailymail com has been told that there is no longer a copy in the institution s archives it was destroyed long ago said a university official we do not have a copy moscow state university only keeps such works for five years said the official saule omarova a cornell law school professor has been nominated to lead the office of the comptroller of the currency an exclusive new photograph shows omarova as a proud young pioneer the communist youth mass movement at her soviet school number 21 in uralsk now oral in kazakhstan she is wearing the red scarf of the movement in a picture dating from 1979 80 it was titled karl marx s economic analysis and the theory of revolution in the capital but she ignored a deadline he set and appears unlikely to hand it over it is assumed she has her own copy of the thesis even if her old university no longer possesses one ms omarova has time to attack republicans in an interview with the financial times but she can t be bothered to comply with a banking committee requirement that nominees regardless of their political party or ideology submit copies of their writings said amanda gonzalez thompson spokesperson for senate banking committee republicans we certainly hope she reconsiders so senators have the information necessary to fulfill their constitutional duty to advise and consent on appointments omarova did not respond to requests for comment dailymail com has obtained pictures of omarova from her time in the soviet education system an exclusive new photograph shows her as a proud young pioneer the communist youth mass

her school graduation when she was already an enthusiastic member of the komsomol or young communists as she left to study at prestigious moscow state university she graduated with a rare gold medal signifying her academic achievements and opening the door to her move to the prestigious moscow university omarova recently denied having communist sympathies and said that in the ussr there was no academic freedom making it unfair to judge her by what she wrote as a soviet undergraduate student she told the financial times i was in the soviet union where there was no academic freedom and this was a mandatory assigned topic what i wrote in that paper has nothing to do with what i believed in then or in what i believe in now she said my grandmother was orphaned because stalin sent her entire family to siberia and they died there saule omarova circled is photographed during her studies at moscow state university in russia in 1988 when mikhail gorbachev was president of the soviet union she studied under a scholarship named after vladimir lenin and wrote a thesis on karl marx omarova has previously called wall street s hedge funds a quintessential a hole industry in the documentary a holes a theory pictured here she has offered other controversial opinions such as opposing private banking and praised the soviet union s financial system her family was destroyed because they were educated kazakhs who didn t join the party i was really lucky to get to moscow state university i was 18 and within a year i became an anti communist like most of my classmates we were reading stuff that was prohibited we were listening to pink floyd which was illegal we were talking about solzhenitsyn former school classmate elena samokisha said i remember her as a kind and nice person i was her classmate beginning from grade 7 she is really a cool person and i am happy the fate brought us together i would love to wish her luck in announcing her as biden s pick for comptroller of the currency

providing a brief update on our third quarter overall market dynamics and our new innovative products after my comments tim will discuss our third quarter performance and our outlook for the full year then i ll wrap up with some closing remarks and we ll open it up for q a we re pleased to announce we had another strong quarter despite markets that are still recovering similar to the second quarter this was driven primarily by demand for new product innovation solid commercial execution and strong market recovery in the united states recovery in our international markets remains mixed although we are encouraged to see signs of recovery in select european markets late in the quarter other countries like japan which is our second largest market continue to be impacted by the pandemic third quarter sales of 2 1 billion were up 13 versus 2019 with increases across all sales categories in surgical and vision care core operating margin was 17 7 and core diluted earnings per share was 0 54 customer interest and need for our new products are driving above market growth and in surgical our portfolio of advanced technology intraocular lenses is driving increased penetration rates of atiols and we continue to see strong demand for cataract refractive equipment in vision care our new contact lenses are winning in the market and our systane brand family is posting strong double digit growth in all regions now moving to our end markets by franchise in surgical the global cataract surgery market was relatively consistent with last quarter excluding india the global market was down mid single digits versus 2019 while the u s showed solid mid single digit growth over 2019 the international markets remained down high single digits primarily due to emerging markets in japan which continue to be suppressed against this backdrop our implantables business continued to outpace the market driven by our strong atiol performance in vision care the contact lens market was flat to slightly up versus the third quarter of 2019 similar to surgical the u s market has returned to growth while international markets are approaching 2019 levels our contact lens business grew significantly faster than the market driven by the strong performance of precision1 now moving to innovation in surgical we maintained our strong market share in pciols solidifying our position as the market leader this was driven by strong demand for our new innovative products panoptix and vivity despite new market entrants we continue to see atiol penetration rates increasing sequentially as existing surgeons increase their use of advanced technologies and as surgeons who traditionally preferred monofocals and torics are now implanting vivity vivity is the first and only pciol with wavefront shaping technology and a clinically proven exceptionally low rate of visual disturbances surgeons appreciate the consistency of patient outcomes without the worry of halo s and glare in our equipment business our products and innovations remain a favorite of surgeons including our market leading phaco equipment our active sentry handpiece the luxor revalia microscope and the argos biometer earlier this week we unveiled the latest evolution of cataract connectivity with smartcataract designed specifically for ophthalmology this new cloud based application delivers planning connectivity and analysis to improve cataract surgery efficiency reliability and accuracy this is the next step in the evolution of our equipment ecosystem and further enhances the value of our new innovations installations of our first application smartcataract are underway with select customers in the united states in vision care we re expanding our contact lens offerings to the premium and middle market segments by launching a steady stream of new silicone hydrogel daily and reusable products in the premium segment we re building out our total brand with a complete portfolio of design options in addition to our existing dailies total1 sphere and multifocal lenses we re now adding dailies total1 for astigmatism to capture the premium toric market and also total30 to capture the premium reusable market dailies total1 for astigmatism has been eagerly anticipated by eye care professionals for years this lens provides a significant opportunity in a fast growing segment where only one in four astigmatic patients are wearing toric lenses select customers in the u s are already fitting the lens early feedback has been very positive and we re excited for the broader commercial launch early next year now total30 addresses the large 4 billion reusable market which hasn t seen any significant innovation in years total30 is now available to wearers in the u s and europe and early reception has been strong this lens brings the water gradient feature of dailies total1 into a monthly lens creating a comfortable lens which feels like nothing on day 1 and on day 30 now moving to the middle market segment the strong performance of precision1 and precision1 for astigmatism continues to drive our above market growth in the total dailies market both the sphere and toric designs are currently available in the u s and europe and precision1 sphere is available in japan as more international markets recover we believe we are well positioned to drive steady growth with precision1 finally in ocular health we re building out our eye drop portfolio systane sales continue to grow globally reinforcing our leadership in artificial tears if you recall about 25 of the fast growing u s market for artificial tears is the preservative free category compared to over 50 in some international markets our multi dose preservative free formulations of systane ultra and hydration are now available in europe and the u s where we re seeing a favorable customer response we also continue to see strong demand for pataday family of allergy products which has been aided by our recent launch of pataday extra strength earlier this year and finally this is the first full quarter where we ve added simbrinza to our growing portfolio of eye drops now before i pass the call to tim i wanted to touch on our recent announcement regarding our intention to acquire ivantis we re very excited for the opportunity to expand our glaucoma portfolio in this large 500 million market growing in the low to mid teens glaucoma is the second largest cause of blindness after cataracts and impacts more than 75 million people globally ivantis flagship product is the hydrus microstent a minimally invasive glaucoma surgery device importantly the hydrus is unique as the only migs device with safety and efficacy data out to five years the five year horizon clinical study of hydrus is the longest continuous follow up of a migs device it demonstrated that 65 of hydrus patients remained medication free at five years hydrus has a combination cataract indication in the u s which means the device is implanted during cataract surgery in both combo cataract and stand alone indications in five international markets we intend to leverage our global commercial footprint and our development capabilities to create even greater value for existing and future ivantis products in a few minutes tim will walk you through some of the financial aspects of that deal our third quarter performance demonstrates the resilience of our business the strength of our innovation engine and the expertise of our commercial organization we are executing on our new product launches and growing faster than the markets around the world even as they continue to recover for surgical we re expanding our leadership in equipment by developing an equipment ecosystem to improve efficiency and accuracy while we re expanding our implantables business in surgical glaucoma and for vision care we re using our water gradient technology to create differentiated new silicon hydrogel contact lenses for both daily and monthly use with that let me pass it to tim who will take you through our financial results tim stonesifer senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks david we are pleased to report third quarter sales of 2 1 billion up 13 versus 2019 driven by 14 growth in surgical and 12 growth in vision care year to date sales were up 10 versus the first nine months of 2019 with surgical up 12 and vision care up 9 implantables sales were 375 million in the third quarter an increase of 32 versus 2019 as david mentioned we remain market leaders with our pciol portfolio and we continue to see adoption driving encouraging penetration rates above historical levels on a year to date basis implantables sales were up 28 versus the first nine months of 2019 consumables sales of 594 million in the third quarter increased by 3 versus 2019 with sales growth across all three categories of cataract vit ret and refractive on a year to date basis consumables sales were up 1 versus the first nine months of 2019 equipment and other sales were 192 million in the quarter up 20 versus 2019 about 8 points of the growth was due to the refractive sales with continued demand for lasik procedures the remaining growth was primarily due to strong demand in cataract and new equipment on a year to date basis equipment and other sales were up 21 versus the first nine months of 2019 now turning to vision care third quarter sales of 923 million grew 12 versus 2019 contact lens sales were 562 million in the quarter up 7 versus 2019 this was driven by strong demand for precision1 and precision1 for astigmatism as well as continued growth from dailies total1 as david mentioned we are also rolling out total30 in the united states and europe where customer feedback has been extremely favorable based on the strong performance of our contact lens portfolio we continue to add new manufacturing lines and assess the need for additional capacity to support product flow of our new products especially precision1 for astigmatism on a year to date basis contact lens sales were up 5 versus the first nine months of 2019 now moving to ocular health where sales of 361 million in the quarter increased by 20 versus 2019 about half of the growth is attributed to systane which grew double digits in all regions underpinned by a growing artificial tear market this was aided by our new multi dose preservative free launches in europe and u s the other half of the growth is primarily due to new additions to our portfolio including pataday and simbrinza which had no comparable sales in 2019 on a year to date basis ocular health sales were up 16 versus the first nine months of 2019 now moving down the income statement third quarter core gross margin was 63 7 broadly in line with 2019 we continue to see inflationary headwinds related to raw materials freight and labor despite our best efforts to mitigate these pressures through active management of supply and selective price increases core operating margin was 17 7 in the quarter driven by operating leverage as higher sales outpaced increases in sg a as we mentioned on our last call we do expect to see incremental margin pressure in q4 primarily due to product mix and timing of spend as we continue to invest in our commercial activities and sales force as markets recover third quarter interest expense was 31 million down from 35 million in 2019 while we ve taken on incremental debt we ve benefited from lower variable interest rates and lower debt in affiliates the core effective tax rate was 17 5 in the quarter compared to 18 2 in the third quarter of 2019 the current rate benefited from a build up of inventory in certain international markets that had a favorable product mix and a favorable mix of pre tax income and loss across tax jurisdictions for the first nine months of the year the core effective tax rate was 17 5 in the quarter compared to 18 2 in the third quarter of 2019 the current rate benefited from a build up of inventory in certain international markets that had a favorable product mix and a favorable mix of pre tax income and loss across tax jurisdictions for the first nine months of the year the core effective tax rate was 19 1 core diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2021 were 0 54 up 0 08 versus the third quarter of 2019 driven primarily by operating leverage next i ll touch on a couple of cash flow and balance sheet items free cash flow year to date was 578 million compared to 260 million for the same period in 2019 higher core operating income and lower separation spend were partially offset by increases in capital expenditures and inventory to support new product launches and expected upcoming demand capex was 380 million for the first nine months of the year with the increase driven by our contact lens manufacturing expansion as a reminder historically capex spend has been heavily weighted in the fourth quarter and we expect that trend to continue this year transformation costs were 14 million for the third quarter and 141 million life to date turning now to business development as david mentioned we announced our intention to acquire ivantis for 475 million in cash plus potential future payments contingent upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones ivantis offers attractive sales and earnings growth potential in a fast growing category where we currently do not participate we estimate ivantis will have sales of approximately 60 million for the full year 2021 in 2022 we estimate that ivantis will be broadly neutral to core operating income with some pressure on the core operating margin rate we expect the acquisition to be accretive to core operating income in 2023 we anticipate to close the transaction in the first quarter of next year subject to customary closing conditions including regulatory review as we discussed earlier in the call we continue to see broader macroeconomic burdens such as inflation and tightness in the supply chain we have been proactively working to manage these challenges but we ve seen pressure to date and expect that to continue going forward in addition the u s dollar has appreciated significantly since the first half of the year if the u s dollar remains at current rates we would expect to see fx headwinds in 2022 as compared to 2021 despite that backdrop and based on the strong performance year to date we expect to come in around the higher end of our 2021 guidance this outlook continues to assume that global markets return to 2019 levels by the end of the year u s markets continue to grow above 2019 for the remainder of the year and on an aggregated basis international markets reach 2019 levels early next year with emerging markets and countries like japan remaining subdued now i ll turn it back to david for some closing remarks david j endicott chief executive officer thanks tim to briefly wrap up we re pleased with the strong results we saw this quarter with sales up in every category exemplifying the resilience of our business the strength of our innovation engine and the expertise of our commercial organization our new product launches are gaining momentum and taking share as markets around the world will continue to recover we re pleased to be expanding our surgical portfolio both through our smart solution ecosystem and through our intended acquisition of ivantis and in vision care our robust pipeline of innovative products are bringing new options for doctors and patients in contact lenses dry eye allergy and glaucoma drops we re pleased with our ability to deliver growth and outpace the market and we are well positioned to capture an outsized benefit as the global markets recover delivering long term value to our shareholders and with that let s open up the line for q a questions and answers operator thank you and our first question comes from the line of ryan zimmerman with btig please proceed with your question ryan zimmerman btig analyst great thank you for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter tim and dave when i think about your markets last year in the height of covid ophthalmic markets really took a pause and yet now they re proving far more resilient and so i m wondering if you could just kind of speak to that dynamic as to why that is and we ve heard from many of your peers about staffing challenges into next year are you anticipating that or not particularly in the u s market where again it s sounding to be it s proving to be more resilient i d love just to hear some comments on that david j endicott chief executive officer yeah ryan we have seen a lot of strength in the markets and i think it probably speaks to the underlying fundamentals in the quarter you kind of think about getting through this not everybody i think we weren t 100 sure how it s going to happen first of all as you recall we were a little bit off on the early guidance but i think what we really believed is that these cataracts aren t going away and that they are coming back but again even through this point in time i think if you look at them we ve used 2019 as comparators so that you kind of divide by two and see if it s still there and i think through a couple of years we still think the market is not yet back to full growth so i think in the u s it was 4 procedures over 2019 so if you do that by divide by two you re still not quite what the normal growth would be we would have expected normal growth to have been about 3 so yeah it s been solid coming back and again although it paused last year a lot of the underlying things in vision care for example were better than we expected so i think vision care we don t see necessarily for example the visits back to where we d like to see them but we are seeing revenue come back and that seems to be a phenomenon of some renewal remotely for prescriptions and also larger purchase per patient so we re seeing some of that happen as well so i think there has been some unique circumstances but i think more importantly the underlying fundamentals on eye care leads you to believe that these are relatively resilient markets and so i do think they are going to as we said come back largely by the first part of next year all in we think this year the u s is growing now as i said but international is going to take a while it s going to take a little longer and some markets may drag into the middle part of the year but i think in aggregate international should be back sometime early next so we ll get there but i think it s likely to be a slow steady climb from here maybe slightly above historical numbers as opposed to any kind of quick bounce back that looks a little bit more steep i think it s much more likely to be a gradual climb that s just slightly warmer than historical growth rates tim stonesifer senior vice president and chief financial officer staffing ryan zimmerman btig analyst okay david j endicott chief executive officer and staffing yeah i m sorry thanks on staffing yeah we still see that i would tell you that staffing in optometry in particular i think is difficult right now the surgical centers i think are generally pretty good but it is difficult for them to kind of go way beyond what they were doing and i think this kind of earlier we had hoped that there would be a steeper bounce back perhaps i don t really see that partly because frankly it s hard to get more throughput out of the current capacity that we have and there are staffing issues in vision care similarly i think if you were seeing 20 patients a week sorry 20 patients a day in 19 you are probably seeing 16 or so right now and it is tough without additional staff to get back up to that 20 so again i think that will climb slowly but i think over the long haul you re going to see that these markets are kind of roughly returning as we would expect next year and kind of back to kind of historical growth rates ryan zimmerman btig analyst okay and then just on cataract i mean obviously there has been some product introductions in the market competitively and so what are your expectations for when you could or could not see that impacted i mean it seems like you re panoptix and vivity are doing well despite that those introductions and so i would imagine though that you re baking in some expectation there if you could speak to that a little bit i d appreciate it david j endicott chief executive officer sure ryan zimmerman btig analyst thank you for taking the questions david j endicott chief executive officer yeah no i mean look we ve seen these products in the market around the world for a while so really the only new market here is the u s and i think we expected to we had a very high share up in the 80s certainly that s going to come down so it s just a matter of is it more or less than we planned and i think we re seeing pretty much what we expected i think people will try the lens it s a good product but i think they re going to find that particularly vivity has no halo s and glare really i mean to speak of and i think it s very similar to a monofocal when you really cut all through it but it s giving you intermediate and near vision so this lens has turned out to be a much better alternative for a lot of folks than trying some of the newer lenses i think that have a lot more of the visual disturbances so i think somewhere between panoptix if you really want near vision 100 pretty much guaranteed near vision that s going to be a panoptix patient but you can get a lot out of this vivity product and we are seeing a lot of benefit from that and remember that again even with the share dynamic what we re really trying to do now is move more to the penetration side of this thing and so we ve been talking a lot about how do we get more people involved in atiols how do we get more patients through the end of these practices and i think that will be the dynamic that s probably more important over the long haul because i think we said in the past as you know there s probably for every 100 basis points of penetration we can pick up 100 million so we re very interested in right now the penetration rates because our share is pretty solid and i feel really good about the competitiveness of our current position ryan zimmerman btig analyst all right thank you operator and our next question comes from the line of julien dormois with bnp paribas please proceed with your question julien dormois exane bnp paribas analyst yeah hi good morning dave and tim thanks for taking my questions i have two the first one relates to vision care and more precisely the launch of total30 if i m right you currently have a share in the mid teens in that category of premium reusable how do you think what is the reasonable share objective that you have for this specific segment and how long do you think it could take to get you there and my second question is on surgical and i know i ve already asked the question on other calls but i m still very puzzled by the very different growth patterns that we still see between consumables on the one hand and implantables and equipment on the other hand and that s obviously compared to 2019 so is it just a function of implantables and equipment growing above their historical trends or do you still expect to see a catch up effect at some point in consumables for example in 2022 david j endicott chief executive officer sure julien let me let start with the first one we are very excited about t30 i mean total30 is a unique product that i think adds water gradient to a material that is durable for 30 days and so you re getting that the two best elements of what we want which is durable material that will last 30 days and yet at the same time feels like nearly nothing on day 1 and actually out to day 30 very similar to the first day you had it in your eye so that s a big change from what the kind of products that are available right now and we are excited about the reception we see to that right now so i think that would the beautiful thing about the contact lens market is it takes a while to move share and so on the one hand you d like to see it the aggressive part of this is you d like to see it run up but what you re really doing is turning a small part of the market every year so remember if you re happy in your lenses you re likely to stay in your lenses and that s probably 70 of the patients who walk in through the door they re going to end up basically in the lens they walked in with if you re unhappy or you re having a trouble or it s not as comfortable that s a switch or a new patient and you need to think about those as really about a third or less of the total market that churns and so that s the available opportunity every year to move some share and so that takes several years in many cases dt1 for example we ve had out nearly 10 years it s still growing share and we will see a long rise of these products they re not super steep they re relatively stable when you get them on a share trajectory they tend to grow every year a little bit and that s really the outlook and in a lot of ways that s a very helpful financial trajectory because you got a pretty good pattern and it s got long term sustainable growth so we re excited about what it could be again i wouldn t forecast a share objective per se for this product right now but we re excited about what we see early days on the surgical side there isn t really the way to think about implantables and equipment are different but you start with the market growth and again historically the market growth in procedures you can pretty much approximate with unit growth in implantables and again typically it s been kind of in that three somewhere between kind of three and four globally it s been hotter than that occasionally but somewhere in there is usually the procedural growth the unit for implantables is going to grow very close to that procedure rate because of course one surgery usually means one implantable consumables similarly should grow roughly in other words one pack or one unit of use idea will come along with that same surgical piece what you re seeing in implantables is a trade up in volume value so you re trading a unit that was a 1 was in excess of 100 let s just say for a monofocal now trading at 600 to 800 to 900 in some places and that s what s driving the value difference between those numbers equipment is slightly different equipment has just been unusually robust and we would normally say that equipment should run just slightly in advance of procedural growth so if you figure the market has enough equipment to service the equipment there is some changeover every year so that s usually let s call it somewhere between 10 and 20 of the market should be retiring equipment and buying new equipment and then you basically got growth on the market that is procedural growth and so that is how we think about that growth and it s usually again typically slightly warmer than the procedural growth depending on the price of the equipment and then if you re upgrading on a price then again the value grows a little bit faster so that s probably the way to think about it but i don t think there is a ton of of catch up here for consumables because whatever procedures grow i think is where you re going to see the consumables rate grow generally and so that s kind of where we are and part of the difference you re seeing in some of our markets is that we index more heavily to markets that right now have recovered versus the global markets and in many cases we exclude india because it really hasn t recovered there s a monster number of procedures but we re not benefiting from those right now julien dormois exane bnp paribas analyst helpful thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of scott bardo with berenberg please proceed with your question scott bardo berenberg analyst yeah thanks guys for taking the question so two questions so i ll start with the first please just on guidance so obvious question would be why didn t you include any comments on guidance in your release i think that confused quite a bit of capital the capital markets this morning and i don t think we ve seen it before i appreciate tim also you highlighting comments about inflation and logistic costs and so forth so what i m trying to understand is are they significant enough to drive the 16 margin in q4 implied by your guidance and do you still hold your 20 margin by 2023 despite this acquisition so that s the first question thanks tim stonesifer senior vice president and chief financial officer so a few questions in that question yeah i was to be honest with you i was a little surprised with the reaction to the no guidance in the press release i mean our philosophy has typically been that we don t update the guidance unless there is a change to the guidance so obviously we provided a little bit more color on the script that we think will be at the high end of the guidance but there were no changes overall from a 16 perspective there are a couple of things in there i mean q4 historically from a seasonality perspective is typically lower than q3 that s primarily driven by vision care and a couple of other elements we also had as we mentioned some timing of spend so we ve got some spend that we thought we would spend in q3 that has now shifted to q4 so i think as you think about how material are things going to be as you project out into 2020 i would just provide the following color i think first of all i would take the high end of our guide so as an example if you start with revenue take the 8 2 billion and then we ve said in the past that we re going to grow mid single digits i would just take into account that we have a lot of momentum exiting 2021 from a revenue perspective so if you think about implantables to david s earlier comments really strong performance in vivity we re going to continue to launch that in new geographies next year so that momentum will continue if you look at contact lenses as an example we have a lot of momentum in p1 we ve got two new lenses coming out t30 and dt1 for astigmatism so again i would expect to see more growth there and then dry eye we re very well positioned with our systane family so i would take that into account from a revenue perspective the one caveat i would add is the comment around equipment i don t think equipment is going to run as hot next year as it did this year because i don t think refractive stays at those levels so but nonetheless that s how i think about revenue now when you go to gross margin in my inflation comments i do expect to see some gross margin pressure year over year next year i mean we like everybody else we continue to see pressure on raw materials if you think about resins if you think about electronic chips i mean that continues i think freight pressures continue labor wages continue to be pressured so we would expect to see some gross margin pressure next year year over year if you think about r d just to keep going through the p l we said 7 to 9 we ve been running at the high end of that range i think next year now that we ve not i don t want to say caught up but just given the profile of our innovation pipeline i would expect that to be more at the midpoint of that 7 to 9 and then sg a as we ve continued to say i would expect to continue to get some nice operating leverage i mean if you look particularly and if you look at the g a side of the house i mean there are going to be modest increases in that given all the transformation work we ve done and then obviously we will invest behind the markets that are growing so that s how i would tee it up and then the only thing i would say on top of that is looking at fx if you just look at the rates as of last friday and compare that to take the average rates for september year to date i mean all the currencies are moving and you ve got the dollar has strengthened a couple of percent versus the euro it s roughly 2 or 3 versus the pound it s 4 versus the yen so assuming rates stay at those levels we would expect to see that type of pressure going forward into 2022 and as far as 2023 we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we gave at capital markets day in reaching the commitments in both 23 and 25 scott bardo berenberg analyst that s a very comprehensive answer thank you and maybe if i can just sneak in a quick one david i d love to hear your thoughts about ivantis and the acquisition here i m just curious to understand why you decided to buy this business when you could have arguably acquired the market leader with four times the revenue just share with us what it is about this business that particularly appeals david j endicott chief executive officer well look i mean this one of the things we ve thought a lot about is because we ve been in this space a number of times is where is the market need and i think this particular product i mean the ivantis folks have done a terrific job with the data that they ve created with the safety of this product and importantly this is a uniquely effective product and we ve always thought i ve always thought that with the space that needs to get filled here is something that is effective over a long haul and when you think about the data that they re showing which is 65 of patients medication free at five years this has got a demonstrable efficacy that we think is very powerful and i think if we put our muscle behind that put some more data behind that give that the commercial footprint that we have we think that this has got a lot of runway and so i think the opportunity here is per dollar paid if you will i think it s just a better value scott bardo berenberg analyst very clear thank you operator our next question comes from the line of veronika dubajova from goldman sachs please proceed with your question veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst good morning guys and thanks for taking my questions two please one just on the iol or pciol momentum david i was hoping you could talk about to what extent the growth that we saw in the quarter is being driven by vivity versus panoptix and maybe just give us a little bit of flavor for the type of market share that you ve seen with vivity in europe and kind of how you think that informs your views going forward and if i can sort of interpret your comments on continued higher penetration and uptake of iols i think i ask you this question every quarter but just your degree of confidence that that continues as we move into next year has it increased or decreased and then my second question is a bit of a financial one for tim tim just thinking about the bridge from the 21 margin to the 2023 margin and would love to get your thoughts to what extent you think that margin progression is 22 versus 2023 weighted is this an even keel or should we be thinking about some element of phasing especially in the context of the ivantis deal as well thanks david j endicott chief executive officer hey veronika good to hear from you listen on the pciols look the vivity product on a growth rate basis is growing really well and obviously it s growing faster than panoptix because it s wrapping around on a really tiny number panoptix s still growing nicely to be fair double digits but i think what we re seeing really is what we said before which was you re going to see as panoptix peaks and comes over and starts wrapping around on all the launches that it has had that it kind of settles down and then vivity becomes really that next booster if you will for us so we re excited about what we see with vivity we are excited about the utility that we see with vivity there s a lot of surgeons doing a lot of kind of important things i think and able to treat patients without this halo and glare that is bringing patients for example from a monofocal toric to a multifocal toric and that s a big move right because if we can upgrade our toric business to multifocal toric really pretty risk free i think that s a really nice opportunity that seems to be a big part of the vivity growth for us right now but i would say that our share growth in around the world has been mostly at this point is being driven mostly by vivity panoptix pretty stable slight growth there are several markets yet to launch vivity so again i think what we saw in panoptix for about 12 or 18 months is what we ll probably see with vivity for about 12 or 18 months which is as it wraps around on its prior year we ll get steady launches around the world we still got to get it into japan we still got china to go we ve got a couple of other markets we haven t got the toric out yet in a couple of markets so we are we ve got more i think share to be had but my point on penetration has been that look i mean there s going to be competitors to us we ve got a very high share right now so we don t expect that that s the main driver of growth going forward so your second question makes tons of sense which is we are excited about what we see right now with vivity in particular we think there is some additional patients coming into the pciol business and that s a little bit of what i said before with monofocal and monofocal torics converting into patients now that are interested in doing this because of the lack of halo s and glare or at least the very similar profile it has to a monofocal i think that s really what it is now the confidence i have around it is a little bit tough because i feel good about that it s definitely driving greater penetration right now but i would be careful with it because again right now the penetration rate has a denominator that lacks a lot of monofocals in it so if you look around the world we re still recovering internationally in particular so there s millions of procedures that were not done let s just pick india brazil russia a bunch of other kind of developing countries where when you add back all of those units to the denominator i think the current penetration rate which is pretty high would probably come down a little bit so i we re waiting to see the market stabilize but i think what s fair to say because we see it with individual surgeons is year on prior year inside of individual surgeons markets we see their individual penetrations growing and we know we re not losing surgeons in that direction so i think we feel confident that it s growing the durability of it we ll have to see and the size of it again i think it s still jury is still out on but again we re of the mind that this is the right thing to be thinking about and tracking tim stonesifer senior vice president and chief financial officer hey veronika and on the margin profile i d say our story is still the same it s that margin improvement is really roughly 80 driven by operating leverage and call it 20 driven by gross margin improvement so i think from an operating leverage perspective it should be relatively linear because again revenue is really going to drive that improvement so as we continue to grow at mid single digits and keep our cost base at inflationary type levels that should go over that should move in sort of a linear perspective on the gross margin perspective i think the view is there s probably be a little bit more improvement in 23 as compared to 22 and that s really driven by two things i m not sure how long this inflationary pressure is going to last i m not sure we ll see as much pressure in 23 as 22 or 21 we ll have more time obviously to put in mitigating actions and what have you and see how the market responds and then you have less pressure on the p1 line installations in 23 as compared to 22 and 21 so that s how i would see the progression and then as far as ivantis if you recall our capital markets day the guidance we gave did not include any acquisitions so we feel very good about the 23 and 25 commitments ivantis isn t really material enough to impact those when you think about the longer term anyway veronika dubajova goldman sachs analyst fabulous thank you guys operator our next question comes from the line of larry biegelsen with wells fargo please proceed with your question lawrence biegelsen wells fargo securities llc analyst good morning thanks for taking the question so david just one on ivantis could do you guys it sounds like you guys think you can grow the product from here from the 60 million despite the reimbursement change can you grow that product in 2022 and beyond and any color on the u s ous breakdown of sales and tim could you just help us quantify the fx headwind the ivantis headwind and inflation in 2022 thanks for taking the questions david j endicott chief executive officer yeah larry on the ivantis yeah we believe we can grow the product long term i think it s we were very aware of a number of situations that we wanted to see resolved before we got into an acquisitive mode with ivantis the cms ruling was one of them and as you know that settled out last week it was very improved from the very difficult price they gave us at the beginning but again it is going to have some downward effect on what was i think a low to mid teens growth rate on the market that said again we think the market continues to grow and we think this product in particular can gain share so as we see it the market is a fast growing market where with the right amount of energy on this product and the right amount of messaging and frankly the great amount of data that the team at ivantis has pulled together for us we re excited about what we can do with it and we ll see how that adds into it and this is right in our wheelhouse right i mean we re in surgery every day with the surgeons doing this procedure this is it s a it s an easy an important kind of add to our service to the surgeons and on the ous to u s sales the way to think about is it s just it s predominantly u s sales right now there s not a significant amount of ous right now we look forward to trying to change that but we ll work principally on reimbursement first before we get very far out get a bunch of sales folks out there we re going to work through that and again i think they re in five countries right now as you know we are thinking about a lot of other markets than that tim stonesifer senior vice president and chief financial officer yeah and as far as the some of the quantifications larry i ll start with fx i rattled off some of the currencies that have been increasing i mean if you were to take the entire bucket of the currencies that really matter it could be 2 or 3 points and but again that s as of rates as of last week and we re just going to continue to monitor those as we progress through and before we give guidance next year on the inflation front it s i m a little bit hesitant to say because again we have pricing actions out there we have our manufacturing guys driving a bunch of productivity initiatives that we re still shaping up so that s one we re going to continue to monitor i would expect to see some pressure but we ll give you some more color when we give our guide next year and as far as ivantis it will put some slight margin rate pressure i mean i would think about take the 60 million in sales and grow that at whatever you think is appropriate next year and there won t be a lot of core operating income with that so that will give you some rate pressure lawrence biegelsen wells fargo securities llc analyst thank you guys operator our next question comes from the line of daniel buchta with zkb please proceed with your question daniel buchta zurcher kantonalbank analyst thank you very much gentlemen for taking my two questions and the first one maybe on the vision care margin i mean it was pretty nice to see that vision care had a relatively good margin in q3 obviously they are all working well with the capacity additions you have and the drag they are causing on operating margins here but can you really feel like it s a turning point here so that going into 2022 vision care should really should turn the tide and show rising margins and then the second question on the one offs i mean you had this one impairment in the amount of 178 million and can you clarify a little bit more what this was related to and also you have 60 million legal expenses what does that cover and what are the risks here could there be bigger burdens to come still on the legal front thank you very much tim stonesifer senior vice president and chief financial officer sure thanks for the question danny yeah as far as vision care margins we were pleased with q3 we continue to make progress i would caveat that though that q3 is impacted by seasonality so we had a very strong revenue performance and some of that is driven by if you think about allergies or allergy season as an example we have a heavier revenue mix in q3 as compared to q4 if you look at the back to school programs that we were on particularly in the u s that gives you a stronger q3 as compared to q4 so operating leverage is driving a significant amount of that improvement but nonetheless we re very pleased with how the vision care business is performing from a impairment perspective yes we did impair we had a surgical asset that we had purchased in 2017 and as you know given the portfolio that we have we manage all of our assets all of our investments on a continuous basis and given some of the successes we ve had in other pieces of the surgical business which is where this asset was we decided to suspend our r d and any potential commercialization so we did take an impairment that was 178 million that is a one time non cash item and then lastly on the legal provision we don t really comment on outstanding legal cases so what i would say is every quarter we look at our at the legal landscape and we look at the balance sheet and we provide provisions to make sure that we are adequately covered and we feel like we re adequately covered in q3 daniel buchta zurcher kantonalbank analyst okay just to clarify there is no bigger issue you are particularly worried about on the legal side tim stonesifer senior vice president and chief financial officer i m sorry what was that david j endicott chief executive officer he was asking about the no look we are again on the legal stuff we look at it every quarter we aggregate it and then look at our risk and we make an appropriate provision so that s what we ve done daniel buchta zurcher kantonalbank analyst okay thank you very much very clear operator the next question comes from the line of cecilia furlong with morgan stanley please proceed with your question cecilia furlong morgan stanley analyst hey thank you for taking the question two questions and i ll ask them both upfront but just in terms of new fits i m curious if you could talk a bit more about what you saw in ous markets during the quarter as well as your outlook going forward from a recovery standpoint and then also just between total30 and ramping dt1 toric can you talk a bit more about just how you re thinking about balancing those two and your comments on ramping manufacturing lines into 23 and thank you david j endicott chief executive officer yeah so new fits right now are going quite well for us i would say in the u s we continue to make a lot of progress particularly in the dailies now t30 is brand new so we don t have a lot of data to give you on that one but precision1 has done very well dt1 is also continues to do well for us outside the u s it s a bit slower and i would say that what we ve seen is that the markets really have new fits coming into the office have been down and remain down particularly japan which is our second largest market europe has gotten a little bit better it s slowly working its way back but as you i think you re correctly pointing out you need to be in a situation where new patients are coming into the office and or patients who are having trouble with their current lenses are coming in and looking for some alternative and so as the market comes back in those areas and i think we believe the vision care international business will largely be back to the 2019 levels in the beginning of the year again i think that s really positive for the new fits for new products but i do think that we ve been trailing our trajectory in the u s because the new fits really aren t there yet so but we ll get there and i think what we see which is encouraging is that when we get these products into the hands of patients and optometrists they are really performing well and so people really like our precision1 for astigmatism they really like the precision1 sphere our dt1 for astigmatism has gotten great reviews in the u s same thing with t30 both in europe and in the u s and so we are working through all of those and obviously we look forward to a more normal market next year where we can get a little bit more share outside the u s but i would say on the ramp up of manufacturing we are in a good place we did we ve had a greater than expected demand for precision1 and so we were a little bit off guard with how well precision1 for astigmatism did and we did have sporadic back orders around the u s and we ve had to delay some rollouts because of that but it just took off on us and so the good news is we got a great reception and we ve had some nice movement on that product but what we do need to do is really look at now what do we expect from these products and do we need more line time and do we need more machines what are we going to do about it so i think we re working through that now again i don t anticipate any major changes per se but we may want to invest a little bit more manufacturing for next year so we ll see cecilia furlong morgan stanley analyst great thank you for taking the questions operator and ladies and gentlemen as we ve reached the top of the hour we have time for one more question and which leads us to the line of jeff johnson from baird please proceed with your question jeff johnson baird analyst thank you good morning guys thanks for squeezing me in david just on that contact lens point i d be interested to hear primarily your expectations what you re seeing for trade up versus trade down from dt1 the trade downs and trade ups from dacp and some of the other older focus products number one and number two let s say you grow a couple of points above market in the contact lens market over the next couple of years do you think that will primarily be driven by net kind of trade up benefits within your own portfolio or do you expect that you d also be taking unit or patient share on eye share however you want to think about it relative to competition david j endicott chief executive officer yeah a little bit of both jeff i mean i think let s start with the cannibalization question we expected to have some cannibalization with p1 of dacp in particular in truth i think the dacp has been a little bit more stable than we expected and dt1 was probably a little bit more than we expected but directionally the all in value change was pretty much as expected so i would say the mix might have been a little bit different than we expected but we re also working hard to make sure that people really understand what these products are and their proposition and i think as we get dt1 one of the reasons we pushed dt1 toric out a little bit sooner than maybe we had wanted to was because p1 toric took off on us and that put some pressure on dt1 because the total1 product obviously great product but we didn t have a toric for it so we were seeing a little bit of p1 eat into dt1 so now that we ve got the toric out there again that stabilizes our premium product now we ve got a and we ve got both the p1 and p1 toric out there so we ve got a middle market product and again that line up seems to be doing quite well for us going forward over time look i think there is a lot of trade up going on between reusables and dailies that s gone on for years and i think one of the really great things about the vision care market is it isn t fast moving or it isn t it s steady and strong and so you re seeing a very fundamental shift from reusables to dailies which is going to continue and i think that drives value growth even in a market where eq growth would be 1 ish maybe 2 on a good day so i think that we expect to see some competitive share for sure but we don t have to go steal share from everybody in this space to grow nicely in the mid single digits or higher so i think that s the beauty of what we re doing right now the other piece of this of course is that our reusable business is under represented in our share position as one of the earlier questions came to us and so as we think about that we actually think we can gain share in the reusable space pretty easily particularly with this technology and that margin profile is a good margin profile for us right i mean that s a much better margin than the dailies margin albeit a lower growth at market so we can gain share improve margin there and then gain revenue and maybe a less attractive margin but still positive we got a good mix going and i think that s how we see moving forward remember too that when we go to the specialty lenses torics in particular that s the sweet spot of this market right now growing very quickly in the silicon hydrogel space and at a premium price to the sphere so again i think we re well positioned to grow for a good bit of time here jeff johnson baird analyst understood and a quick follow up it s been a little quite here recently maybe that s a good thing but haven t heard any updates recently on vbp in china any timing updates there any kind of way to look at public versus private mix within your business just how to think about exposure and if there is a timeline to think about when that exposure might have to be factored into models thanks david j endicott chief executive officer yeah i mean i think china has obviously gone down this path for some time the iol was implemented at a provincial level in most of the provinces at this point in october there was probably only one vbp tender i think it was a joint tender for two provinces but in previous iol vbps the atiol some of them included atiols but mostly they were having price impacts on our monofocal on the monofocal business and we are i would say under represented in the public monofocal business generally so where we re kind of over represented in china tends to be in the private atiol business so again i don t really have a split for you but i ll just tell you that directionally most of our money is kind of in the private sector atiol business now look there is some crossover impacts here that we re watching very carefully but again i think directionally we probably have less exposure than some jeff johnson baird

by lt matt little u s navy on august 26th ships aircraft and personnel from australia india japan and the united states commenced for the second year in a row a combined naval exercise to demonstrate cooperative planning training and employment of advanced warfare tactics 1 the exercise malabar 2021 marks a significant step toward increased maritime cooperation between the four members of the quadrilateral security dialogue or quad which has emerged as a promising but unproven partnership for regional security in the indo pacific the quad nations are united by their agreement on the importance of a free and open indo pacific but have not yet defined their mutual role in the region lingering ambiguity surrounding the quad s intended function breeds doubt about its potential for success and prompts dismissal by critics of the current informal relationship 2 former japanese prime minister shinzo abe first described a vision for the quad as a security diamond meant to safeguard the maritime commons of the indo pacific 3 how might the current leaders of the quad nations defy the critics and bring abe s vision to fruition maritime security is an innately multinational interest with challenges such as unregulated fishing smuggling and piracy that occur in international waters and traverse borders between states 4 the quad comprised of four democratic nations committed to the rule of law is well suited to muster a collective response to these illicit activities the united states for its part would be wise to embrace such cooperation u s policymakers concede that america s military advantage in the region is eroding and that allies and partners are crucial to achieving u s policy objectives 5 the combined national powers of the quad provide an opportunity to exert the military and law enforcement presence necessary to respond to security threats while actively pursuing increased cooperation with rising regional powers the quadrilateral security dialogue should focus the combined diplomatic information military and economic power of its member nations to promote maritime security in the indo pacific by fostering and strengthening rising partners in the region while coordinating to detect analyze and interdict illicit maritime activity invest in asean the quad s main line of effort in the tense indo pacific region should be diplomacy and the primary avenues of approach should be relations with the association of southeast asian nations asean the quad provides a vehicle for its members to engage asean on common goals as one body rather than as separate parties asean s own published outlook on the indo pacific echoes many of the quad s priorities for the region indicating that engagement would likely be worthwhile the asean nations aspire to play a central role in promoting maritime security by combating transnational crimes such as trafficking in persons or of illicit drugs sea piracy and armed robbery against ships and by cooperating for sustainable management of marine resources 6 the quad in turn has publicly committed to asean centrality in the region and voiced support for asean s outlook such agreement between the two multinational partnerships is a starting point for increased diplomatic efforts and consensus building another diplomatic component of maritime security in which the quad nations are highly capable is the realm of humanitarian aid and disaster relief hadr the quad could expand its soft power in the region with little political resistance by incorporating hadr into its diplomatic agenda 7 by continually promoting itself as a force for good in the region the quad will retain the necessary diplomatic capital to enforce maritime law and stave off allegations that its purpose is as a military alliance for great power competition as china s presence and power in the region continue to grow it will be increasingly important for the quad to remain an attractive non threatening partner for asean cooperation hadr will likely prove a key component in sustaining goodwill among both asean political leaders and the people of southeast asia after establishing firm diplomatic ties with asean nations and other cooperative partners the quad should coordinate economic investments to help those partners strengthen their own maritime security efforts several quad nations already have existing economic programs meant to address such security challenges the maritime security initiative of the united states for example is a 425 million program that provides grants to asean nations for technologies such as automatic identification systems intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities data collection capacity and secure communications 8 the promise of the quad is the ability to direct the economic efforts of all four nations toward a single purpose to maximize effectiveness by acting as one body the quad can dedicate more resources towards providing asean nations with the technologies and capabilities required to make them effective maritime security partners in addition to assisting asean nations with their maritime security capabilities the quad could improve economic security in the region by responding to violations of asean economic exclusion zones eezs for example as signatories to the un fish stocks agreement the quad nations would share an interest in conducting boarding and inspection of fishing vessels to ensure compliance with international rules 9 enforcing the rule of law in eezs would help ensure that asean nations have the right to protect and benefit from their own natural resources improving their economic situation would provide asean nations with more financial resources to dedicate towards maritime security initiatives enforce maritime order while diplomatic and economic efforts should largely be spent fostering new partnerships for the quad the information and military levers of power should be directed toward improving the quad s ability to respond to current issues in the region one of the major challenges to fostering maritime security in the vast indo pacific is maintaining continuous maritime domain awareness mda the individual quad nations already possess many of the resources and doctrine required to contribute to a robust mda picture in the area of maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft for example all four nations field comparable assets the united states australia and india all operate the p 8 poseidon and while japan chose to build the kawasaki p 1 it shares many standard operating procedures and tactics with the united states and australia from many years of operating the p 3 orion 10 the quad s immediate focus in the information realm should be combining the mda efforts of its assets into a shared common operational picture cop that provides all four nations with situational awareness of maritime security concerns the primary hurdles for the development of a shared cop are limits on information sharing the quad should build upon recently signed agreements such as the communications compatibility and security agreement comcasa between the u s and india and the trilateral information sharing arrangement tisa between the u s australia and japan to craft a quadrilateral agreement that allows for universal sharing of maritime intelligence 11 12 with information sharing architecture in place the quad should next form a maritime intelligence fusion center where analysts from all four nations can assimilate information and coordinate military or law enforcement responses to illicit maritime activity ideally this fusion center would be developed in a central strategic location such as india s andaman and nicobar command at the mouth of the strait of malacca 13 in addition to instituting formal information sharing and analysis the quad should take several steps to improve its military response to maritime security issues first should be organizing and conducting ongoing training for proficiency and interoperability both among its own nations and alongside willing participants from asean most of the training should focus on law enforcement and response which would be less politically sensitive than regular drilling of warfighting tactics and would address the most common concerns in the region such as smuggling piracy human trafficking and illegal fishing 14 the quad could even consider involving chinese authorities in law enforcement training as a way to foster cooperation on mutual concerns after a period of successful training the next step for the quad should be to create an on call force comprised of quad naval and coast guard assets that would share responsibility for responding to illicit activity across the region 15 the four nations would coordinate the placement of maritime assets across the region to minimize response time to any located threats these assets could then respond to information gathered by the quad maritime fusion center or reports from asean nations concerning incursions of their sovereignty by working together to detect analyze track and respond to illicit maritime activity the quad could grow into a functional maritime security enforcement organization that would promote a rules based order across the indo pacific no nato of the pacific more aggressive proponents of the quad might argue that the group s maritime security efforts should not be directed solely at partner building and maritime domain awareness but rather towards deterring china s malign actions in the region such as the militarization of the south china sea but while recasting the quad as a nato of the pacific may seem like the arrangement s logical strategic destiny proceeding too quickly towards open opposition to china would inevitably break the partnership the greatest challenge for the quad will be keeping the strategic priorities of the four nations aligned in the face of inevitable pressure from the prc 16 all four quad nations are deeply entangled with china economically and as democracies would face the difficult task of messaging the economic consequences resulting from a military standoff forcing the quad too quickly into an anti china alliance would likely produce political pressures leading to its demise additionally the various interests of asean nations align with both china and the quad if the quad were solely aimed at great power competition with a rising china asean would not support it 17 lacking cooperation with asean the quad would have little influence or legitimacy in the region the quad s maritime security efforts should focus on politically insensitive missions that foster cooperation and interoperability and could later be scaled to meet deteriorating strategic conditions if china continues its record of coercion and pressure in the region the governments of canberra delhi tokyo and washington will all recalibrate their threat perceptions and may very well see the value in intensifying their military cooperation 18 in the meantime the quad can still take some steps to counter chinese aggression for example the recent participation of the quad nations in malabar 2021 should be repeated an annual exercise that brings together the capital assets of all four nations fosters high end interoperability and builds the combined capabilities of the quad militaries thereby improving deterrence in the region by demonstrating an increased capacity for response 19 in conclusion the quadrilateral security dialogue should focus the combined diplomatic information military and economic power of its four member nations to promote maritime security in the indo pacific by fostering and strengthening rising partners in the region while coordinating to detect analyze and interdict illicit maritime activity the quad is the premiere u s partnership in the region for addressing maritime security a critical component of the u s vision for a free and open indo pacific the u s will not achieve its objectives in the region if quad efforts towards maritime security are misdirected or ineffective diplomacy and economic measures should focus on improving the willingness and capability of asean nations to join the quad in pursuing their mutual goal of a free and open indo pacific quad information and military capabilities should be combined and coordinated to improve maritime domain awareness and provide a response mechanism to address illicit maritime activity these measures would all be politically viable and would preclude a looming china from driving a wedge between the partners u s policy recognizes the indo pacific as the single most consequential region for america s future 21 if the

how one photographer turned entrepreneur is changing the industry joshua kissi s squarespace website one of the great things about the rise of the internet and social media especially is that it gave young and independent creators access to a global audience photographer joshua kissi was able to create a career for himself in part because of his online influence and he now stands as one of the pioneers in the business of creativity in the digital age along with his high school friend travis gumbs kissi created street etiquette a lifestyle blog focusing on black men s style since its launch the platform has evolved into a creative agency and kissi has made a name for himself in the industry his work has appeared in publications worldwide and he has teamed up with leading brands around the globe with his stock photo company tonl the ghanian american photographer directs his efforts towards reshaping the stock imagery industry into one that is more culturally diverse and inclusive as a photographer with a portfolio as extended as it is diverse it was important for kissi to build a website that reflected the range of his work thanks to squarespace and their beautiful website templates the photographer was able to show off his work in an organized and visually appealing way kissi also set up an online store allowing him to sell prints directly to his audience squarespace is a website builder that offers stunning layouts for photographers and visual artists like joshua known for their clean and striking approach to web design they make it easy to create a website without the hassle of coding we talked to the photographer about his business his photography and the online platform he created to showcase it all joshua kissi s squarespace website what initially attracted you to squarespace has a hosting platform for your website i think squarespace is the best platform when it comes to supplying the right type of template and backend functions for anyone from a novice user to an advanced user the template designs are diverse in design and aesthetically pleasing i think the days of having a crappy website are gone with platforms like squarespace there is no excuse your website showcases everything you do from street etiquette to tonl how important was it for you to show the full range of your talents rather than focus on one specific aspect of your work i was able to have a good friend cleon grey who is a ux ui designer help me with what the design and communication points on the website as well it was very important to us to show the full perspective of my individual pursuits on the website between tonl street etiquette and commission based work the goal was essentially to display that my craft is photography but it was also vital to communicate my entrepreneurial journey in co founding two companies can you tell me a bit more about your template what exactly attracted you to it i chose the miller template from squarespace i loved the simplicity of the template you can plug in any image and the template comes to life in a way that is unique to you in your opinion how important is it for photographers to have a website showcasing their work instagram has become a new portfolio for a lot of photographers but potential clients especially more traditional ones would ask for a portfolio i finally decided to create a website one night while hanging out with my fiancé and friends it was one of those tasks that i frequently procrastinated on because the idea of displaying my favorite or best images would put my mind in a frenzy since developing my website i feel there are potential clients who believe in what i m presenting to them and the general consensus is that i m a working photographer and not a hobbyist your website has a shop section as well in which people can get prints of your work can you talk a bit about your experience with selling your work on squarespace selling prints on my website has been a transformative experience altogether personally it s been my first time printing my images for supporters to take part in my creative journey with me it has been delightful when i launched the shop section of the website i would sit idle and watch the purchase confirmation emails with joy because i didn t think anyone would buy them how has your creative process evolved since you started taking photos what do you think is the best lesson you learned along the way my creative process has evolved through being more intentional about being in the moment when capturing subjects when i shoot subjects i try to build a meaningful relationship with them if possible things like learning about their interests their experience and their childhood provides me with a perspective on how they see the world which is so important the best lesson i learned along the way is to keep going even when things appear tough because there is growth on the other side what have been the differences between tonl and street etiquette in terms of creative process do you approach photography the same way in both cases the creative process for tonl and street etiquette are a bit similar but also totally different street etiquette s end product photographs are as editorial as they need to be because of our style and fashion background tonl needs to exist within that perfect medium between commercial editorial and lifestyle when shooting for tonl we have to make sure we re pushing the narrative of all types of individuals everywhere and not displaying some of the same stereotypical images that have been created in the past which current photographers and visual artists are you inspired by i m inspired by andre wagner adrienne raquel serge k clottey travis gumbs and prince gyasi what do you

president joe biden visited the port of baltimore on wednesday to highlight steps his administration is taking to alleviate middle class burdens and planned infrastructure investments that will increase supply chain efficiency now and in the future the tour took place against a backdrop of consumer inflation at a 30 year high and christmas products stuck on ships because ports and inland systems are too crowded to move more imports to their destination delays and soaring transportation costs were significant contributors to the 6 2 inflation rate in october the government reported earlier congress passed a 1 2 trillion infrastructure bill on friday that delivers federal investments in transportation drinking water electric vehicle charging broadband and emission reduction projects biden said his economic priorities are to get prices down make sure stores are fully stocked and put people back to work who were displaced by covid by investing in our roads our bridges our ports this bill is going to make it easier for companies to get goods to market quickly and ensure our shelves are stocked with products and the longer term view is it means building greater resilience to withstand the shocks and disruptions we can anticipate biden said in a speech at the seagirt marine terminal the bill represents the biggest investment in ports in american history and for american families it means products moving faster and less expensively from the factory floor through the supply chain to your home he said with a maersk container vessel tied up on the dock behind him the white house is already moving to implement parts of the infrastructure investment package even before the president signs it into law monday so funds can be quickly used to address some of the immediate supply chain bottlenecks on tuesday it announced a port action plan that includes policy changes allowing port authorities to redirect savings from previous projects toward mitigating dock truck and rail chokepoints an expedited disbursement process for port grants faster reviews for major harbor dredging projects guidance on how states should direct formula grants for roads and bridges to freight projects establishment of a system for supply chain data sharing to increase visibility the infrastructure plan includes 17 billion for ports 25 billion for airports and 110 billion for roads and bridges which experts say have suffered from decades of underinvestment included in the package are a 2 25 billion port infrastructure development grants program and nearly 5 billion for

baltimore is an example of the type of nationally significant public private project on the drawing board for many years that is finally getting funding to eliminate a major freight bottleneck the

railroad csx nasdaq csx direct access to its main north south line along the interstate 95 corridor and the ability to more efficiently move shipments to the ohio valley and chicago the state of maryland is the primary funding source for the project with a 202 5 million investment during his tour the president viewed large machinery rolls of fresh fiber paperboard and other goods that are imported and exported through baltimore he also met crane operators and other unionized dockworkers the port of baltimore handles more autos and light trucks heavy farm and construction machinery than any port in the u s it is a major gateway for goods purchased for e commerce sellers due to the high number of local distribution fulfillment and sorting centers in the area the seaport has received 23 unscheduled ships in the past year that were diverted from other ports because of congestion totaling more than 35 000 twenty foot equivalent units according to the maryland port authority in 2020 the seagirt terminal handled 628 132 containers earlier this year terminal operator ports america completed a dredging project that deepened to 50 feet a second berth so seagirt can handle two ultra large container vessels simultaneously seagirt also received four massive neo panamax ship to shore cranes that can reach across 23 rows of containers the cranes are expected to be fully operational

the white house supply chain disruptions task force formed to coordinate solutions among various freight modes port authorities logistics companies and their customers the administration has called on the ports of los angeles and long beach along with a handful of major importers to extend hours of operation into the night to maximize utilization of constrained assets and spread out truck transfers to less busy periods in his speech biden said the commitment to 24 7 operations is already paying dividends in reduced wait times for containers the reality is there is only a single pilot program at one terminal so far and it has hardly been utilized as yet because of difficulties truckers have returning empty containers and shifting their schedules according to industry officials in the area and the number of cargo containers cargo owners agreed to receive at night is extremely small compared to the overall volume the white house also endorsed the twin ports decision to impose stiff surcharges on imported containers left on the docks for extended periods created a supply chain dashboard showing key performance indicators and is cutting red tape to better link customs systems with trading partners to facilitate document exchanges biden met tuesday with ceos from big box retailers and integrated logistics and parcel delivery companies to discuss progress in combating freight bottlenecks building on a meeting he held a month ago biden explained the basics about how supply chains work to uninitiated americans facing rising prices on everything from gasoline to bread and clothes and frustrated that favorite products are sometimes unavailable he noted how disruptions have coincided with higher demand enabled by higher wages and savings in simple terms a supply chain is just the journey that a product takes to get to your doorstep raw materials plus labor assembly and shipping these products are extremely complex even a product as simple as a pencil can use wood from brazil and graphite from india before it comes together at a factory in the united states biden said global supply chains have dramatically brought down the price of things we buy but they ve also made us much more reliant on what happens in other parts of the world so if the factory in malaysia shuts down due to a covid outbreak it causes a ripple effect that can slow down auto manufacturing in detroit because they can t get the computer chips that they need that s why it s important to do everything we can to stabilize the supply chains click here for more freightwaves american shipper

electric automaker rivian hit public markets with a big splash rivian shares surged in their first day of trading on wednesday after the company completed one of the largest initial public offerings in u s history the shares have settled slightly after the initial pop but the company is still valued at close to 100 billion a larger market capitalization than ford or general motors has although not as high as tesla s mind boggling 1 trillion valuation it s a lot for a company that has built only a couple of hundred vehicles and hasn t turned a profit yet but rivian is hoping to echo tesla s vertiginous rise from automotive startup to mass market manufacturer it plans to sell pickup trucks suvs and a delivery vehicle and it counts amazon and ford as some of its key shareholders here s why rivian is attracting so much buzz electric vehicles are hot companies may disagree about how quickly a transition to electric vehicles will happen but the entire industry is embracing the idea that battery powered vehicles are the future at the cop26 climate talks on wednesday dozens of governments and companies embraced a target of selling only zero emission vehicles by 2040 or 2035 in major markets it essentially means replacing every new gas or diesel powered vehicle with an electric one spencer platt getty images getty images the interior of rivian s all electric pickup truck r1t as it sits at one of the automaker s facilities in brooklyn n y on nov 9 the company has started deliveries of the r1t the scale of that transition is huge posing a big challenge for existing automakers and an opening for new entrants in the market there s a lot of opportunity says stephanie brinley an analyst with ihs markit and of course the meteoric rise of tesla has whetted the appetite for who can do it again tesla is currently the world s most valuable automaker despite producing fewer vehicles than its rivals rivian won the race to build the first electric pickup truck americans love pickup trucks and drop a lot of money on them so automakers were competing to bring the first battery powered truck to market rivian won that race starting deliveries of its r1t this fall the r1t starts at 67 500 and is marketed toward outdoor enthusiasts one optional feature is a pullout kitchen with an induction stovetop and a sink designed for cooking at campsites it pairs adventure oriented specs with a luxurious interior cnn called it a glamper s dream truck rivian may have been the first electric pickup to market but it won t be the last established automakers are launching electric versions of their pickup trucks including ford the maker of the bestselling pickup in america it will be challenging for rivian to compete with the bigger cheaper ford f 150 lightning when it becomes available and the competition in the space will grow even fiercer as gm is also expected to unveil its all electric silverado at ces next year says jessica caldwell executive analyst at edmunds referring to a popular technology trade conference but for now rivian has the advantage of timing and the vehicle s performance is getting good reviews including a glowing assessment from edmunds on road testing team jeff kowalsky afp via getty images afp via getty images ford unveiled its new electric f 150 lightning pickup outside its headquarters in dearborn mich on may 19 ford like other legacy automakers plans to sell electric versions of many of its popular models it s also targeting the commercial delivery market rivian has another major advantage it has a huge deal with amazon to build electric delivery trucks amazon invested a lot of cash in the startup and owns a sizable stake in rivian the retail giant has committed to buying 100 000 delivery vehicles from rivian a big deal for the fledgling automaker that s as many vehicles as tesla is due to deliverto rental car company hertz in a deal that sent shares in the electric automaker sharply higher other electric automakers have stumbled a bunch of startups have tried to re create the tesla magic with spotty success hydrogen truck company nikola and electric pickup maker lordstown have been investigated by the securities and exchange commission after fraud allegations while other companies have just disappointed with repeated delays in their promised vehicles and with their underperforming stocks some analysts think rivian is better positioned than its rivals particularly because it has demonstrated it can build its product rivian for the most part has kind of been a little bit more nose to the grindstone and doing the work and getting it done brinley from ihs markit says one other electric vehicle startup can say the same lucid which went public this year through a different route also started deliveries of its luxury electric sedan it currently has a market cap of around 70 billion patrick t fallon afp via getty images afp via getty images a lucid air grand touring electric luxury car is displayed at lucid motors studio and service center in beverly hills calif on feb 25 lucid is another electric startup attracting a lot of buzz still scaling up will be a huge challenge for rivian delivering a vehicle to consumers was a major achievement for rivian but volumes are still small rivian has tens of thousands of preorders but expects to deliver only 1 000 vehicles by the end of 2021 the company s factory in normal ill can hypothetically produce hundreds of thousands of vehicles but brinley says to be truly sustainable rivian will need to expand to more plants let s not put the cart before the horse says asad hussain a mobility analyst with pitchbook i think the real challenge is going to be ramping up that manufacturing capacity the ipo should help its listing brought in nearly 12 billion for rivian a cash infusion the company will use to tackle that challenging problem of scaling up copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

oil tanks on worry over biden initiatives as demand continues to soar by ship bunker news team however chances of spr oil being released seem less likely file image pixabay oil on wednesday fell 3 3 percent the biggest drop in a week due partly to a rising u s dollar and as industry data differed on the state of domestic crude stocks falling last week however bob yawger director of energy futures for mizuho said the big reason for oil prices tanking was u s president joe biden asking the national economic council to work to reduce energy costs and the federal trade commission to push back on market manipulation in the energy sector in an effort to reverse inflation which was revealed in the u s to be rising at a 6 2 percent year over year rate the fastest rate in three decades west texas intermediate fell 2 81 to settle at 81 34 per barrel while brent declined 2 14 to settle at 82 64 per barrel after an energy information administration report showed that inventories rose by 1 million barrels in the most recent week short of estimates for a 2 1 million build the eia report does curb concerns that the u s will release oil vivek dhar analyst commonwealth bank this contradicted earlier american petroleum institute data showing u s crude stocks declining by 2 5 million barrels for the week to november 5 vivek dhar analyst at commonwealth bank said in a note the eia report does curb concerns that the u s will release oil from its strategic petroleum reserve spr but even given the stock build overall growing demand which not too long ago caused jubilation in trading circles but is now a source of angst given supply s inability to catch up is hardly confined to the u s while asia jet fuel refining margins dipped on wednesday they stayed close to multi month highs achieved in recent weeks on recovering aviation demand cash premiums for jet fuel jet sin dif rose to 35 cents per barrel to singapore quotes compared with 27 cents per barrel on tuesday meanwhile trading in the days ahead will likely be influenced by biden being pressured even by fellow democrats to combat high prices at the pump with a ban on oil exports a move that dismayed kevin book managing director of research firm clearview energy partners he noted if you block crude and cause an artificial drop in the wti price you probably hurt the driller more than you help the driver there is more for the u s economy to gain from investment in the oil patch than savings in the service aisle
rhode island senator jack reed and ten colleagues are urging the biden administration to do what it can to lower gasoline prices the average price is currently three dollars 40 cents a 25 cent increase in rhode island in the past month reed and the other senators are suggesting a release from the strategic petroleum reserve and a ban on crude oil exports to help curb rising prices instead of allowing the market to work investing in clean energy technology and strengthening domestic energy infrastructure the trump administration fixated on propping up the stock price of big oil companies rolling back vehicle fuel efficiency standards and cozying up to saudi arabia and russia now americans are paying more at the pump and our nation is more vulnerable to the oil whims of saudi arabia russia and other adversarial dictatorships abroad stated reed oil companies are enjoying the surge in fuel prices consumers are not and it has to end some of the upward pressure on oil prices today is directly tied to the fact that oil producers can make more money by producing less oil for the good of our economy and national security we must ween ourselves off a system that is so ripe for foreign manipulation and driven by greed in addition to senator reed the letter was signed by u s senators bob casey d pa patrick leahy d vt elizabeth warren d ma maggie hassan d nh ed markey d ma tina smith d mn chris van hollen d md jeanne shaheen d nh richard blumenthal d ct and sherrod brown d oh so far there has been response from the white house photo by michael williams getty images

congress created this tax favored opportunity in the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 to help address the belief that persistent poverty and uneven economic recovery left too many american communities behind since then many investors developers real estate and other entrepreneurial types and other investors have used this congressionally sanctioned investment opportunity to invest in otherwise distressed areas designated as opportunity zones the internal revenue service explicitly recognizes the inherent opportunity zone purposes of spur economic growth and job creation in low income communities while providing tax benefits to investors the recent 2020 election and the seemingly inflationary economic climate may portend changes in many previously favored tax provisions however to this point no proposal mentions rolling back or eliminating this particular tax benefit can taxpayers expect opportunity zone investments to boom in 2021 the federal government designated over 8 700 low income census tracts chosen by state governors and certified by the treasury department where investors can use capital to finance various investments in return for tax advantages investors must invest in these designated opportunity zones through opportunity funds essentially funds that invest at least 90 percent of their assets in qualified opportunity zone property which means i qualified opportunity zone stock ii qualified opportunity zone partnership interest and iii qualified opportunity zone business property the remainder of this article assumes a qualifying opportunity fund the treasury regulations under section 1400z 1 and 2 set out requirements for these tax favored opportunities in copious detail as constructed the opportunity zone may represent the most generous such tax incentive to date investing realized capital gains in an opportunity zone through an opportunity fund provides i a temporary tax deferral ii a basis step up and iii a permanent exclusion from recognition of any gain accrued on the investment in the opportunity fund not the original gains temporary tax deferral assume an investor sells an investment portfolio with a 1 million capital gain at that moment the investor realizes the capital gain but investing the 1 million realized capital gain in an opportunity zone fund within 180 days after the sale defers recognition of that gain until the earlier of i the date the opportunity zone investment gets sold and ii december 31 2026 if the original sale takes place in 2021 the opportunity zone investment defers recognition of the 1 million realized gain to december 31 2026 assuming no earlier sale basis increase that 1 million investment in the opportunity fund has zero basis immediately after acquisition however holding that initial investment in the opportunity zone for five years results in a 10 percent increase in basis here decreasing the realized gain from 1 million to 900 000 if this sale and investment occurred on or before december 31 2019 for a holding period of at least seven years the opportunity zone rules would have added another five percent basis increase and thus reduced his realized capital gain to 850 000 now taxpayers do not have time before december 31 2026 to hold the investment for seven years permanent exclusion holding the opportunity fund investment for at least 10 years without regard to the december 31 2026 date results in a complete exclusion of any gains accrued on the opportunity fund investment itself if the taxpayer properly elects such treatment for example if the 1 million investment in the opportunity zone fund grows to 2 5 million in 10 years the taxpayer still pays tax on the appropriate portion of the initial 1 million invested capital gain but not on the 1 5 million gain on the opportunity zone asset itself right now depending on the type of investment that exclusion saves somewhere between 15 percent and 20 percent of that additional 1 5 million gain plus the net investment income tax niit of 3 8 percent or somewhere between 282 000 and 357 000 in taxes assuming no recapture note this exclusion does not apply to dispositions occurring after december 31 2047 so plan accordingly this provision still generally allows a taxpayer to exclude up to 30 years worth of capital appreciation the recent biden budget proposal includes an increase in the capital gains rate to 39 6 percent for married taxpayers filing jointly with more than 1 million of income raising the combined capital gains tax rate and niit rate to 43 4 percent taking effect as of the date of the announcement if congress enacts that provision opportunity zones become that much more attractive take the 1 million gain example above the new tax on that sale increases to 434 000 for a married taxpayer instead of 238 000 so the opportunity zone now defers an additional 196 000 of realized capital gain if the taxpayer again holds the investment for 10 years and receives 1 5 million of appreciation the opportunity zone investment now saves 651 000 in capital gains taxes of course the deferred tax due increases as well conversely if the markets fail to continue their pre covid gains then the opportunity zone still results in a better after tax return but the exclusion of the gain on the opportunity zone investment itself will not be as attractive but tax avoidance remains tax avoidance if you have significant unrealized capital gains selling those assets realizing the gain and investing the gain in the right opportunity zone investment results in a greater after tax return compared to simply selling the appreciated assets and paying the tax assuming an identical reinvestment opportunity in terms of risk and return

gazprom to europe we own you at least until 2016 zerohedge aug 14 2014 it is no secret that in scrambling to find an alternative to russia s energy export dominance europe is actively seeking to recreate the us shale miracle at least superficially recall that a month ago germany shelved shale gas drilling plans until at least 2021 when it would again reassess the shale ban curiously one of the few places that features as a most probable candidate for shale drilling is none other than ukraine itself whose dnieper donets basin is a place targeted by local energy company burisma where as we have reported extensively in the past none other than joe biden s son hunter has been strategically placed as a director to give the us a front line of sight into drilling developments there is one problem however and a rather major one at that it will take europe years in a best case scenario at that before it can bring its shale output online in fact according to gazprom s quarterly report released on wednesday shale gas production in europe could be possible in europe not earlier than in 2016 2018 which of course is gazprom s polite way of saying that for at least the next two years and likely far longer european marginal gas needs will be met by the dreaded russian semi nationalized monopoly which in turn means that for all the posturing the kremlin will have an exclusive right of first refusal to determine european economic growth with the literal push of a button commercial shale gas production in europe can begin not earlier than in 2016 2018 even with positive geological surveys but production volumes will not bring about major changes in the european gas market due to a decline in conventional gas production the report said read moregazprom to europe we own you at least until 2016

toronto nov 10 2021 globe newswire northland power inc northland or the company tsx npi today reported financial results for three and nine months ended september 30 2021 all dollar amounts set out herein are in thousands of canadian dollars unless otherwise stated abnormally low wind conditions in the north sea persisted in the third quarter resulting in reduced financial contribution from our three large offshore wind facilities however consistent with last quarter we remain on track to meet the low end of our 2021 financial guidance largely due to the performance of our onshore portfolio as well as the increasing diversification within our operating portfolio thanks to our colombian utility ebsa and the recently acquired solar and wind portfolio in spain both of which are performing

complete third quarter results summary offshore wind facilities electricity production was 13 or 107 gwh lower than the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to the historically low wind resource at all three offshore facilities as well as reduced turbine availability at nordsee one due to the rotor shaft assembly replacement campaign sales of 197 million decreased 23 or 60 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to similar factors affecting production and foreign exchange rate fluctuations adjusted ebitda of 104 million decreased 31 or 46 million primarily due to low wind

and management expects to complete the replacement of the remaining 44 rsa in 2022 and 2023 as parts continue to become available and weather conditions allow in some cases nordsee one may need to curtail the performance of turbines to extend their life until replacement of the rsa which would affect production and may lead to lost revenues in 2022 and 2023 this issue is not expected at gemini or deutsche bucht which utilize different turbines for the nine months ended september 30 2021 northland experienced 4 million 6 million at northland s share of lost revenues pertaining to curtailment of turbines under this replacement campaign the ten rsa were replaced at a cost of 13 million 16 million at northland s share and the total cost to replace all 54 rsa is now expected to be slightly lower than estimated last quarter and within a range of 50 million and 60 million 65 million and 75 million at northland s share the costs are expected to be almost fully covered by the warranty bond settlement received in 2020 relating to outstanding warranty obligations of nordsee one s turbine manufacturer upon its insolvency efficient natural gas facilities electricity production decreased 20 or 179 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2020 due to kirkland lake operating under the enhanced dispatch contract commencing in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the baseload ppa in 2020 as well as a planned major maintenance outage in the third quarter at another facility sales for the three months ended september 30 2021 increased 7 or 6 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to higher production at one facility and annual rate escalations at multiple facilities adjusted ebitda of 64 million increased 6 or 4 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to the same factors affecting sales onshore renewable facilities electricity production was 23 or 66 gwh higher than the same quarter of 2020 due to the recent spanish acquisition partially offset by lower solar and wind resources at the canadian facilities sales of 74 million were 40 or 21 million higher than the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to higher electricity production adjusted ebitda

of 2021 compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of the factors described above as well as accelerated amortization expense on iroquois falls property plant and equipment due to the expiry of its ppa in december 2021 combined with an 8 million higher total tax expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda of 211 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 decreased 17 or 44 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing adjusted ebitda include 37 million decrease in operating results at gemini primarily due to the lower wind resource and apx hedge losses realized 10 million decrease in operating results at nordsee one primarily due to lower wind resource and turbine availability compared to the same period of 2020 and 15 million increase in corporate costs primarily driven by an increasing level of project development activities and associated corporate activities to support growth the factor partially offsetting the decrease in adjusted ebitda was 19 million contribution from the recent acquisition of the portfolio of solar and wind facilities in spain which closed on august 11 2021 free cash flow free cash flow of 11 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 was 82 or 50 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 the significant factor decreasing free cash flow was the 63 million decrease in overall earnings across all facilities as described above but primarily due to lower wind resource at the offshore wind facilities the factors partially offsetting the decrease in free cash flow was a 3 million contribution net of debt payments from the recent acquisition of the portfolio of solar and wind facilities in spain and an 8 million decrease in current tax expense primarily due to lower earnings from the offshore wind facilities adjusted free cash flow which excludes growth expenditures amounted to 35 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 and was 55 or 42 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing adjusted free cash flow were as described for free cash flow refer to northland s md a for the third quarter of 2021 for additional information on sources of liquidity in addition to adjusted free cash flow outlook the offshore wind resources experienced in the first nine months of the year is trending well below the historical average across the three offshore wind facilities despite the weakness in the offshore wind resources experienced year to date management remains on track to achieve the low end of its 2021 financial guidance in large part due to the efforts to diversify northland s operating portfolio through recent acquisitions as well as the continued strong financial performance of northland s canadian portfolio and ebsa ebsa s adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are benefiting from the current inflationary environment in colombia that is resulting in indexed escalations within its regulated framework in addition the financial performance of the recently acquired portfolio of solar and wind facilities in spain is expected to lessen the relative financial impact from the weakness in the north sea offshore wind resource for adjusted ebitda and free cash flow per share management continues to expect full year results to be at the low end of the guidance range released in february 2021 of 1 1 to 1 2 billion and 1 30 to 1 50 per share respectively unchanged from last quarter for adjusted free cash flow per share management continues to expect a range of 1 60 to 1 70 as disclosed last quarter formerly 1 80 to 2 00 in february 2021 management believes the company continues to have sufficient liquidity available to execute on its growth objectives as at september 30 2021 northland

the three months ended september 30 2021 to 84 2 million as compared to 63 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2020 primarily driven by an increase in remediation and compliance services revenue from the commencement of new project work partially offset by a decrease in fossil services revenue due to project completions and a slight decrease in byproduct sales due to the dissolution of our ash venture llc joint venture in the second quarter of 2021 and decreases in supply from international sources due to increases in shipping rates partially offset by increased plant production as utility customers production recovered from the impacts of the pandemic and the 2020 hurricanes gross profit increased 1 1 million or 13 4 for the three months ended september 30 2021 to 9 4 million as compared to 8 3 million for the three months ended september 30 2020 primarily driven by an increase in gross profit from our remediation and compliance services from the commencement of

the decreased loss was primarily due to i a decrease in impairment expense ii gains on sales of property and equipment net of 3 0 million resulting from the commencement of operations at the gibbons creek ert project in 2021 and the completion of an asset purchase agreement with a third party for the sale of certain grinding related assets iii a gain on aro settlements of 1 1 million representing differences between the estimated costs used in the measurement of the fair value of the company s aros and the actual expenditures incurred for specific remediation tasks performed at the gibbons creek ert project and iv the previously mentioned increase in gross profit these favorable drivers were partially offset by a 7 1 million reduction in expense related to the expiration of our purchase option liability on our structural fill sites which benefited 2020 but did not recur in 2021 other operating expenses from ert services of 0 8 million resulting from the commencement of operations at the gibbons creek ert project in 2021 and a decrease in income from equity method investment of 0 6 million resulting from the dissolution of our equity method investment joint venture in 2021

0 million for the nine months ended september 30 2020 the decreased loss was primarily due to i the decrease in loss on extinguishment of debt resulting from the absence of 8 6 million of expenses incurred as a result of the company s amendment no 3 to credit agreement of our existing credit facility during the nine months ended september 30 2020 ii gains on sales of property and equipment net

nine months ended september 30 2020 business developments new business awards to date in 2021 we have won 805 million of new awards including approximately 120 million awarded since our second quarter 2021 earnings release in august although the timing of new business awards is not within our control based on our assessment of our competitive position with respect to pending bids we expect that new business awards for the full year will exceed the year to date level of 805 million the most recent awards included two ash pond closure contracts and an ash pond stabilization contract with a longstanding southeastern utility customer we also were awarded a five year byproduct sales and marketing contract with associated electric cooperative for 150 000 tons annually of fly ash bottom ash and boiler slag from the thomas hill energy center and a five year contract with the gavin power plant for 35 000 to 60 000 tons annually of fly ash under both contracts we will be responsible for the environmentally friendly recycling of these byproducts and marketing of them for use in ready mix concrete as an economic replacement for portland cement we will be targeting regional markets using our multisource materials network for distribution ert services we continue to evaluate opportunities to leverage our innovative and sustainable ert solutions further to meet the evolving and increasingly complex needs of utilities and power generation companies as they seek to retire and decommission older or less economically viable generating assets while minimizing costs and maximizing the value of the assets and improving the environment our unique ability to provide a single source solution for large scale complex environmental challenges continues to position us as a strong partner for existing and potential new customers we are very pleased with our performance at our ongoing ert projects and we continue to believe that charah solutions possesses unique competitive advantages and benefits for our utility customers compared to other alternatives gibbons creek we achieved a major milestone by completing the planned implosion and demolition of the plant in october remediation efforts at the project continue to progress on plan and below budget we expect remediation of the ash and scrubber ponds to be substantially complete by year end with remediation work on the landfill still to be performed as planned with demolition completed we expect scrap sales to accelerate in the fourth quarter and continue into 2022 we are nearing completion on parcel redevelopment for the site and expect to see parcel sales accelerating in early 2022 b c cobb this project for consumers energy involved remediation of the existing ash ponds and repurposing of the site to natural wetlands along the shore of lake michigan work is progressing well and is expected to be substantially completed by year end avon lake we expect to close on the acquisition of the avon lake generating station and adjacent property from genon in april 2022 when the plant ceases operation we have commenced planning for the environmental remediation and sustainable redevelopment of the property and will begin physical work once the full transfer occurs we have retained a third party to provide real estate advisory development and brokerage services to oversee the redevelopment of the property in an environmentally conscious manner and future sale of the remediated property we are working with the local community to position the property to expand economic activity and benefit the surrounding area through job creation remediation and compliance work is progressing well on several previously announced large remediation projects including a coal ash reclamation project for dominion energy and two long term ash pond closure by removal projects for another longstanding southeastern utility customer the projects are on schedule and on budget the first phase of the dominion project is expected to be substantially completed by year end with an expected ramp of the second phase beginning in 2022 we also began work on three new ash pond remediation contracts that were awarded recently by the above referenced large southeastern utility customer byproduct sales byproduct sales decreased in the first half of this year likely attributable to the impact of the covid 19 pandemic on power generation levels and construction activity as well as a change in the sales mix however the third quarter 2021 level was approximately level with a year ago and showed sequential improvement from the first two quarters of this year as the economy continues its recovery we expect to see continued sequential improvement in byproduct sales although the full year 2021 result is likely to be below the level of 2020 primarily due to a change in sales mix recently enacted infrastructure legislation is expected to be beneficial to this business over a multiyear period with an expected increase in demand for concrete esg reporting during the first quarter of 2021 we issued our first annual esg report to showcase charah solutions significant leadership in fulfilling our esg commitments and sustainably preserving our natural resources for the betterment of our planet our communities and our customers through our various businesses we reduce greenhouse gas emissions decrease landfill disposal remediate land for community and business use conserve natural resources and protect our waterways our ert business provides innovative environmentally conscious solutions to utilities and power generation companies seeking to decommission older or less economically viable generating plants and communities seeking to ensure that redevelopment of the property brings economic benefits to the area our envirosource technology offers resource conservation and recovery through the beneficial recycling of coal ash into a product that can substitute for portland cement our remediation and compliance business ensures the secure closure of ash impoundment facilities in our initial esg report we laid out 2021 objectives in the key areas of environmental data acquisition and reporting capabilities diversity and inclusion and safety we are on track or ahead of plan with respect to these goals in the area of safety for example our total recordable incident rate for 2021 to date was 0 22 significantly better than our goal of 0 46 or better lower we have had zero lost time injuries this year to date during the third quarter we were recognized as a leader in construction safety for the fourth year in a row by the annual associated general contractors of america we also received seven employee safety awards from the north carolina department of labor for our outstanding record of employee safety in 2020 the ninth year that we have been recognized for our safety record financing activities stock purchase agreement on august 6 2021 we executed a stock purchase agreement with b riley financial under which we issued approximately 2 9 million shares of common stock at 4 50 per share in a private placement for total proceeds of 13 million senior notes issuance on august 25 2021 we issued 135 0 million of 8 50 unsecured senior notes the notes with a maturity date of august 31 2026 net proceeds to us after debt issuance costs were 123 1 million we used the net proceeds from this offering and the proceeds from our equity issuance to b riley to repay all loans and borrowings outstanding under our credit facility and revolver which totaled 126 5 million following this repayment the credit facility was terminated the letters of credit outstanding under the revolver at termination were cash collateralized with the proceeds from a 17 9 million promissory note we issued to b riley on august 25 2021 this refinancing provides us with greater financial flexibility relative to the credit facility as the notes do not have financial covenants thus we will not be required to comply with net leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios on a quarterly basis as we were under our previous credit facility in addition the notes are bullet maturities and thus do not require amortization of principal prior to maturity unlike the credit facility interest expense on the notes is comparable the level we incurred on the credit facility but cash used for debt service is lower on the notes as there is no amortization of principal with a 2026 maturity date the notes improve our maturity profile relative to the credit facility which would have matured in 2022 new credit agreement on november 9 2021 we closed on a new credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank n a the credit agreement provides for a four year senior secured revolving credit facility of up to 30 million plus an additional 5 million of capacity that is available for letters of credit which are supported by cash collateral provided by the company availability under the credit agreement is subject to a borrowing base calculated based on the value of certain eligible inventory accounts receivable and equipment of the company we are not subject to any financial covenants under the new facility unless available liquidity falls below a minimum level in which case we would be required to ensure that the fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement is not less than 1 00 to 1 00 in keeping with our strong esg focus we were invited to participate in jpmorgan s sustainability linked pricing structure under this innovative incentive charah solutions will receive facility fee and interest rate reductions from jpmorgan based on meeting certain esg metrics as defined by the company and consistent with the one and five year goals in our inaugural esg report issued earlier this year we do not expect to draw under the new facility we do expect to reissue and replace existing letters of credit under the new facility upon reissuance and cancellation of the existing letters of credit the cash collateral securing the existing letters of credit will be released and will be used to repay the 17 9 million promissory note to b riley in full 2021 guidance we provide mission critical services to a diversified base of customers a majority of whom are investment grade regulated utilities that must continue to operate their power plants reliably despite the challenges presented by the covid 19 pandemic to date we have not experienced any significant disruptions to our business due to the pandemic however the ongoing pandemic and potential for significant business disruptions beyond our control have created a high level of uncertainty including but not limited to the potential impacts on demand driven power generation and the level of construction activity each of which affects our byproduct sales there are also timing uncertainties associated with the startup of recently announced customer awards including ert awards unfavorable weather including hurricanes excessive rain or moderate temperatures which may temper power generation and therefore ash production levels could adversely affect results at any or all of our businesses results for the fourth quarter of this year should benefit from an increased contribution from our gibbons creek ert project and the continued ramping of recent new awards including large remediation and compliance projects based on our results year to date and our current expectations for the fourth quarter of the year we now expect to be in the upper half of our initial 2021 guidance ranges for revenues adjusted ebitda 2 and adjusted free cash flow 2 and have narrowed these ranges as follows revenues of 280million to 300 million previously 260 million to 300 million net loss attributable to charah solutions inc of 5 million to 0 million unchanged adjusted ebitda 2 of 37 million to 40 million previously 35 million to 40 million of 37 million to 40 million previously 35 million to 40 million adjusted free cash flow 2 of 35 million to 38 million previously 33 million to 38 million this guidance is based on our current expectations of no material worsening of the covid 19 pandemic specifically including but not limited to no material customer work stoppages no significant employee absences no government mandated quarantines and no material worsening of supply chain issues that could potentially affect our byproduct sales revenue any worsening of the covid 19 pandemic could materially affect our 2021 outlook this guidance also assumes that we do not experience material adverse weather in the fourth quarter of 2021 2 the forward looking measures of 2021 adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow are non gaap financial measures that cannot be reconciled to net loss attributable to charah solutions inc and cash flows from operating activities respectively as the most directly comparable gaap financial measure without unreasonable effort primarily because of the uncertainties involved in estimating forward looking measures conference call charah solutions will host a conference call at 8 30 a m et on thursday november 11 2021 to discuss its third quarter 2021

expenditures we include cash and restricted cash received from ert transactions and proceeds from the sales of property and equipment and exclude capital expenditures because we consider them to be a necessary component of our ongoing operations we consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for investing in our business and strengthening our balance sheet but it is not intended to represent the amount of cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non discretionary expenditures such as mandatory debt service requirements are not deducted from this measure the company uses non gaap measures internally as a key performance measure of the results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance these measures facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and help investors to better understand the operating results of the company by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core business or operating results the company believes the use of these measures enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period the company s operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner the non gaap measures are a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income or earnings per basic diluted share as determined in accordance

electric automaker rivian hit public markets with a big splash rivian shares surged in their first day of trading on wednesday after the company completed one of the largest initial public offerings in u s history the shares have settled slightly after the initial pop but the company is still valued at close to 100 billion a larger market capitalization than ford or general motors has although not as high as tesla s mind boggling 1 trillion valuation it s a lot for a company that has built only a couple of hundred vehicles and hasn t turned a profit yet but rivian is hoping to echo tesla s vertiginous rise from automotive startup to mass market manufacturer it plans to sell pickup trucks suvs and a delivery vehicle and it counts amazon and ford as some of its key shareholders here s why rivian is attracting so much buzz electric vehicles are hot companies may disagree about how quickly a transition to electric vehicles will happen but the entire industry is embracing the idea that battery powered vehicles are the future at the cop26 climate talks on wednesday dozens of governments and companies embraced a target of selling only zero emission vehicles by 2040 or 2035 in major markets it essentially means replacing every new gas or diesel powered vehicle with an electric one spencer platt getty images getty images the interior of rivian s all electric pickup truck r1t as it sits at one of the automaker s facilities in brooklyn n y on nov 9 the company has started deliveries of the r1t the scale of that transition is huge posing a big challenge for existing automakers and an opening for new entrants in the market there s a lot of opportunity says stephanie brinley an analyst with ihs markit and of course the meteoric rise of tesla has whetted the appetite for who can do it again tesla is currently the world s most valuable automaker despite producing fewer vehicles than its rivals rivian won the race to build the first electric pickup truck americans love pickup trucks and drop a lot of money on them so automakers were competing to bring the first battery powered truck to market rivian won that race starting deliveries of its r1t this fall the r1t starts at 67 500 and is marketed toward outdoor enthusiasts one optional feature is a pullout kitchen with an induction stovetop and a sink designed for cooking at campsites it pairs adventure oriented specs with a luxurious interior cnn called it a glamper s dream truck rivian may have been the first electric pickup to market but it won t be the last established automakers are launching electric versions of their pickup trucks including ford the maker of the bestselling pickup in america it will be challenging for rivian to compete with the bigger cheaper ford f 150 lightning when it becomes available and the competition in the space will grow even fiercer as gm is also expected to unveil its all electric silverado at ces next year says jessica caldwell executive analyst at edmunds referring to a popular technology trade conference but for now rivian has the advantage of timing and the vehicle s performance is getting good reviews including a glowing assessment from edmunds on road testing team jeff kowalsky afp via getty images afp via getty images ford unveiled its new electric f 150 lightning pickup outside its headquarters in dearborn mich on may 19 ford like other legacy automakers plans to sell electric versions of many of its popular models it s also targeting the commercial delivery market rivian has another major advantage it has a huge deal with amazon to build electric delivery trucks amazon invested a lot of cash in the startup and owns a sizable stake in rivian the retail giant has committed to buying 100 000 delivery vehicles from rivian a big deal for the fledgling automaker that s as many vehicles as tesla is due to deliverto rental car company hertz in a deal that sent shares in the electric automaker sharply higher other electric automakers have stumbled a bunch of startups have tried to re create the tesla magic with spotty success hydrogen truck company nikola and electric pickup maker lordstown have been investigated by the securities and exchange commission after fraud allegations while other companies have just disappointed with repeated delays in their promised vehicles and with their underperforming stocks some analysts think rivian is better positioned than its rivals particularly because it has demonstrated it can build its product rivian for the most part has kind of been a little bit more nose to the grindstone and doing the work and getting it done brinley from ihs markit says one other electric vehicle startup can say the same lucid which went public this year through a different route also started deliveries of its luxury electric sedan it currently has a market cap of around 70 billion patrick t fallon afp via getty images afp via getty images a lucid air grand touring electric luxury car is displayed at lucid motors studio and service center in beverly hills calif on feb 25 lucid is another electric startup attracting a lot of buzz still scaling up will be a huge challenge for rivian delivering a vehicle to consumers was a major achievement for rivian but volumes are still small rivian has tens of thousands of preorders but expects to deliver only 1 000 vehicles by the end of 2021 the company s factory in normal ill can hypothetically produce hundreds of thousands of vehicles but brinley says to be truly sustainable rivian will need to expand to more plants let s not put the cart before the horse says asad hussain a mobility analyst with pitchbook i think the real challenge is going to be ramping up that manufacturing capacity the ipo should help its listing brought in nearly 12 billion for rivian a cash infusion the company will use to tackle that challenging problem of scaling up copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

first down payment on a boondoggle thirteen republican congressmen crossed the aisle late friday night to help pass a 1 2 trillion infrastructure bill the original proposal was 2 3 trillion so some republicans consider it a victory but it creates programs that will likely remain in place once the bill s spending authorization expires in five years like ronald reagan said nothing lasts longer than a temporary government program and at 2 700 pages you can be sure there s plenty of wasteful pork in it only about one third of that money goes toward actual infrastructure such as bridges tunnels roads and airports the rest is for vague causes like human infrastructure which includes training oversight and other government intrusion favored by the democrats still there was enough real infrastructure in the bill to gain bipartisan support but this so called bipartisan infrastructure bill is only one part of a more ambitious infrastructure package don t move or i ll shoot the other legislation is a 1 75 trillion welfare bill this figure used to be 3 5 trillion but it was scaled back at the insistence of moderate senate democrats nancy pelosi and house democrats were holding the infrastructure bill hostage as leverage to get the senate to agree to their priorities on the welfare bill this strategy backfired both because the senate does not like to be played by the house and some democrats would have been happy if the welfare bill failed entirely the house hostage strategy was like holding a gun to your head and saying don t move or i ll shoot senators say go ahead this muddle is entirely procedural but what about the actual substance of the bills 103 000 lost jobs there are expert or nonpartisan panels such as the tax foundation and the congressional budget office that render verdicts on these issues to help members of congress understand what they re actually doing the tax foundation estimates that the democrat welfare bill will destroy 103 000 jobs over the next 10 years many of these job losses are due to tax increases increased regulatory burdens and energy inefficiency introduced by the green new deal the job losses projected by the tax foundation are in addition to hundreds of thousands of job losses facing the economy in the short run because of vax mandates and the firing of employees who refuse to be injected with the gene modification treatments called vaccines for example new york city has had to close 20 fdny fire companies because of suspensions retirements and layoffs of firefighters who chose not to be vaccinated the same personnel losses are being reported in the nypd emergency medical workers nurses teachers sanitation workers and others performing critical tasks needed to keep society running politicians don t care for them it s vax or be fired for the rest of us it means more fires unsafe streets rats feeding on garbage and reduced medical care no temporary blip the economic cost of this is huge on top of the social costs it s one reason economic growth almost stalled out in the third quarter mortgage foreclosures in the third quarter of 2021 jumped 32 compared with the second quarter and 67 compared to the third quarter of 2020 there was a high correlation between this surge in foreclosures and the termination of government moratoriums on foreclosures this means that the economy was weak all along and that government programs in response to the pandemic only papered over the weakness now that the programs have ended the weakness has emerged this is more than a temporary blip the foreclosure wave has just begun because many state and local moratoriums were continued even as federal relief ended one by one those other moratoriums will be ended also and the foreclosure wave will grow on the whole the pandemic may be ending but the economic aftermath of the pandemic has only just begun no full recovery until 2045 this new wave of weakness will impact stock markets which rose based on a reopening meme of increasing sales and spending as the economy gets back to normal but there is no normal we re living in a new post pandemic world and signs of sustainable growth are hard to find the effects of the pandemic on the economy will be intergenerational the behavioral changes induced by the great depression did not fade until 30 years after the depression was over such is the staying power of social trauma whether it be war depression or pandemic accordingly we will not likely recover from this pandemic fully until 2045 or later in terms of savings consumption disinflation low interest rates and low growth in the shorter term the biden administration will slow u s and global growth with a combination of higher taxes more regulation and wasteful spending on programs such as the green new deal stimulus biden administration deficit spending such as the infrastructure bills is continually claimed as stimulus but in fact there is no stimulus from such spending because the u s debt to gdp ratio is now approaching 130 there is good evidence that debt to gdp ratios in excess of 90 produce less growth than the amount of new debt itself in other words there is no stimulus and only an increasing debt to gdp ratio that makes the situation worse it s just digging a deeper hole at some point you have to stop digging the u s was already facing slower growth in the years ahead with or without the biden administration s policies because of high debt and a central bank that does not understand monetary economics now that biden s policies are fully revealed and becoming law it is clear that growth will be even worse than would otherwise be expected if biden s trying to destroy the u s economy he s off to a very good start the new depression continued as i ve argued before this is all characteristic of a new great depression a depression is not technically defined but is understood as a prolonged period of growth that is either below the long term trend or below potential growth that s the reality we re facing meanwhile inflation has hit a 30 year high for the month of september inflation rose at an annual rate of 4 4 the highest since 1991 and october s producer price index came out today wholesale prices increased 8 6 since last october the highest annual pace in nearly 11 years tomorrow the labor department will release october s consumer price index which is expected to continue recent trends economists debate whether this recent rise in inflation is temporary or here to stay but in the short run it doesn t matter inflation is here today and your purchasing power is going down it s hopeless to expect the government to cut down on deficit spending or money printing anytime soon it s all they know how to do unfortunately things will probably get worse regards jim rickards for the daily reckoning

close in the second quarter of 2021 japan offshore wind in september the japanese government designated four new sea areas as promising areas for the development of offshore wind under its round three process included in these four areas was isumi city chiba prefecture where northland is progressing with the development of its chiba offshore wind project in consortium with shizen energy and tokyo gas additionally katagami akita prefecture where northland continues to explore an opportunity through a consortium with mitsui and osaka gas was also designated in the promising areas list the designation as promising areas for these two regions is a key milestone in the early stage development processes for these two projects that could have a total productive capacity of up to 900mw when complete third quarter results summary offshore wind facilities electricity production was 13 or 107 gwh lower than the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to the historically low wind resource at all three offshore facilities as well as reduced turbine availability at nordsee one due to the rotor shaft assembly replacement campaign sales of 197 million decreased 23 or 60 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to similar factors affecting production and foreign exchange rate fluctuations adjusted ebitda of 104 million decreased 31 or 46 million primarily due to low wind resource in the north sea compared to the same quarter last year an important indicator for the offshore wind facilities is historical average of the power production of each offshore wind facility

earned through a combination of annual average dutch wholesale market price apx a subsidy top up sde and a markup to compensate for annual profile and imbalance p i costs from the offtaker which are variable from year to year the sde mechanism tops up the apx to a set price of 169 per megawatt hour mwh for up to 2 385 gigawatt hours of annual production gemini subsidy cap the sde mechanism is designed to ensure the full subsidy is received by gemini annually for production beyond the gemini subsidy cap revenue is earned at the apx less p i costs the sde is subject to an annual contractual floor price sde floor thereby exposing gemini to market price risk when the apx falls below the annual sde floor approximately 46 mwh for 2021 the apx has been below the sde floor for the majority of gemini s five years of operation with the exception of 2021 management has purchased fixed cost apx put options the preferred hedging instrument to protect northland against 100 of its downside apx exposure in 2021 and 2022 should the apx fall below the sde floor price nordsee one component issue at nordsee one to date in 2021 ten rotor shaft assemblies rsa have been replaced minimizing downtime of the wind turbines during the fourth quarter when wind resource tends to be stronger the replacement of all the rsa at nordsee one the replacement campaign will resume in the second quarter of 2022 and management expects to complete the replacement of the remaining 44 rsa in 2022 and 2023 as parts continue to become available and weather conditions allow in some cases nordsee one may need to curtail the performance of turbines to extend their life until replacement of the rsa which would affect production and may lead to lost revenues in 2022 and 2023 this issue is not expected at gemini or deutsche bucht which utilize different turbines for the nine months ended september 30 2021 northland experienced 4 million 6 million at northland s share of lost revenues pertaining to curtailment of turbines under this replacement campaign the ten rsa were replaced at a cost of 13 million 16 million at northland s share and the total cost to replace all 54 rsa is now expected to be slightly lower than estimated last quarter and within a range of 50 million and 60 million 65 million and 75 million at northland s share the costs are expected to be almost fully covered by the warranty bond settlement received in 2020 relating to outstanding warranty obligations of nordsee one s turbine manufacturer upon its insolvency efficient natural gas facilities electricity production decreased 20 or 179 gwh compared to the same quarter of 2020 due to kirkland lake operating under the enhanced dispatch contract commencing in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the baseload ppa in 2020 as well as a planned major maintenance outage in the third quarter at another facility sales for the three months ended september 30 2021 increased 7 or 6 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to higher production at one facility and annual rate escalations at multiple facilities adjusted ebitda of 64 million increased 6 or 4 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to the same factors affecting sales onshore renewable facilities electricity production was 23 or 66 gwh higher than the same quarter of 2020 due to the recent spanish acquisition partially offset by lower solar and wind resources at the canadian facilities sales of 74 million were 40 or 21 million higher than the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to higher electricity production adjusted ebitda of 53 million was also higher than the same quarter of 2020 utilities sales of 56 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 were in line with the same quarter of 2020 adjusted ebitda of 23 million increased 4 or 1 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 largely due to certain optimization of operations statement of income loss g a costs of 15 million increased 18 or 2 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 due to higher personnel and other costs in support of northland s global growth development costs of 23 million increased 46 or 7 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to the timing of development activities net finance costs of 80 million decreased 10 or 9 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of scheduled repayments on facility level loans and repayment of borrowings on the corporate revolving facility as a result of the equity offering in april 2021 fair value gain on derivative contracts was 34 million compared to a 15 million gain in the same quarter of 2020 primarily due to net movement in the fair value of derivatives related to the apx interest rates and foreign exchange contracts foreign exchange loss of 6 million is primarily due to unrealized losses from fluctuations in the closing foreign exchange rates net loss of 5 million decreased 104 or 114 million in the third quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of the factors described above as well as accelerated amortization expense on iroquois falls property plant and equipment due to the expiry of its ppa in december 2021 combined with an 8 million higher total tax expense adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda of 211 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 decreased 17 or 44 million compared to the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing adjusted ebitda include 37 million decrease in operating results at gemini primarily due to the lower wind resource and apx hedge losses realized 10 million decrease in operating results at nordsee one primarily due to lower wind resource and turbine availability compared to the same period of 2020 and 15 million increase in corporate costs primarily driven by an increasing level of project development activities and associated corporate activities to support growth the factor partially offsetting the decrease in adjusted ebitda was 19 million contribution from the recent acquisition of the portfolio of solar and wind facilities in spain which closed on august 11 2021 free cash flow free cash flow of 11 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 was 82 or 50 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 the significant factor decreasing free cash flow was the 63 million decrease in overall earnings across all facilities as described above but primarily due to lower wind resource at the offshore wind facilities the factors partially offsetting the decrease in free cash flow was a 3 million contribution net of debt payments from the recent acquisition of the portfolio of solar and wind facilities in spain and an 8 million decrease in current tax expense primarily due to lower earnings from the offshore wind facilities adjusted free cash flow which excludes growth expenditures amounted to 35 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 and was 55 or 42 million lower than the same quarter of 2020 the significant factors decreasing adjusted free cash flow were as described for free cash flow refer to northland s md a for the third quarter of 2021 for additional information on sources of liquidity in addition to adjusted free cash flow outlook the offshore wind resources experienced in the first nine months of the year is trending well below the historical average across the three offshore wind facilities despite the weakness in the offshore wind resources experienced year to date management remains on track to achieve the low end of its 2021 financial guidance in large part due to the efforts to diversify northland s operating portfolio through recent acquisitions as well as the continued strong financial performance of northland s canadian portfolio and ebsa ebsa s adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are benefiting from the current inflationary environment in colombia that is resulting in indexed escalations within its regulated framework in addition the financial performance of the recently acquired portfolio of solar and wind facilities in spain is expected to lessen the relative financial impact from the weakness in the north sea offshore wind resource for adjusted ebitda and free cash flow per share management continues to expect full year results to be at the low end of the guidance range released in february 2021 of 1 1 to 1 2 billion and 1 30 to 1 50 per share respectively unchanged from last quarter for adjusted free cash flow per share management continues to expect a range of 1 60 to 1 70 as disclosed last quarter formerly 1 80 to 2 00 in february 2021 management believes the company continues to have sufficient liquidity available to execute on its growth objectives as at september 30 2021 northland

finance advisor shaukat aziz claimed last week that negotiations with the imf had finally been completed implying that the saudi loan had done the trick which got everybody glued to the headlines in anticipation of the official announcement yet none has come so far in fact it has since come to light that a number of problems persist particularly regarding the sbp amendment bill 2021 and unless they are sorted out there s very little chance of the fund okaying anything in a hurry that explains why the rupee halted its nine odd day rise and fell another one and a half percent in the last two days the stock market had a fright on tuesday as well before recovering just a little on the next day the reason is the same financial markets are not sure anymore which direction the economy is going to take and more or less everything depends on whether or not the extended fund facility eff can really be revived also considering how things have gone since the government s finance team flew to washington to conclude negotiations with the fund markets might think twice before trusting the finance ministry or even the state bank in the future perhaps the government is going to realise a little late in the day that it should have been more transparent with the public about how the talks were really going instead of always giving the impression that there was nothing to worry about that s not to say that we have missed the bus and there will be no going back to the bailout facility in fact a complete rollback of the program at this point is very unlikely what remains to be seen is just how stiff the agreement for the rest of it is going to be everybody had hoped seeing the expansionary budget that the new finance minister meant what he said when he claimed that he would get the fund to tone down its demands now it s becoming clearer by the day that the imf is in no mood to give too much space either way the best way to proceed and minimise trauma is to be completely transparent about all negotiations
players in the plant protein industry made headlines in recent weeks that will be closely watched to see if the sector can live up to the excitement or hype heaped upon it there is still a good argument that plant protein products have a bright future but to maximize growth promoters might have to put meat on the bones when they pitch their foods as healthier and a low carbon partial solution to climate change here are a few of the developments roquette officially opened its 600 million pea protein plant in portage la prairie man expected to process 125 000 tonnes of peas a year for a market it thinks has few limits on growth advertisement read also used cooking oil amount proves surprising saskatoon canada s canola oil is facing stiff competition from used cooking oil uco and tallow in renewable diesel markets more than protein ingredients ltd broke ground on a 100 million pea processing plant at bowden alta beyond meat the california based plant protein meat maker that was a market darling when it launched on the nasdaq stock exchange in 2019 has recently seen its share price perform below exceptions particularly after lowering its revenue guidance for the third quarter advertisement but the same company saw shares bump up last week as mcdonalds began testing in the united states its mcplant burger made with beyond meat s beef substitute previously mcdonalds tested it internationally if the golden arches rolls the product out permanently across the u s it will be a boon for beyond meat and the plant protein sector generally maple leaf foods last week said it is re assessing its plant protein business after seeing a marked slowdown in its performance which may suggest systemic change in the extremely high growth rates expected by the industry the review will determine whether to affirm its investment or adjust its strategy it is not surprising that a new industry rapidly growing but barely out of diapers might have a few teething problems and i doubt that the sector is close to collapse as some critics and social media warriors would like us to believe advertisement growing pains are not surprising considering that through most of the launch period of these plant protein products we ve been living in a pandemic that upended consumer buying patterns and supply chains plant protein products like all food groups had to adjust as covid initially closed dining out options putting the food focus on grocery stores and then adjust again as restaurants reopened but struggled because of labour shortages beyond meat pointed to covid issues when in october it had to revise its revenue guidance for the third quarter down to about us 106 million from an earlier forecast of between 120 million and 140 million another factor that could play into revenue adjustments at any single company is the fact that the sector is quickly filling up with competitors advertisement beyond meat and impossible foods were the two early industry disrupters created at roughly the same time and nurtured financially in the venture capital environment of california s tech heavy economy but established meat companies quickly decided they too had to get involved or risk losing market share canada s maple leaf foods in 2017 bought two companies and combined them in a new plant based subsidiary called greenleaf foods in the latest quarter maple leaf s meat protein group sales rose 13 4 percent to c 1 15 billion while its plant protein group saw sales fall 6 6 percent to 48 million although the decline was revised to 1 2 percent to account for foreign exchange fluctuations the disappointing quarterly results prompted the company s review of its plant protein strategy that i mentioned earlier advertisement tyson foods america s biggest meat company initially invested in beyond meat but then launched its own brand called raised and rooted other huge long established global food companies also entered the segment including nestle cargill in a joint venture with puris foods jbs smithfield foods and unilever in june cargill chief executive officer david maclennan speaking at the u s national grain and feed association convention forecast that in three to four years plant based products could make up as much as 10 percent of the meat market he has also projected that demand for protein will grow by 70 percent by 2050 meaning lots of growth opportunities for traditional meat the newer alternatives as well as the wide world of dairy substitutes but now that the initial hype is dying down some are demanding more data and transparency to confirm health and environmental claims a recent new york times story quoted environmental advocates that track the sustainability of companies complaining about lack of disclosure regarding the carbon footprint of alternative meat producers the times quoted ricardo san martin research director for the alternative meats program at the university of california as saying everybody has a supply chain and there is a carbon footprint behind that chain

call in the investor relations section of our website we posted some slides that we ll be referencing during our presentation today i m pleased to report that our q4 capped another terrific year a year in which we posted record revenues earnings and cash flows and we were able to do this despite headwinds in fiscal 21 due to a shift in the timing of revenue recognition for term license subscription sales and the sale of two product lines in our software business and the managed and deliberate decline in our software and professional services revenues pages two and three show some financial highlights from our fourth quarter we reported revenues of 335 million in q4 and 1 32 billion of revenue for the fiscal year we were able to grow our full year revenue despite these negative revenue factors we delivered 86 million of gaap net income in the quarter and gaap earnings of 3 per share for the full fiscal year we delivered 392 million of gaap net income and 13 40 of earnings per share which includes the gain of 100 million on product line asset sales and business divestiture on a non gaap basis q4 net income was 112 million up 15 and earnings per share of 3 92 was up 21 from the prior quarter prior year quarter full year non gaap net income was 383 million up 31 over last year and non gaap eps of 13 07 was up 34 over the previous year we continue to deliver strong free cash flow growth as well q4 free cash flow was 90 million bringing the fiscal year total to 416 million up 21 from the previous year in fiscal 2021 we continued our commitment to shareholder return buying back 882 million of stock during the year we increased our leverage by about 425 million compared to year end fiscal 20 but our adjusted leverage ratio remains a modest 2 07 times we view fico shares as the best use of our excess cash at this time and expect to continue to aggressively buy back shares in the coming year we had another solid year and making steady progress on our strategic initiatives in our scores segment our diversification of verticals has enabled us to continue to drive growth even as various sectors slow down scores were up 10 in the quarter versus the prior year and up 24 for the full year as you can see on page seven of the presentation on the b2b side revenues were up 2 in the quarter versus the prior year which had a onetime royalty true up adjusting for that revenues were up about 15 for the quarter and 21 for the full year as expected we saw a slowdown in mortgage origination volumes and revenues were down about 18 year over year auto origination revenues were up 19 and card and personal loan origination revenues were up 45 we are seeing particular strength in the card and personal loan space from our customers including fintechs the year over year pricing increases we implemented in fiscal 21 also had a positive impact on overall b2b revenues our b2c revenues were up 32 versus the prior year quarter and 42 for the full year compared to 2020 we saw strong growth through both our own myfico com products as well as through our partner channels in next year s guidance which i ll discuss in greater detail later we expect the scores business to grow about 6 there s been no change in our strategy or approach to special pricing accordingly special pricing increases consistent with the past several years are not included in this guidance while we expect these price increases to have an impact consistent with those over the last several years because it s difficult to estimate the timing and the magnitude of the impact we remain conservative in how we issue our guidance relative to such increases turning to our software business as we have mentioned in recent quarters we have been developing new financial metrics that provide more visibility into the recurring revenue generated by our subscription based saas and on prem software and the retention and growth of our existing software customers beginning this quarter we are pleased to unveil our revised software reporting structure and these new metrics mike mclaughlin will go into much more detail in his remarks but let me give you just a few highlights first we reevaluated our operating segments to better align with how we assess performance and allocate resources we merged our legacy applications and decision management software segments into a single software segment we continue to report the scores segment which is unchanged from past reporting we also changed the classification of revenue from transactional and maintenance professional services and license to on premises and saas software professional services and scores to better align with our business strategy and peer reporting practices you ll also find in our 10 k this year our first reporting of annual recurring revenue or arr which provides visibility into the growth trajectory of our software business without the variability that comes with the upfront revenue recognition required by asc 606 for on prem subscription sales we are also disclosing dollar based net retention rate and annual contract value of software bookings another big change we ll be talking about is the split of our software revenue between our on platform and off platform products we ll give those splits for revenue for arr and for dollar based net retention revenue we believe it s important to focus on the progress of our on platform offerings as it s the central strategy of our software business as in prior years we will continue to focus on investing in our software platform in fiscal 21 we divested assets that could not be easily migrated to the platform and reallocated resources to accelerate platform development and our go to market efforts by allocating the resources strategically and efficiently we expect to spur growth and achieve scale while effectively managing our operating expenses i m happy with the progress we made in 2021 and i m optimistic about what lies ahead in 2022 and beyond we ll continue to allocate our resources to areas of high strategic importance and we ll continue to focus on long term shareholder value i ll have some final comments in a moment provide our fiscal 22 guidance then but first let me just turn the call over to mike for further financial details michael i mclaughlin executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks will and good afternoon everyone as you may have already seen in our 10 k and the financial highlights presentation posted to the fico website we have made significant enhancements to our financial reporting this quarter including the introduction of new metrics in both our scores and software segments we ll briefly preview these metrics and i will take some extra time on this call to provide more details on what we are disclosing and what new insights these numbers provide as will said we have a strong finish to our fiscal year and we are well positioned as we enter fiscal 2022 total revenue for the fourth quarter was 335 million a decrease of 11 over the prior year due primarily to a reduction in upfront recognition of term license revenues on prem software sales the sale of our collections and recovery product line in june and lower professional services revenue in our software segment our full year revenue of 1 32 billion was up 2 over last year in our scores segment revenues were 169 million up 10 from the same period last year b2b revenue was up 2 over the prior year as you may recall last year s fiscal fourth quarter included a onetime royalty true up that did not recur this year adjusting for this onetime true up b2b revenue was up about 15 this quarter b2c revenues were up 32 from the same period last year both myfico com and partner revenues grew significantly one of the new financial metrics we are adding to our 10 k and 10 q disclosures going forward is the breakdown of our scores segment revenues between b2b and b2c components for the full year scores revenues were 654 million up 24 from last year as will previewed we have merged our applications and decision management segments into a new software segment software segment revenues in the fourth quarter were 166 million down 25 versus the same period last year full year software revenues were 662 million down 14 from the previous year this quarterly and full year decline was due to reduced upfront license revenue recognition reduced professional services revenue and the divestitures of our collection recovery products i will spend a few minutes discussing each of these three factors and their impact on fy 21 results at the start of fiscal 2021 we shifted the timing of revenue recognition for on premise term license subscription deals as a result we now recognize less upfront license revenue and more revenue ratably over the term of each contract the net impact was lower license revenue in our software segment of about 12 million in q4 and about 34 million for the full year versus what it would have been under our prior sales model to help show the impact of upfront revenue recognition of on prem term license software sales we have added a new table in the 10 k that breaks out our on premise and saas software revenue into revenue recognized at a point in time versus revenue recognized over the contract term turning to professional services we have previously explained how we are deemphasizing low margin nonstrategic services engagement as expected this has resulted in lower ps revenues our ps revenues were down 35 in q4 compared to the prior year quarter and 20 for the full year professional services continued to be an important part of our business helping our customers implement our software and realize the most value from it over time we expect to see additional modest declines in our services revenues over the next few quarters after which we expect it to return to a growth trajectory in line with our on premise and saas revenues the third factor negatively impacting reported revenues this period was the divestiture of the collections and recovery product line in june as well as the sale earlier in the year of our enterprise security score and the sale of certain assets to a joint venture we established in china to help understand the impact of these divestitures we have added additional details to the financial highlights presentation posted on our investor relations website in that presentation you will find reconciliations of our revenue in prior periods excluding these divestitures this quarter 81 of our total company revenues were derived from our americas region our emea region generated 14 and the remaining 5 was from asia pacific the americas region which we will use in our financials going forward is simply a combination of our north america and latin america regions we mentioned in our call last quarter that we are planning that we were planning to introduce a number of new financial metrics for our software segment we are pleased to introduce those metrics this quarter you will find a full description of these new metrics in the 10 k and on page eight of our financial highlights presentation let me take a few minutes to briefly walk you through each new metric the first of these is annual recurring revenue or arr which measures the underlying performance of our subscription based software contracts arr is defined as the annualized revenue run rate of on premise and saas software agreements within a quarterly reporting period and as such it is different from the timing and amount of revenue recognized in any given period all components of our software licensing and subscription arrangements that are not expected to recur primarily perpetual licenses are excluded we calculate arr as the quarterly recurring revenue run rate multiplied by 4 second new metric is annual contract value or acv bookings this replaces our previously disclosed bookings metric which was based on total contract value including the value of professional services acv bookings is the average annualized value of software contracts signed in the current reporting period that generate current and future on premise and saas software revenue we only include contracts with an initial term of at least 24 months and we exclude perpetual licenses and other revenues that are nonrecurring in nature we also exclude the value of professional services sales for renewals of existing software subscription contracts we count only incremental annual revenue expected over the current contract as acv bookings the third new metric is dollar based net retention rate or dbnrr a measure of our success in retaining and growing revenue from our existing customers to calculate dollar based net retention rate for any period we compare the arr at the end of the prior comparable period we call it the base arr to the arr from that same cohort of customers at the end of the current quarter retained arr then we divide the retained arr by the base arr to arrive at the dollar based net retention rate our calculation includes the positive impact among this cohort of customers of selling additional products price increases and increases in usage fees and the negative impact of customer attrition price decreases and decreases in usage based fees during the period it is important to note that our disclosed arr dollar based net retention rate and acv bookings numbers for the current quarter and all prior quarters exclude revenues and bookings from our divested assets to make period to period comparisons more meaningful fourth as mentioned briefly above we are disclosing the amount of our software segment revenue that is recognized at a point in time versus recognized over the contract term this helps provide an understanding of a key factor that drives the differences between reported software revenue and arr from period to period and finally we are breaking out our on premise and saas software revenues arr and dollar based net retention rate into platform and non platform components the shift of our software solutions and capabilities to the fico platform is our number one strategic goal in the software segment this new disclosure provides significant additional visibility into our progress taken together we believe these metrics significantly enhance investor visibility into our software segment specifically arr and dollar based net retention rate show how we are retaining and growing our subscription based customer relationships and our platform disclosure shows the size growth and expansion potential of the fico platform now let me give you a few highlights on what these new metrics show this quarter our software arr in the fourth quarter was 524 million a 7 increase over the prior year our platform arr was 75 million representing 14 of our total fourth quarter arr and a growth rate of 58 versus the prior year our non platform arr was 449 million in the fourth quarter which was 1 higher than the prior year our dollar based net retention rate in the quarter was 106 overall while our non platform customers software usage tends to be mature and relatively stable with retention hovering around 100 our platform customers are showing very strong net expansion from land and expand follow on sales and increased usage the dollar based net retention rate for platform was 143 in the fourth quarter up from 116 in the prior year excluding divested product lines and businesses our software acv bookings for the quarter were 25 8 million versus 28 9 million in the prior year acv bookings increased for the full year to 62 8 million versus 58 3 million in fy 20 representing growth of about 8 year over year as a reminder acv bookings include only the annual value of software sales excluding professional services turning now to our expenses for the quarter total operating expenses were 219 million this quarter this included an 8 million restructuring charge primarily associated with reductions in our professional services delivery staff and rationalization of resources following our collections and recovery divestiture our non gaap operating margin as shown on our reg g schedule was 45 for the quarter and 40 for the full year we delivered non gaap margin expansion of 600 basis points for the full year gaap net income this quarter was 86 million up 45 from the prior year quarter our non gaap net income was 112 million for the quarter up 15 from the same quarter last year for the full year gaap net income was 392 million which included a gain of 100 million on product line asset sales and business divestiture non gaap net income was 383 million up 31 from the prior year the effective tax rate for the full year was 17 including 24 million of reduced tax expense from excess tax benefits recognized upon the settlement or exercise of employee stock awards we expect our fy 2021 recurring tax rate to be approximately 25 to 26 that expected recurring tax rate is before any excess tax benefit and other discrete items the resulting net effective tax rate is estimated to be about 24 for the year free cash flow for the quarter was 90 million for the full year free cash flow was 416 million up 21 from last year s 343 million at the end of the quarter we had 195 million in cash on the balance sheet our total debt at quarter end was 1 26 billion with a weighted average interest rate of 3 3 in october we amended our credit agreement to allow for the issuance of a 300 million term loan with our bank group increasing our total bank capacity to 900 million we used the proceeds of the term loan to reduce the draw on our revolving line of credit turning to return of capital we bought back 845 000 shares in the fourth quarter at an average price of 446 per share in fiscal 2021 we repurchased a total of 1 877 000 shares at an average price of 470 per share for a total of 882 million at the end of september we had about 173 million remaining on the board repurchase authorization and continue to view share repurchases as an attractive use of cash with that i ll turn it back over to will for his thoughts on fiscal 22 william j lansing president and chief executive officer thanks mike as we move into fiscal 22 i believe we are well positioned for the year ahead in our software business we continue to solidify and add functional capabilities to our platform and we remain committed to becoming the preeminent provider of decisioning analytics we are committed to pursuing growth opportunities and improving our efficiency in our scores business we continue to innovate and find new ways to add value for our customers and benefit from the diversification that comes from the broad usage through the various credit verticals we entered the new year with more visibility than last year and as such are again providing guidance for fiscal 22 as shown on page 15 of the presentation we are guiding revenues of about 1 35 billion an increase of about 3 versus fiscal 21 on an as reported basis and about 6 when adjusted for the divestitures we are guiding gaap net income of approximately 318 million gaap earnings per share of approximately 11 29 non gaap net income of 397 million and non gaap earnings per share of 14 12 i ll turn the call back over to steve and then we ll take your questions steven p weber vice president treasurer tax and investor relations thanks will this prepares our prepared this concludes our prepared remarks and we re ready now take your questions operator please open the lines questions and answers operator and our first question comes from george tong with goldman sachs your line is open george tong goldman sachs analyst hi thanks good afternoon you re guiding to scores revenue growth up 6 next year that excludes any special pricing increases could you talk about what the assumptions are and factors are that go into your 6 growth outlook william j lansing president and chief executive officer it s a continuation we break it down into the pieces and we look at mortgage we look at auto we look at card we look at prescreen so we look at all the pieces and put estimates on that we use industry forecasts to inform those estimates although we re not always exactly on top we form our own views and that s basically how we do it that s how we got to the 6 i mean it s a combination of it combines both volume increases based on industry and price increases as well george tong goldman sachs analyst okay got it so there is some measure of underlying pricing increase in there william j lansing president and chief executive officer yes just to be clear it s cpi kinds of increases michael i mclaughlin executive vice president and chief financial officer not including the strategic price increases william j lansing president and chief executive officer right michael i mclaughlin executive vice president and chief financial officer and george i would add to that i just sorry to interrupt just looking across those segments we do our best to predict volumes for the three major parts of our b2b business just like you probably do we don t have a crystal ball but i can say that our expectations for mortgage are in line with what you would find from third party forecasters and likewise we expect modest but positive growth in the auto and credit card and other segments george tong goldman sachs analyst okay yes that s helpful that was the extra color i was hoping to get and then with the extra software disclosures i guess if we dive into arr performance the percentage of arr that s on platforms at 14 it s nearly double what it was about two years ago what are your expectations for how that continues to tick higher what s embedded in your 2022 guide and how would you expect that trajectory to just perform in the years ahead william j lansing president and chief executive officer we see the platform side of arr growing at over 50 michael i mclaughlin executive vice president and chief financial officer and overall if you just do the math on our guidance the 6 total revenue growth is approximately equal in terms of percentage between the software and scores business so if you expect very strong continued growth in the platform business we think our platform is going to be relatively flat george tong goldman sachs analyst okay so 50 is a good run rate growth to apply to the platform piece michael i mclaughlin executive vice president and chief financial officer that s right george tong goldman sachs analyst got it thank you operator our next question comes from surinder thind with jefferies your line is open surinder thind jefferies analyst thank you as a follow up to the arr question and more specifically the net revenue retention rate of 143 for the platform can you talk about the sales process and how that works for the client in terms of what the client initially buys and kind of what the upsell is and how the timing of the upsell works william j lansing president and chief executive officer sure and obviously it varies from client to client typically we put the platform in with a specific number of use cases and very specific ideas about how the platform will be used and what problem is being solved but increasingly it s being put in with a view to being able to provide additional solutions later on and what we re seeing a classic land and expand strategy and what we re seeing is that s working with our current platform customers and what and the ones that have gone in less recently we re seeing expansion we re seeing new uses new ways of using the platform and so which is what s really informing that 143 retention rate surinder thind jefferies analyst that s helpful and then in terms of just bringing on new clients onto the platform can you talk a little bit about the conversations you re having there and what it s kind of taking to get them across the finish line and the time lines generally involved william j lansing president and chief executive officer the time line is a little bit longer than our historic 270 day sales cycle with our older applications but the what s happening is it s a bigger deal at the client it s being brought in as part of a broader strategy it s being brought in with a view to using it to really interact with consumer customers strategically and so it is a bigger more complicated conversation but it s we re kind of in the middle of it we re right in the middle of the way our clients want to interact with our consumer customers we re seeing ourselves pop up in their strategy presentations surinder thind jefferies analyst got it and just kind of a technical question on the accounting part of the arr maybe is there a kind of a volume component to it in the sense that there s a head count of the number of people that are on there all else equal or usage michael i mclaughlin executive vice president and chief financial officer i m not following the head count part of it are you talking about our contracts that are usage based as opposed to based on minimums per year surinder thind jefferies analyst yes the combination of minimums versus usage base so let s say a use case has a lender has i don t know 10 million accounts or something like that as a use case or was part of that and then obviously that number can change so are there kind of bands or how does that work just to understand what the volatility might be michael i mclaughlin executive vice president and chief financial officer yes it s a good question so our contracts have both many have minimums many have usage components some have minimum with usage if you exceed a certain amount of volume or use cases or accounts what we do is if it s minimums that s what goes in the arr unless and until that customer exceeds the minimums and then that additional run rate is added to arr in the period in which that occurs if it s a purely usage based contract some of our customer communication services contracts for example are based on the number of messages that are sent in cases where fraud is identified or what have you there we estimate once the solution has been installed and is running and has shown a stabilized usage rate we then use that as the arr that we will enter into the quarter s results if that usage goes up or down in future quarters we adjust arr accordingly does that make sense surinder thind jefferies analyst yes that s actually very helpful that s it for me operator next question comes from kyle peterson with needham your line is open kyle peterson needham analyst guys thanks taking the questions just wanted to touch on the margins obviously it came in really strong this quarter i know there s been a lot of moving pieces with deemphasizing professional services and the c r divestiture but just wanted to get any thoughts on what your assumptions would be on like the sustainability of operating margins in line with what we saw this quarter michael i mclaughlin executive vice president and chief financial officer there isn t anything structural that has changed or we expect to change in the quarters ahead in fiscal 22 versus what you ve seen in recent quarters other than the fact that we expect to return to traveling so if you look at the expense breakdown in our supplemental materials i think we spent 0 5 million on t e in q4 that s going to go back up to a more normal rate or at least that s what we re projecting professional services as that declines that s a low gross margin business therefore a high cost of goods sold business so the cost of goods sold declines as those revenues go down but otherwise in terms of what we re investing in r d and go to market and g a nothing dramatic has changed in our forecast versus our historical other than we ve taken out a lot of expense from divestitures kyle peterson needham analyst got it that s helpful and then i guess just a follow up on the b2c side the performance continues to be really impressive for scores is this something that you guys think you can keep growing kind of above trend it seems like you guys are putting up significantly faster growth than what we re seeing with some of the other players in the space william j lansing president and chief executive officer i think that there s a lot of strength in the fico brand and i think that there s a lot of strength in the operating and management acumen of our b2c team so doing better than others i think you could expect that will we be able to repeat year over year performance in the 30s i can t promise that i think we re more likely to be on something closer to our quarter to quarter growth kyle peterson needham analyst okay that s helpful thanks guys operator the next question comes from ashish sabadra with rbc capital markets your line is open john mazzoni rbc capital markets analyst hi this is john mazzoni filling in for ashish maybe just a quick one on the b2b revenues i know there was a onetime impact that if adjusted that would be around 15 how should we think about these moving forward especially going into kind of the 22 william j lansing president and chief executive officer those kinds of onetimers happen periodically it is kind of part of the business we do audits and true ups every few years with different channel partners and so can you expect them to continue yes there will be things like that that are a little bit unpredictable but it is part of the business john mazzoni rbc capital markets analyst understood and then maybe just a quick follow up how do you see the software business evolving over time maybe of a longer term perspective just as we kind of wrap our heads around these new metrics what could be a longer term growth rate or any type of things that investors should be paying attention to william j lansing president and chief executive officer okay with the caveat that this is not guidance i would say look at our platform growth 50 platform growth which tells you that we have something there that the market wants we have a large number a large number 19 enterprise customers large customers who have adopted the platform and many more in the pipeline and what we re seeing is that s a combination of conversion substitution of platform solutions for more historical solutions but it s also growth it s also new stuff and so over time and it could be a very long time but over time you ll see our software transition from our older solutions to platform solutions and the platform solutions piece is growing a lot faster so will our growth rate go up yes it almost certainly will go up as we do more and more of our total software business on the platform so if today is 6 i would just extrapolate out from 6 upward and i don t know how many years it will take but we will be in double digits eventually john mazzoni rbc capital markets analyst great that s very helpful thanks again operator and mr weber there are no further questions steven p weber vice president treasurer tax and investor relations all right thank you all for joining today s call and we
