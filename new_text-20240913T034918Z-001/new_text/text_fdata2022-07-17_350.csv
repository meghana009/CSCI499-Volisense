margaret hamburg recently forfeited her title as commissioner for the fda after 6 years of serving one of the longest runs in recent decades so what do you have to say about the six year tenure of dr margaret hamburg as commissioner of the u s food and drug administration maybe if we look at a couple of aspects from the mandate of the fda we can more accurately come up with a grade on her performance as she departs according to the fda s website its mandate is as follows fda is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety efficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs biological products medical devices our nation s food supply cosmetics and products that emit radiation fda is also responsible for advancing the public health by helping to speed innovations that make medicines more effective safer and more affordable and by helping the public get the accurate science based information they need to use medicines and foods to maintain and improve their health fda also has responsibility for regulating the manufacturing marketing and distribution of tobacco products to protect the public health and to reduce tobacco use by minors finally fda plays a significant role in the nation s counterterrorism capability fda fulfills this responsibility by ensuring the security of the food supply and by fostering development of medical products to respond to deliberate and naturally emerging public health threats 1 margaret pushes pharmaceuticals and big pharma ties when dr hamburg was confirmed as commissioner in 2009 hopes were that because of her public health background she would take steps away from total commitment to drugs as the only sanctioned health remedy but she quickly moved to show this was not in her plans her years at the fda have been devoted to advancing prescription drugs roughly 100 americans die from prescription drug use every day and the rise in fatalities during the last several years is astonishing statistics from 2010 show that 38 329 people in the us died from prescription drugs that year up from 16 849 observed in 1999 in 2013 that number was 22 767 revealing statistical variation rather than a downward spiral in death rates the fda s activity is seen by some as equivalent to dropping an atom bomb on each usa city every year due to its blatant endorsement of pharmaceutical drugs and food additives at the same time the fda has banned many safe and effective natural remedies little has been done to harness drug industry corruption as it has reached outrageous proportions in the last six years in fact commissioner hamburg s fda proposed the elimination of one of the few pseudo effective measures that restrict the agency from simply rubber stamping all drug approvals by pushing for the elimination of conflict of interest laws and a green light to fill advisory positions with paid drug company shills in 2013 hamburg led the surge to fast track more types of pharmaceutical drugs fast tracking is nothing more than a way to get around safeguards already in place and to start making more money faster regardless of the consequences for those who take those drugs reports noted that the fda planned to allow certain obesity drugs antibiotics and others to be foisted onto the masses without undergoing appropriate regulatory review 2 natural health raw milk vigorously attacked meanwhile such biological products as vitamins minerals and herbs haven t killed a single person for many years but during hamburg s reign at the fda she presided over several acts of domestic terrorism against people who produced and sold dietary supplements and raw milk and practiced natural health there is an ongoing effort to regulate them out of existence the replacement of the food provided for us and underwritten by nature has continued under hamburg s reign with the approval of unwanted and inadequately tested genetically modified alfalfa salmon and apples among other gmo foods 3 gmo foods forced onto the public knowing that public opposition to unleashing genetically modified salmon into the environment was great the fda pulled a fast one in late december 2012 when most people were distracted with holiday happenings they advanced the approved gm salmon when few were paying attention in spite of the fact that most people are overwhelmingly in favor of gmo labeling laws the fda refuses to budge in its stance that labeling is unnecessary this is in the face of lawmakers and advocates that cite health concerns 4 refusing to truly act on antibiotics in livestock and other food issues in 2012 the fda refused to ban antibiotics in livestock saying any phase out would have to be voluntary this move has helped to spawn the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria leaving the population which as a group does not generally know much about natural alternatives with little in the way of drug remedies for bacterial infection hamburg has used outbreaks of food borne illness as a chance to extend fda power after the egg recall in 2010 she said her organization s power is limited to reacting when an outbreak occurs she called on congress to pass legislation that would provide a more preventive approach you can look at the heat gassing of almonds and the resulting loss of much of their nutritional value as a protocol for what this preventive approach would be just like most of the members of the medical establishment hamburg fosters the belief that all food is the same except for its caloric value meaning that in her world a half cup of cool whip has the same food value as an amount of blueberries with the equivalent calorie value although her high intelligence and good health suggest she knows this is not true she advocates for the masses to believe it less than six months after the first reports on the tragic bp oil spill in the gulf hamburg s fda joined with the national oceanic and atmospheric administration to state categorically that all gulf seafood was safe to eat this was while independent tests were showing the waters were still highly contaminated and sea creatures were dying from exposure to oil and the toxic dispersant used in trying to break it up a glimpse into hamburg s character although margaret hamburg received her salary as fda commissioner from the american tax payers she and her father dr david a hamburg are members of the council on foreign relations a power politic organization seeking to undermine the sovereignty of the us and implement a new world order in 2008 charlie brown national counsel for consumers for dental choice sued the fda for its failure to classify mercury amalgam as it had been directed to do since 1976 when it was determined that all medical devices needed to be classified why hadn t amalgam been classified because the fda would have had to tell americans that amalgam is mostly mercury and then nobody would want it in their mouth ruining the dental industry and henry schein the largest seller of dental products including mercury amalgam here s a classic example of the revolving door through which insiders bounce between well paid positions in industry to high ranking fda positions that regulate those industries just before coming to the fda hamburg was on the board of henry schein she came straight to the fda with this huge conflict of interest when she became fda commissioner she had to sign an ethics contract saying she would sell her henry schein stock and not participate in any matters affecting the company as long as she owned stock or stock options in the company but after she signed her contract and was approved for the fda she did not recuse herself from working on the amalgam rule and she continued to hold stock options in henry schein while she was holding those options she and another schein employee created a scheme to cover up the fact that the company was selling amalgam containing mercury so goodbye to you commission hamburg and being the naturally healthy people that we are we wish you well please don t slam the door on the way out additional sources politico

bloomberg the principal fault lines in the us bond market have re located an emerging consensus that the federal reserve will finish raising interest rates this year has investors grappling with what happens after that to be sure there s ample uncertainty about how high the fed s policy rate will need to rise in order to restore price stability in the economy and how it will get there just this week a skirmish broke out over whether the july meeting will deliver another three quarter point increase or the first full point one since the 1980s after june inflation increased more than expected however the main battleground has shifted to how long the overnight benchmark might remain at its peak level and how much if at all it will decline next year questions that depend on how the economy copes with a policy rate that s expected to reach 3 5 from its current range of 1 50 1 75 this week s decline in 10 year yields to levels more than 20 basis points lower than two year yields signal pessimism on that front sure we can reach a recession but as investors we have to think about what it would look like and what s on the other side of it said anthony crescenzi a portfolio manager at pacific investment management co his outlook is for a mild recession in which the fed keeps the policy rate steady at its peak level rather than bringing it quickly back down and that investors will be hesitant to pile back into bonds after this year s steep losses the memory of what happened in the bond market this year will last for a generation crescenzi said on bloomberg television barring a much deeper economic recession than most people foresee investors won t be so quick to drive yields down that fast he said the view that the policy rate will peak around the end of this year or early next year is apparent in swap contracts tied to fed meeting dates the december 2022 and february 2023 contracts carry the highest rates just above 3 5 late 2023 rates are around 3 reflecting the consensus view that rate cuts will follow the hikes which began in march this year as the main us inflation rate approached 8 this week s tussle over the july meeting was temporarily resolved in favor of another three quarter point hike rather than a larger one as two fed policy makers backed that choice before a self imposed pre meeting quiet period but at least three banks are forecasting a full point move and swap rates assign a one in six change of that outcome while the june rate for the consumer price index reported this week was 9 1 a new generational high there are indications that tighter policy is beginning to bite led by oil a broad index of commodity prices returned to levels that prevailed before russia s invasion of ukraine in february led to steep gains the us national average price of gasoline has declined every day since mid june and is down 8 8 over the period with that the real yield on inflation protected treasuries maturing in two years rose back above 0 for the first time since may 2020 fed chair jerome powell at the news conference after the june meeting said that positive short term real yields were an indicator of a near neutral policy rate neither stimulative nor restrictive additional fed rate increases are likely to further close the gap between two year real rates still under 0 2 and 10 year real rates around 0 6 a positive real two year yield is moving in the right direction said steven blitz chief us economist at ts lombard but he says it needs to exceed the 10 year real yield in order to tighten financial conditions enough to throttle inflation and that the funds rate will need to reach at least 4 to make that happen ten year real yields have declined by about 30 basis points from their mid june peak of 0 88 an auction on july 20 of new 10 year treasury inflation protected securities will provide information about the extent to which demand has been dented by cooling commodity prices next week s other significant auction a 20 year bond reopening on july 19 is a potential stumbling block for the broader market reintroduced in 2020 the tenor is still struggling to gain acceptance evidenced by its yield that s been higher than the 30 year bond s since october what to watch economic calendar july 18 nahb housing market index tic flows july 19 housing starts july 20 mba mortgage applications existing home sales july 21 philadelphia fed business outlook weekly jobless claims july 22 s p global us manufacturing and services pmis central bank calendar there are no fed speakers scheduled during self imposed quiet period ahead of july 26 27 meeting the bank of japan and european central bank are due to deliver policy decisions july 21 auction calendar july 18 13 and 26 week bills july 20 20 year bonds july 21 10 year treasury inflation protected securities 4 and 8 week bills 2022 bloomberg l p
the u s government should help make high tech careers attractive and exciting for young americans not just import foreign experts says pat gelsinger the new ceo of intel corp which was once the world s leading designer and builder of computer chips gelsinger is a skilled engineer who got his start at intel by helping design the 80386 chip in 1982 on july 12 he told the washington post s ignatius that intel s board realized it had hired too many finance oriented executives during the prior 15 years intel lost its way we had nontechnical leadership of the most important technology company in america for a decade and a half some of that clearly goes to the board of directors and the choices that they made some of it was hey we tried certain things we stumbled and we failed on different programs as well but the confluence of those board decisions management decisions technology stumbles has taken one of the great technology icons of america and we re not leading anymore intel s self inflicted decline matches the experience of other companies that elevated the c suite s stock market priorities over professional merit boeing s 737 max aircraft for example crashed after stock price executives sidelined american professionals in favor of cheap outsourced workers including indian graduates intel s corporate reports as well as federal data show that the company has imported thousand of foreign experts for jobs sought by american professionals gelsinger emphasized the future hiring of american graduates would be vital for intel are we making this an exciting domain for young talented individuals to enter into since we ve announced our ohio project for instance our top universities arizona state ohio state university michigan michigan state purdue are excited to build the semiconductor manufacturing curriculum to build us that long term workforce gelsinger s focus on training americans was cheered by kevin lynn the founder of the u s tech workers a group that opposes the large scale use of imported workers he understands because he knows intel lost its way when nontechnical leadership was put into important management roles for decades now american elites have prioritized efficiencies and earnings per share over innovation and productivity that s why people like ignatius one of those beltway crapweasels see immigration as a solution to everything what people like gelsinger know someone who s a long term veteran of the industry it s about investing in america s human capital but congressional efforts to help gelsinger rejuvenate intel are being delayed by investor demands for more foreign workers the house and senate have drafted legislation that grants roughly 50 billion bill to jump start technology development and domestic production by intel and other companies the technology funding is the chips act but the house added the chips act to the america competes act which includes many additional and diverse agendas one of those agendas is in section 80303 which would allow fortune 500 companies and their subcontractors to import all of their skilled workers from china and india that legislation doubles down on current federal policy that rewards executives who increase corporate stock prices instead of executives who increase industry wide productivity and innovation since 1990 the federal government has allowed pr0fit minded ceos and investors to import multiple generations of visa workers and immigrants for skilled work that wave of cheaper foreign workers has subordinated and sidelined many american professionals and many new graduates according to a 2021 federal report many ceos have used the federal government s pipeline of h 1b opt l 1 and b 1 b 2 workers to replace outspoken american professionals with cheap compliant and subordinate foreign graduates he said those foreign workers are cheap and compliant because the visa law allows the ceos complete authority over whether they can be fired and sent back to their poor countries lynn continued i know from my conversation with managers in america s fortune 500 companies particularly our fortune 500 technology companies that a reliance on foreign workers and foreign managers only leads to tribalism and politics when we see a preponderance of people from one country let s just use india as an example career movement throughout the company becomes political and not merit based it becomes tribal because we also import their caste system their regional their politics and their misogyny they know that s how they re got the job that s how they re going to stay in a job with indian managers and get green cards these drive out technical workers because they re typically ill equipped to deal with that level of office politics they understand merit they understand how to solve a technical problem they can t overcome caste and country of origin discrimination the indian office politics are used by ceos to suppress complaints from foreign workers about pay hours and workplace abuse the foreign office politics also minimize pushback from american professionals who oppose the c suite executives skimping on safety security reliability quality and long term research the visa workers are very subservient to higher managers said mary from central new jersey an immigrant software expert who works alongside h 1bs she told breitbart news in 2020 i would tell professionally what the issue was and she didn t like that you can t oppose her in any way if she tells you it is black it has to be black even if it is white will feed her what she wants to hear when the information given to that manager is wrong and that manager does not care the professionalism of the field is gone gelsinger has been forced through this cultural shift in 2009 gelsinger was forced out of intel after 3o years of service which had begun with a professional interview at a community college when he was just 18 he was forced out because intel s board put business school graduates in the top jobs the new york times reported otellini and his successors prioritized intel s profit margins while failing to take risks to move into new markets and outflank rivals former company insiders now acknowledge intel s stock focused executives recruited many foreign visa workers instead of american professionals a 2013 report at dice com a job site used by many migrant workers reported that when it s seeking to fill a position basically doesn t care whether it s a u s citizen or h 1b worker who fills it for example from 2017 to 2019 the company asked the federal government for roughly 4 300 h 1b visa work permits it asked for 1 000 permits in 2020 and 3 000 in 2022 intel also hired many foreign graduates via u s universities practical training programs in 2018 for example they hired 1 348 foreign graduates including 368 on one year work permits and 1 111 on three year work permits once intel sponsored them for green cards the foreign temporary workers were allowed to stay in the united states indefinitely but the nominated workers usually cannot leave their employers until they can get their green cards often decades later from 2017 to 2022 intel nominated roughly 6 400 foreign workers for green cards most of the visa workers are inexperienced and often are less skilled than american professionals the company sought green cards for fewer than people who arrived with o 1 genius visas which are given to people with a record of extraordinary ability or achievement the company s 2021 diversity report shows that asians including many indian and chinese visa workers now comprise almost 40 percent of the technical staff up five points from 35 percent in 2014 whites mostly americans comprise less than 42 percent of the technical staff this population replacement has reshaped the company and damaged the quality of research and production intel has also got a big h 1b problem and that s why they re behind another software professional told breitbart news i was brought up that if you find an issue raise it immediately a u s professional who worked at intel told breitbart in 2020 but the rules are very different in departments run by indian managers he said when you find a bug don t announce it announce it to your boss they want to make sure it s not their problem and not their bug don t go through the normal process one of the things that got me in the biggest trouble with the indians was when i found a bug he said it was clearly our device causing the problem he said but when he revealed the problem via a department email the indian manager became unglued screamed at me in a conference room and called me the worst engineer now most of the managers are indian so it is very hard for an american to get hired over there i d go into a room of 30 people and 15 to 17 of them are from india he said adding they all come from the same area they all know each other they all hang out together the other half room is all americans the indians are a very very tight group they automatically know the caste system the guys at the bottom they know to suck up to the caste guys above them they will never suck up to an american indian managers can quietly trade company jobs to junior indians in return for bribes so they have a hidden incentive to force open jobs by firing u s professionals multiple indian visa workers have told breitbart news while working for one indian manager i was the senior guy and i was given the shittiest tasks the american said adding she hated me she would tell me i was the worst engineer she d ever seen she d berate the shit out of me and she would talk about her friend down in the bay area who was looking for a job so she was gonna fire me and hire her best friend in the bay area i left it was the best thing i ever did within about a month i looked back and said what in the hell why didn t i do this sooner intel s management was more focused on merit when a 23 year old gelsinger by then a born again christian criticized his intel bosses in 1985 said a february 2022 report by the new york times a few days later he got a surprise call from grove the hungarian born executive then intel s president who later wrote the management book only the paranoid survive had built a culture where lower level employees were encouraged to challenge superiors if they could back up their positions mr grove began mentoring mr gelsinger a relationship that lasted three decades made him at age 24 the leader of a 100 person team designing intel s 80486 microprocessor corporate outsourcing is forcing generations of americans out of the technology sector said one tech professional who followed her father mother and grandfather into the business she told breitbart news in 2020 i told all my kids be good with computers but major in something else my youngest son is a biomechanical engineer with a master s my middle son is a credentialed professional in environmental health and safety my oldest son works in the defense industry we can t talk about what he does but he probably makes more than the other two put together my daughter married well the federal outsourcing policy is basically shutting the citizens out of the tech sector she added washington s legislators staffers and journalists have ignored the deep economic damage caused by the donor driven policy of allowing investors to import their own subordinate white collar workforce for example beltway insider ignatius pushed gelsinger on july 12 to endorse greater reliance on foreign graduates i need to ask you frankly whether you think the american semiconductor industry has the talent pool to be able to make this competitive leap forward or whether we need to think about changes in our immigration policies that allow more high quality engineers to come here from other countries what do you think gelsinger answered with 157 words on the need to train americans we have to be rebuilding those areas of our colleges universities also community colleges as well so clearly that s a priority we ve committed funding to that we ve committed for instance in the ohio project 50 million of funding which is complemented by 50 million from nsf funding specifically on talent development gelsinger s industry peers want those foreign workers his company is now dependent on them and there is no easy or quick fix so gelsinger added 136 words of waffled partially garbled and skeptical comments on migration before ending the interview at the same time you know i do believe our immigration policies anybody who receives a master s or a ph d from a u s school can get a green card stapled to it right we want the best talent in the world coming here staying here and you know some of the different versions of usica and competes you know in the house and the senate version specifically you know also include provisions around immigration you know i doubt that those will pass in this current form given some of the earlier political comments david you know but this is a hot button for me you know i want to have the best talent on the planet coming here staying here being trained here we just have to make it much easier for that to be the case in august 2021 gelsinger gave a far more animated answer to the washington post on w he described his company s plans to work with 18 community colleges to train the next generation of americans i m a farm boy from pennsylvania sort of stumbled into technology went to community college and really just the great american cinderella story so it s something close to my personal heart as well that you know many bright capable you know they don t have the opportunity to be mit or stanford entry with 18 community colleges we re building on a success model that we already had in place to start this ai program that enable us to have this workforce development with the basics of ai we do believe that it becomes basic for everybody but we also expect that this will some of the pat gelsingers of the future that this will be the starting point and they go on to university and that they progress with their career and their employers we do hope that sometime soon we re on a conversation where we re saying okay we ve launched our next 50 next 100 community colleges gelsinger is also deflating the investors profit expectations that were set by his business degree predecessors at intel the new york times reported last march mr gelsinger announced intel s manufacturing expansion including the foundry plan and the 20 billion arizona project when he detailed the long term financial impact in october wall street was stunned intel shed nearly 25 billion in market value in one day congress is now trying to help gelsinger rejuvenate intel but congress has been slow to pass its draft bill offering 52 billion to companies that design and build computer chips in the united states the bill has been delayed by congressional horse trading including the investor plan to let fortune 500 companies import an unlimited number of foreign workers for the careers needed by skilled american graduates that giveaway is opposed by midwest gop opposition principally sen chuck grassley r ia and sen todd young r in who want their young people and communities to get the new high tech jobs the giveaway has also been opposed by president joe biden s deputies especially commerce secretary gina raimondo she is part of biden s east coast network which often clashes with the party s west coast faction intel is promising to build a 20 billion production facility in ohio but that project may be canceled if congress cannot get the funding approved with a skinny bill gelsinger told ignatius if i was building a new fab in asia you know and a new fab module is about a 10 billion investment per fab module you know enormous capital investment it s about 30 to 40 percent cheaper to do it in asia strong incentives ecosystem and other factors are associated with it but by far the biggest is the capital incentives that are in place in those asian companies countries and what the chips act does it levels the playing field it simply gives us the incentives to build those factories in the u s where the fabs are for the next several decades is more important than where the oil reserves have been for the last several decades in defining geopolitics economic and national security he said adding it s that important to our future

the global elite are very clearly telling us that they plan to raid our bank accounts economic collapse march 27 2013 don t be surprised when the global elite confiscate money from your bank account one day they are already very clearly telling you that they are going to do it dutch finance minister jeroen dijsselbloem is the president of the eurogroup an organization of eurozone finance ministers that was instrumental in putting together the cyprus deal and he has said publicly that what has just happened in cyprus will serve as a blueprint for future bank bailouts what that means is that when the chips are down they are going to come after your money so why should anyone put a large amount of money in the bank at this point perhaps you can make one or two percent on your money if you shop around for a really good deal but there is also a chance that 40 percent or more of your money will be confiscated if the bank fails and considering the fact that there are vast numbers of banks all over the united states and europe that are teetering on the verge of insolvency why would anyone want to take such a risk what the global elite have done is that they have messed around with the fundamental trust that people have in the banking system in order for any financial system to work people must have faith in the safety and security of that financial system people put their money in the bank because they think that it will be safe there if you take away that feeling of safety you jeopardize the entire system so exactly how did the big banks in cyprus get into so much trouble well they have been doing exactly what hundreds of other large banks all over the u s and europe have been doing they have been gambling with our money in particular the big banks in cyprus made huge bets on greek sovereign debt which ended up failing but what happened in cyprus is just the tip of the iceberg all over the planet major financial institutions are being incredibly reckless with client money they are leveraged to the hilt and they have transformed the global financial system into a gigantic casino read morethe global elite plan to raid our bank accounts

economic watch u s economic picture unclear amid mixed data 17 38 july 16 2022 by matthew rusling xinhua a woman buys food at a food truck in new york the united states may 11 2022 xinhua wang ying the u s economy is now heading for a recession due to the fed being overly aggressive in its efforts to control inflation desmond lachman senior fellow at the american enterprise institute told xinhua washington july 16 xinhua the u s economy is showing both positive and negative signs amid an uncertain recovery from the covid 19 pandemic some economists point to robust employment numbers while others believe a recession looms indeed the past month has seen mounting signals that the hot economy is slowing reduced consumer spending suggests the ability of americans to keep shelling out cash on vacations and restaurants is fading housing activity is starting to feel the weight of rising interest rates and investment in the tech sector particularly startups is drying up consumer confidence hit its lowest level in u s history in june on skyrocketing inflation and dim views of the economy according to the university of michigan s widely watched monthly consumer sentiment index inflation continued to be the primary concern of consumers with 47 percent of the survey s participants blaming high prices for a reduction in living standards said joanne hsu director of the university of michigan s surveys of consumers the housing market is beginning to crumble because of sharply increased mortgage rates and exporters are having difficulty because of the strong dollar the u s consumer price index cpi a broad measure of everyday goods and services skyrocketed a whopping 9 1 percent last month the fastest annual clip since november 1981 according to the u s bureau of labor statistics june s cpi rose from the previous four decade high of 8 6 percent in may and is higher than the 8 8 percent increase forecast by bloomberg in the latest sign of soaring inflation the producer price index rose 11 3 percent from a year ago in june near the record 11 6 percent posted in march the bureau of labor statistics reported thursday photo taken on june 22 2022 shows the u s federal reserve building in washington d c the united states xinhua liu jie wells fargo a major u s bank reported thursday that the u s federal reserve is unlikely to see any signs of inflation coming down toward its target some economists believe that an aggressive rate hike could be on the horizon by month s end including a 100 basis point increase that would be larger than june s 75 basis point increase already the biggest since 1994 a recession is more likely than not next year wells fargo said noting the bank expects the united states to enter a mild downturn in the first quarter of 2023 the u s economy is now heading for a recession due to the fed being overly aggressive in its efforts to control inflation desmond lachman senior fellow at the american enterprise institute told xinhua in addition the air is coming out of the stock market and bond market bubbles as the fed raises interest rates and withdraws liquidity that is bound to cast a further cloud over the economic outlook lachman said one silver lining is record low jobless numbers and abundant job openings however several companies have announced job cuts and hiring freezes over the past two weeks ranging from jpmorgan chase bank to redfin an online real estate firm data released thursday by the labor department showed that initial jobless claims last week rose to 244 000 the highest level in eight months the latest sign that the labor market might be cooling but other economists argue the economy remains in good shape dean baker senior economist at the center for economic and policy research told xinhua that for most people the economy is the state of the labor market and that s faring well the unemployment rate has remained at 3 6 percent for the fourth consecutive month gas prices are displayed at a gas station in los angeles california the united states june 1 2022 photo by zeng hui xinhua the vast majority of people are able to get jobs and have the freedom to quit jobs they don t like baker said the rapid run up in prices is very bad news but i think we are likely to see this turn around baker said we are getting the supply chain issues that sent the price of a wide range of goods soaring under control many of these items are likely to see falling prices in the months ahead baker said adding that soaring rents might also moderate in the next few months brookings institution senior fellow barry bosworth told xinhua that despite low unemployment and an extraordinary number of unfilled jobs product markets are also very stressed and vulnerable to shocks in various commodity markets bosworth said that the situation should moderate over the next few months if a large supply shock can be avoided in the energy markets meanwhile the white house is feeling the brunt of americans anger over soaring food

liberal leader peter dutton has issued a stark warning about the future of peace in the pacific region and dismissed labor s claims that climate change is the biggest security issue speaking from washington dc mr dutton said he welcomed recent dialogue between beijing and canberra with the albanese government but urged for them to hold china to account on issues such as human rights abuses and its military china is growing its naval fleet at the same tonnage rate of our entire royal australian navy fleet every 18 months he told sky news australia s kieran gilbert stream sky news live on demand with flash 25 news channels in 1 place new to flash try 1 month free offer ends 31 october 2022 mr dutton said he welcomed recent dialogue between beijing and canberra with the albanese government but urged for them to hold china to account picture martin ollman and i might note at a time when most of the world is pledging support and depleting their own stocks to give the ukraine a fighting chance against russia the government should be asking of china if they re conducting talks in good faith and negotiation in good faith that a sign of that good faith would be pulling back on the rapid expansion of their military arsenal the australian government needs to be serious in the discussions and we need to ask china to explain the human rights abuses and to explain what s happening in relation to their military build up mr dutton also offered a strong rebuke to comments made by defence minister richard marles who claimed climate change is the biggest threat to the pacific the pacific islands forum of which australia is a member has been consistent in declaring climate change as the single greatest threat to livelihoods in our neighbourhood it is an existential threat mr marles told the us centre for strategic and international studies the forum has also been consistent in calling for the countries of the pacific including australia to work together in response under prime minister albanese australia will lift its weight the opposition leader acknowledged that addressing climate change is important but dismissed mr marles claim we support sensible action in relation to mitigating and providing investment into new technologies he continued but for richard marles or anybody else to suggest that that is a bigger issue in terms of security threats it s in complete defiance of the intelligence that he would be reading the briefings that we have had here in washington have been as sober as any i ve had over the course of the last six years around the national security table it s why i ve spoken out strongly because i do think peace is at risk within the indo pacific and i do think we have to step up with the united states with our partners in the region to stare down that aggression climate is an important issue but the biggest security issue in the indo pacific at the moment is china and the acts of aggression since coming to government in may the albanese government has stepped up australia s emissions targets pushing for a more substantial cut by the end of the decade compared to what was previously committed to by the coalition the labor government will seek to reduce emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 up from the 26 to 28 per cent from the coalition mr albanese said climate action was setting australia up for a future that is powered by cleaner cheaper energy the thing with climate action is it s all about the short term capital investment that s required but then you get the long term benefit he said because the cheaper cleaner energy flows well into the future and that s what sets australia up for a prosperous future a future powered by cleaner cheaper energy a future in which we make more things here a future in which we participate in the global effort to deal with the challenge of climate change but also seize the opportunity that is there from acting on climate change labor is seeking to legislate the target when parliament returns this month but is facing an uphill battle in the senate where it must work with the greens and newly elected independent david pocock greens leader adam bandt has signalled his party will support the legislation with a few key amendments including making the target a floor and not a ceiling he also demands no more new coal or gas projects and there be no ability for the target to be relaxed by new governments mr pocock has indicated he will support the legislation

rattled and uncertain of its future twitter stumbles on under the cloud of elon musk s buyout bid twitter is left in limbo san francisco anxious employees wary advertisers and hamstrung management twitter is limping along as it waits to learn how the fight over elon musk s buyout bid will end just days before the first court hearing in twitter s lawsuit seeking to force the tesla boss to close the 44 billion deal the firm is stuck in limbo the best conclusion for me would be that he leaves us alone so that we can go on our merry way an engineer at the key social media network told afp on condition of anonymity the engineer spoke of employees departing and a climate of uncertainty that does not leave one with a peaceful state of mind we re still trying to do our work normally because the main reasons why we chose to work for twitter still hold true he added but there s been nothing normal about musk s unsolicited bid that he s now backed away from saying twitter has obfuscated on the number of fake accounts on the platform he has harangued the network on its own platform no less with mocking tweets about its management and direction musk s repeated disparagement of twitter and its personnel create uncertainty that harm twitter and its stockholders the firm s lawyers argued in their lawsuit lodged this week the billionaire s comments also expose twitter to adverse effects on its business operations employees and stock price the lawyers added a judge has set the first hearing in the case for tuesday in a court in the eastern state of delaware sluggish ad sales twitter is facing a huge image crisis and confidence in its leadership is wavering emarketer analyst debra williamson told afp but whether the musk situation has affected its revenues is unclear she said the most loyal advertisers have likely stuck around but those less committed to twitter may have scaled back their spending while waiting for the endgame angelo carusone president of watchdog group media matters thinks the damage is already done because musk has been a frequent critic of content moderation the fight against hate and disinformation is widely defended internally but also by many advertisers concerned that their brands are not associated with toxic messages carusone said that in early may at an annual marketing event where companies negotiate large advertising deals twitter was not able to give advertisers any clarity or confidence that it would continue to be safe showcase for them they didn t go anywhere close to what they normally sell at that event and it s obviously been sluggish since then he added the san francisco based social network cannot afford to lose customers unlike big fish such as google and facebook parent meta which dominate online advertising and make billions in profits twitter lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020 and 2021 the group will capture less than one percent of global ad revenue in 2022 according to emarketer compared to 12 5 percent for facebook 9 percent for instagram and nearly two percent for booming upstart tiktok on top of that twitter s user base is barely expected to grow and may even shrink in the united states noted williamson the emarketer analyst twitter can t meaningfully respond musk once had potential twitter investors salivating with his talk of growing revenue fivefold and aiming for a billion users by 2028 instead a court battle is building to end either with twitter being owned by an unhappy investor who decided he didn t want it after all or with twitter on its own and weaker than it was before this all started williamson added the battle is set to last for months and at a time when economic headwinds are steady and firms need to be nimble to monetize new audio and video formats diversify revenue sources and attract younger audiences at least facebook can respond to current threats even if they re responding poorly they can respond said carusone the media matters president what twitter cannot do right now is meaningfully respond to anything the social network s lawyers have blamed musk for withholding consent for two employee retention programs designed to keep selected top talent during a period of intense uncertainty generated in large part by musk s erratic conduct internally some employees have also lost confidence in management which they would have liked to be more combative in dealing with the world s richest person parker lyons a financial analyst at twitter went so far as to tweet several memes that took aim at the firm s board for its deal with musk in one the board is shown firing bullets into twitter above the sarcastic caption who could have done this

ever since federal agents showed up at his pricey sutton place apartment in 2009 he s maintained his innocence his case riveted wall street and with reason he ended up being convicted on all 14 counts of securities fraud and conspiracy and sentenced to 11 years one of the harshest penalties the us has ever levied for insider trading it was the first major insider trading case in which the government used wiretaps a tactic often used against organised crime and drug traffickers today rajaratnam insists he doesn t want to relitigate his case but he s been doing that a lot lately in media interviews and in a book uneven justice the plot to sink galleon published in december like michael milken a symbol of the greed is good 1980s who has successfully refurbished his reputation and been re embraced by the global business elite rajaratnam is also using his wealth for various philanthropic efforts particularly in his native sri lanka billion dollar force of deception but make no mistake raj rajaratnam is unrepentant he says he was the fall guy for the feds failure to convict any prominent bankers following the 2008 financial crisis i was entrapped framed unlawfully wiretapped surveilled and then made to endure a brutal and very public media lynching rajaratnam writes in uneven justice federal agents and prosecutors crossed legal lines to convict him he says threatened with prison employees and business contacts testified against him to save themselves he says at fmc devens where he was sent because he has diabetes and kidney disease he did time with murders and sex offenders he says he tried to avoid them and befriended drug dealers and white collar crooks some fellow inmates tried to extort money from him that was not going to happen with me he says this is a huge infrastructure that has to change rajaratnam says of the criminal justice system that s not quite the way federal prosecutors saw things government authorities called rajaratnam a billion dollar force of deception and corruption on wall street tapping a network of informants across swaths of corporate america he illegally used inside information to trade stocks such as goldman sachs google intel and hilton worldwide holdings prosecutors said his trading generated profits or avoided losses of us72 million not quite us10 million for each year he served in prison rajat gupta former global head of mckinsey co and former board member for goldman sachs served a two year prison sentence for insider trading ap the explosive case exposed the trafficking in illicit information at the highest echelons of american finance roughly a hundred other people were eventually ensnared by insider trading cases most pleaded guilty or like rajaratnam were convicted by a jury among those who went to prison were rajat gupta former global head of mckinsey co and former board member for goldman sachs who blamed rajaratnam for his downfall the two were later reunited at fmc devens where rajaratnam says they played bridge and scrabble together gupta was convicted of passing tips to rajaratnam related to goldman sachs and was sentenced to two years he has long maintained his innocence advertisement yeah we were civil to each other rajaratnam says of gupta rajaratnam has been far less charitable towards preet bharara the former us attorney who spearheaded the government s sweeping crackdown some celebrated bharara as the sheriff of wall street for aggressively going after hedge fund managers others accused him of letting wall street off the hook for the financial crisis to hear rajaratnam tell it bharara used the power of his office to win at all costs and advance his own career he mentions bharara 325 times in his 333 page book bharara today says he doesn t care what rajaratnam thinks in an email the former prosecutor called the hedge funder he put away possibly the least sympathetic defendant ever second act in real estate says bharara raj rajaratnam was a privileged billionaire who engaged in massive insider trading and there was an avalanche of evidence to prove it bharara pointed to rajaratnam s failure to win over jurors and judges despite an aggressive and costly defence whatever fairy tales he may now tell to rehabilitate his reputation or settle scores or peddle his book raj rajaratnam was and is guilty period wrote bharara who was fired by donald trump in 2017 still similar to milken rajaratnam might have another act yet anita raghavan a former wall street journal reporter who wrote a book about rajaratnam and gupta says that in all likelihood rajaratnam is still a billionaire she calls his book a selective retelling of the galleon affair and says there was ample evidence at trial to convict rajaratnam but wealth begets wealth and also influence in the waning days of the trump administration milken received a presidential pardon for his part rajaratnam won t say if he s still a billionaire yes i am in many currencies rupees lira pesos he jokes back at synamon rajaratnam is working with his small staff to spot investment opportunities we invest in real estate as well as in the stock market he says and so i come to work every day rather than having hundreds of investors we have one investor bloomberg
thai aesthete and collector rolf van bueren who sources material from south asiatic countries to turn them into objets d art on how to sell an ancient craft to a new audience a silver faced chinese guan protector of a home speeding on a motorbike is made out of bits and bobs rolf von bueren and son nicklas who are exhibiting their collection at jia the oriental kitchen colaba pics pradeep dhivar rolf von bueren first came to india in 1964 and his first buy was a jamevar shawl from kolkata since then he has been visiting the country three to four times a year to work with the craftsmen and source textiles this time around he has come armed with a few sanskrit words i have been asking people what they mean and i haven t got an answer says the genteel octogenarian in thailand many people would know that some of these words mean in thailand all royal ceremonies start with brahmin priests reciting the prayers then come the buddhist ones even the written thai language is closer to sanskrit than hindi is born german rolf has done a lifetime of meditation and other exercises to shed the aggression of the west the thai are very gentle people he says of his adoptive country looking at that high forehead soft speech and deep bow during introductions and farewells it s hard to imagine him as anything other than a connoisseur of fine things yet he was sent to thailand in 1962 to set up a chemical plant then i was sent to korea he says but the country was too hard no judgment advertisement he met his thai scot wife helen and together they set up lotus arts de vivre an exclusive travelling collection of jewellery personal items and artifacts rolf and his son nicklas are in mumbai to open a brick and mortar outpost in colaba which will see other aesthetes by appointment the van buerens travel as a family almost 200 days in a year sourcing material from mostly south asiatic countries and giving them their distinctive twist a leather bulldog with veins of silver 100 year old bamboo mats folded into clutches covered with cloth and hand painted the trunk burl of a tree turned into a table you see swirls instead of rings rolf points out gigantic bowls made out of cinnamon sticks rudraksh gilded and strung to form a necklace scarab wings such as the ones used to make this necklace remain vivid for a long time he has just ordered a bunch of shibori bandhej bandhani scarves for clients at the end of the year rolf s introduction to the weavers and artisans of india came through textile conservator and cultural historian martand mapu singh he still works with weavers and artisans introduced to him by mapu as he does with his contemporaries textile scholars and conservators rahul jain and rta kapur c8histi rajmata gayatri devi was a gateway into the grandeur of royal rajputana and she inaugurated many of the van buerens exhibitions mapu told me that the best shibori has 25 000 knots per square metre says rolf eyes wide as if he was just told this bit of trivia can you imagine how fine it must be you want anything in textile you come to india you also have the best craftsmen for kundan setting stone inlay bidri work that s why we come here why reinvent the wheel also read mumbai a city of dreams but not for all being such a frequent visitor rolf has also been witness to the shrinking pool of artisans you used to have a huge number of handloom weavers now only about 20 per cent remain if you go to benaras and see some of the weaving it s terrible all the young people have left he says in jaipur which was a stone dedicated city we saw artisans glued to their screens when the stock exchange was booming the stone layers did not care about their business anymore there was no new stock the splendour is slowly fading away there are a few young people who are following their parents into the trade we work with them the challenge of the lack of artisans is what my sons will have to face bamboo mats turned into clutches with a rare bamboo root as handle nicklas is with rolf on this trip sharp in a suit he has three bracelets on one hand braided leather with animal head clasps in silver his personal agenda in india is to check out textiles and have some suits made his professional task has been to build an online presence for their endeavour trying to distill 1 000 year old craft processes into 1 5 minute attention span of the new clientele astonishingly the three year long covid 19 imposed lockdowns during which the family did not travel led to a spike in sales people were stuck in their homes their attention span was devoted to their home country they were not flying out every other week so they had the time to understand our objets d art people wanted to know and learn about what they didn t know before explains nicklas the most expensive thing we sold was worth 2 25 000 dollars to a customer in america both sons manage the marketing online presence and growth of the business while rolf remains the taste maker but we still have physical stores says nicklas because people want to touch and feel the products so we are trying to find a balance between the new way of selling and the old made in china this bowl has 60 to 80 layers of lacquer infused with cinnabar for colour their current collection is on exhibition at jia the oriental kitchen in a colaba bylane although not on sale on display is jewellery made of iridescent blue and green scarab beetle wings we have millions of them on tamarind trees says rolf as he walks us through it and they die and fall down from where we collect them they don t fade there is a 11th century vase in japan made of scarab wings and the colour has not dulled there are gold nuggets reminiscent of those found in the usa 150 years ago strung into a necklace we ve made them lighter says rolf his respect for the process of each of these things of beauty sets him apart from those who hoard them solely for their price tag there s a large carved cinnabar basin from china it has 60 to 80 layers of lacquer rolf tells us about a lacquered japanese tray he says these are polished with ash which costs 5 000 a kilo and there is wood so much wood the gnarled root of a bamboo rare to find is the handle of a hand painted purse root of a teak tree turned into a table hardly seen rosewood the felling of these trees is illegal in most countries trunks rosewood trees are practically finished rolf says they used to be sold by the tonne now they are sold by the kilo even the large coconuts shells that priests used for alms they are much smaller now then there are laugh pieces such as silver faced chinese guan protector of a home speeding on a motorbike made out of bits and bobs when the van buerens need to modernise a piece as in the case of clutch purses they look at it as another opportunity to shine a spotlight on a craft to create a thing of beauty now everything needs to hold a phone rolf explains and the lady might have a glass in one hand and a plate in another she needs a strap on her purse so we made detachable hand painted straps but we wanted to cover the clasps so we camouflaged them using little silver lotuses we had to ensure the metal wasn t so thin that it would break the edges should not poke the person it takes skill turn to nicklas with the worry of crafts dying out and he says younger people have an interest it s about how to get it out of them people travel and they realise that some brands have stores in every airport they understand that they want to be different from their friends and peers we ve got to get to them

jorge piedrahita is an argentine executive based in the united states since 1996 when he arrived at citibank s operations in new york he is currently the ceo of gear capital partners a macroeconomic policy and debt restructuring advisory firm piedrahita is a wall street veteran with more than 20 years of experience in financial services in addition to having been a citibank official he was international treasurer of ford credit a director at ford motor company and co founded of torino capital llc in a dialogue with lpo the executive said that there might be a recession in the country at the time of the elections and that might lead the democrats to lose control of congress and have two complicated years ahead in the government imagine moving forward an economy during the eighties which allowed at the time ronald reagan to take over the presidency the united states remains a very divided and polarized country that s not going to change there is a lack of clarity about the candidates of both parties for 2024 de santis is shaping up well biden might not be a candidate there are talks for kamala harris but she still faces rejection the democrats need to raise her bar he warns is a recession avoidable as biden recently said or are we already experiencing one soft landings as used as a financial jargon are sometimes the product of chance and difficult to promote jerome powell raised rates by 75 points and there are talks that they will hike another 75 points in july they will do anything to lower inflation to the 2 annual target and to achieve that they re going to have to put the economy into a recession even powell acknowledges that perhaps a recession cannot be avoided the fed lost credibility i think it now has the task of rebuilding it but it s a process that s going to lead to a recession recession is difficult it is not inevitable but it will be hard to avoid the real estate sector is very inflated by rates and needs to deflate what is key in that sector is affordability that is if the person can pay their mortgage because it went from 3 to 6 a relevant jump that causes many buyers to be left out of the market what the white house can do to avoid that scenario is limited what biden can do is limited unless there is a fiscal package in congress that would certainly not be approved he can truly do very little unfortunately at the time of the elections the country will already be in a recession it will slow down sharply that s the central scenario right now you see it in the prices of financial assets the stock exchange discounts future expectations and to make matters worse inflation will continue to be present with a drop in the economic activity if you look at inflation projections it s not just a matter of lowering them but of anchoring expectations it is not a 2 month task it takes longer in terms of taxes there is no space the democrats will be in a bad position at the time of the elections and they will be left with a lame duck administration as dubbed without being able to do anything in the second half of the mandate congress will be opposition and a president without congress can t do much is this scenario already beginning to be felt in any sectors adjusting to higher rates and lower activity if we look at the economy there are several bubbles that need to be deflated the real estate sector is very inflated by rates and needs to deflate what is key in that sector is affordability that is if the person can pay the mortgage fee because it went from 3 to 6 a relevant jump that causes many buyers to be left out of the market and that s why demand will plummet it is inexorable that the fall in the real estate sector will slow down new construction and will inflation drop faster because of the economic situation that s what the fed is betting on i think inflation will go down fast because of the drop in activity it will take 1 or 2 years i don t see a scenario like the 70 s with inflation and a sharp drop in activity we are starting from a different base of low inflation i would believe that in 2 years inflation would be within the range that the federal reserve has set they can raise rates to more than 3 3 5 but at the end of the day there is no magic within that process the democrats will be in a bad position at the time of the elections and they will be left with a lame duck administration as dubbed without being able to do anything in the second half of the mandate congress will be opposition and a president without congress can t do much will the economic activity have resumed for the 2024 presidential elections it is possible that by then we will have entered the initial part of the growth cycle recessions rarely last a long time but the voter s perception may not be from the period we are living but from a general perspective which includes the past still the president is believed to have more power than he actually has oil went up as well as gas prices and there isn t much that biden can do the tax holiday can t change the situation it s a political effort that shows they re trying to do something that s all what kind of economy are we moving into in terms of historical comparison in the coming year amid a high probability of recession it will be like living in the 80 s for democrats which allowed reagan to win with a country beset between inflation and economic activity where reagan bursts onto the scene the united states remains a very divided and polarized country that is not going to change there is a lack of clarity in the future candidates of both parties de santis is shaping up well biden might not be a candidate there is talk for kamala harris but she still faces rejection democrats need to raise her bar put her in charge of critical issues such as foreign relations something that has visibility it is also a complicated scenario

clients enabling them to meet esg mandates as well as save on electricity costs and capital expenditure capex a report by a joint team from frontier group and environment america research and policy center released last year reported that the proportion of electricity the u s generated from wind and solar increased by about four times between 2011 and 2020 within that decade wind solar and geothermal power production grew at a yearly average of 15 and should this growth rate continue renewable energy is projected to meet the country s electricity demand by 2035 the state of california however does not have to wait until 2035 as it broke that record earlier in may albeit briefly for 15 minutes the state s renewable energy generation peaked at 101 of the current energy demand most of it solar energy breaking a previous record of 96 4 and though this does not imply that california was 100 powered by only renewable energy sources as nuclear natural gas and other non renewable sources also contributed electricity to the grid the new record marked an important milestone against this backdrop observers now note that stakeholders need to work on ensuring the state runs on 100 clean energy for even longer a whole day week or year the need for states and countries to run on 100 clean energy has never been more urgent particularly in the wake of the paris agreement and more recently the cop26 summit which amplified calls to mitigate climate change at the same time companies are increasingly supporting environmental social and governance esg initiatives to meet investors expectations combined these factors have increased the demand for clean energy sources with deloitte s 2022 renewable energy industry outlook report noting that renewable energy growth will accelerate

luke sharrett introduction readers who have been with me for a while won t be shocked by what i have to say next i bought more norfolk southern nyse nsc shares for my dividend growth portfolio in april i wrote that the company was in troubled waters due to economic weakness back then i suggested that investors break up investments to buy in intervals right now the stock is more than 10 below levels in april which means i listened to my own advice and bought more in this article i will once again look at nsc from a dividend growth investor s point of view and dive into current economic developments the company s better risk reward but also the biggest potential risks as well as analyst opinions at the end of this article you will understand why i bought more and be in a better position to decide if this atlanta based railroad is the right fit for your strategy buying supply chain dividends i like businesses that dominate certain supply chains and or the segments they operate in i own three railroad stocks union pacific unp canadian pacific cp and norfolk southern because this gives me coverage of the west the east canada and mexico in the case of norfolk southern it dominates everything between the midwest and east coast with its florida based peer csx corp csx norfolk southern headquartered in atlanta norfolk moves most of its freight on the following routes new york city area to chicago via allentown and pittsburgh chicago to macon via cincinnati chattanooga and atlanta central ohio to norfolk via columbus and roanoke birmingham to meridian cleveland to kansas city memphis to chattanooga the company has no operating rights in florida beyond the border part with georgia however it has trackage haulage rights so it s not uncommon to spot an nsc train in the sunshine state besides what is known as foreign power of course railroads borrowing each other s engines anyway what makes norfolk southern special is its focus on intermodal it generates roughly 28 of its revenues in intermodal norfolk southern is the second largest intermodal railroad behind buffett owned bnsf coal has shrunken to just 12 of total revenues which means that like its major peers it s not a coal play anymore like it was in the 20th century and the first years of this century author norfolk southern it s now an industrial consumer play higher industrial growth and consumer demand automatically translate to higher freight revenue if we ignore the somewhat limited competition norfolk remains a macro play thanks to its relationship with economic growth i will elaborate on that in this article one of the factors that got me to invest in railroads is the fact that they generate high free cash flow this used to be different in the early years of this century and prior to that as capital investments were high capital investments are still high but not relative to what these railroads make in terms of free cash flow free cash flow is basically net income adjusted for non cash operating items operating cash flow minus capital expenditures it s money a company can spend on dividends buybacks and debt reduction without having to worry that it impacts its day to day operations the charts below show that the company did roughly 1 1 billion in free cash flow in 2016 the first year after the 2014 2015 manufacturing recession this year estimates are that nsc will do 3 0 billion in fcf despite ongoing economic difficulties the lower part of the chart below shows what nsc spends its money fcf on while dividend growth has been steady the company spends its excess cash on buybacks buybacks are favored by the tax system as dividends are taxed on multiple levels moreover buybacks are flexible while a dividend isn t officially a commitment it feels like a commitment investors tend to dump stocks that cut dividends cutting dividends is also a sign of defeat it s like a military retreat for the lack of a better example hence companies are gradually building the dividend while using buybacks to get rid of excess cash which benefits shareholders as well due to a lower share count it enhances the value per share over the past 10 years nsc has bought back one in four outstanding shares during the past 5 years the number of diluted shares outstanding has dropped by 17 data by ycharts with regard to the dividend the company has one of the best dividend scorecards in its industry according to the scorecard provided by seeking alpha the company scores very high compared to industrials on safety growth and consistency its yield is a b minus seeking alpha norfolk southern is paying a 1 24 dividend per share per quarter this translates to 4 96 per year or 2 2 of the company s stock price this is now back to normal levels if we exclude spikes during steep sell offs and the recent slump caused by an outperforming stock price over the past 10 years the dividend has been hiked by 150 data by ycharts the most recent dividend hikes are listed below january 2022 13 8 july 2021 10 1 january 2021 5 3 july 2019 9 0 dividend safety as the scorecard indicated already is fantastic if the company can do 3 0 billion in free cash flow it translates to an implied yield of 5 5 this covers the 2 2 dividend with a wide margin and paves the way for both buybacks and debt reduction the reason why norfolk is buying back shares so eagerly is that its debt is sustainable the company is expected to end this year with 13 6 billion in net debt roughly 2 2x ebitda in 2021 s p affirmed norfolk southern s bbb rating with a stable outlook the valuation norfolk southern is roughly 23 below its all time high which makes it one of the steepest sell offs in recent years the 2020 pandemic sell off was worse the 2014 2015 manufacturing sell off was also more violent author nsc drawdowns from all time high while it s hard to call for a bottom i agree with stifel analyst nolan who noted that a lot of rail stocks have fallen further than they deserve seeking alpha news the note pointed to the 2006 2009 cycle as a contrasting point with the rail freight market remaining far more elastic in the prior period additionally demand remains stronger with valuations likely to hold up better than in the prior recession especially as higher fuel prices drive share gains over trucking as such the recent selloff in rail stocks is overdone for many of the names in nolanâ s view â rail equities have re rated and are now at much more attractive multiples relative to what had been anticipated â he wrote â while we are generally making cuts to estimates on lower growth and higher given the substantial selloff in equities and our view for a modest recession impact on the rails we are upgrading some of the cheapest names â i agree with this unlike in the manufacturing recession pricing isn t a big issue now commodities remain strong the trucking market is extremely tight fuel prices are likely to remain high and the war in ukraine benefits us export of commodities like grains coal and related needless to say intermodal weakness and general economic headwinds are reasons to be cautious hence it helps that nsc has priced in a lot according to the graph below norfolk shares have priced in a lot of manufacturing weakness as prices fell in lockstep with the manufacturing sentiment according to the latest data it looks like manufacturing sentiment could catch a break which would add to the attractiveness of nsc shares author with that said using the company s 54 1 billion market cap 14 2 billion in expected 2023 net debt and 580 million in pension related liabilities we re dealing with a 68 9 billion enterprise value that s roughly 10 8x next year s expected ebitda of 6 4 billion that s a good valuation as it erased the entire post 2020 surge in the company s valuation the same goes for the implied free cash flow yield of 5 5 which would be the highest number in more than 10 years in other words investors aren t overpaying for ebitda and free cash flow data by ycharts with that said there are lasting headwinds related to supply chains the supply chain labor headwind one of the biggest headwinds facing railroads and their investors is labor and supply chain problems as freightwaves wrote in a recent article titled america s freight railroads are incredibly chaotic right now the article mentions that despite earning a six figure salary railroads have a very hard time recruiting new qualified talent what used to be an 8 or 9 hour workday is now becoming 12 hour shifts with long hours of waiting around for transportation or relief crews with some days lasting up to 19 hours longtime rail analyst tony hatch said thereâ s something unusual going on with rail headcounts right now typically crews and carloads move in lockstep with railroaders able to hire up or down in times of increased or decreased traffic now those companies havenâ t been able to keep up carloads have steadily increased since mid 2020 but employment hasnâ t matched that freightwaves now president biden is tasked with appointing a presidential emergency board to work on new labor contracts if he fails to get meaningful negotiating going the us rail industry could see the first nationwide strike since 1992 besides that this is bad news for rails it s a worst case scenario for already broken supply chains one of the reasons why railroads did so well in the past 12 years is because of something called precision scheduled railroading psr according to freightwaves psr means that railroads have set times for when they pick up cargo from their customers not unlike a commercial airline before railroads would wait for the cargo there are endless implications that come from this system some of which my colleague mike baudendistel delved into in this 2020 article psr allowed railroads to reduce capital budgets slash headcount and merge internal operations with glee but its biggest boon to the railroaders was how much it boosted their cred on wall street creating billions in shareholder value between 2006 and 2022 nsc operating margins have soared from roughly 27 to more than 40 this is caused by psr among other things data by ycharts i m not saying this trend is going to reverse it won t but the pressure is rising after all finding new trainees is hard and the government i e the stb is going ballistic when it comes to addressing railroad issues norfolk for example saw a steep decline in qualified labor even after the pandemic lockdowns nsc started this year with fewer than 7 thousand qualified t e as a result the company is accelerating hiring it had 905 conductor trainees as of may 2022 however it needs to be seen how successful the hiring process will turn out to be norfolk southern personally i m not worried however this is far from perfect as i approach these investments with a business ownership mentality i assume that railroads will not be able to maintain the steep increase in profitability they showed prior to the pandemic supply chains are still a mess regardless of railroad operations as lockdowns and ongoing difficulties across countries have made shipments unreliable railroads will have to deal with that while addressing customer needs at home if the employee count rises we ll likely see shorter trains and less efficient kpis key performance indicators nonetheless none of the good news i ve given you in this article is void railroads will remain great sources of free cash flow and long term growth is looking good the situation in trucking is even worse labor fuel and environmental regulations make railroads way more attractive on top of that nsc is rather cheap at current levels it makes incorporating these headwinds a lot more feasible takeaway i bought more norfolk southern the company is one of three railroads in my portfolio and one of my all time favorite investments this railroad gives me industrial exposure as it covers more than half of the us economy it benefits from its ability to generate high free cash flow used for aggressive buybacks and satisfying dividend hikes thanks to the most recent sell off norfolk has reached a favorable valuation while i cannot guarantee that the market has bottomed i bought more as the yield is now close to 2 2 unfortunately headwinds exist on top of economic uncertainty we re dealing with a new era of railroad operating efficiency all major class i railroads will have to figure out how to boost hiring efforts and customer satisfaction without damaging operating profitability while i believe that this will result in weaker margin growth in the year s ahead it does not keep me from buying more railroads especially not at these prices in the weeks and months ahead we will get to discuss these developments as well as quarterly results and the impact of changing economic growth on norfolk and its peers dis agree let me know in the comments

dear editor in a recent article it was reported that vice president jagdeo stated among other things that a larger share of its oil revenues sooner would not benefit the country in fact if it comes in he said we can t spend it all positing that it comes inflationary certainly if the money is not properly managed inflation can be a probable outcome however saving the extra oil income now will not be inflationary as it can be placed in the natural resource fund nrf and these savings will earn interest in us dollars so the bigger share of oil now can earn interest income for the country not to do so now will only reflect poor management as explained below every extra dollar guyana receives today is a good day for guyana for when interest rates are not zero a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow the evidence in guyana today will show that interest rates are not zero and more importantly guyana has relatively large interest payments on both the domestic and foreign debts more specifically in the 2021 bank of guyana annual report it is recorded that the stock of the domestic debt at the end of 2021 is g 91 345 million with total interest payments equal to g 2 787 million in 2021 table xv page 35 similarly the external public debt is us 1 393 million with us 23 3 million as interest payments table xvii page 36 certainly these interest payments are not zero and therefore using the oil money to pay down either the current domestic or foreign debt or both is a reasonable outcome for guyana in particular less domestic debt will reduce the interest payments on treasury bills and this will expand the pool of local funds that will now be available for private sector borrowing consequently the private sector should encourage the government to pay down the national debt as they will have access to a larger pool of financial resources hopefully at competitive interest rates from the financial sector with regard to the foreign debt a similar payment arrangement can be applied to the foreign debt to reduce the debt service on loans from the multilateral agencies including the inter american development bank the caribbean development bank and the world bank among others such repayments will not be inflationary as the collected oil payments can be sent directly to these institutions as an alternative these funds can be saved for emergencies such as an oil spill the probability of which is not zero or it can be used to finance the cost of natural disasters due to climate change finally good governance must include collecting in a timely manner all payments especially payments for our non renewable resources that are due to the government and people of guyana to do otherwise and delay collecting the funds especially when the future is unknown and the government has been agreeing to the investor s demands without any reservations this can be both detrimental and costly for the guyanese people this must not happen and guyana must do better in managing our financial and natural resources sincerely c kenrick hunte ph d professor and former ambassador
by kirsty needham suva reuters pacific island nations courted by china and the united states put the superpowers on notice telling the world s two biggest carbon emitters to take more action on climate change while pledging unity in the face of a growing geopolitical contest leaders at a four day summit of the pacific islands forum meeting in fiji s capital suva bristled at a chinese attempt to split some of the nations off into a trade and security agreement while washington pledged more financial and diplomatic engagement the exclusive economic zones of the 17 forum members span 30

inundate lower lying areas at the summit that ended on thursday leaders adopted language several members have used in declaring a climate emergency saying this was supported not only by science but by people s daily lives in the pacific a communique yet to be released shows the nations focussed on the next united nations climate conference cop27 they will push for a doubling of climate finance to flow from big emitters to developing nations within two years money they say is needed to adapt to rising sea levels and worsening storms the communique seen by reuters also calls for meaningful progress at cop27 on financing for the loss and damage to vulnerable societies that cannot adapt and will need to relocate communities a battle lost at last year s global climate talks what matters most to us is we secure bold commitments from all countries at cop27 to phase out coal and other fossil fuels and step up finance to the most vulnerable nations and advance causes like loss and damage that matter dearly to the most at risk island communities fiji s president frank bainimarama told reporters we simply cannot settle for any less than the survival of every pacific island country said bainimarama the forum s chairman tuvalu s foreign minister simon kofe who literally made waves at the last global climate conference by standing knee deep in seawater to show what his country faces

the climate change agenda of its neighbours although maritime surveillance announcements to protect sustainable fishing hinted at its core anxiety it s harder for countries that are responsible for most of the illegal fishing then to argue they are going to support the region to stop illegal fishing australia s pacific minister pat conroy said in an interview referring to china australian officials privately say they do not want security choices in the region driven by economic ties to china and although pacific islands are sophisticated actors they need funding support because many

parallel between its recent pacific diplomacy and a platform it created a decade ago to engage with european countries and bypass the european union some leaders said in interviews that china provided

live in the town know better reading has its own unique history and is home to numerous independent businesses and a wide variety of communities for a while it s been home to a large nepalese community who became expatriates following help from gurkha soldiers in the twentieth century in recent times we ve also welcomed people fleeing afghanistan hong kong and ukraine read more new premium reading tea shop to open soon the town also has some quirky and loved features not least for the bar purple turtle as well as the purple number 17 bus which is the backbone of reading with this in mind we ve come up with a list of the ten things you d only know if you ve actually lived in reading from the terrible roads to the amazing food markets and limescale filled this is what it s like to live in the ding 1 reading may be slowly turning into an american foodhall when it comes to american food outlets reading seems to be the go to place when us businesses are looking to open up new store branches wendy s for example opened its first ever uk branch in reading last year and then opened shops in london oxford and brighton as well the opening day saw queues of people line up to get their hands on some burgers staff also handed out frosty s to customers to help keep them cool in the weather reading is also home to taco bell which opened back in 2019 and is one of the most popular food outlets in the us in september 2021 we also welcomed a jollibee to town which is a filipino based chain that s huge in america image berkshire live darren pepe like any other town in the uk reading is also chock a block with mcdonald s and kfcs whilst the high street does seem to be morphing to the eating habits of the wider us population this could also be indicative of a wider trend that has seen numerous fast food outlets open in uk high streets since the noughties 2 the number 17 bus is the backbone of the town in may of this year local brewery double barrelled decided to create a pale ale called the number 17 the creators wanted to pay homage to reading s famous purple buses the brewery explained that this was its tribute to the backbone of reading the vehicle s legacy has also been recognised by the independent shop but is it art which stocks various gifts featuring the bus image get reading if you live in reading then you will know and love the number 17 bus it runs every eight minutes and takes passengers through the heart of reading all the way from earley to tilehurst it s the easiest way to get into town if you live in these areas and i m sure many people don t know what they d do without it 3 reading town centre isn t worth visiting on saturday afternoons but it is on wednesdays and fridays reading town centre is often a buzz of activity whilst this is mainly good it can sometimes prove to be annoying when you re out and about on a saturday afternoon and trying to find a seat at pret or maybe somewhere like shed but all of the seats have been taken image get reading you don t quite get this same experience on a wednesday or friday and if you re looking for a nice place to eat then you re spoiled with a lot more choice this is because the blue collar food market is open on these same days every week and they offer a wide variety of cuisines with plenty of seating in the market place area this makes reading a much more desirable place to visit during the week compared to the weekend 4 the worst time of the year is the august bank holiday as if driving wasn t hard enough in reading the whole ordeal is made entirely worse when the august bank holiday rolls around this is the weekend reading festival is held read more independent reading businesses that have opened in the past year or so not only are the roads chock a block especially where reading bridge and caversham bridge are concerned but there s also the issue of leftover rubbish on the fields and local eateries losing business this happens as visitors will tend to buy food from inside the site whereas locals will stay in their houses and not tend to deal with the trouble of trying to get a takeaway 5 if you can drive in reading you can drive anywhere image hannah roberts as mentioned above driving in reading is difficult the town is constantly congested and it takes a while to get your head around the one way system what is more there always seems to be road works in the town centre as well as multiple people riding around on e scooters willy nilly this is why if you learn to drive in reading you ll be met with the same response from every person you tell if you can drive in reading you can drive anywhere read more reading lost pubs and whether they ll pull pints again 6 it s best to invest in a water filter reading s water just doesn t quite taste the same as water from buxton or the lake district or somewhere else up north it s not that it tastes rancid it just tastes like it has a lot of limescale in it which it does taps in the town draw out hard water which is filled with the stuff the good news is hard water is actually meant to be good for you as it s filled with trace minerals that being said it still might be a good idea to invest in a water filter unless of course you don t mind having to descale your kettle every week 7 purple turtle is the best night out image get reading once you re past the age of 19 q club just doesn t quite hit the same you could go to lola lo s slug and lettuce lime o neills and walkabout but these clubs can feel like a pretty tragic night out if you re not hammered in contrast purple turtle has a much different vibe as it offers some quirky looking toilets three bar areas a seated and sometimes heated outdoor area and a dungeon it s got range that the other clubs and bars just don t have 8 it feels a bit like living on a construction site there is constant construction work being done in reading town centre and this is true also of the wider area at the moment the station hill development is taking over a lot of the reading skylight towering cranes are being used to install a residential area that will house over 1 000 new homes there have also been city fibre works which have seen large parts of reading blocked off whilst super fast fibre broadband cables are laid down 9 we ll maybe never get city status but it s worth a try this year reading missed out on being granted city status for the fourth time reading is home to over 300 000 people and is one of the largest towns in the uk and yet it s still not a city a lot of people thought that reading would be in with a pretty good chance of winning city status this year given the addition of the elizabeth line but alas city status was granted to doncaster milton keynes and stanley in the falkland islands instead 10 the four story primark is reading s mecca image get reading reading s primark opened in 2016 and since then it has always busy a nice busy though it s not quite as manic and messy as the one you ll find on oxford street if you stroll through the town centre you ll see at least ten people with primark bags this may be the case in a lot of high streets but reading s primark is a bit different offering four floors of accessories makeup homeware clothes and more the branch is always filled with the best that primark has to offer this includes an exclusive homeware range and even a gregg s clothing collaboration which is now almost definitely out of stock read next

although the given title for my talk is the challenges and rewards of translation i have re titled it the goddess in my puja room hoping to make it less yawn worthy and more intriguing perhaps eliciting questions like who is this goddess and where is this puja room the puja room is in my mind and the goddess is constance garnett the translating machine who lived from 1861 to 1946 and translated during fifty of those years some 70 volumes of russian prose into english some of which i read growing up and perhaps you did too garnett started off not knowing russian she had to take a russian émigré s assistance to help her translate but she soon wearied of the arrangement studied russian went to russia where she met leo tolstoy in the flesh and began to translate unaided if today the first line of anna karenina happy families are all alike every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way is quoted in the english literary world as one of the finest first lines ever written it wasn t written by leo tolstoy it was written by constance garnett to put her in my puja room then is the least i can do by way of genuflection i read dostoevsky s crime and punishment at the age of 13 when its theme lay way beyond my experience of life if despite that i was captivated the credit must go to garnett s translation back then i imagined her as a thin ascetic woman who spent her days and nights in a garret going clackety clack on her typewriter even as the rest of the house slept the image as it turns out was not anachronistic as far as the typewriter went the underwood no 5 had become a fixture of offices and homes by 1900 when garnett was 29 however that wasn t how garrett worked her friend dh lawrence has described her as sitting out in the garden turning out reams of her marvellous translations from the russian she would finish a page and throw it off on a pile on the ground without looking up and start a new page that pile would be this high really almost up to her knees and all magical and me although i ve been through translating manually with a fountain pen ballpoint pen and then on three progressively more advanced typewriters i have worked comfortably on a computer for the last thirty years and yet metaphorically speaking the sheets have not piled knee high on the floor beside me i cannot even complain that it is because of the close set type of marathi books that puts such a great strain on my eyes because who knows how the russian books garnett had to read were set and anyway she was apparently half blind even before she began translating constance garnett with her son david in the mid 1890s image credit wikimedia commons if garnett s output and style of working are enough to shame translators like me the fact that it has not been bouquets all the way for her in recent times must engender in us a sense of fellowship in my case a certain individual named mr dam once summarily dismissed a book of three premanand gajvi plays of which i had translated two in the pages of an upcountry sunday newspaper i dismissed the review equally summarily but my anguished editor felt compelled to complain on facebook that mr dam had damned the translations without offering a single reason why and had done so in badly crafted sentences to boot some samples of which he was only too happy to point out the wholesale damming of garnett s translations has come from critics of greater consequence than mr dam although ezra pound contended that without garnett the nineteenth century russians would not have been such a profound influence on early twentieth century american literature and earnest hemingway swore that the depth and accomplishment he saw in the russian writers as translated by garnett was like having a great treasure offered to him vladimir nabokov declared her translation of anna karenina a complete disaster pointing to a passage in her rendering which read holding his head bent down before him nabokov comments acidly mark mrs garnett has decapitated the man joseph brodsky on his part said the reason english speaking readers can barely tell the difference between tolstoy and dostoevsky is that they aren t reading the prose of either one they re reading constance garnett some translators might take that as a compliment for instance tim parks british author of 14 novels and translator of works by moravia calvino calasso and machiavelli his article on translation in the observer begins who wrote the milan kundera you love answer michael henry heim and what about the orhan pamuk you think is so smart maureen freely or the imaginatively erudite roberto calasso well that was me i would be very upset if i were told that an author i had translated sounded like me the aims and ideals of translation have travelled with time today we strive to keep as many of the textural syntactical and rhythmic qualities of the original text intact in our translations as we possibly can garnett s times were different that is why i dismiss nabokov s and brodsky s comments about her work as ahistorical just as i dismiss tim parks s hubris as misplaced authors are authors translators are translators authors are great translators are not if you can t stomach that hierarchy then whether you translate moravia or machiavelli they are going to sound like tim parks therefore writerly pride in pocket the translator submits to the original author s voice she doesn t take over the original she allows herself to be taken over by it if the author of the original text writes a rough edged prose that deliberately disregards some conventional rules of grammar and syntax to smoothen out the rough edges would mean drowning out the author s authentic voice the translator must instead stretch the possibilities of her language to accommodate that voice in the process she might even enrich her language walter benjamin says the opportunity offered by translation is not a defensive one to preserve to embalm the current state of the translator s own language rather it is an opportunity to allow a foreign tongue to influence and modify the language into which a work is being translated i would claim to have once risen to that ideal when i translated gieve patel s play mister behram into marathi patel uses a formal constructed language in the play he is not writing realistic dialogue he is writing a classical modern dialogue that puts a formal distance between speakers the commonly used language in contemporary marathi theatre depending on the story is realistic or colloquial or poetically heightened aiming low i could have converted patel s uniquely inflected prose into something closer to what my audience was accustomed to but that would have been an act of embalming the current state of marathi rather than grabbing the opportunity to allow patel s language to influence and modify it so i severed all links with the voices of marathi theatre that filled my aural memory and concentrated on patel s voice alone to guide the translation in rehearsal the actors were at first uncomfortable with speaking this language but they soon settled down to it when it was staged the audience too was uncomfortable at the start but they too settled down allowing the freshness of its new register to challenge and excite them translators are often asked the question does your choice of language depend on the readership for which you translate what the questioner has in mind is whether we orient our translation towards the american or the british reader some translators might i don t i do not translate for a particular group of readers wherever they live i do not planish and pat a masterpiece into a vilely beautiful shape as nabokov puts it in his essay on the art of translation to conform to the notions and prejudices of a given public for nabokov such an act constitutes a crime that belongs to the third degree of a translator s turpitude to be punished by the stocks as plagiarists were in the shoebuckle days a crime that brodsky points to is dropping words and phrases that you don t know the meaning of and not giving yourself enough time to hunt for the meaning translation needs as much time as original writing i find it very difficult to translate with a deadline hovering over my head how do you know what traps lie in wait for you in the original text i have spent days trying to find the meaning of a dialect word or phrase and more days digging for its nearest equivalent in english the picture of garnett finishing sheet upon sheet of translation makes me wonder if she skipped words and even whole sentences as critics have observed because she was running to catch deadlines not blessed with constance garnett s productive energy nor indeed by the press of publishers that came knocking at her door i have been very selective in the books i have chosen to translate susan sontag says in her st jerome lecture on literary translation by literary translation we mean we could mean the translation of the small percentage of published books actually worth reading that is to say worth rereading i shall argue that a proper consideration of the art of literary translation is essentially a claim for the value of literature itself the purpose of translation the evangelical incentive as she puts it is to enlarge the readership of a book deemed to be important i have chosen to translate only such books as are important landmarks in marathi literature and have been reread or deserve to be reread over time that is why i have translated durga khote s autobiography mee durga khote uddhav shelke s novel dhag makarand sathe s novel achyut athavale ani athavan prabhakar barve s essays on art kora canvas and the plays of mahesh elkunchwar satish alekar g deshpande vijay tendulkar premanand gajvi shafaat khan rajeev naik and others that is also why i will one day translate laxmibai tilak s smritichitre and sane guruji s shyamchi aai smritichitre the memoirs of a spirited wife lakshmibai tilak translated by shanta gokhale at the risk of elevating myself i will admit that i possess something of the evangelical incentive that drives me to translate that is why i am somewhat bemused when unknown people call me up and ask me to translate their books beginning with my friend so and so gave me your number and recommended you for translating my book that puts me in the category of grocers my friend so and so highly recommends your papads can you send me a packet please once you are known as a translator it is assumed that you have set up shop and have nothing else to do in life when i receive such requests i decline firmly but politely but there are always those sticky ones who will not take a polite no for an answer one such individual believed that if i only but set eyes on his book i d grab the opportunity to translate it he brought the book across one afternoon and put it down before me with a flourish it was about his management philosophy i said nice and gave him tea and biscuits that should have put him on his guard it did not he opened the pages of the book for me read out its impressive contents

a virginia man distressed by a desecrated family cemetery just over three years ago found some solace july 9 when a government issued tombstone was officially set in place at the gravesite of his distant relative i think it s fantastic gordon silleck of fredericksburg said i would have rather had the original stone in perfect condition there but since that was destroyed this is fantastic since his early childhood years living in rural new york silleck has never given up learning about preserving and honoring the memory of his very distant relatives all interred at southern stafford s wallace family cemetery located in liberty hall estates subdivision off truslow road it s just an interest in history that i ve always had combined with that cemetery silleck said who was buried there and what their lives were like that was the main attraction for me in the 1960s silleck had an aunt who lived in the village of falmouth each year sillecks parents katherine wallace and sidney bayley silleck of scarsdale new york piled gordon and his four young siblings into a ford station wagon and headed south on u s 1 to visit agnes nannie wallace and her daughters at clearview the family s historic estate during those visits one of nannie s daughters with a keen interest in family genealogy would take the children to visit the old family cemetery which during colonial times was 975 rolling green acres known as liberty hall farm while visiting the family cemetery located deep in the woods and surrounded by an old wrought iron fence the children rubbed charcoal etchings of the white marble and sandstone grave markers to permanently retain their images before time weather and age took their toll among those buried there are silleck s great great great grandfather john wallace of fredericksburg as well as silleck s great grandfather samuel gordon wallace a civil war soldier who served in the 30th virginia infantry regiment decades later when silleck moved from new york to fredericksburg after a career with sikorsky aircraft corp in connecticut he made it back to the wallace family cemetery to discover the woods he once trekked through as a youngster were now bulldozed leveled and cleared by a developer to make way for a collection of large homes that has now become liberty hall estates to silleck s dismay the bulldozers and their steel blades used during the land clearing passed directly over the historic wallace family cemetery without care the dirt had been dug to about 4 inches and graded across the whole cemetery silleck said in early 2019 stones were sitting at all angles there were footstones that didn t match the headstones and it looked terrible there was a debris pile which had marble and granite in it which could not have come from anywhere else but the cemetery stafford county officials eventually cited the developer for violating the county ordinance on preserving cemeteries in april 2019 officials sent the developer a notice that included nine alleged violations for disturbing soil and vegetation near the cemetery and for removing concrete slabs as well as the iconic black wrought iron fence the developer was also cited for headstones and footstones being pulled from the ground and improperly grading the terrain although the developer s attorney said his client did not move any headstones or damage the cemetery eventually the developer agreed to piece together the broken cemetery to stafford county s satisfaction but the end result did not meet sillecks expectations i d give him a 4 on a scale of 1 to 10 silleck said i m a little disappointed that no one was held responsible and there was no accountability but it turned out ok silleck said the builder eventually installed a 4 foot high aluminum fence around the cemetery and a plaque was also placed on the grounds bearing the family name silleck said both the fence and the plaque look like it s the cheapest thing the developer could do and said the permanent damage done to some of his relatives headstones allegedly by the developer was beyond comprehension headstone was standing when took over then it fell over and now it s just broken all into pieces silleck said of all the stones there a revolutionary war patriot that was the one that got broken shortly after a drenching rain passed over hartwood late saturday morning john wallace the original owner of liberty hall farm who passed away may 4 1829 finally received a new government issued white georgia marble headstone with the help of six volunteers from the col fielding lewis chapter of the virginia society of the sons of the american revolution seth roderick a member of the chapter said a 2019 free lance star story that reported silleck s dilemma at the cemetery prompted him to get involved we wanted to do something to support gordon in his efforts to remember his descendant roderick said we came up with a few ideas and the most likely was petitioning the veterans administration for a new headstone roderick who said his chapter represents several counties in the region including stafford said the group keeps a stock of brass markers to place at veterans gravesites but the occasion to place a marble headstone for a revolutionary war veteran is a big deal for chapter members we hope this grave monument stands for another 200 years as a reminder of one of the citizens of stafford and his contributions to his community roderick said it was during a difficult time in our shared history which was the founding of the united states roderick said the process to obtain the official headstone took about four months he said a chapter member who was familiar with submitting the necessary government paperwork led the way while other members combed the internet to obtain the relevant military service documents associated with wallace i got online and pulled some proof of service for john wallace from fold 3 and other online sources roderick said i was able to find copies of his original muster paperwork during their search of military records volunteers from the local chapter also discovered wallace had served during the battle at valley forge in late 1777 through june 1778 then onto the battle of monmouth he also camped at the middlebrook encampment in bridgewater township new jersey at west point new york and at smith s clove a pass through new york s ramapo mountains he eventually went on to join the philadelphia campaign which lasted a year from july 1777 to july 1778 after decades of looking after the cemetery while worrying about its future silleck believes the residents of liberty hall estates will become faithful stewards of the hallowed ground and said several of them have already stepped in to lend a hand maintaining the cemetery during one of the storms a limb came down in the cemetery and they cleared it off so they re watching over it silleck said i think the hoa in the future there is going to be taking care of it it s a great feeling next month roderick s chapter will officially dedicate the new headstone at john wallace s gravesite which will also include a brass revolutionary war veteran marker the aug 14 public ceremony takes place at 2 p m and will include members of falmouth s falls of the rappahannock and fredericksburg s washington lewis chapters of the daughters of the american revolution we re all custodians of a rich and dynamic history roderick said the founding generation pledged their lives fortunes and sacred honor for liberty and their honor is our legacy remembering john wallace and others like him is a small token of gratitude and a decent thing to do in the community

have you ever experienced that sudden high pitched ringing noise inside your ear for a moment all the outside sounds will go mute and all you could hear was that ring but then we will immediately plug our fingers in our ears and the noise will stop as soon as it starts we get that once in a while and right after the ring stops we forget about it this noise doesn t bother us or disrupt our day to day work so it s okay but what if this high pitched noise you hear refuses to stop it s a disease called tinnitus this noise is not an external sound that we could get away from it comes from inside our ear s therefore if it doesn t stop we will get so annoyed and disappointed this non stop noise we here are called tinnitus more than 20 million people suffer from tinnitus in the usa so should i

by kirsty needham suva reuters pacific island nations courted by china and the united states put the superpowers on notice telling the world s two biggest carbon emitters to take more action on climate change while pledging unity in the face of a growing geopolitical contest leaders at a four day summit of the pacific islands forum meeting in fiji s capital suva bristled at a chinese attempt to split some of the nations off into a trade and security agreement while washington pledged more financial and diplomatic engagement the exclusive economic zones of the 17 forum members span 30 million square km 10 million square miles of ocean providing half the world s tuna the most eaten fish the nations are also feeling some of the severest effects of climate change as rising seas inundate lower lying areas at the summit that ended on thursday leaders adopted language several members have used in declaring a climate emergency saying this was supported not only by science but by people s daily lives in the pacific a communique yet to be released shows the nations focussed on the next united nations climate conference cop27 they will push for a doubling of climate finance to flow from big emitters to developing nations within two years money they say is needed to adapt to rising sea levels and worsening storms the communique seen by reuters also calls for meaningful progress at cop27 on financing for the loss and damage to vulnerable societies that cannot adapt and will need to relocate communities a battle lost at last year s global climate talks what matters most to us is we secure bold commitments from all countries at cop27 to phase out coal and other fossil fuels and step up finance to the most vulnerable nations and advance causes like loss and damage that matter dearly to the most at risk island communities fiji s president frank bainimarama told reporters we simply cannot settle for any less than the survival of every pacific island country said bainimarama the forum s chairman tuvalu s foreign minister simon kofe who literally made waves at the last global climate conference by standing knee deep in seawater to show what his country faces told reuters there is technology available to protect the islands and raise the islands and that is what we are seeking it is very costly as the pacific summit was ending australian coal mining stocks soared on expectations china could resume imports after a two year political dispute halted coal shipments to the world s biggest coal burner from its second biggest exporter in contrast to the market s bullishness leaders in the forum s thatched roof headquarters discussed how to deal with the statehood of people whose nation has sunk in rising seas or rights to fishing grounds defined by their distance from a landmass that may disappear splintering regionalism the communique cites an urgent need for assistance on debt vulnerability and the rising cost of food amid the pandemic and russia s invasion of ukraine in a video address to the forum u s vice president kamala harris pledged to triple funding to pacific islands over a decade under a fisheries treaty and open more embassies pacific leaders at times showed irritation at the global focus on the contest between the washington and beijing over their region australia in tune said less about security and pledged greater support for the climate change agenda of its neighbours although maritime surveillance announcements to protect sustainable fishing hinted at its core anxiety it s harder for countries that are responsible for most of the illegal fishing then to argue they are going to support the region to stop illegal fishing australia s pacific minister pat conroy said in an interview referring to china australian officials privately say they do not want security choices in the region driven by economic ties to china and although pacific islands are sophisticated actors they need funding support because many have historical debts to beijing fiji for example has taken no loans from china since 2012 but continues to service export import bank loans for chinese infrastructure projects that will cost the government fj 40 million 18 million this year budget documents show australian strategic policy institute analyst michael shoebridge said beijing has a record of splintering regionalism drawing a parallel between its recent pacific diplomacy and a platform it created a decade ago to engage with european countries and bypass the european union some leaders said in interviews that china provided economic opportunities that small island economies could not ignore although they agreed to work through the forum to stay unified in their response to great power competition particularly on security after disquiet that beijing struck a security deal in april with the solomon islands the forum s secretary general openly criticised china s bid to have around half the forum members sign a deal on trade and security in may that would exclude members with ties to taiwan and exclude australia and new zealand leaders at the summit said it had been rushed without consultation china s embassy in fiji responded on twitter on saturday saying beijing had prepared and presented the outcome document to pacific islands a month ahead of a meeting of foreign ministers beijing has created a new platform for cooperation with pacific island countries through an annual meeting with its foreign minister it said 1 2 2578 fiji dollars reporting by kirsty needham in suva editing by william mallard
these supercharged growth stocks have the tools and intangibles necessary to make patient investors a lot richer this has not been the start to 2022 that most investors envisioned the benchmark s p 500 delivered its worst first half to a new year since 1970 while the growth dependent nasdaq composite tumbled at one point by more than 30 while there s no question that bear markets can be scary due to the unpredictability and velocity of their downside moves they re also the ideal opportunity for patient investors to do some shopping no matter how volatile things may appear in the short run all notable declines in the broad market indexes have eventually been cleared away by bull market rallies it s an especially good time to go bargain hunting within the veritable sea of beaten down innovative growth stocks the following three monster growth stocks all have the tools and intangibles necessary to turn a 350 000 initial investment into 1 million by 2028 novavax the first mammoth growth stock with the potential to nearly triple your money over the next six years is biotech stock novavax nvax 3 74 novavax s claim to fame is the company s development of a covid 19 vaccine nvx cov2373 last year novavax published the results of two large scale studies involving its vaccine in the adult population the u k trial produced an 89 7 vaccine efficacy ve while the u s mexico trial yielded a 90 4 ve earlier this year novavax released the results from a third study involving adolescents that produced an 80 ve the point being that nvx cov2373 is one of only a small handful of vaccines to have reached the elusive 90 ve mark in clinical trials what makes novavax s covid vaccine so intriguing is that it s protein based rather than focused on messenger rna there s a real possibility that vaccine holdouts who were concerned about mrna vaccine technology might be more willing to receive the novavax jab assuming it s given the green light by the u s food and drug administration fda for emergency use authorization eua to build on this point the fda s advisory panel seemingly gave novavax s vaccine a resounding endorsement in june the panel with one abstention voted 21 0 in favor of approving the company s vaccine for eua ultimately the fda granted eua to novavax s covid vaccine this past week aside from its success in fighting covid 19 infection the development of nvx cov2373 demonstrates the value of novavax s drug platform in particular it suggests the company could quickly become a leader in developing combination vaccines such as influenza and covid 19 or variant specific covid 19 vaccines what s more novavax is sitting on a veritable mountain of cash the company ended march with 1 57 billion in cash and cash equivalents and is likely to add to these totals as it rakes in between 4 billion and 5 billion in covid 19 vaccine sales orders in 2022 with a significant portion of the company s market cap supported by its cash novavax is highly de risked as an investment valued at less than 3 times wall street s forecast earnings for this year novavax looks to be an absolute steal among growth stocks green thumb industries a second monster growth stock with the ability to turn a 350 000 investment into a cool 1 million by 2028 is u s marijuana stock green thumb industries gtbif 1 96 as of february 2021 there wasn t a buzzier industry than cannabis the expectation had been that democrats gaining control of congress and joe biden taking the oval office would roll out the proverbial green carpet for federal cannabis reforms unfortunately the ongoing pandemic and a slew of other issues have derailed lawmakers attempts to legalize weed in the united states as a result multi state operators msos like green thumb have taken it on the chin thankfully this shortsightedness can be your opportunity to pounce the first thing to understand about the u s pot industry is that federal legalization isn t necessary for its success approximately three quarters of all states have given the green light to cannabis in some capacity which is providing more than enough organic opportunity for msos like green thumb it s also worth noting that cannabis is treated as a nondiscretionary good this is a fancy way of saying that consumers continue to buy pot products even if economic activity weakens or inflation soars in a way this makes marijuana products a basic necessity item for consumers in legalized states what makes green thumb such an intriguing mso is its revenue mix according to a may presentation from the company well over half of the company s sales come from derivatives such as beverages vapes oils and pre rolls aside from their higher price point derivatives boast juicier margins than dried cannabis flower green thumb s product mix has played a key role in the company generating a generally accepting accounting principles gaap profit in each of the past seven quarters for context most u s msos still aren t profitable on a recurring basis green thumb has also placed a lot of emphasis on expanding into limited license markets states where dispensary licensing is purposefully limited allows a company like green thumb the time to build up its brands and a loyal following with a rapidly growing operating model that s clearly working green thumb industries should soon have its patient shareholders seeing green upstart holdings the third and final monster growth stock that can turn 350 000 into 1 million by 2028 is cloud based lending platform upstart holdings upst 7 89 without a doubt there ll be no shortage of skeptics ready to bet against upstart last week the company preannounced its second quarter operating results which fell well short of its previous guidance according to the company revenue is expected to be about 228 million with a net loss ranging from 31 million to 27 million this compares to its own prior forecast of 295 million to 305 million in sales and a quarterly loss ranging from 4 million to 0 breakeven the company cited inflation and recession fears as driving up interest rates and making lenders far more cautious as a reminder upstart s platform is new and has yet to be battle tested during an economic downturn but in spite of this negative news my opinion of upstart s artificial intelligence ai based lending model remains unchanged rather than relying on a decade s old loan vetting model upstart s platform is able to use ai to completely automate and instantly approve about three quarters of all applications this means more loans can be processed at a cheaper cost to financial institutions furthermore upstart s ai lending platform has produced approvals at a lower average credit score than the traditional loan vetting process yet there hasn t been a deterioration in loan delinquencies despite this drop off this suggests upstart s lending platform can open doors for a broader swath of society even as loan applications decline upstart s recent success makes it more likely that financial institutions turn to its ai solutions as a vetting tool but perhaps the most exciting aspect of upstart s lending platform is its expansion potential throughout the company s young history it s predominantly focused on personal loans following the acquisition of prodigy software in 2021 upstart now has access to ai based auto loans the addressable market for auto loans 751 billion is nearly seven times larger than that of personal loans 112 billion over many years i d be surprised if upstart s ai lending platform wasn t also used for mortgage loan originations a 4 5 trillion market although upstart is rough around the edges at the moment it has the innovative capacity and ai powered platform to make financial institutions and its patient investors a whole lot richer
nato nations are facing major military economic and security problems because of the war in ukraine what it comes down to is that military leaders back all possible military aid for ukraine while political leaders face problems with paying for it not just the financial cost but the impact on voters who find themselves facing higher taxes and as well as inflation and shortages of essential goods supporting the ukrainian war with russia is expensive and exposes the true costs of cutting defense expenditures in the past by not maintaining sufficient stockpiles of weapons and munitions the basic problem is that it is a historical fact reinforced by the current situation that you must maintain adequate stockpiles of ammunition and equipment for use against a large well equipped force in a war these stockpiles are also referred to as the war reserve as in large quantities of munitions and spares stockpiled to keep the troops supplied during the initial 30 60 days of fighting until production can be increased to sustain the fighting these stockpiles must contain the most useful munitions and other supplies and be positioned so they can be moved to the combat zones as quickly as possible without adequate logistics as in the right supplies delivered in time wars or at least battles are often lost early and often this is happening to the russians and is crippling ukrainian war efforts because nato cannot keep key weapons and other supplies coming nato military leaders point out that supporting ukraine is not just about supporting a nation facing conquest and annexation by russia the real issue is that the war in ukraine is between nato and russia only because attacking ukraine which is not a nato member but wants to be one does not trigger the mutual defense aspect of nato membership if ukraine were a nato member the russian attack would face nato troops from all nato members that would mean all nato members would be suffering troop losses and that motivates voters to support paying the high economic costs of defending ukraine russia sees victory in ukraine as a victory over nato and a weakening of nato resolve to comply with mutual defense aspects of membership russian victory in ukraine would make the new since the 1990s nato members vulnerable to attack and annexation by russia before other nato members could help prevent it for nato nations adjacent to russia these fears aren t theoretical but historical and often include centuries of russian aggression and brutal occupation that sometimes led to annexation the original reason for nato was mainly about keeping the russians out the americans in and the germans down nato was formed after world war ii ended in 1945 that also ended over 70 years of major wars instigated by germany now germany was partitioned and the western half faced another russian invasion the german occupation was short and the germans were eager to join nato and help keep the russians out that attitude has persisted through the cold war the collapse of the soviet union and reunification of germany the germans had lost all interest in wars of aggression but the russians had not the soviet union prospered for a while after nikita khrushchev who took over when josef stalin died in 1953 concentrated on the economy and well being of russians rather than the world conquest and generally murderous attitudes of stalin this was a welcome change for most russians if only because stalin s policies had resulted in 18 percent of the russian population dying in wars or domestic terror against russians by stalin to protect his power khrushchev was gone within a decade the first russian leader in a long time to retire alive from office rather than die or be killed while in power khrushchev was replaced by less altruistic politicians who had aligned with russian military leaders who wanted to start an arms race with the west and prepare for an eventual attack on western europe and that new nato alliance then as now russia described this as necessary to defend russia from more prosperous nato countries who might think and act like russians this is a bad habit that russia is having a difficult time overcoming even though the old soviet union collapsed from among other things this arms race after the soviet union dissolved russia tried democracy to do another khrushchev for a decade there was some success but not enough because vladimir putin a former kgb officer took power and returned to the police state and military buildup that stalin and khrushchev s successors tried with such disastrous results putin won the support of the military by spending a lot of money russian could not afford to update the cold war era weapons those updates as well new tactics and unit organizations turned out to be failures and this was made clear when the overconfident russian military invaded ukraine despite the initial failures russia persists and is still seeking to intimidate nato into submission for russia it is a three front war first there is the very obvious combat in ukraine as well as an information war against politicians and journalists in nato countries then there is an economic struggle to deal with the economic sanctions the economics of war have changed since the end of the cold war an event that was expected to deliver a peace dividend made possible by major cuts in military forces and defense spending that did not work out as expected because many countries eliminated conscription but underestimated the cost of a smaller all volunteer force another unpleasant surprise was the higher costs for maintaining war reserves the widespread use of gps ins guided shells and rockets since the late 1990s has led to most artillery being retired one guided shell or rocket can do the work of dozens of unguided projectiles the validity of this was proven time and again while fighting islamic terrorists since 2001 this included 2016 18 battles against isil islamic state in iraq and the levant where the islamic terrorists were defending urban areas the same way a conventional force would but smart shells and rockets were used effectively and frequently rather than the older tactic of using far more unguided shells and rockets in both cases the urban areas are destroyed but with guided projectiles it is done with more precision and that enables the friendly ground forces to advance more rapidly and with fewer casualties than in the past because of the battles with isil in iraq and syria the effectiveness of fewer guided projectiles replacing many more unguided ones was proven and ammunition stockpiles could be adjusted accordingly russia has some guided shells but cannot afford to stockpile many of them and they are less effective than american designs russia and east european nations that lost their communist governments by 1990 were stuck with huge stockpiles of ammo not all of it could be exported because so much of it was now available moreover bombs rockets and artillery shells have expiration dates because the propellants detonators and explosives used degrade over time elderly ammo first becomes unreliable and eventually too unstable for use because this ammo will detonate spontaneously or as it is used this is why so many russian shells and rockets fail to explode it s expensive to dispose of elderly ammo and russia tends to consider older ammo as either unreliable and acceptable for use or dangerously unstable because even moving it or trying to fire it will cause it to explode this stuff be disposed of since 2018 u s army orders for 155mm artillery shells were up from 16 573 to 148 287 for 2019 because of a new precision guidance option in 2020 the emphasis switched to gps guided 227mm rockets gmlrs and upgrades for the longer range 600mm atacms guided rocket in 2020 the army has ordered 10 193 gmlrs rockets versus 8 101 in 2019 and 6 936 in 2018 in that time the army discovered that it was easier to use the longer range 70 kilometers or more gmlrs than trying to develop longer range tube based artillery the need here was to match longer range artillery developed and put in service by russia and china even with longer barrels and rocket assisted shells artillery could not reach as far as gmlrs moreover jamming the gps signal is a less effective enemy option with the much improved microchip based ins inertial guidance system long used as a less accurate backup in weapons using gps for projectile guidance the new ins is nearly as accurate as gps and if you have to be sure fire two or three gmlrs at the same target that works especially since ins cannot be jammed there is still a need for guided and unguided 155mm artillery shells to provide choice the army has been ordering many more of the pgk projectile guidance kit 155mm fuze the pgk fuze turns an unguided 155mm shell into a gps ins guided one these were found to be exceptionally useful in syria and iraq and in mid 2017 the u s army ordered another 5 600 pgk fuzes and has been building a large stockpile the army still uses unguided artillery shells for situations that don t require precise accuracy for each shell but the pgk provides options that can be implemented quickly to turn any dumb shell into a smart one it is unknown if any of these pgk fuzes have been sent to ukraine recent u s defense budgets accelerated purchases of numerous items that have to be stockpiled to sustain a major war even a short one although fighting in iraq syria and afghanistan has involved few american troops it has seen enough action and use of artillery in support of iraqi syrian and afghan forces to deplete stockpiles and indicate which items would be needed in another major war that war came along unexpectedly in 2022 when russia invaded ukraine and much of the nato s support was in the form of modern atgms and other guided weapons before 2008 as the war began to wind down in iraq there were warnings that stockpiles and war reserves were being allowed to shrink to dangerously low levels the impact of this was first seen during the 1973 arab israeli war where ammo expenditures were much higher than expected that lesson remains relevant and politicians don t like when it stands in the way of keeping the defense budget from interfering with other spending priorities that appeal to more voters in early 2016 american military leaders went public about how their complaints about smart bomb and missile shortages being ignored in 2015 over 25 000 smart bombs and missiles were used by american mostly and allied nato and local arabs warplanes operating over iraq and syria nearly all weapons were supplied by american firms but the american politicians and military leaders couldn t agree on how to get the money to replace bombs being taken from the war reserve stocks that debate was largely halted in 2022 when ukraine was invaded now there is lots of support for increasing production of the items most useful to ukrainian forces like javelin and stinger and rebuilding war reserves of those weapons without nato membership ukraine has to depend on the voluntary contributions of military assistance to defeat the russian attack the initial nato response was massive and demonstrated the superiority of nato weapons it also revealed that nato nations had underestimated the need to stockpile sufficient munitions to fight this kind or war and nations manufacturing most of these weapons had not paid enough attention despite frequent warnings to how long it would take to achieve wartime production levels also neglected were the problems of additional economic burdens placed on nato member civilian populations the new nato members had warned of the growing possibility of a russian attack even though that was dismissed as unlikely because of the mutual defense aspects of article 5 in the nato membership agreement but it happened in pro nato ukraine and the new nato members see doing everything they can to support ukraine as essential to prevent future attacks on nato members taking ukraine is part of russia s plan to rebuild the russian empire in spite of article 5 and ukraine is the place to prove their plan works some of the original cold war era nato members do not believe the russians are that reckless the new nato members suggest that all nato members should review the long and violent history the new nato members have had with russia in light of the current war in ukraine and russian plans for continuing their aggression after they conquer ukraine politicians prefer to defer hard decisions whenever possible insufficient defense spending is a favorite candidate for such false economies article 5 made politicians even more eager to defer essential defense spending because not only was nato military manpower huge over three million active duty troops and organized reserves but nato forces were equipped with the most modern weapons and equipment all true left out of the press releases is the sorry state of stockpiles of spare parts to keep all the vehicles aircraft and ships operational and war reserves then there was the fact that half the nato manpower came from two countries the united states and turkey this is a major problem because the u s also manufactures most of the high tech weapons and equipment turkey has become a very unreliable nato member since an anti israel and anti nato government came to power in 2000 led by recep erdogan the new turkish government also proved to be economically inept and erdogan faces loss of power in the next elections because of the damage he did to the local economy and living standards of many turks with ukraine erdogan is trying to play both sides to gain any advantage he can for turkey and his own political career the war in ukraine has proved to be a major embarrassment for most nato governments because politicians believed russia would not invade ukraine the surprise turned politically painful when it was realized how much it was costing to support the ukrainian forces and how much more expensive and politically damaging it would be to continue that support until russia was defeated many nato politicians are looking for a way to evade their moral responsibility to support ukraine this is the price east european nato members are willing to pay and this division threatens to destroy nato as a unified defensive alliance
in recent years the world has been rocked by unforeseen and unimaginable global catastrophes the coronavirus pandemic caused disruptions to global economies as countries closed their borders markets became volatile and saw historic crashes while commodity prices shot up owing to shortages in supply the global economy became accustomed to a new normal where covid 19 vaccines represented health passports that dictated movement and activities across borders then the sudden resumption of activity in travel trade business and consumerism brought forward newer challenges increase in demand for consumer goods created extreme shortages in supply new constraints and volatilities emerged in the global supply chain industry as demands to meet shortages outweighed capacity giving rise to severe port congestion quadrupling of freight charges and heightened costs for warehousing and logistics there was hope that the supply chain crises would subside by 2022 but with the current russia ukraine war and the re imposition of restrictions over the resurgence of covid 19 cases in china the challenges to global supply chain networks seem to only have been exacerbated further supply chain is part of the very fabric of globalisation a phenomenon that has shaped the global economy over the past several decades according to the international monetary fund transoceanic routes carry over 80 of the world s traded goods in the months following march 2020 the freight charges from ocean liners have increased by more than 300 and as the crunch in the industry deepens the tenets that have defined globalisation slowly seem to be tethering away globalisation controversies anti globalisation movements date as far back as 1999 when protests took place outside the word trade organization conference in seattle populist sentiments against open borders increased into the new millennium as businesses struggled to stay afloat in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis some people believed globalisation was on the brink of extinction even back then then came brexit and trump in 2016 the united states launched a trade war against china leading to one of the highest effective tariff rates the country had seen since the 1930s in recent years china also increased restrictions on the flow of cross border goods focusing instead on meeting a growing domestic demand despite all this supply chains continued to thrive and global trade remained firmly reliant on the framework that has interconnected the global economy since the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 it was impossible for it to have been any other way globalisation may have made economies interdependent but this interdependency is characterised by geopolitical stability exchange and transfer of technology and for economies to make trade decisions based on where they have a comparative advantage global marketplaces emerged defined by highly sophisticated global value chains in short efficiency was the key no one wants to give up on the comforts of globalisation the trillions of dollars of opportunities that it has afforded over the years and the addiction it has created amongst consumers to buy at exorbitantly low prices nor do globalization advocates want to ignore the benefits of the systems benefits on the 1 billion people who ve risen out of poverty because of the new jobs that were created by foreign direct investment and rapid industrialisation but efficiency also has its costs risks of sudden capital flights have the power to destabilize financial markets and blue collar workers in rich countries lose out when production is offshored more recently however disruptions to the global economy brought about by the pandemic have prompted a serious reflection and reimagining of the current world order as new bottlenecks in supply chain have emerged businessmen policymakers institutions and consumers all saw firsthand how globalisation failed during a global health crisis globalisation in essence was the reason why covid 19 which started in a small chinese province of wuhan spiraled into a never before seen before global pandemic the russia ukraine war has served to justify these claims once again since sanctions on russia have disrupted markets even further food and commodity prices have surged and energy markets are becoming more and more volatile europe having been dependent on russia for its energy needs for years is desperately trying to build up its gas reserves globalisation s changing tide there is fear in giving up on existing frameworks completely but businesses also need protection the narrative is changing from efficiency to security and from a need to offshore to reap the benefits of cheap labour and production costs to a need to reshore and reap the benefits of safety in the event of another global crisis globalisation seems to be slipping in popularity while regionalisation is promoted to build new trading blocs that will yield minimal global impact in the event of a crisis it must be noted that evidence of countries reshoring production is very little according to the economist domestic manufacturing in america remains not only firmly reliant but has also shown a significant increase on imports of raw materials manufacturing shares as percentage of gdp in the rich oecd countries remains at a historic low of just 13 but the fact that companies in the west are bearing additional costs to build up on reserve inventories in case of another supply chain crisis shows that the fear is palpable countries are diversifying their sourcing bases to be able to meet demand in the event of a crisis when aggregate supply falls therefore reimagining globalisation is all about accruing the benefits of globalisation with partners businesses and people who you can rely on with whom you share a strategic geographical and political advantage cause for fears freight forwarders currently hold all the power and freight rates are expected to remain at record highs in the months to follow this is after the eu mobility package which went into effect on february 2022 which has reduced the average number of working times for drivers and jacked up costs elsewhere in the west an aging population means that drivers are in short supply thus creating a gap in the market to find younger applicants the industry needs to further improve working conditions reduce hours and adjust pay scales moreover oil prices continue to remain high and given the highly fuel dependent nature of the supply chain industry the burden is being translated into high transportation costs diesel buyers in europe are having to spend 41 percent more on fuel today compared to december 2021 in addition to this europe is also on its way to revise its draft of the emissions trading system the world s largest carbon market to regulate emissions the additional tariffs are expected to be in place starting 2023 on aviation industries oil refineries electricity generation steel production and other highly polluting sectors lastly the bottlenecks in the supply of goods remain the closing of the suez canal in august 2021 has increased traffic and several port closures in china due to covid 19 are adding to the pressure intense backlogs and congestion persist at ports in both the east and the west coast the fact remains that stakeholders had underscored their dependency on maritime container trade the imf reports that rising shipping costs play a key role in driving global inflation when freight rates double inflation increases by 0 7 percentage points while fuel or commodity prices have a higher and a more direct impact on inflation volatility in shipping costs is quantitatively similar rising shipping costs are in effect translated into higher import costs evidence from 143 countries further suggests that since imported goods and raw materials form the basis of production in most sectors the impact is reflected in producer prices every 2 months these costs are gradually passed on to the consumer countries that have a consistent trade deficit thus feel the impact of surging inflationary pressures far more than others robustness gives way to resilience risks to supply chain have always been an inherent part of the industry according to mckinsey s dan swan and disruptions will continue to happen with more frequency and potentially larger magnitudes the current supply chain crisis has reduced global gdp by 1 per cent global supply chains therefore must be reengineered to afford sustainability and strength the question is how should railway systems and trucking be more regulated how can the power of the oligarchies that control the shipping industry be curtailed how can retailers and middlemen who have abused pitfalls to raise prices be held accountable these are among the questions that need to be addressed to make the supply chain industry more resilient but regulation also goes against the fundamental premise of the neoliberalist dream of globalisation if the need for security morphs into a desire for regionalisation protectionism and industrial subsidies will become the undercurrent allowing countries to meet domestic demand in the short term broken supply chains and additional tariffs will further raise prices in the long term however replicating supply chains into regional networks will create inefficiencies that will increase operating and financial costs to over 2 per cent of the global gdp according to the economist consequences for pakistan pakistan has recently grappled with a severe financial and political crisis and up until a few weeks ago the country was on the brink of bankruptcy inflation hit a two year high at 13 8 percent one of highest in asia and the central bank has had to hike its interest rates by 675 basis points in response food prices have surged by 17 3 per cent while transportation costs have increased by 31 per cent electricity tariffs and gas prices have increased by almost 50 per cent while fuel prices are up by over 30 per cent to meet the conditions of the imf moreover the trade deficit has widened to an all time high by 57 85 per cent year on year during the first 11 months of 2021 2022 the import bill has increased in the country by 44 per cent to over 72 18 billion up from 50 02 billion in the same period last year within the current framework in which pakistan needs to significantly boost its exports the looming changes in the global economy should be of major importance to the country pakistan should evaluate and define its own trade policy in response the export sectors need a buffer to cushion themselves against surging costs of production to remain competitive meanwhile the textile industry offers a one of a kind opportunity to capture newer markets and buyers china is struggling once again to contain another outbreak of covid 19 and india is facing rising cotton prices which have made the country s textile exports highly uncompetitive subsidies and relief measures should therefore be extended to not only make the industry more competitive but also to assuage the workers and employees who are already facing the impact of inflation causing lowered buying power and standards of living an employee who has his basic needs taken care of is one whose productivity is also higher equally important is a need to identify new opportunities for trade within the region and establish links markets like china and india are witnessing the rise of emerging market consumption within the rising middle class according to a mckinsey report it is projected that developing countries will account for almost two thirds of global consumption of manufactured goods by 2025 and more than half of overall global consumption by 2030 it is projected that china will account for 12 cents of global consumption for every 1 and is soon expected to overtake the united states for having the greatest number of millionaires in the world china s share of exports also decreased to 9 percent of what it produced in 2017 compared 17 percent in 2007 this has been largely obscured because the country s output exports and imports have all shown an increase in absolute terms but what it indicates is that china is reorienting its value chains to meet its own burgeoning domestic demand elsewhere india exported 35 percent of its total apparel output in 2002 this share decreased to 17 percent by 2017 as domestic consumers increased consumption these shifts present pakistan with new potential opportunities that are fully in line with changing global paradigms but it also presents a need for the country to build and establish the frayed relationships with some of its neighbours especially india where nationalist sentiments and political mistrust have sabotaged relations for decades for pakistan to be able to use the potential economic climate to its advantage it will need to make use of careful strategic planning taking incremental steps through cultural diplomacy to build new bilateral trade relationships ramisha saleem is a freelance writer who is a special advisor for

on july 7 a jury found a colorado funeral home operator guilty of selling the remains of unconsenting clients deceased loved ones to medical purchasers the convicted trafficker megan hess promised services to grieving families including cremations that never happened instead her funeral home opened a side operation called donor services which sold bodies to hospitals and medical schools that were unaware the remains were stolen while shocking and seemingly uncommon this story exemplifies a once normal practice in u s medicine from the founding of the first u s medical school in 1765 into the 20th century medical faculty and their agents routinely trafficked in stolen human remains to stock their dissecting rooms with cadavers and museums with objects made of human remains before laws regulating the donation of bodies to science physicians obtained these remains from the socially vulnerable most often targeting impoverished black and native american people moreover some of these remains were even used to validate white supremacy by creating hierarchical race based skull collections this practice and its legacies still reverberate today as museums grapple with what to do with such collections and medicine remains buffeted by ingrained racist stereotypes that affect patient care advertisement rare contemporary cases such as this serve as a profound reminder that nothing less than dignity in death is at stake in having a highly regulated market for human remains likewise they draw a spotlight to early american medical schools legacies of embracing classism colonialism and enslavement in the 18th and 19th centuries physicians considered dissecting a cadaver an important rite of passage they argued that having access to cadavers was essential to having medical schools that could compete with european ones for example public hospitals in paris had easy access to cadavers making them the envy of the transatlantic medical world faculty at elite u s schools had trained there too they also saw human remains and skeletal casts as essential to effectively teaching and documenting racial science which argued that there were five separate racial groups which were perhaps even separate species distinguished by faulty measurement of crania white people stood atop the hierarchy advertisement they stored remains in racial science and general anatomical collections maintained at university museums collecting thousands of such pieces these collections existed at schools ranging from harvard university to the medical college of south carolina share this article share the problem was that the practice of acquiring cadavers aroused considerable public enmity in the united states in the spring of 1788 violent protests broke out in new york city when it was discovered that students at the new york college of physicians and surgeons the precursor to columbia university s medical school had stolen the bodies of working class whites for dissection an editorial writer in new york s daily advertiser tried to assuage the outraged mostly white crowd by using racist reasoning claiming that only executed criminals and productions of africa were being dissected if this were the case the editorialist asserted surely no person can object the editorial reflected the tactic that medical schools and their allies adopted to defend such practices dividing and conquering along racial lines even though in reality they acquired disproportionate amounts of the bodies of the impoverished of all races not just black people or the executed privately anatomists grumbled about how superstition and religion stood in the way of passing laws that created legal routes for schools to obtain cadavers but the state of public opinion meant the best medical schools could get were secret arrangements with city governments to obtain bodies from the potter s field or public cemetery which housed the bodies of the indigent of all races advertisement in new york anatomists and the city had a clandestine arrangement the city maintained two graveyards with the remains of the poor without loved ones going in a plot secretly designated for theft meanwhile in philadelphia the mayor arranged without the public s knowledge to give the bodies of the deceased poor to local anatomists the city even hired security for the potter s field to ensure that only authorized thieves exhumed the dead sometimes private cemeteries seeking financial gain also routed bodies to medical schools in 1860 for example for a price of 7 harvard s medical faculty purchased a recently deceased native american man s remains from the director of mount hope cemetery harvard anatomists saw the native man s remains as evidence of innate racial differences and wanted a cast of his skull for their anatomical museum over the 19th century medical faculty and their political allies slowly convinced the mostly white male voting public of the need for dissection in medical education in 1831 massachusetts became the first state to pass an anatomy act that created some legal channels for schools to obtain bodies even as harvard continued to also use extralegal routes in 1883 pennsylvania passed a similar law advertisement this regulation of the use and trafficking of human remains has dramatically reduced the nonconsensual use of bodies for scientific purposes cases like the funeral home in colorado are much rarer in the 21st century than they were in the 19th for their normal operations medical schools no longer rely on stealing human remains that being said this history still reverberates in 2022 both through the persistence of racial medical stereotypes some of which are legacies of the racial theories tied to the collection of bodies in the 19th century and in the extant collections of unreturned and often unethically sourced human remains recently harvard announced that its various museums contained the remains of more than 20 000 humans many of which were collected during this period with few regulations similarly the university of pennsylvania recently made two startling admissions first it announced the planned repatriation of the morton skull collection more than 1 000 skulls collected in the antebellum era meant to prove that humanity was divided by race into five species second shock ensued when the remains of children killed in the 1985 move bombing were found in a drawer at the penn museum
correction a previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the federal reserve this year had raised interest rates twice by a total of three quarters of a percentage point the fed has

financial infusions to cover their debt payments like ecuador and tunisia also are hurting as the u s currency climbs advertisement the dollar s outperformance up 13 percent this year in the dxy index

set its policy rate at the same level the highest in more than six years those moves came one day after south korea s central bank lifted rates by half a percentage point its largest move since 1999

these supercharged growth stocks have the tools and intangibles necessary to make patient investors a lot richer this has not been the start to 2022 that most investors envisioned the benchmark s p 500 delivered its worst first half to a new year since 1970 while the growth dependent nasdaq composite tumbled at one point by more than 30 while there s no question that bear markets can be scary due to the unpredictability and velocity of their downside moves they re also the ideal opportunity for patient investors to do some shopping no matter how volatile things may appear in the short run all notable declines in the broad market indexes have eventually been cleared away by bull market rallies it s an especially good time to go bargain hunting within the veritable sea of beaten down innovative growth stocks the following three monster growth stocks all have the tools and intangibles necessary to turn a 350 000 initial investment into 1 million by 2028 novavax the first mammoth growth stock with the potential to nearly triple your money over the next six years is biotech stock novavax nvax 3 74 novavax s claim to fame is the company s development of a covid 19 vaccine nvx cov2373 last year novavax published the results of two large scale studies involving its vaccine in the adult population the u k trial produced an 89 7 vaccine efficacy ve while the u s mexico trial yielded a 90 4 ve earlier this year novavax released the results from a third study involving adolescents that produced an 80 ve the point being that nvx cov2373 is one of only a small handful of vaccines to have reached the elusive 90 ve mark in clinical trials what makes novavax s covid vaccine so intriguing is that it s protein based rather than focused on messenger rna there s a real possibility that vaccine holdouts who were concerned about mrna vaccine technology might be more willing to receive the novavax jab assuming it s given the green light by the u s food and drug administration fda for emergency use authorization eua to build on this point the fda s advisory panel seemingly gave novavax s vaccine a resounding endorsement in june the panel with one abstention voted 21 0 in favor of approving the company s vaccine for eua ultimately the fda granted eua to novavax s covid vaccine this past week aside from its success in fighting covid 19 infection the development of nvx cov2373 demonstrates the value of novavax s drug platform in particular it suggests the company could quickly become a leader in developing combination vaccines such as influenza and covid 19 or variant specific covid 19 vaccines what s more novavax is sitting on a veritable mountain of cash the company ended march with 1 57 billion in cash and cash equivalents and is likely to add to these totals as it rakes in between 4 billion and 5 billion in covid 19 vaccine sales orders in 2022 with a significant portion of the company s market cap supported by its cash novavax is highly de risked as an investment valued at less than 3 times wall street s forecast earnings for this year novavax looks to be an absolute steal among growth stocks green thumb industries a second monster growth stock with the ability to turn a 350 000 investment into a cool 1 million by 2028 is u s marijuana stock green thumb industries gtbif 1 96 as of february 2021 there wasn t a buzzier industry than cannabis the expectation had been that democrats gaining control of congress and joe biden taking the oval office would roll out the proverbial green carpet for federal cannabis reforms unfortunately the ongoing pandemic and a slew of other issues have derailed lawmakers attempts to legalize weed in the united states as a result multi state operators msos like green thumb have taken it on the chin thankfully this shortsightedness can be your opportunity to pounce the first thing to understand about the u s pot industry is that federal legalization isn t necessary for its success approximately three quarters of all states have given the green light to cannabis in some capacity which is providing more than enough organic opportunity for msos like green thumb it s also worth noting that cannabis is treated as a nondiscretionary good this is a fancy way of saying that consumers continue to buy pot products even if economic activity weakens or inflation soars in a way this makes marijuana products a basic necessity item for consumers in legalized states what makes green thumb such an intriguing mso is its revenue mix according to a may presentation from the company well over half of the company s sales come from derivatives such as beverages vapes oils and pre rolls aside from their higher price point derivatives boast juicier margins than dried cannabis flower green thumb s product mix has played a key role in the company generating a generally accepting accounting principles gaap profit in each of the past seven quarters for context most u s msos still aren t profitable on a recurring basis green thumb has also placed a lot of emphasis on expanding into limited license markets states where dispensary licensing is purposefully limited allows a company like green thumb the time to build up its brands and a loyal following with a rapidly growing operating model that s clearly working green thumb industries should soon have its patient shareholders seeing green upstart holdings the third and final monster growth stock that can turn 350 000 into 1 million by 2028 is cloud based lending platform upstart holdings upst 7 89 without a doubt there ll be no shortage of skeptics ready to bet against upstart last week the company preannounced its second quarter operating results which fell well short of its previous guidance according to the company revenue is expected to be about 228 million with a net loss ranging from 31 million to 27 million this compares to its own prior forecast of 295 million to 305 million in sales and a quarterly loss ranging from 4 million to 0 breakeven the company cited inflation and recession fears as driving up interest rates and making lenders far more cautious as a reminder upstart s platform is new and has yet to be battle tested during an economic downturn but in spite of this negative news my opinion of upstart s artificial intelligence ai based lending model remains unchanged rather than relying on a decade s old loan vetting model upstart s platform is able to use ai to completely automate and instantly approve about three quarters of all applications this means more loans can be processed at a cheaper cost to financial institutions furthermore upstart s ai lending platform has produced approvals at a lower average credit score than the traditional loan vetting process yet there hasn t been a deterioration in loan delinquencies despite this drop off this suggests upstart s lending platform can open doors for a broader swath of society even as loan applications decline upstart s recent success makes it more likely that financial institutions turn to its ai solutions as a vetting tool but perhaps the most exciting aspect of upstart s lending platform is its expansion potential throughout the company s young history it s predominantly focused on personal loans following the acquisition of prodigy software in 2021 upstart now has access to ai based auto loans the addressable market for auto loans 751 billion is nearly seven times larger than that of personal loans 112 billion over many years i d be surprised if upstart s ai lending platform wasn t also used for mortgage loan originations a 4 5 trillion market although upstart is rough around the edges at the moment it has the innovative capacity and ai powered platform to make financial institutions and its patient investors a whole lot richer
as the old saying goes a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step every investor had to get started somewhere the process can be intimidating and as the market s performance so far in 2022 reminds us it s quite possible for stocks to go down as well as up that makes it even tougher for those who haven t yet taken the leap of faith it takes to put hard earned cash at risk in the market in the hopes of stronger future returns still even with the market s recent trends it s hard to argue against the long term wealth building potential that stocks have with those perspectives in mind we asked three experienced investors to make a selection appropriate for new investors to consider they picked starbucks sbux 0 29 mcdonald s mcd 0 43 and the vanguard total stock market index etf vti 1 23 read on to find out why and decide for yourself if any of them might be worth using to take those all important first steps on the lifetime journey of investing a company with a straightforward business that commands a premium price eric volkman starbucks for me a good beginner stock should be a company familiar to investors ideally to the general public too its business should be more or less easy to understand plus as with any worthwhile investment the company behind it should be profitable and have solid potential for growth finally it doesn t hurt if that company reliably pumps out a dividend starbucks is a company that satisfies all these criteria with years of aggressive expansion behind it the company is nearly ubiquitous in almost any american municipality of any size and also has a presence in select markets abroad the company s single minded mission in life is to sell coffee and to a lesser extent other beverages food and snacks its business strategy is to keep expanding in order to sell more coffee how s that for an easy to grasp business profile people just can t get enough starbucks even on a casual visit during off peak hours to most of the company s stores it s likely you ll encounter at least one regular customer lines at starbucks in airports and train stations often rival the ones at the check in counter or ticket window that high demand and the company s ever increasing footprint have put some real caffeinated zip into the fundamentals despite a hiccup in its fiscal 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic annual revenue has been on a determined march higher from just under 22 4 billion in fiscal 2017 to more than 29 billion four years later profitability is choppier but it s usually strong regardless in fiscal 2021 it was almost 4 2 billion for example starbucks even managed to squeeze out a few bucks in that covid weakened 2020 earning 928 million on the bottom line over this and next year meanwhile analysts are collectively expecting further growth in both revenue and net profit and there s that shareholder dividend starbucks currently pays 1 96 per share annually for a not bad yield of 2 5 starbucks is a fine entry stock for investors indeed it s not only a convenient spot to get your morning java fix mcdonald s has a long history of excellent performance parkev tatevosian mcdonald s one of my top stocks for new investors to buy is mcdonald s the international fast food chain is coming out of the pandemic reinvigorated revenue and profits are soaring while adjustments made during the pandemic could sustain those increases for several years more mcdonald s struggled at the pandemic s onset when government restrictions forced it to disallow guests from dining inside as a result revenue fell by 10 in 2020 management skillfully adapted to the new operating conditions by emphasizing digital sales customer orders for delivery pickup and drive thru exploded and mcdonald s revenue bounced higher by 21 in 2021 the expanding revenue flowed to the bottom line as mcdonald s reported a record 10 04 in earnings per share in 2021 that was a whopping 59 increase from the year before fortunately for potential investors these changes could be long lasting mcdonald s newly formed delivery capabilities expand the reach of each mcdonald s restaurant it could also increase the frequency of customer purchases whereas a customer may have previously only purchased mcdonald s on their commute to work they might add a weekend delivery order to the mix mcdonald s low cost menu items could also attract more customers as inflation forces households to prioritize getting more bang for their buck the good news is that new investors can buy this excellent stock at a fair price to earnings ratio of 26 7 that s roughly the average price mcdonald s has sold for in the previous five years a simple way to get stock market returns chuck saletta vanguard total stock market index etf one of the best strategies for beginning investors is also one of the simplest buy an index fund over the long haul you will get returns that come very close to the underlying index less a very modest fee in the case of the vanguard total stock market index etf that fee is a virtually invisible 0 03 the beauty of this approach is that over the long haul index investing quite frequently beats funds managed by wall street s best and brightest indeed warren buffett famously won a 1 million bet by betting that a simple index fund would outperform a basket of hand picked hedge funds over the course of a decade when it comes to the vanguard total stock market index etf the fund invests in a sampling that covers virtually every investible u s based company or in other words it aims to pretty much match the overall market of american businesses so if you re looking for a simple way to get returns virtually identical to the total american stock market this provides a great opportunity to do just that while nobody can guarantee what the market s total returns will be the fees that professional fund managers charge make it likely that over time and on average those pros will lose to index funds sure if you put in the effort uncover companies with incredible prospects and diversify your holdings appropriately you ve got a chance of beating the market by picking stocks on your own for a person who s new to investing however it s really hard to beat an index fund like this one get started now whether you want your first investment to be a well recognized everyday business like starbucks or mcdonald s or you want to take the straightforward indexing approach to virtually market matching returns it s important to take that first step to becoming an investor even if your first investment doesn t work out learning the process and becoming comfortable owning shares of businesses can get you on a long term wealth building path so make today the day you put your plan in place to start investing for your future
to get a sense of what a 40 year high inflation rate looks like south of the border stroll down martin luther king jr avenue in d c s historic anacostia neighbourhood and ask the locals about the

agriculture mario tama getty images the less processed a food item the higher their share he said a bottle of milk for example can return about half the retail price to the farmer the pandemic put a lot of demand on a limited supply as people stopped eating out and bought more groceries and that raised the overall cost of food production cryan said if demand grows rapidly it can be very tough to keep up food prices rise fast fall slowly profit driven markups are also likely a component in the price increases said barrett given the extent of market concentration in the food and grocery sectors

cleared by the food and drug administration fda for use in the hospital clinic or home setting however devices used by non professionals outside of a clinical setting and that can present serious health consequences like tablo are subject to heightened scrutiny by the fda including post market surveillance studies thus though cleared by the fda for sale tablo for use in the home setting was subject to additional studies the results of which could require additional applications for clearance and approvals and while performing further regulatory studies during the class period outset

that the united states spends the most on health care is unsurprising what s questionable is paying so much for the worst health care system amongst high income countries and being far behind many countries that could not be considered high income by any stretch of the imagination other than doing brilliantly at mammograms and seasonal flu vaccines the u s is found appalling not just canada and mexico but when the likes of chile saudi arabia india and dominica are ahead of us and we are in league with slovenia and lithuania it is time to blush what gives corruption or to put it in morbidity and mortality conference jargon corruption causing system failure fixing the system is imperative it is not particularly egregious if one ends up choosing an inept plumber it can be fatal innocently choosing a bad doctor there are laws of the land bylaws of health care facilities and a code of ethics for its practitioners all read principled and high minded yet the practitioners from the top down

mice the cheese the pharmaceutical and health insurance companies must turn a good profit for themselves and their investors which conflicts with their raison d etre it necessitates diverting health care dollars doled out as profits and bonuses while just in the recent past it was unconscionable not to prescribe copious amounts of pain medication at the whim of the patients thus enriching the pharma industry never mind the addiction epidemic that destroyed lives the current fad is to boot outpatients from hospitals as fast as possible because they recover better at home it helps the industry s cause to deny necessary procedures or delay them by ensnaring physicians in interminable processes to justify their treatment imagine a surgeon fileting patients indiscriminately causing complications and alarm there are mechanisms available to check his it usually is a his mayhem except doing so will deprive the hospital of the significant monetary gains from those misadventures in the guise of surgery if you were an astute businessperson which of the following steps makes sense following a modus operandi that a will generate million s b manage to just break even c leads to soaking in red choosing a makes one a good hospital administrator endears one in the eyes of the financial beneficiaries and results in generous bonuses for the fiscally prudent as a fiscally prudent administrator why would one kill the goose that lays the golden eggs far better to employ those quality control measures to show on paper that all is well or use them to upend those who rock the boat and endanger the windfall if you choose b your performance from a business perspective is lackluster and expect to be replaced by a star the star may be a cmo or ceo who blatantly demands at the peril of livelihood or financial setback to the hapless physician that patients be kept and referred within the particular hospital system even to the patients detriment so much for stark laws if you chose c you are out the door the problems of discrimination and cronyism are rife in u s health care we do not see it because we search for villains with horns on their heads we don t see the good neighbor the great dad the generous friend or the brilliant aunt we see the kindly doctor who treats our mother s heart condition and not that he refers patients to his friend who he knows is decidedly incompetent we don t see that he indiscriminately performs tests and procedures that serve no purpose other than to enrich him he is also confident about getting away with it because he and his friends always have he also does the hospital s bidding by pulling in line or ostracizing colleagues who stood up for their patient s welfare yet his own family would be referred to the ostracized there is nothing really to prevent birds of a feather from flocking together be they the well entrenched old boys clubs soft spoken and polite in the deep south or it s first generation immigrants in the midwest who have surreptitiously taken over the hospital in numeric strength causing the original natives to largely flee medical ghettos are thus created espousing tactics more in line with the mafia if there were any good left amongst the physicians or administrators they would adopt that old saying if you can t beat them join them so what is a principled physician to do if you attempt to bell the cat the cat eats you the answer in some ways is straightforward defang the cat for starters expel insurance companies from the stock market to remove at least one perverse incentive just as advertising cigarettes is banned disallow pharma from touting their wares to the public as if they were candy other than perhaps the german army of wwii there is no army in the world where the privates command the generals nor are the crucial logistical and administrative aspects outsourced to civilian mbas so that the generals and soldiers can do what they are meant to do fight they devise their own logistics and methods getting the requisite education and training to do so if anything is contracted out the contractors are accountable to their clients not turned into bosses therefore something is wrong with a system when highly qualified physicians are managed by high school graduates or those with less than stellar credentials why complain when those who are from the finance and assembly line tradition run health care exactly like that given the opportunity they would have done exactly the same to the military similar to the latter health care should promote from its own ranks the most competent and able physicians and nurses with unquestioned integrity who are untainted if we study good health care models the physicians are at the helm and in crucial roles rather than in token leadership positions the prevalent system generally enables physicians who are morally weak chameleonic in integrity and servile to the non medical administrators to be incorporated into the administration if led by those intent on feathering their caps and undermining their colleagues and profession we can only be led further into the abyss administrators collecting bonuses for making a profit should be outlawed in medicine with great power comes great responsibility in health care that should mean that if a physician is found guilty of malpractice and the hospital is found lacking in checking it the heads of the cmo ceo and associates must roll alongside the unsavory physician they automatically go if seen retaliating against a nurse physician or employee attempting to protect the patient and do the right thing during such moments suddenly the administration protests their innocence due to their lack of medical background or they scapegoat the doctor or nurse just a few bootings in such circumstances will wonderfully fortify wavering integrities just as the state grants licenses to practice the state or a transparently autonomous body should handle privileges at any hospital independent of the hospitals but with provisos reflecting their particular goals sounds heavy handed we are dealing with mere humans so not just self interest but conscious and unconscious biases prevail why else would blinded music auditions cause the percentage of female musicians to rise from 6 percent to 21 percent in highly ranked national symphony orchestras peer review companies as a business are no better than the health insurance and pharmaceutical companies he who pays the piper calls the tune and so peer review companies commonly do the hospitals bidding in whitewashing unnecessary complications imagine a judicial system where one side could pay off the judge do away with any peer review model where there is money to be made when it comes to our wealth the system works well enough we need not fear that someone might run away with the contents of our bank account when it comes to our health for many it is the luck of the draw between good treatment being injured by someone s greed or ending emphatically dead even as sickness and demise make possessing all the wealth in the world meaningless as amply demonstrated here in the u s throwing a lot of money at health care is not the solution all it does is create a free for all to make hay while the sun shines the few who walk the straight and narrow stick out like a sore thumb

in spite of it happening a week late and controversies arising about a number of funding issues the pennsylvania general assembly once again managed to pass a budget as always there was some good some bad and some ugly in the process perhaps the worst of the bad was the delay in passing the budget gave republican leadership an opportunity to rush through proposed constitutional amendments to potentially restrict access to abortions and voting among other bad ideas the continuing efforts of these legislators to try to usurp the authority of the other two branches of government is a grim reminder of the threat to democracy that exists in today s politics a surprising piece of good news was the inclusion in the budget of a new program the whole home repair initiative whole home repair is a response to a problem pennsylvania faces with its housing stock in the commonwealth s big metropolises medium sized cities and smaller boroughs the homes of many pennsylvanians are aging along with their residents whole home repair is particularly important for older pennsylvanians these are the individuals and families who are commonly referred to as house rich but cash poor many of them own their properties but struggle to get by on their social security benefit and if they are lucky a small pension the homes they live in are often in need of extensive repairs leaking pipes cracked ceilings and drafty windows are problematic for anyone but they can be especially burdensome to older homeowners who are physically unable to do the kinds of repairs they performed when they were younger but cannot afford the expense to pay someone to do them this is where the whole home repair program will make a difference a 125 million appropriation in the state budget will enable qualified homeowners to utilize up to 50 000 to have these repairs done it will enable these individuals and families to continue to live in the communities where they want to be instead of being forced to relocate likely to a communal living situation where because of their limited incomes they may soon exhaust all their resources creating and funding whole home repair acknowledges the demographic challenges facing the commonwealth and establishes an innovative way to address the question of where our older population will live with a solution that not only helps individuals but improves entire communities what may be the most shocking aspect of whole home repair to followers of the harrisburg political scene is it began as an initiative of a first term democratic state senator from philadelphia nikil saval and garnered bipartisan support whyy fm s report on the approval of the funds quotes republican sen dave argall who represents schuylkill county as noting any community that has faced economic distress needs this bill unfortunately there was not unanimous support for this initiative and it is where the ugly aspect of the budget debate and the pervasive atmosphere of self interest in the halls of the general assembly comes into the story despite being negotiated by the republican leadership the state budget did not win the approval of the entire republican caucus in the general assembly state sen john disanto r dauphin was one of those who voted against the final spending package in a news release announcing his opposition to the budget disanto specifically highlighted the whole home repair initiative as a particularly egregious example of excessive government spending he went on to refer to saval as an avowed democratic socialist legislator from philadelphia and claimed the program is an insult to the low income homeowner who has worked and saved for years to maintain their home disanto theoretically represents the city of harrisburg and other small economically stressed communities in dauphin and perry counties such as duncannon halifax and newport whose residents will benefit from the funding available through the whole home repair program it turns out disanto voted against the entire state budget a budget funding state government which employs a large number of the residents of his harrisburg based district and the chief reason he cites is the creation of a program to assist owners of older homes which he feels threatens to negatively impact the hefty bottom line of his company disanto s vote against the state budget epitomizes the ugly side of pennsylvania s state budget process our political system and many of the selfish individuals enmeshed in it the bright side is this time the darkness was defeated and pennsylvanians have a new innovative state initiative
menafn valuewalk the meteoric rise of the cannabis industry has seen the waning power of the prohibition era give way to multi state dispensaries sprawling cultivation operations and hi tech manufacturing facilities however one space remains off to a slow albeit deliberate start cannabinoid derived pharmaceuticals with just four fda approved cannabinoid pharmaceuticals on the market the cbd based anticonvulsant known as epidiolex and synthetic forms of thc marinol dronabinol syndros dronabinol and cesamet nabilone the space remains largely developmental or in the pre clinical trial phase get the full henry singleton series in pdf get the entire 4 part series on henry singleton in pdf save it to your desktop read it on your tablet or email to your colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more why investors with esg in mind might want to rethink investing in esg funds in 2021 the impact of environmental social and governance esg issues became of much greater importance for investors inflows into esg funds continued to increase last year with inflows for the first three quarters surpassing those recorded for all of 2020 which amounted to 51 1 billion by the end of 2021 inflows to esg funds read more however despite the slow move toward cannabinoid derived pharmaceuticals the space is poised to be the fastest growing sector in the entire industry market analysis from grandview research projects that the cannabinoid pharmaceutical space will grow from 943 5 million in 2021 to 68 billion in 2028 a massive compound annual growth rate of 104 3 this growth presupposes further regulatory movement on pre clinical and developmental cannabinoid medications to better understand the evolution of the cannabinoid derived pharmaceutical sector how it s developing and what it will take to realize the monumental growth that s predicted we spoke with dr sean hall founder and ceo of medlab clinicals ltd asx mdc 1 q what are cannabinoid derived pharmaceuticals and why is there such growth potential for the space 2 q given these benefits why does the overall pharmaceutical space remain so small as a share of the broader cannabis industry 3 q what have been the biggest challenges to pharmaceutical companies in developing clinical trial ready medications 4 q what are the biggest opportunities for disruption you see open to cannabinoid derived medications 5 q how is medlab moving forward in the next six months given these realities showq what are cannabinoid derived pharmaceuticals and why is there such growth potential for the space a cannabinoid derived pharmaceuticals are clinical grade medications targeting certain receptors in the endocannabinoid system ecs they have their roots in cannabis and are based on the compounds found in the plant although when we re talking about clinical environments it s really so far beyond the botanical products you can find in a dispensary these are clinically evaluated and proven medications made in alignment with strict regulatory standards and subject to extreme scrutiny they re intended for clinical environments in which patients are receiving treatment for chronic or life threatening diseases in short cannabinoid derived medications are about harnessing the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids and producing safe effective consistent drugs that can improve lives and research suggests there are many potential applications for cannabinoids when it comes to treating serious conditions q given these benefits why does the overall pharmaceutical space remain so small as a share of the broader cannabis industry a pharma is a little bit slow in our conversations there are still some concerns around the cannabis thing one concern that comes up quickly is the gray or black market these unregulated sales i get that but you can see the american market cleaning itself up they re well aware that historically the department of justice and food and drug administration fda have prosecuted for unsubstantiated health claims so we re seeing health based ctas removed from packaging that s all good in many ways and will help the space to grow fortunately there are already signs that the space is primed to really take off in the next couple of years everyone knows about the jazz pharmaceuticals plc nasdaq jazz acquisition of gw pharmaceuticals plc nasdaq gwph which was worth more than 7 billion and now pfizer inc nyse pfe is getting into cb1 antagonists and then there are small biotechs like us there s a lot of interest in the endocannabinoid system ecs and how it works q what have been the biggest challenges to pharmaceutical companies in developing clinical trial ready medications a attaining that precision and accuracy on a consistent basis over time is always going to be the key in gaining regulatory approval this is an evolution any biotech has to make if they want to gain approval for their products this is a high bar to hit and it takes years of research and development work to find the right formulations so you can imagine why pharma is a bit behind some of these other sectors in legal cannabis our firsthand experience speaks to the sort of trial and error you need to do in order to get your precision and consistency to the level the fda and other regulatory agencies around the world are going to demand we started in botanicals with a formula that was 97 categorized but in the regulatory world that s still a bit shy the feedback we received was to look at synthetics now we have a neat cbd that is 100 identifiable to plant and we have a drug master file for a neat dronabinol which is really unusual when you re working with neat synthetics the whole manufacturing cycle gets simpler a simpler manufacturing cycle makes it easier for regulatory agencies and also reduces final cost to the patient we re not talking gmp like or pharma grade that s all rubbish we re talking current gmp standards under the fda reaching that level is a challenge and only the biotechs that are committed to doing that and finding new ways to drive precision and accuracy are going to be the ones that survive long enough to realize the growth of the space the good news is despite the long runway the pharma sector has really strong outlooks for growth in the next few years q what are the biggest opportunities for disruption you see open to cannabinoid derived medications a i think we should shift the conversation into what final drug approvals look like and that s where cannabinoid derived medications represent effective treatments for conditions or symptoms that remain largely unaddressed right now for me the top of the list is central nervous system cns pain which directly relates to opioid abuse and the physician s push to prescribe less we have the nabilones but they aren t working we ve had them for years and they re not arresting the problem we need a new solution to come into place and you need small biotechs to take the risks needed to build new analgesics i think that s where some of the biggest growth opportunities exist right now and of course there is the mental health piece we ve seen such an explosion in occupational stress and burnout since the pandemic began and now with economic pressures on top of everything people are more worn down than ever promising research into the ability of cannabinoids like cbd to address stress and anxiety point toward a pharmaceutical solution that doesn t carry the same risks or challenges as benzodiazepines and antidepressants so that represents another big growth opportunity as well q how is medlab moving forward in the next six months given these realities a at medlab we have two synthetic cannabinoid based therapies both of which are delivered with our nanoparticle delivery platform nanocelle the first therapy called nanabis is a combination of cbd and thc intended for pain management and we re seeing that work particularly well for bone pain in cancer patients the other we call nanocbd which relies on a pure cbd synthetic intended for the management of occupational stress and burnout both of which have become ever more common in the wake of the covid 19 pandemic so recently we ve continued our rwe work here in australia and at the last report we had 1 100 australians under clinical obs a few hundred of them are past the six months point that s important because pharmaceutical drugs are predicated on two things from a regulatory point of view precision and accuracy we re working to understand the safety and sustainability of these drugs when we look at nanabis we can attest to safety after 12 months of everyday use and we can still show the benefit of reduction in pain and improvement in quality of life through the end of the calendar year we re expecting regulatory readouts primarily around chemical manufacturing and controls cmc we re also hoping to see more readouts as we move into the clinical programs i think regulatory feedback on those two cannabinoid programs will be key as we move through the remainder of 2022 on top of that we re working on a number of partnership agreements that should materialize during that time these are partners who intend to take the product to market should we obtain regulatory approval updated on jul 15 2022 12 09 pm

link new york cnn business netflix once a darling of wall street is suddenly on the ropes the streaming giant will report its second quarter earnings on tuesday and it s shaping up to be one of the most consequential moments in the 25 year history of the company netflix is having a terrible year in april the company reported that it had lost subscribers in the first quarter of 2022 the first time that had happened in any quarter for more than a decade netflix s stock subsequently burst into flames it s currently down about 70 so far this year wiping out billions of dollars in market value and the company laid off hundreds of employees the loss of subscribers wasn t the only problem that caused netflix nflx s world to be turned upside down like the kids on stranger things a weak outlook for the second quarter shocked investors netflix nflx predicted it would lose another 2 million in the spring whatever happens tuesday could reshape the future of the company as well as the entire streaming sector as goes netflix so goes streaming there will be hell to pay if they report a number that is significantly higher than the 2 million loss being thrown around andrew hare a senior vice president of research at magid told cnn business the streaming market has matured and saturated hare noted so investors will be asking what s next and where is the growth going to come from netflix is pinning its hopes on potential savior advertising the company announced wednesday that it will partner with microsoft on a new cheaper ad supported subscription plan despite reed hastings netflix s ceo being allergic to the idea for years advertising is now a major part of netflix s plans to boost revenue going forward the new tier will reportedly come before the end of 2022 but netflix admits its nascent ad business is in its very early days the company is also focusing on clamping down on password sharing and focusing on creating compelling content to help turn the tide but will any of that matter if tuesday s numbers are so lackluster that wall street fully turns its back on netflix once netflix becomes heavily undervalued by the market all bets are off hare said the streamer does have some things working in its favor however for starters it s still netflix the streaming leader with 221 6 million subscribers worldwide it s also reporting numbers in a marketplace that s presenting factors out of netflix s control such as soaring inflation so it has those excuses it can rely on to possibly soften the blow with investors investors will give them time to right the ship but they need to hear more solid plans about the path towards immediate growth hare said it s all about communicating how they are evolving the business to ensure they continue to win in streaming no one has the stomach for a business losing millions of subscribers every quarter wall street ceos grapple with the r word big banks kicked off earnings season last week placing executives in front of investors and members of the media for questioning the rapport was fairly predictable bank execs want to discuss things like net interest margin and credit reserve builds everyone else had one thing on their mind recession there s no denying that the economy is the story and investors believe that banking titans are co authors they want to know what happens next so here s what we ve gleamed so far about the state of the economy to come jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon geopolitical tension high inflation waning consumer confidence the uncertainty about how high rates have to go and the never before seen quantitative tightening and their effects on global liquidity combined with the war in ukraine and its harmful effect on global energy and food prices are very likely to have negative consequences on the global economy sometime down the road morgan stanley ceo james gorman we might head into some form of recession and i like many of others have tried to handicap it but we are frankly guessing at this stage but i think it s unlikely to be a deep and dramatic recession at least in the u s i think asia is a little behind it depends how covid rolls out and it s sort of reemerging a little bit in some countries and then europe is obviously is fighting the hardest right now because of the war in the ukraine because of the pressure on gas and gas prices and so on first republic bank ceo and founder jim herbert the fed has to play catch up they re behind and they re doing they re likely to do so pretty quickly so i think you re likely to see the recession is probably coming of some kind and it will stabilize a lot of the excesses i don t think that it s threatening overly to us i think we re in maybe the second or third inning of what s going to be required to get inflation under control that would be my personal opinion bny mellon president and ceo elect robin vince you ve all seen those charts the s p 500 had its worst first half performance in over 50 years 10 year treasury had the worst start to the year since the beginning of the index in the early 1970s and with 150 basis points in rate hikes this is the fastest tightening cycle over six months since the volcker era at the end of the 1970s underneath these headlines what we re seeing across our platforms is that investors are clearly rebalancing and de risking we re seeing asset reallocation from growth to value higher than expected cash balances and relatively shallow market liquidity making it harder for investors to move risk wells fargo ceo charles scharf you re really looking at a number of scenarios that you need to be thoughtful about and include in your modeling and for a number of quarters in a row we have had a significant weighting on the downside scenario already and some of those scenarios are pretty severe right and so you ve got weightings on what some might term wild recession more severe recessions so you could create a lot of labels for them but it s a number of scenarios that have different severities of downside citigroup ceo jane fraser while sentiment has shifted little of the data i see tells me the u s is on the cusp of a recession consumer spending remains well above pre covid levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress and as any employer will tell you the job market remains very tight i m just back from europe where it s a different story we expect a very difficult winter is coming and that s due to disruptions in the energy supply there is also increasing concern about second order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent and the mood is of course further darkened by the belief that the war in ukraine will not end anytime soon up next monday bank of

a view of apartments and buildings in seoul yonhap the government and the ruling party on sunday agreed to allow low priced home owners to replace their floating rate based borrowing with fixed ones as part of efforts to help ease their financial burden amid fast rising borrowing costs the decision was made at a policy consultation meeting between the government and the people power party ppp as the central bank s recent swift and sharp rate hikes have resulted in a spike in interest payment burden on many people who have bought homes with borrowed money we shared the view that top priority should be put on the stability of prices and livelihoods a ppp spokesperson said after the policy meeting in a related move they agreed to allow people owning homes valued below 400 million won 301 640 to replace their borrowing based on floating rates with fixed ones starting in september as part of efforts to ease burdens from interest payments the spokesperson said the ppp proposed around 4 percent as a fixed interest rate as an option for those homeowners though details such as the home price ceiling for determining the change in borrowing arrangements and others remain subject to the government s internal discussion according to the spokesperson borrowing costs have been rapidly mounting as banks have raised lending rates in tandem with the recent push by the bank of korea bok to hike its policy rate aimed at reining in fast rising inflation pressure last week the bok delivered its first ever big step half point rate increase which also marked the sixth increase in the cost of borrowing since august last year many homebuyers had taken out loans on a floating rate borrowing arrangement as banks lending rates had long been maintained at record lows to shore up the pandemic hit economy the bok s aggressive monetary tightening however has raised their interest paying burden faster than those who borrowed money on fixed rates the government and the ruling party also discussed issues related to recent financial market conditions and shared the view that it is necessary to push for a currency swap channel with the united states saying it will serve as a brake that could forestall a further decline in the local currency s value korea and the u s had maintained a 60 billion currency swap deal under which seoul could borrow dollars in exchange for its local currency a scheme intended to assuage market anxiety possibly caused by dollar crunch but the temporary deal expired at the end of last year as scheduled amid relatively stabilized market conditions but the won has lost much ground since the start of this year on rising concerns over a global recession and mounting aversion to risky assets which have raised the need for the reopening of the swap channel to stabilize local financial markets speculations have arisen that the two countries could discuss the reopening of a currency swap line as u s treasury secretary janet yellen will visit south korea this week and meet with key financial and economic policymakers last week bok gov rhee chang yong told reporters yellen will likely hold discussions with south korean officials on various measures for foreign exchange market stabilization yonhap
time to crack down on financial fraud more sternly last thursday the supreme court finalized a 40 year sentence for the principal offender in a case of financial fraud amounting to about 1 35 trillion won 1 01 billion the top court also upheld the appellate court s verdict on ceo kim jae hyun of optimus asset management confirming its orders of forfeiture of 75 2 billion won and a fine of 500 million won given that kim is in his early 50s the ruling has effectively isolated him from society for good the decision may not heal the wounds of 3 200 victims who suffered enormous economic and non economic damages however it should send a stern warning to many economic criminals kim and his accomplices raised 1 352 6 billion won from 2018 to 2020 allegedly promising to invest the money in low risk assets involving public organizations however they spent it on risky assets or refunding investors eventually failing to return at least 554 2 billion won to clients many advanced countries including the united states punish white collar crimes especially those of financial fraud more severely than other offenses in contrast there have been constant complaints in korea about lenience on economic crimes financial fraudsters who manipulate stock prices or lure investors into ponzi schemes usually serve brief jail terms and live comfortably with the proceeds of their crimes that they have secretly hoarded away financial crimes destroy individuals lives and disrupt capital market order with this incident the law enforcement authorities must reaffirm their zero tolerance principle on economic crimes it is in this regard encouraging that the new government has recently revived a joint securities crime investigation squad the team should start by getting to the bottom of the alleged involvement of some political and financial bigwigs in the previous administration in this financial scandal equally problematic the former moon jae in administration held financial firms excessively accountable without taking equivalent steps on financial regulators financial companies responsible for fund sales on behalf of optimus had to pay back 100 percent of investment principal to clients however the measure unduly compromised the investors principle of self responsibility all this shows why the law enforcement authorities have a long way to go before dissolving all suspicions concerning this kind of fraud even after the top court s final decision

dr kennedy k amofa for the past century we have faced numerous challenges such as geopolitical conflicts war famine climate crises global financial market turmoil epidemics and natural disasters to mention just a few with all these environmental uncertainties most businesses including for profit and nonprofit thrive on overcoming all these problems to create value in the global market the emergence of social enterprise initiatives will provide unique opportunities to resolve the numerous social problems affecting life expectations worldwide it is noteworthy that adam smith s publishing of the wealth of nations in 1776 marked the birth of modern capitalism and the economics of the free market to help allocate resources automatically toward the most valued ends the philosophy of conscious capitalism is to create value for all stakeholders which could be seen as wealth creation to improve social life by lifting people out of poverty and starvation however it is fair to say that global businesses cannot solve all the ever increasing world problems for the past two decades business leaders have been more conscious about providing philanthropic responsibilities to enhance the well being of the entire society the strategic philanthropic activities extend beyond altruism to enhance corporate image and add value to shareholders a good example is starbucks providing microloans to help sustain the livelihood of poor farmers in south america however out of necessity businesses are continually reducing the budget for philanthropic responsibilities due to economic difficulties negatively impacting society the global community is the largest society where people from various countries experience many problems including lack of food poverty health and sanitation issues and even many other basic needs of ordinary people additionally modern society faces several threats such as natural calamities pollution robbery corruption violence and many more a non governmental organization ngo serves as a voluntary group or institution with a social mission that operates independently from the government ngos or similar organizations exist in all parts of the world and play an important role in society in helping the needy a notable example is the world central kitchen a not for profit ngo devoted to providing meals in the wake of natural disasters founded in 2010 by celebrity chef jose andre s the organization prepared food in haiti following its devastating earthquake it is now partnering with the local ngos in ukraine to provide hot meals to the citizens devastated by the war with russia nevertheless ngos are currently overwhelmed with numerous challenges to the point that their contributions to society fall short of expectations fortunately social entrepreneurship presents one of the prominent responses to fulfilling unmet individual and societal needs social entrepreneurs are crucial in providing sustainable solutions to these pressing issues social entrepreneurs exhibit good moral judgment empathy self efficacy and social support due to their prior experience in facing and addressing social issues with advanced technology individuals and organizations can either start a new venture or scale existing operations with a strategic global alliance to tackle the fundamental problems facing the existence of humanity with the internet finalizing strategic partnerships to scale operations to touch more lives is much easier the internet is a vital tool to help recruit local international volunteers and raise capital through crowdsourcing mobile money technology consists of an electronic wallet service that enables users to deposit transfer and receive money using their mobile devices this process has helped improve life in most developing continents including africa the point of the matter here is that the emerging technologies could help advance the course of social enterprise to give hope to the marginalized people in the world social enterprise leaders can explore mobile money technology to expand access to financial services in low resource environments with the mobile phone users can transfer money quickly at a low cost without access to an existing banking account from a financial institution additionally they could raise capital to finance business operations globally with the following financial systems gofundme justgiving indiegogo patreon crowdrise cash app and zelle the current geopolitical conflicts in europe and other parts of the world such as yemen syria and afghanistan have resulted in serious humanitarian crises that include refugees and food shortages aside from considering the impact on the global economy moreover considering dangerous pathogens facing the global health system such as covid 19 there is the need for everyone to answer the divine calling to use advanced technology to either start or scale social enterprise to enhance the livelihood of humanity around the

not so long ago america s next covid fall looked almost tidy sure cases might rise as the weather chills and dries and people flock indoors but pfizer and moderna were already cooking up america s very first retooled covid vaccines better matched to omicron and its offshoots and a new inoculation campaign was brewing instead of needing to dose up three four even five times within short order perhaps americans could get just one covid shot each year matched roughly to the season s circulating strains fall 2022 seemed the first opportunity to routinize covid vaccines says nirav shah the director of the maine center for disease control and prevention and simultaneously recharge the country s waning enthusiasm for shots read this fall will be a vaccination reboot now that fall is officially 10 weeks away that once sunny forecast is looking cloudier the biden administration could soon offer second booster shots to all adults an amuse bouche apparently for fall s omicron focused vaccines which may not debut until october at the earliest by which time ba 5 may be long gone and potentially too late to forestall a cold weather surge in april the fda s leaders seemed ready to rally around a fall reboot in a statement last month peter marks the director of the agency s center for biologics evaluation and research struck a more dispirited tone the coming autumn would be just a transitional period he said which checks out given the nation s current timetable i see this fall shaping up to be more incremental says jason schwartz a vaccine policy expert at yale rather than that fresh start of let s begin again this perhaps is not where experts thought we d be a year and a half ago when the vaccines were fresh and in absurdly high demand since then the tale of the u s s covid immunity has taken on a tragicomic twist first we needed a vaccine then we needed more people to take it now the problem is both yes fall s vaccine recipe seems set but much more needs to happen before the nation can be served a full immunization entrée it s july and we just heard that the fda would like to see a bivalent vaccine with the spike of ba 4 and ba 5 mixed with that of the og sars cov 2 schwartz told me when exactly will the updated shots be ready how effective will they be how many doses will be available we just started prepping for this new inoculation course and are somehow already behind then once shots are nigh what will be the plan who will be allowed to get one and how many people actually will right now america s appetite for more shots is low which could herald yet another round of lackluster uptake there s little time to address these issues fall is like tomorrow says jacinda abdul mutakabbir an infectious disease pharmacist at loma linda university in california autumn the season of viral illnesses and packed hospitals already puts infectious disease experts on edge we dread fall and winter season here says yvonne maldonado a pediatric infectious disease specialist at stanford university the system has little slack for more logistical mayhem the world s third covid autumn far from a stable picture of viral control is starting to resemble a barely better sequel to the uncoordinated messes of 2020 and 2021 the coming rollout may be one of america s most difficult yet because instead of dealing with this country s vaccination problems we re playing our failures on loop in an ideal version of this fall revamped covid vaccines might have been doled out alongside flu shots starting as early as august or september to prelude a probable end of year surge but that notion may have always been doomed at an fda advisory meeting in early april marks told experts that the fall vaccine s composition should be decided no later than june the agency didn t announce the new ingredients until the final day of last month and it chose to include ba 4 and ba 5 the reigning omicron subvariant rather than the long gone ba 1 which pfizer and moderna had been working with that decision may further delay the shots premiere punting the delivery of some doses into november december or even later depending on how the coming months go if the goal is preventing a spate of seasonal sickness that s cutting it quite close says wilbur chen an infectious disease physician and vaccine expert at the university of maryland whenever the shots do appear they could once again be hard to keep in stock coronavirus funds are still still stalled in congressional purgatory and may never make it out although the biden administration has agreed to purchase more than 100 million doses of pfizer s revamped omicron vaccine for the months ahead federal officials remain worried that as ashish jha the nation s top covid response coordinator has said we re not going to have enough vaccines for every adult who wants one this fall meanwhile state and local leaders are awaiting marching orders on how much vaccine they ll be getting and who will be eligible for boosters intel they may not receive until after the updated shots are authorized with a year and a half of experience under their belts health workers know how to roll out covid shots says chrissie juliano the executive director of the big cities health coalition but distribution could still get tangled if we re back to a situation of scarcity she told me the government may allocate shots based on states populations or it could opt to dole out more doses to the regions with the highest vaccination rates wasting fewer shots perhaps but widening gaps in protection more than two years into the pandemic with the health care system under constant strain and staff exhausted or frequently out sick local communities across the nation may not have enough capacity to deploy fall shots en masse in particular pharmacies a vaccination mainstay will need to handle a simultaneous surge in demand for flu and covid shots amid a serious nationwide staffing shortage michael hogue the dean of loma linda university s pharmacy school told me a lack of funding only compounds these problems by making it harder for instance to get doses to people who aren t insured for that reason alone some of the contractors we ve used in the past have not been able to keep up the same services including vaccination drive throughs phil huang the director of dallas county health and human services told me in douglas county nebraska pop up vaccination sites are closing because not enough nurses can staff them how do you get people vaccinated lindsay huse the county s health director asked me when nobody wants to work for what you re paying or they re just burned out even if more resources free up greater shot availability may not translate to greater protection less than half of eligible vaccinated americans and less than a third of all americans have received a first booster dose a pattern of attrition that experts don t expect to massively improve and just how much of an immunity boost the updated shot will offer is still unclear when the fda recommended including ba 4 5 s spike it had limited data on the proposed recipe collected in mice by pfizer s scientists and pfizer and moderna won t have time to generate rock solid efficacy data in humans before the shots are authorized then roll out in the fall so when we get these vaccines cranking off the assembly line the case public health officials may be able to make will be tempered schwartz told me that these doses will offer big improvements on their predecessors is a decent bet but believing that will for the public require a small leap of faith at a time when americans trust in public health is already low america has had its share of covid vaccination victories hundreds of millions of people have gotten at least one dose distribution and administration have been streamlined communities have come together to bring shots to people in all sorts of venues the local experts i spoke with felt confident that they d rise to the challenge of this autumn too but if the shots themselves are not in demand an infusion of supply side resources alone won t be enough read america created its own booster problems with two years of data on covid vaccines safety and efficacy the case for dosing up has only strengthened scientifically but the public s interest and trust in the shots has fallen off as recommendations have shifted often chaotically and the number of necessary shots has ballooned even americans who lined up for their first doses are now over the idea of rolling up their sleeves again abdul mutakabbir hears often i got the two doses that s what you told me i needed to do i m not doing anything else in camden county new jersey a team led by paschal nwako the region s health officer has knocked on doors given out freebies and gift cards visited people in all areas grocery stores shops restaurants schools churches shows he told me we have exhausted all the playbooks still people have refused the shifting culture around covid in the u s has undoubtedly played a role we don t have the same sense of desperation that we did in december of 2020 maldonado of stanford told me americans are eager to put the pandemic behind them and boosters are a tough sell in a nation that has dispensed with nearly all other covid prevention measures and where political leaders are triumphantly declaring victory we start talking about covid and people s eyes glaze over says nathan chomilo a pediatrician and health equity advocate in minnesota the messaging will have to be fundamentally different even than last year s conversation about boosters read don t wait to get your kid vaccinated when the vaccines were fresh the popular narratives were tantalizing the shots could permanently stop transmission in its tracks but that was probably never going to pan out says luciana borio the fda s former acting chief scientist everybody that worked in the vaccine space she told me knew that the safeguards against infection were not going to last their voices did not get listened to instead the more appealing story took root setting expectations that could not be sustained disappointment ensued fracturing public faith mis and disinformation seeped into the cracks and no one including the nation s leaders was able to offer a compelling enough counternarrative to put the matter to rest an upgraded shot could be enticing to some pandemic weary folks i know a lot of people including my family members who say if it s the same vaccine why would i have to get it nwako told me they want something different chomilo suggested that it may also be wise to stop counting how many shots people have gotten i hope no one 15 years from now is saying i m on my 15th booster but nothing about these new vaccines promises to unify americans around the why of covid vaccines at april s advisory meeting marks said the fda knew that the u s s current vaccination strategy couldn t go on forever we simply can t be boosting people as frequently as we are he said and yet the nation s leaders now seem keen on okaying another round of original recipe shots for adults under 50 without emphasizing other tactics to lower transmission rates getting covid shots too can be a chore with so many brands doses schedules and eligibility requirements in the matrix it s the most complex vaccine we have says erik hernandez the system director of clinical pharmacy services at the university of pittsburgh medical center the fall will introduce even more snarls boosters are switching to an omicron blend but contrary to what the fda had initially planned primary series shots will be sticking with the original recipe that has massive operational implications maine cdc s shah said and could increase the risk of errors nor have federal officials offered clarity on how long people getting shots now will have to wait before they re eligible for yet another this autumn and loma linda university s hogue thinks that it s very unlikely that children especially the youngest ones will be greenlit for bespoke omicron doses this fall another caveat to juggle some experts also worry that different states will once again select different rules on who can sign up for shots first you almost have to have a computer algorithm to figure out what shots you need chen of the university of maryland told me recommending an updated dose for everyone at once could be less confusing but if shots are truly scarce broad eligibility could simply put the privileged at the front of the queue read vaccines are still mostly blocking severe disease less funding already means less community outreach and less support for the people most vulnerable to covid s worst the country could easily default back to many of the failures of equity it s rehearsed before abdul mutakabbir who s the lead clinician and pharmacist for the covid 19 equitable mobile vaccination clinics serving black and latino communities in san bernardino county says she s very nervous that large swaths of the country will once again end up in this place where people of minority groups are going to be those that suffer and people of lower socioeconomic status are going to be those that suffer an infusion of dollars would allow the government to purchase more vaccines it would furnish states with the funds to hire more workers expand their community clinics and reach people who might otherwise never get their shots but the underlying issue remains the u s does not have a strong coordinated vaccination plan experts still can t agree on how many shots people need how often we ll need to update them even what the purpose of a covid vaccination should be stopping just severe disease and death blocking as much infection as possible we don t really have a grand unified theory of what we re doing when we vaccinate shah told me at least not one that s been properly messaged a deficit that will keep hamstringing the country s immunization efforts without a clear plan this fall contra marks s prediction may actually be a definitive one for covid vaccines just not in the way that the nation s leaders once hoped a bad precedent too could be set and make americans trust in these shots and the people who offer them even tougher to recoup

these energy sector players are well positioned to benefit from the global green energy transition over the last 50 years stocks that paid dividends have as a class outperformed stocks that didn t the best total returns for investors came from companies that had higher payout ratios and thus higher dividend yields and also steadily increased their payouts over time so for investors who hope to build generational wealth high yielding dividend growth stocks are among the best options three such stocks that our contributors think will produce great returns in years to come are the southern company so 0 49 brookfield renewable bepc 1 57 bep 2 52 and nextera energy partners nep 1 74 buy this utility and reinvest the dividends reuben gregg brewer the southern company investors often focus too much attention on price appreciation when evaluating investments but over time dividends have accounted for around a third of the broader market s total returns and dividends provide stability as well giving you something to look at other than stock prices when the market is in turmoil so why not pick up some shares of a company that has held its dividend steady or increased it annually for more than 75 consecutive years the southern company one of the largest electric and natural gas utilities in the united states is currently offering a yield of about 3 8 while that s not huge it is well above the yield that the s p 500 index is delivering and is notably better than the average utility s 2 7 yield based on the vanguard utilities index etf as a proxy and then there s that incredible dividend streak that you can build on by letting the dividends automatically reinvest and compound over time the only major negative with this stock is that the southern company is currently constructing a pair of nuclear power plants that are delayed and over budget however they are now expected to be complete by the end of next year once they re online that headwind will turn into a tailwind as the utility will get to include two reliable baseload power sources that emit zero carbon that s right in line with the current environmental zeitgeist and should position the company and its shareholders well for future dividend growth an unparalleled opportunity matt dilallo brookfield renewable humanity needs to dramatically reduce its carbon emissions to avoid the worst potential impacts of climate change according to one estimate full decarbonization of the global economy will require investments of more than 150 trillion over the next 30 years that offers unparalleled commercial opportunities for companies focused on decarbonization one of the early leaders in capitalizing on the decarbonization megatrend is brookfield renewable it operates a globally diversified portfolio of renewable energy operations it currently has 21 gigawatts gw of clean power production capacity enough to power the city of london with emission free energy meanwhile it has another 69 gw of renewable energy assets in development which will prevent carbon emissions equivalent to new york city s brookfield estimates that its development projects will help grow its cash flow per share by 3 to 5 annually add in inflation driven annual rate escalations on its current power contracts and its ability to secure higher rates for power as its existing agreements expire and brookfield expects to be able to organically grow its cash flow per share by 6 to 11 per year that will easily support the company s plan to expand its dividend by 5 to 9 per year on top of that brookfield sees the potential to add up to another 9 to its bottom line each year by making acquisitions that s up to 20 annual growth on top of a steadily rising dividend that at the current share price yields 3 6 that s the type of total return profile that can produce lasting wealth a stock with huge growth potential neha chamaria nextera energy partners companies that pay regular generous and growing dividends can reward shareholders richly in the long term especially if their management teams prioritize shareholder returns nextera energy partners is one such company investors who bought shares of nextera energy partners when it debuted on the new york stock exchange in 2014 and held on have seen those shares more than double their value since and those who reinvested their dividends all along have made a lot more because the company has increased its dividend every quarter since 2014 its annualized dividends grew by almost 300 through the fourth quarter of 2021 while past performance doesn t guarantee future results investors who buy and hold nextera energy partners stock and reinvest their dividends are likely to mint money over the long run there are two reasons why first is the growth potential in the company s business nextera energy partners owns one of the world s largest clean energy portfolios with a focus on wind and solar energy to grow the company can acquire assets from its sponsor nextera energy nee 0 52 or other third parties with countries around the globe working to transition from fossil fuels to clean energy the opportunities are huge and nextera energy is already the world s largest producer of wind and solar energy second since these are contracted assets nextera energy partners can expect to generate steady cash flows and pay generous dividends right now it aims to increase its payouts by 12 to 15 annually through 2025 and i strongly expect that pattern to continue beyond that all of that combined with its already high yield at the current share price about 3 8 makes nextera energy partners the kind of stock that could help you build long lasting wealth for your family
these companies are growing rapidly in spite of macroeconomic headwinds fearing high inflation many investors have tried to recession proof their portfolios by ditching risky assets like growth stocks even so the s p 500 growth index is still up 82 over the past five years easily beating the 59 return of the broader s p 500 better yet the current bear market means that many high quality growth stocks are trading at a discount to their historical valuations that creates a buying opportunity for patient investors here are two growth stocks with monster potential 1 mercadolibre mercadolibre meli 1 96 has revolutionized commerce and payments in latin america the company operates the largest online marketplace in the region as measured by unique visitors and page views and it has reinforced its leadership position with an ecosystem of value added services most notably a large portion of the latin american population lacks access to a bank account or debit card but mercadolibre has helped democratize digital payments in the region with its fintech platform mercado pago the company also provides solutions for financing advertising and logistics and each of those services makes its marketplace a more compelling option for merchants in turn mercadolibre wields a certain degree of pricing power its commerce take rate commerce revenue as a percentage of gross merchandise volume hit 16 7 in the last quarter up from 15 in the prior year similarly its fintech take rate hit 3 8 the last quarter up from 3 2 in the prior year financially mercadolibre is growing rapidly despite high inflation in latin america revenue soared 69 to 7 9 billion in the past year and the company posted a gaap profit of 3 67 per diluted share up from a loss of 0 31 per diluted share in the prior year mercadolibre is well positioned to maintain that momentum forecasts from statista suggest that e commerce sales across the markets mercadolibre operates in will total 260 billion by 2025 similarly digital payment volume across these markets will total 470 billion by 2026 that gives the company a massive market opportunity and with shares trading at 4 1 times sales near their cheapest valuation in the last decade this monster growth stock is a screaming buy now 2 crowdstrike holdings cybercriminals are getting more creative a recent survey suggests that 45 of organizations experienced at least one software supply chain attack last year up from 32 in 2018 a software supply chain attack is a type of cyberattack that targets upstream software suppliers as a means of infecting downstream customers the solarwinds breach is a perfect example by injecting malicious code into solarwinds orion platform software hackers were able to infect 18 000 different customers in the wake of that event and many others effective cybersecurity has become a priority for many organizations on that note crowdstrike crwd 3 09 is the gold standard in endpoint device security the company led the industry with 14 2 market share last year up from 7 9 in 2019 those market share gains have translated into strong financial results but the company s leadership status is a key advantage for two other reasons as well first it means crowdstrike handles lots of data about 1 trillion security signals each day which theoretically makes its artificial intelligence models uniquely effective in identifying and preventing threats second it means crowdstrike is well positioned to attract new customers and expand its relationship with existing ones with its significant brand authority better yet the company is executing on that opportunity crowdstrike offers 22 different software modules that span several verticals of the cybersecurity industry and momentum is building in areas like cloud workload protection identity protection and managed services to that end its customer count jumped 57 in the past year and 71 of those customers now use at least four software modules up from 64 in the prior year in turn revenue skyrocketed 64 to 1 6 billion and free cash flow climbed 49 to 481 million shareholders have good reason to be bullish management puts its opportunity at 71 billion by 2024 meaning crowdstrike has only realized a small fraction of its addressable market and the company believes its product roadmap and future initiatives could boost that figure to 126 billion by 2025 that gives this growth stock monster potential currently shares trade at 24 5 times sales not cheap but much cheaper than the three year average of 37 9 for that reason investors should consider buying a few shares now

agreements falling through at some of the fastest rates ever that one piece of data hardly paints the whole picture of what it s like to be a publicly traded homebuilder in america today despite the scary sounding news homebuilders remain in a strong position to continue to both grow and thrive considering that the country is still short by millions of housing units relative to its needs the

netflix unofficially kicks off q2 earnings season for the beaten down tech industry a friday rebound wasn t enough to put stocks into positive territory last week as both the dow jones industrial average dji 0 65 and the s p 500 gspc 1 20 shed less than 1 the indexes are off their lows for the year but remain in deeply negative territory so far in 2022 second quarter earnings season might accelerate those declines or lessen them if good news arrives about consumer spending in the face of inflation with that in mind let s look at three big reports on the way this week from netflix nflx 2 52 domino s dpz 1 47 and boston beer sam 1 69 1 subscriber losses at netflix netflix shocked wall street with its last earnings report and sent the wider tech market reeling expectations aren t much better ahead of this tuesday s upcoming report the streaming video giant is expecting to report subscriber losses of around 2 million to easily mark its worst growth quarter since pivoting to its original and exclusive content strategy more than 10 years ago part of that slump can be blamed on a growth hangover following booming gains in 2020 and 2021 but netflix is also losing market share to cheaper priced rivals that have flooded the market lately in response to that shift look for co ceo reed hastings and his team to talk up their new ad supported selling model that s currently being developed we ll also learn on tuesday whether the new season of stranger things helped persuade more users to stick with the platform with help from netflix s staggered content release schedule that pushed the finale into the start of fiscal q3 2 sales volumes at domino s demand for home delivery has rarely been higher but domino s is struggling to remain on top of that expanding market the pizza delivery leader said in its last report that sales fell in the u s market for only the second time in the past decade in part because of soaring competition in the space thursday s earnings report will show whether domino s has returned to its steady growth profile now that comparisons are getting easier with the prior year period the fast food chain is still among the most efficient in the industry thanks to its relatively small stores that focus on to go and takeaway orders the stock might begin recovering if sales trends stabilize but those improved growth trends will need to be paired with steady profitability and continued positive cash flow for investors to really feel comfortable that the business is back on firmer footing following a post pandemic slump in early 2022 3 seltzer sales at boston beer wall street hasn t been kind to boston beer s stock this year even compared with peers such as constellation brands that s mainly because the beer giant was far more exposed to the hard seltzer niche which has fallen out of favor following a demand surge in earlier phases of the pandemic boston beer noted a 7 drop in depletions a measure of consumer sales in its last report in late april this thursday s update should show improving trends as management is targeting a return to growth for the full 2022 year but that annual forecast could receive a big update this week reflecting the latest sales for the truly franchise boston beer is also predicting a big hit to its profitability as it continues to adjust to a tougher selling environment the stock isn t likely to get back into wall street s good graces until that gross profit margin trend begins recovering perhaps by late 2022

as the old saying goes a journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step every investor had to get started somewhere the process can be intimidating and as the market s performance so far in 2022 reminds us it s quite possible for stocks to go down as well as up that makes it even tougher for those who haven t yet taken the leap of faith it takes to put hard earned cash at risk in the market in the hopes of stronger future returns still even with the market s recent trends it s hard to argue against the long term wealth building potential that stocks have with those perspectives in mind we asked three experienced investors to make a selection appropriate for new investors to consider they picked starbucks sbux 0 29 mcdonald s mcd 0 43 and the vanguard total stock market index etf vti 1 23 read on to find out why and decide for yourself if any of them might be worth using to take those all important first steps on the lifetime journey of investing a company with a straightforward business that commands a premium price eric volkman starbucks for me a good beginner stock should be a company familiar to investors ideally to the general public too its business should be more or less easy to understand plus as with any worthwhile investment the company behind it should be profitable and have solid potential for growth finally it doesn t hurt if that company reliably pumps out a dividend starbucks is a company that satisfies all these criteria with years of aggressive expansion behind it the company is nearly ubiquitous in almost any american municipality of any size and also has a presence in select markets abroad the company s single minded mission in life is to sell coffee and to a lesser extent other beverages food and snacks its business strategy is to keep expanding in order to sell more coffee how s that for an easy to grasp business profile people just can t get enough starbucks even on a casual visit during off peak hours to most of the company s stores it s likely you ll encounter at least one regular customer lines at starbucks in airports and train stations often rival the ones at the check in counter or ticket window that high demand and the company s ever increasing footprint have put some real caffeinated zip into the fundamentals despite a hiccup in its fiscal 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic annual revenue has been on a determined march higher from just under 22 4 billion in fiscal 2017 to more than 29 billion four years later profitability is choppier but it s usually strong regardless in fiscal 2021 it was almost 4 2 billion for example starbucks even managed to squeeze out a few bucks in that covid weakened 2020 earning 928 million on the bottom line over this and next year meanwhile analysts are collectively expecting further growth in both revenue and net profit and there s that shareholder dividend starbucks currently pays 1 96 per share annually for a not bad yield of 2 5 starbucks is a fine entry stock for investors indeed it s not only a convenient spot to get your morning java fix mcdonald s has a long history of excellent performance parkev tatevosian mcdonald s one of my top stocks for new investors to buy is mcdonald s the international fast food chain is coming out of the pandemic reinvigorated revenue and profits are soaring while adjustments made during the pandemic could sustain those increases for several years more mcdonald s struggled at the pandemic s onset when government restrictions forced it to disallow guests from dining inside as a result revenue fell by 10 in 2020 management skillfully adapted to the new operating conditions by emphasizing digital sales customer orders for delivery pickup and drive thru exploded and mcdonald s revenue bounced higher by 21 in 2021 the expanding revenue flowed to the bottom line as mcdonald s reported a record 10 04 in earnings per share in 2021 that was a whopping 59 increase from the year before fortunately for potential investors these changes could be long lasting mcdonald s newly formed delivery capabilities expand the reach of each mcdonald s restaurant it could also increase the frequency of customer purchases whereas a customer may have previously only purchased mcdonald s on their commute to work they might add a weekend delivery order to the mix mcdonald s low cost menu items could also attract more customers as inflation forces households to prioritize getting more bang for their buck the good news is that new investors can buy this excellent stock at a fair price to earnings ratio of 26 7 that s roughly the average price mcdonald s has sold for in the previous five years a simple way to get stock market returns chuck saletta vanguard total stock market index etf one of the best strategies for beginning investors is also one of the simplest buy an index fund over the long haul you will get returns that come very close to the underlying index less a very modest fee in the case of the vanguard total stock market index etf that fee is a virtually invisible 0 03 the beauty of this approach is that over the long haul index investing quite frequently beats funds managed by wall street s best and brightest indeed warren buffett famously won a 1 million bet by betting that a simple index fund would outperform a basket of hand picked hedge funds over the course of a decade when it comes to the vanguard total stock market index etf the fund invests in a sampling that covers virtually every investible u s based company or in other words it aims to pretty much match the overall market of american businesses so if you re looking for a simple way to get returns virtually identical to the total american stock market this provides a great opportunity to do just that while nobody can guarantee what the market s total returns will be the fees that professional fund managers charge make it likely that over time and on average those pros will lose to index funds sure if you put in the effort uncover companies with incredible prospects and diversify your holdings appropriately you ve got a chance of beating the market by picking stocks on your own for a person who s new to investing however it s really hard to beat an index fund like this one get started now whether you want your first investment to be a well recognized everyday business like starbucks or mcdonald s or you want to take the straightforward indexing approach to virtually market matching returns it s important to take that first step to becoming an investor even if your first investment doesn t work out learning the process and becoming comfortable owning shares of businesses can get you on a long term wealth building path so make today the day you put your plan in place to start investing for your future
investing in equal parts of these three industry leading businesses provides a dividend yield above 3 during periods of heightened stock market volatility it can be hard to stop thinking about your portfolio one tried and true method of taking the pressure off your investments this summer is finding quality businesses that use the strength of their earnings growth to support dividend raises year after year dividend aristocrats are an elite tier of s p 500 components that have paid and raised their dividends for at least 25 consecutive years emerson electric emr 0 79 caterpillar cat 0 47 and exxonmobil xom 0 57 stand out as three great buys now here s why a dividend aristocrat with plenty of long term growth potential lee samaha emerson electric rightly or wrongly some companies get labeled in specific ways in the case of emerson electric it s sometimes that industrial company whose prospects are tied to the energy markets in a sense that s understandable after all emerson s automation solutions products services and software for heavy industries process automation the processing of raw materials have significant exposure to energy spending that said only around 11 of the company s overall sales go to the upstream oil and gas market and ceo lal karsanbhai is looking to sell its commoditized upstream oil and gas businesses it s an interesting approach because it makes emerson a near term beneficiary of relatively higher oil prices but at the same time if karsanbhai successfully divests emerson s upstream oil and gas businesses the company will be without the long term risk of exposure to an industry facing a significant threat from the growth of renewables furthermore emerson also sells into a host of other heavy industries chemicals power refining etc and has significant climate technologies products and services for heating ventilation and air conditioning company customers and tools and home products businesses there s a lot to like about emerson and it s more than just oil and gas caterpillar continues to emerge from downturns as a stronger company daniel foelber caterpillar caterpillar stock went from one of the best performers in the dow jones industrial average to a market performing stock after falling over 15 in one month part of the sell off was likely due to a couple of analyst downgrades however the bigger story is that a prolonged recession could lead to less demand for the industries that caterpillar serves namely construction energy rail and marine transportation agriculture and mining caterpillar s customers may be less inclined to buy or finance new equipment if the economy isn t growing quickly this relationship was displayed in caterpillar s q1 results when the company reported strong revenue growth but weak margins due to inflation and rising input costs however caterpillar continues to prove that its business is far more efficient than in years past for example caterpillar generated record net income in 2021 despite earning revenue far below its record year that record net income paired with a lower stock price is the main reason why caterpillar stock has just a 14 6 price to earnings ratio if the economy is in for a recession then caterpillar s results will likely falter and its valuation won t look as cheap however the investment thesis for owning caterpillar over the long term isn t centered around timing the market cycle rather it s all about investing in a business that is well positioned to endure downturns capitalize on uptrends and pay a growing dividend in the process with a dividend yield of 2 8 caterpillar stock is worth a look down nearly 30 from its high fuel your fire for passive income with this oil supermajor scott levine exxonmobil whether it s the fear of refueling your gas guzzling family truckster before the next road trip or simply the thought of gassing up for your daily commute high energy prices have drivers cringing every time they see their fuel gauges falling investors however have an opportunity to mitigate some of that pain at the pump this summer by picking up shares of one of the most alluring oil dividend stocks exxonmobil which currently offers a forward dividend yield of 4 1 consistent with the rise in energy prices shares of exxonmobil have risen 41 since the start of 2022 while the price of west texas intermediate the u s oil benchmark has risen about 35 despite the rise in exxonmobil s stock price shares are still attractively valued trading at 14 3 times earnings for context exxonmobil s five year average p e is 21 2 and the s p 500 s earnings multiple is 19 7 people may be most familiar with the company s downstream business which includes exxonmobil s fueling stations but it s the company s upstream business that has recently warranted attention working to optimize its portfolio by shedding high cost assets exxonmobil recently closed on the 750 million sale of barnett shale assets the transaction is part of the company s larger initiative announced in january to streamline its businesses according to exxonmobil the restructuring will result in the company saving 6 billion by 2023 compared to 2019 while high energy prices are presently benefiting the company s finances income investors should place greater emphasis on exxonmobil s long standing commitment to rewarding shareholders the company has logged 39 years of consecutive dividend raises a period during which it has increased its distribution at an average annual rate of 6

like countless other contract disputes twitter s twtr clash with elon musk over the tesla ceo s tsla attempted exit from his 44 billion agreement to acquire the social media company turns on language that can be open to multiple interpretations don t expect twitter or musk to admit that the legalese laying out the terms of their merger agreement leaves the slightest ambiguity about their respective rights though after publicly taunting twitter with the threat of a hostile takeover and forcing the board s hand with a premium too good to refuse musk agreed to the sale based on a merger agreement drafted by some of the priciest lawyers that money can buy in a matter of weeks from signing the contract musk hinted of cold feet and then terminated the deal citing suspicion that twitter s platform suffered from a higher prevalence of fake accounts than the less than 5 of its monetizable daily active users reported twitter alleges in a complaint against musk that the agreement allows it refuse musk s demands and force him to buy the company musk s lawyers for their part say he can ditch the agreement entirely because twitter s refusals qualify as a material breach and possibly as a material adverse effect that would void the deal in a july 8 termination letter musk s lawyers called the bot data fundamental to twitter s business and financial performance and necessary to complete the deal new york new york may 02 elon musk attends the 2022 met gala celebrating in america an anthology of fashion at the metropolitan museum of art on may 02 2022 in new york city photo by theo wargo wireimage theo wargo via getty images twitter instead says musk is using the bot request as a pretext for backing out of the deal noting that the tesla ceo repeatedly disparaged twitter on the platform itself twitter also notes that musk s premium purchase offer at 54 20 per share is much higher than the stock s more recent value the company s stock was trading at 37 74 at market close on friday room for argument despite the competing claims the actual merger document doesn t explicitly mention bot data it does spell out broad terms about musk s right to access information up until the deal closes and twitter s right to withhold it there certainly is going to be room for argument widener university s delaware law school professor lawrence a hamermesh told yahoo finance a high prevalence of fake accounts would threaten the foundation of twitter s revenue stream advertisers pay to reach real human account holders and not bots a bot rate higher than twitter claims could scare off investors advertisers and possibly even users because bots can both decrease genuine advertising impressions and spread misinformation sun valley idaho july 07 parag agrawal ceo of twitter walks to a morning session during the allen company sun valley conference on july 07 2022 in sun valley idaho the world s most wealthy and powerful businesspeople from the media finance and technology will converge at the sun valley resort this week for the exclusive conference photo by kevin dietsch getty images kevin dietsch via getty images as of the fourth quarter of 2021 the company s regulatory filings state that fake or spam bot accounts represent less than 5 of its user base for musk s part his lawyers argue that under one provision of the contract twitter was on the hook to hand over enough data to enable him to independently assess the incidence of fake accounts to back up his claim his lawyers cite contract language stating that twitter must provide him with reasonable access to twitter s properties books and records and promptly furnish him with all information concerning twitter s business properties and personnel for any reasonable business purpose related to the consummation emphasis added of the transaction that section does give musk some rights to get information hamermesh said but it s not carte blanche free for all access to information the language he explains presents hurdles for musk to show he needs the data for a reasonable purpose that s related to closing the deal what s a reasonable business purpose what s related he asks explaining that those questions if the dispute is resolved in court will be up to a judge to decide still he says i m sure there s plenty of room to argue both sides of that twitter is likely to contend that the type of information musk is demanding isn t covered by the contract language and that musk could have asked for data related to bots before he agreed to the merger agreement hameresh said it means what the trier of fact decides it means to further muddy the water twitter also cites imprecise contract language to argue that it s at liberty to decline musk s requests the company points to a provision that lets it withhold information if in its reasonable judgment it determines that disclosing the data would cause significant competitive harm to twitter if the deal doesn t close in other words twitter can decide there s too much risk of competitive harm to twitter if musk fails to acquire the company and is left holding tools for estimating fake account data that language too leaves room for interpretation what s reasonable what s significant columbia business school senior lecturer donna hitscherich says sorting out those questions through litigation is a risk for both twitter and musk because the judge will have to interpret the meaning of ambiguous terms in the merger agreement in reality it means what the trier of fact decides it means hitscherich said in addition to holding a right to flat out reject musk s requests twitter says the agreement further insulates it from handing over the data because musk waived his right to due diligence the right to obtain certain proprietary twitter information the very absence of a due diligence condition in the contract they claim means musk has no right to demand bot data as a condition of acquiring the company musk s lawyers claim he didn t in fact waive his right to review the data unless twitter and musk settle their dispute the delaware chancery court s chief judge kathaleen mccormick will be left to interpret the contract before that musk will have a chance to answer twitter s accusations that he tried to tank the deal in an answer to the company s complaint this story was amended to clarify twitter s
