here are the highlights of events related to the war in ukraine over the past 24 hours an explosion rocked russia s belgorod a glowing flying object and a fire explosion in sevastopol new explosions on russian territory caused anxiety in the population of russian belgorod and sevastopol located in the occupied crimea the local administrations of the two cities reported an attack by ukrainian drones and explosions reuters quoted a source from the local administration in sevastopol as saying that a missile fired from a ship of the black sea fleet shot down a drone over the city the first reports of thunder in sevastopol on social networks are from 7 o clock local time on thursday in the local telegram channels they write that something is noisy in the city as the 24 channel portal notes with such euphemisms the russians are trying to calm down after the latest ukrainian attacks a little later the administration in sevastopol announced that it had activated air defense on the fifth kilometer it is probably near the gagarin area of the occupied city where the kazakh bay is located and where there were explosions at the end of august social media users were relieved that the sound seemed like something had been taken down other subscribers describe what they saw with their own eyes at 6 50 a m a glowing thing flew across the sky of sevastopol the unknown object was chased by a shot after which sparks fell from the sky footage later emerged of smoke balls over sevastopol but no explanation of what exactly was burning a large scale fire preceded by strong explosions was also reported by belgorod located near the border with ukraine local residents write about a ukrainian attack there are pictures on social media of a fire with thick black clouds of smoke above it high voltage lines are down a third explosion took place on the territory of the yakovlev city district north of belgorod about 50 kilometers from the border with ukraine siberia should be worried ukrainian drone attacks show that russia has no safe zones ukrainian drone strikes on targets in the rear of the russian federation show that russia has no safe zones writes the financial times on the occasion of the latest ukrainian attacks on air bases in saratov ryazan and kursk ukraine has been insisting for months that its western allies supply it with long range missiles to strike russian military bases far behind the front lines the paper said citing unnamed government sources in kyiv who said the ukrainian military would soon be able to strike any russian targets in any territory including in siberia we have no limits on range and will soon be able to hit any target in russia including siberia we in ukraine know how difficult it is to defend yourself against such air attacks soon there will be no safe zones in russia either says a defense adviser to the government of ukraine speaking on condition of anonymity on december 6 a ukrainian drone attacked the kursk airport causing the oil tank to catch fire on december 5 two more military airfields were attacked near saratov and ryazan three people died and two bombers were destroyed according to the official russian data unofficially military bloggers and analysts indicate that such strikes may have more casualties and analysis of satellite images show that 10 planes are missing from airports the financial times quoted ukrainian defense ministry officials and analysts as saying the attacks were part of a new tactic designed to disrupt russian military planning and confuse the public by showing that russia is not safe either ukrainian defense ministry officials believe that one of the long term results of such attacks could be a dispersion of russian military forces inside the country which would help protect them but make it difficult to maneuver with available military forces military observers have already noted that russian air defenses are being exposed due to the deployment of s 300 systems to ukraine where the installations are used to strike ukrainian ground targets thus for these strikes for example s 300 batteries from the st petersburg area were taken off duty and transferred to ukraine ukraine has so far not publicly claimed responsibility for the strikes on russian rear lines and many details remain secret as with other such special operations by kyiv such as the combined air and sea drone attack on the black sea fleet naval base in sevastopol in october on wednesday the united states officially announced that it has not provided ukraine with weapons of increased range and does not encourage it to strike targets on russian territory but at the same time in no way prevents kyiv from acquiring longer range weapons on its own scholz international pressure has reduced the nuclear threat from russia the risk of using nuclear weapons in the conflict in ukraine has decreased thanks to international pressure on russia german chancellor olaf scholz said in an interview one thing has changed for the time being russia has stopped threatening to use nuclear weapons in response the international community has drawn a red line scholz said in an interview with the german media group funke asked if the threat of nuclear escalation had been averted scholz said we have ended it for now the german leader praised his recent visit to china for contributing to this development during my visit to beijing chinese president xi jinping and i jointly expressed the view that nuclear weapons should not be used shortly thereafter the g20 countries confirmed this position he said scholz was also asked about french president emmanuel macron s controversial comments that it would be necessary to provide guarantees for russia s own security the day it comes back to the table at the talks the priority now is for russia to immediately end the war and withdraw its troops he said it is true that after that the question is how we can achieve security for europe of course we are ready to talk with russia about arms control in europe we proposed this before the war and this position has not changed threatening language from putin himself as well as the military stalemate have raised concerns that russia may resort to its nuclear arsenal to achieve a military breakthrough but speaking at a meeting of his human rights council putin suggested moscow would only use nuclear weapons in response to such an attack when they hit us we hit back he said stressing that his country s strategy is based on the so called counter strike policy uzbekistan poured cold water on russia for the idea of a gas union the minister of energy of uzbekistan zhurabek mirzamakhmudov poured cold water on the authors of the russian proposal for a gas union with the russian federation which was proposed by the president of russia vladimir putin reported reuters the minister announced that tashkent would not agree to political conditions that would endanger its national interests according to reuters uzbekistan has not yet received a concrete offer but there have been russian statements since last month that a gas alliance with kazakhstan and uzbekistan is being discussed to strengthen supplies between the three countries and other buyers including china it is part of moscow s changed strategy since its invasion of ukraine which has seen the european union sharply reduce its dependence on russian energy even if a gas contract is signed with russia it does not mean an alliance mirzamakhmudov said negotiations are underway for russian gas supplies via the kazakhstan pipeline but this will be a technical agreement rather than an alliance if we import gas from another country we only cooperate on the basis of a commercial sales contract we will never agree to political terms in exchange for gas in short we will get our proposed gas contract only if we agree with it otherwise not the minister emphasized reuters explained tashkent s lukewarm attitude to the russian proposal as a manifestation of moscow s growing difficulty in imposing its will on other former soviet republics amid the war in ukraine despite this position of the former soviet republic uzbekistan remains dependent on foreign gas supplies the country including the capital tashkent has been experiencing shortages of the blue fuel in recent days due to increased consumption during the cold winter days mirzamakhmudov announced that the cold has forced uzbekistan to reduce by 6 million cubic meters of gas per day exports to china in total the country produces about 52 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually imports 4 billion and exports 2 7 billion reuters recalls isw discontent is brewing in the army of belarus russia s attempts to force belarus to join the war in ukraine may cause internal conflicts in the republic s army as noted by the analysts of the american institute for the study of war isw this was also confirmed by the ukrainian general staff in particular on december 7 the general staff of the armed forces of ukraine reported growing dissatisfaction with the activities of the belarusian military and political leadership in connection with the threats of belarus to join the war in ukraine among the servicemen of the belarusian border service and the armed forces isw analysts previously suggested that russian defense minister sergei shoigu traveled to belarus to meet with alexander lukashenko and belarusian defense minister viktor khrenin to continue to pressure minsk into backing russia offensive campaign in ukraine at the same time belarusian officials especially lukashenko and khrenin use this rhetoric to support the ongoing russian information operation aimed at strengthening ukrainian forces on the belarusian ukrainian border with the threat of belarus joining the war pressure from russia and the involvement of belarusian officials in the ongoing russian information operation may cause concern among the belarusian military isw continues to believe that belarus is unlikely to start a war in ukraine due to domestic factors that limit lukashenko s willingness to did the report said package 9 ban on import of engines for russian drones and three more banks under sanctions new package the ninth in a row of sanctions against russia because of the war in ukraine was presented by the president of the european commission ursula von der leyen according to the proposals which must receive the blessing of all 27 eu members to become sanctions are to cut off russia s access to unmanned aerial vehicles ban the direct export of drone engines to russia and other countries such as iran which could supply it with drones bta reported it is proposed to add nearly 200 more individuals and legal entities to the list of those sanctioned this includes employees of the russian armed forces as well as individual officers and companies from the defense industry deputies of the state duma and the federation council ministers governors and political parties the ec proposes that three more russian banks fall under the sanctions and that a complete ban on transactions of the russian bank for regional development be introduced an extension of export restrictions is envisaged especially for dual use goods including chemicals and electronics the commission proposes that four more russian tv stations be taken off the european airwaves and all other distribution platforms the proposed sanctions include measures against russia s energy and mining sectors experts have shown how russia can circumvent oil sanctions by hiding its tankers a ship tracking ngo has managed to show how a russian tanker in the mediterranean falsified its location data experts believe this may be evidence of preparations to circumvent oil sanctions against russia the bbc reported commissioned by the us department of defense global fishing watch tracked and verified the transponder signals and satellite images of the russian tanker captain shchemilkin and found that in may and august the tanker s crew twice tried to hide their true location by has submitted incorrect coordinates to the maritime automatic identification system ais this was reported by the financial times which independently verified the findings of global fishing watch the ft notes that this technique has been used before by ships secretly carrying oil from iran and venezuela in addition the newspaper recalls that according to maritime brokers russia bought an entire shadow fleet of more than 100 tankers before the embargo and price ceiling on its oil the eu embargo on russian oil tankers came into effect on december 5 the same day the g7 countries the eu and australia imposed a a barrel cap on russian crude supplies a price above which it cannot insures itself in the companies in these countries and which practically controls the entire world market global fishing watch found that the captain shchemilkin was anchored off the coast of malta from may 28 to july 12 but throughout that time it gave the appearance of being much further east in greek waters the tanker then returned to the black sea before re entering the mediterranean in august this time heading for northern cyprus the port and the technesik power station but ais reported it was again circling greek waters in recent months we have seen russian tankers doing something similar to training voyages to circumvent sanctions samir madani head of the tankertrackers com service told the ft to prove that captain shchemilkin falsified its location data global fishing watch compared ais data with satellite images from the european space agency and planet labs in addition it found that sometimes the signals of the russian tanker were not picked up by the satellites in the areas where it should have been according to the signals in question the same operation was done by the financial times obtaining the raw data itself captain shchemilkin is owned by the rostov based company rechmortrans the company did not respond to the ft s request for comment klitschko warned of an apocalyptic scenario in kyiv kyiv s mayor warned on wednesday of an apocalypse scenario for the ukrainian capital this winter if russian airstrikes on infrastructure continue and said that while there was no need for people to evacuate yet they should be prepared to do so kyiv may lose electricity water and heat supply an apocalypse may happen like in hollywood movies when it is not possible to live in homes because of the low temperature mayor vitaly klitschko said in an interview with reuters but we are fighting and doing everything in our power to make sure that doesn t happen said the former world heavyweight boxing champion who is now a politician according to klitschko 152 kyiv civilians have been killed and 678 buildings destroyed since the start of the russian invasion on february 24 but the city faces new tests this winter because of the relentless russian strikes on ukraine s energy grid the picture is grim kyiv does not have enough heated shelters to accommodate all 3 6 million residents in the event of a total blackout and people should be prepared to evacuate if the situation worsens klitschko said nearly 500 autonomous heating centers have been prepared but for a city of 3 million 500 points are nothing he admitted after days ago president volodymyr zelensky criticized him for failing to provide heating for the city s residents klitschko outlined as a realistic possibility that kyiv would be left without central heating at a time when temperatures could drop to minus 15 degrees celsius if the electricity supply continues to be absent while the outside temperatures remain low we will be forced to drain the water from the buildings otherwise the water may freeze and cut off the entire water supply network and then the buildings will be completely unfit for further use said the mayor klitschko urged residents to stock up on food and water as well as prepare clothes and documents for a quick exit if the heating is shut off however he said there was no need for evacuations at this time as the city had only a 20 power deficit and conditions remained stable at the moment there is heating in kyiv there is electricity everything is working there is no need for evacuation at the moment klitschko said but added that residents should be prepared for different scenarios asked what the city needs most the mayor said a new air defense system he added that tens of thousands of generators and industrial fan heaters are also needed klitschko dismissed criticism from ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky over preparations for the winter saying he believed they were politically motivated and causing astonishment among supporters of ukraine klitschko now in his ninth year as mayor was considered one of zelenskiy s most prominent political opponents before the russian invasion i am convinced that politics is behind it because representatives of a political group started running around trying to find fault in kyiv klitschko said follow novinite com on

photo credit andy dean photography shutterstock the housing market is entering the traditionally quieter winter season but recent indicators suggest that the market has already been slowing in the last few months new listings pending sales and prices are all on the decline signs of rapid cooling after a two year frenzy in the market one of the primary factors driving the slowing of the market has been inflation including for housing costs during the covid 19 pandemic the median home sale price in the u s increased by more than 38 from 329 000 in the first quarter of 2020 to 454 900 in the third quarter of 2022 and as home prices have rapidly become more expensive so has everything else inflation as measured by the consumer price index has topped 5 for 18 straight months driven by increases in major expenses like food and rent the effects of inflation have left potential buyers with less ability to save up for a purchase adding to this pressure is an increase in interest rates the u s federal reserve has engaged in aggressive rate hikes throughout 2022 to curb inflation and mortgage lenders have pushed up rates for consumers as a result the average interest rate for a 30 year fixed rate mortgage has increased from around 3 at the end of 2021 to about 6 5 now in october the average 30 year rate briefly passed 7 for the first time since before the great recession as a result of these factors total home sales per month have been down year over year for every month in 2022 and the gap between 2021 and 2022 monthly figures has widened as the year has gone on in october 2022 home sales fell to 439 596 a decline of nearly 30 as total sales have declined another important metric the time homes sit on the market before selling is on the rise september was the first month since february 2021 where the median days on market for home listings exceeded 30 days at the height of the market the typical listing spent just 15 days on the market but today the median listing will sit on the market for 35 days few places have escaped the slowing of the market but some locations are experiencing especially stark drops in activity nine of the top 10 states with the steepest drops in home sales from 2021 to 2022 are found in the western u s led by utah with a 43 2 decline the region includes expensive states for housing like california 37 4 and washington 36 7 along with states that boomed during the pandemic like nevada 40 8 arizona 37 0 and idaho 35 4 local markets in the western region are also among the nation s leaders in decreased home sales the data

treasury secretary janet yellen left and treasurer lynn malerba show off money they autographed thursday the currency is the nation s first to be signed by two women treasury secretary janet yellen on thursday helped mark a milestone in u s history when she held up a newly minted 5 bill signed for the first time ever by two women yellen s signature will appear alongside that of u s treasurer lynn malerba the first native american in that position advertisement yellen joked during a stop in texas about the bad handwriting of some of her male predecessors and said i will admit i spent some quality time practicing my signature two women on the currency for the first time is truly momentous added malerba who traveled with yellen to a bureau of engraving and printing facility in fort worth to provide their signatures they ceremonially signed fresh sheets of bills in 1 and 5 denominations and posed with samples to mark the history making moment the new notes will go into circulation next year advertisement anusha chari an economist who chairs the american economic assn s committee on the status of women in the economics profession calls yellen s signature on u s currency a huge milestone but it also shows us how far we have to go the treasury department was created in 1789 and until yellen only white men had led it yellen made her reputation as a stoic chair of the federal reserve and a shrewd forecaster and now is at the forefront of far flung efforts to use economic levers to help stop russia s war in ukraine employ tax policy to protect the planet from climate change and oversee a massive effort to strengthen the beleaguered internal revenue service that puts her at the center of domestic and global politics inviting new levels of pressure and second guessing by friends and foes she is tackling this challenge as the united states is suffering from inflation that hit a 40 year high this summer and sowed fears of a coming recession advertisement even as yellen watched the fresh bills carrying her signature roll out at the bureau of engraving and printing s currency facility her remarks focused on biden administration policy accomplishments rather than her status as the first woman to serve as treasury secretary on the ukraine conflict instigated last february by russian president vladimir putin she said together with over 30 countries we have denied russia revenue and resources it needs to fight its war as for the domestic economy she said pandemic relief and a new law to boost production of semiconductors have positioned the u s to capitalize on a wave of economic opportunities for the american people including in communities often overlooked advertisement later talking to reporters yellen said she thinks the u s can avoid a recession obviously there are risks that the economy faces but i think we re not in a wage price spiral supply chain bottlenecks are clearly beginning to ease that s helpful she said i believe we re on the right track in terms of lowering inflation and a recession is not inevitable now two years into president biden s first term yellen has put to rest rumors that she might be ready to leave the administration early and is strapping in for more economic as well as political battles ahead along with managing the treasury s role in the ukraine war she faces the herculean task of revitalizing an irs that is getting an 80 billion funding boost and enforcing an anti money laundering effort that requires documenting the beneficial owners of tens of millions of u s businesses in hopes of crushing corruption around the world advertisement she occupies an increasingly politicized role in which congress and foreign governments matter as much as the financial markets her treasury department is implementing an oil price cap aimed at hobbling the russian economy as house republican leader kevin mccarthy of california is questioning the level of u s support for ukraine the treasury is also implementing tens of billions of dollars in tax incentives to address climate change which has rankled some european allies and proved controversial with republicans and the wage gains in the most recent u s jobs report suggest the economy might have to endure more pain than expected to bring inflation back to the fed s target of 2 annually advertisement along the way yellen has not shied away from controversy or speaking her mind on issues that many americans look at solely through a cultural lens when sen tim scott r s c at a may congressional hearing told yellen that she was harsh for speaking about the positive economic effects of abortion access for women she replied this is not harsh this is the truth she also has challenged the view that havens for hidden cash lie outside the u s instead arguing that the u s has become the best place to hide illicitly obtained money yellen generated some tension with the white house this year when she veered somewhat from biden s insistence that his 1 9 trillion coronavirus aid package did not contribute to inflation advertisement republican lawmakers have drawn on analyses by major economists such as harvard university s larry summers to say that the sum was excessive and sparked inflation breakages in the global supply chain and a jump in food and energy costs after russia invaded ukraine also have contributed to the rise of prices to uncomfortable levels putting the economy at heightened risk of a recession yellen acknowledged on cnn in may that she had been wrong then about the path that inflation would take biden said he had been apprised of the possible risks of inflation when putting together the relief package but he told the associated press in an interview that the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre yellen s predictions at the treasury about financial markets on other points have proved accurate advertisement her warnings about the risks of a deregulated cryptocurrency market foresaw the recent chaos crypto markets have seen at least two major crashes dozens of scams ponzi schemes and hundreds of billions of dollars made and evaporated overnight yellen has also used her platform as a top government official to warn that despite women s advancements in the workplace a glass ceiling prevents many from reaching the very top positions yellen the only person ever to lead the treasury department the federal reserve and white house council of economic advisors still gets flak from members of both political parties for not being more dynamic and politically savvy at times and for being too direct at other times advertisement summers treasury secretary under president clinton said in a statement to the associated press that yellen continues a remarkable career in economic policy at the u s treasury department no other treasury secretary has had a deeper commitment to social justice as a central goal of macro and financial policies the praise comes as summers has

treasury secretary janet yellen and u s treasurer lynn malerba hold up newly minted 5 bills signed for the first time ever by two women via associated press fort worth texas ap treasury secretary janet yellen on thursday helped mark a milestone in u s history when she held up a newly minted 5 bill signed for the first time ever by two women yellen s signature will appear alongside that of u s treasurer lynn malerba the first native american in that position advertisement yellen joked during a stop in texas about the bad handwriting of some of her male predecessors and said i will admit i spent some quality time practicing my signature two women on the currency for the first time is truly momentous added malerba who traveled with yellen to a bureau of engraving and printing facility in fort worth to provide their signatures they ceremonially signed fresh sheets of bills in 1 and 5 denominations and posed with samples to mark the history making moment the new notes will go into circulation next year advertisement yellen made her reputation as a stoic chair of the federal reserve and a shrewd forecaster and now is at the forefront of far flung efforts to use economic levers to help stop russia s war in ukraine employ tax policy to protect the planet from climate change and oversee a massive effort to strengthen the beleaguered irs that puts her at the center of domestic and global politics inviting new levels of pressure and second guessing by friends and foes she is tackling this challenge as the united states is suffering from inflation that hit a 40 year high this summer and sowed fears of a coming recession even as yellen watched the fresh bills carrying her signature roll out at the bureau of engraving and printing s western currency facility her remarks focused on biden administration policy accomplishments rather than her status as the first woman to serve as treasury secretary advertisement yellen and malerba sign 1 bills andy jacobsohn via getty images on the ukraine conflict instigated last february by russian president vladimir putin she said together with over 30 countries we have denied russia revenue and resources it needs to fight its war as for the domestic economy she said pandemic relief and a new law to boost production of semiconductors have positioned the u s to capitalize on a wave of economic opportunities for the american people including in communities often overlooked later talking to reporters yellen said she thinks the u s can avoid a recession obviously there are risks that the economy faces but i think we re not in a wage price spiral supply chain bottlenecks are clearly beginning to ease that s helpful she said i believe we re on the right track in terms of lowering inflation and a recession is not inevitable advertisement now two years into joe biden s presidency yellen has put to rest rumors she might be ready to leave the administration early and is strapping in for more economic as well as political battles ahead along with managing treasury s role in the ukraine war she faces the herculean task of revitalizing an irs that is getting a 80 billion funding boost and enforcing an anti money laundering effort that requires documenting the beneficial owners of tens of millions of u s businesses in hopes of crushing corruption around the world she occupies an increasingly politicized role in which congress and foreign governments matter as much as the financial markets her treasury department is seeking to hobble the russian economy with an oil price cap as house republican leader kevin mccarthy of california is questioning the level of u s support for ukraine the treasury is also putting together tens of billions in tax incentives to address climate change that have rankled some european allies and proved controversial with republicans and the wage gains in the most recent u s jobs report suggest the economy might have to endure more pain than expected to bring inflation back to the fed s target of 2 annually advertisement along the way yellen has not shied away from controversy or speaking her mind on issues that many americans look at solely through a cultural lens when sen tim scott r s c at a may congressional hearing told yellen she was harsh for speaking about the positive economic impacts of abortion access for women she replied this is not harsh this is the truth she also has challenged the view that havens for hidden cash lie outside the u s instead arguing that the u s has become the best place to hide illicitly obtained money yellen generated some tension with the white house this year when she veered somewhat from biden s insistence that his 1 9 trillion in coronavirus aid package did not contribute to inflation republican lawmakers have drawn on analyses by major economists such as harvard university s larry summers to say that the sum was excessive and sparked inflation breakages in the global supply chain and a jump in food and energy costs after russia invaded ukraine also have contributed to boosting prices to uncomfortable levels putting the economy at heightened risk of a recession yellen acknowledged on cnn in may that she had been wrong then about the path that inflation would take biden said he had been apprised of the possible risks of inflation when putting together the relief package but he told the associated press in an interview that the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre advertisement yellen s predictions at the treasury about financial markets on other points have been proved accurate her warnings about the risks of a deregulated cryptocurrency market foresaw the recent chaos crypto markets have seen at least two major crashes dozens of scams ponzi schemes and hundreds of billions of dollars made and evaporated overnight yellen has also used her platform as a top government official to warn that despite women s advancements in the workplace a glass ceiling prevents many from advancing to the very top positions yellen the only person ever to lead the treasury department the federal reserve and white house council of economic advisers still gets flak from members of both political parties for not being more dynamic and politically savvy at times and for being too direct at other times advertisement summers treasury secretary under president bill clinton said in a statement to the associated press that yellen continues a remarkable career in economic policy at the us treasury department no other treasury secretary has had a deeper commitment to social justice as a central goal of macro and financial policies the praise comes as summers has leveled criticism at the biden administration for the size of its coronavirus relief saying its excesses flooded the economy with money and pushed up prices he has argued that the fed must continue to raise rates to reduce inflation an action that could push the u s and other nations into recession anusha chari an economist who chairs the american economic association s committee on the status of women in the economics profession calls yellen s signature on u s currency a huge milestone but it also shows us how far we have to go the treasury department was created in 1789 and until yellen only white men had led it ___ boak reported from washington associated press writer darlene superville in washington contributed to this report advertisement

energy needs hydropower generation on columbia basin project cbp canals began in 1982 with the commissioning of the russell d smith plant located in franklin county soon followed by an additional six

more than 1 100 unionized new york times staffers are intending to embark on a 24 hour strike today leaving editors at the newspaper scrambling to put out a credible digital report for the day and print editions for the days following a protest featuring some of the paper s most celebrated names is scheduled outside the times midtown manhattan headquarters for 1 p m eastern standard time pulitzer prize winner nikole hannah jones is among those expected to speak it s disappointing that they re taking such drastic action times co ceo meredith kopit levien wrote in a memo late last night she cited what she called the clear commitment we ve shown to negotiate our way to a contract that provides times journalists with substantial pay increases market leading benefits and flexible working conditions the paper s journalists have not had a working contract since march 2021 negotiations between the paper s management and the times guild have broken down mainly over pay union members most of whom are journalists but also ad salespeople security guards and others are questioning why they cannot share more concretely in the strong financial run the times has enjoyed in other words if not during flush times then when and they say that drawing out negotiations has not aided them contending that management only picked up the pace of concessions as the day long strike neared the new york times co share price has risen by about half in the past four years the newspaper remains on a path to 15 million digital subscriptions by the end of 2027 it recently acquired the athletic for 550 million and has embarked on an ambitious stock buy back initiative top executives including ceo levien and publisher a g sulzberger have received major raises the work stoppage a way to simultaneously inflict short term pain and convey solidarity for the proposition of longer term action is a measure of the fractious relationship between the paper s greatly expanded newsroom now at 1 800 staffers and its management it is also happening as unions are flexing their muscle at newsrooms as varied as eroded local papers newer digital sites and public broadcasting outlets a necessary shot across the bow the paper s guild members say they are unified and expect to prevail from my point of view this is an absolutely necessary shot across the bow says guild member michael powell a veteran reporter who covers free speech matters for the new york times national desk we ve seen our salaries almost all of us go straight backward over the years that s not acceptable each month that goes by powell says they re taking more money out of our pocket several managers at the times speaking to npr on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment acknowledge concern about the tensions and the burden of putting out the paper without hundreds of their colleagues editors are scrambling to make sure long held stories are ready for publication some are preparing to flex dormant reporting muscles others are unlikely to miss a step but the sheer volume of copy produced by the paper s newsroom each day is unlikely to be matched with more than half of the chairs metaphorically empty the paper notes that its most current counter proposals represent significant increases we remain committed to working with the nyt newsguild to reach a contract that we can all be proud of times spokesperson danielle rhoades ha said in a written statement the union s leaders and members have taken umbrage at what they characterize as the largely intransigent approach of the paper s outside law firm proskauer rose the paper argues the union s efforts to have large numbers of guild members at negotiations impede honest exchanges and compromise the union is arguing for a package of raises that works out to a 5 25 percent average annual raise over the four year period covered which includes the past two years the company s most recent offer as of late tuesday night represented exactly half of that yet there are myriad other issues at play as well as some recent movement the times has offered to allow the guild to decide whether to continue the current pension plan or to convert to a 401 k retirement plan with a 6 6 annual company contribution for all covered guild employees its most generous benefit inside the company in a memo to staff times deputy managing editor cliff levy acknowledged the walkout represented an unsettling moment still management believes that with a renewed commitment to productive negotiations on both sides we can make significant strides toward a contract wrote levy who is helping to lead negotiations for management a newspaper strike in pittsburgh shows mixed results so far meanwhile a full fledged newspaper strike is playing out 370 miles to the west in pittsburgh the post gazette newsroom union voted by a slight margin to go on strike in mid october to support smaller striking unions at the paper it set up a news site powered by striking post gazette journalists called the pittsburgh union progress the paper has been operating without a contract for those staffers for four years yet the strike appears so far to have had mixed results on the post gazette not all journalists joined the strike several quit for jobs elsewhere including the pittsburgh tribune review and two strikers have returned to work several who initially stayed have since joined the strikers here in pittsburgh the post gazette only prints on thursdays and sundays anyway says andy conte director of point park university s center for media innovation the management of the company has signaled that they are moving to a digital first product most people have gotten used to the idea you re not getting a printed product and so if you re a casual observer the post gazette is the same says conte author of death of the daily news a new book on how the closing of the local paper affected mckeesport pa the block family that owns the post gazette notes the tough economic climate for the local newspaper industry and shows no sign of yielding they have no desire to even meet their workers part way says newspaper guild of pittsburgh president zack tanner an interactive designer at the paper the company has not even acknowledged the strike other than to say we re welcome back to work at any time and to make no concessions a strike three decades ago in pittsburgh led to the closure of the pittsburgh press a loss isn t even on our mind tanner says we ve had three negotiating sessions since we went out on strike and they ve made no concessions there s no getting around that but to make john and allan block listen to us is going to take a big effort like this new york times walkout to be the longest at the paper in decades in new york against a different financial backdrop times journalists say they should share in the wealth our salaries have gone steadily year by year backwards against inflation says powell the reporter it s just reached the point where folks are saying enough we re lucky to be working for a paper that s making money and that s doing well he says we are some of the reason that it s doing well according to both the times and the newsguild the newspaper has a limited history of such work actions journalists staged lunchtime walkouts a couple of times over the past decade in 1981 the guild struck for six and a half hours in 1978 it put up a picket line that lasted less than a day at the tail end of the paper s press operators lengthy and contentious strike the only extended strike initiated by the newsroom union at the times occurred in fall 1965 it lasted for weeks the paper was able to produce a limited print edition thanks to its international edition

as members of congress continue to discuss how best to reform social security many policymakers are focusing on the wrong issue their sole concern seems to be the state of social security s trust fund and they see the sole objective of reform as increasing its size and extending the date when it will run out of its paper assets this emphasis misses the fundamental point about social security s problems the real question is not whether social security s trust fund is solvent for any specific period of time the trust fund is an accounting device and has no real assets it has only ious that must be repaid by future taxpayers instead the question policymakers should be asking is how to ensure that every american regardless of income level has a secure retirement nest egg any debate about social security s future should be about how to improve each american s personal retirement security the only way to accomplish this is to implement president george w bush s proposal to provide younger workers with the opportunity to invest part of their social security taxes in personal retirement accounts the sad reality is that regardless of when social security s trust fund runs out or when the program begins to run cash flow deficits its future fiscal problems have not been addressed far too soon payroll taxes will be insufficient to pay all of the benefits that have been promised even now millions of workers receive a dismal rate of return on their social security retirement taxes making matters worse the current program does not enable workers to build up investments and cash savings to supplement their monthly social security checks solving these problems should be the focus of the coming debate if it is not both president bush and members of congress will have lost a real opportunity to improve the lives of america s future retirees missing the point saving the social security trust fund is fairly simple from an accountant s perspective all one has to do is raise taxes or lower benefits and the social security retirement program could be solvent forever decisions as to whether the program is on budget or off budget or whether the current surplus goes into a lockbox or not will have no effect on the program s failure to meet the needs of average workers today s social security program is a bad deal for average workers regardless of whether the trust fund is solvent for 15 years or 115 years comparing the total amount of social security retirement taxes paid over a working lifetime by a 30 year old two earner couple both of whom make average incomes to what they will receive in benefits in retirement shows that their taxes will earn the equivalent of only a 1 2 percent return per year if they were allowed instead to invest their social security taxes they could have 525 000 more for their retirement the situation is even worse for younger workers and minorities today a 25 year old african american male will receive 13 400 less in benefits than he will pay in taxes he could have 145 000 more if he were allowed to invest a portion of his taxes regrettably social security is the only retirement plan many workers have missing the lessons of the three legged stool since the time of president franklin d roosevelt social security has been described as only one of three legs of the retirement stool in addition to social security retirement security was to be achieved through personal savings and private pensions supplied by employers for many americans this is not the reality only about half of american workers are covered by private pension plans and most of those who are covered earn above average incomes most lower income and middle income workers will have to rely solely on social security for retirement income after subtracting the debts they owe the average american family has savings of only about 1 000 far short of what they will need for retirement when faced with the choice of using their limited income to pay the mortgage or to save for an event 30 years in the future most americans will choose to pay the mortgage the fact is that the 10 6 percent of their income that most workers pay for social security retirement benefits soaks up most of the money that they otherwise could save re creating the roosevelt vision today s social security does two important jobs adequately it provides necessary income protection when a worker is disabled or dies leaving a young family and it provides a stable if low level of retirement income these features should be preserved even though the supreme court says that congress has the authority to change or end them at any time however congress should also create a third leg to the retirement stool by reforming social security to give americans the opportunity to build wealth that they can use to increase their retirement income start a small business or provide better opportunities for their children or grandchildren building the american dream americans would be much better off if a portion of their social security retirement taxes went into personal retirement accounts that they own should they die before retirement this money could be willed to their families studies show that over time a mixed portfolio comprised half of stocks and half of super safe government bonds earns an average of 5 percent a year after inflation this compares to social security s average 1 2 percent annual real growth for an average 30 year old working couple wealthy americans earn at least this much every day it is time to allow workers of all income levels to share in this growth conclusion neither congress nor president bush should waste time arguing in the wrong social security debate talking about trust funds will neither save social security nor raise anyone s retirement standard of living the social security debate should focus on the best way to give all americans the opportunity to build nest eggs for the future david c john

and vigorously researches and tests our top choices bottom line the gearjunkie staff is dedicated to exhaustive analysis and helping our readers make informed choices factors to consider when purchasing the best off road wheels it s crucial to consider the following when searching for the best off road wheels to pick the best match for your tires vehicle and use case wheel size when it comes to getting the appropriate size of off road wheels for your truck or suv paying attention to the diameter and width of the rim is essential with diameter it comes down to both preferences and the best fit for your vehicle if you decide to go with a larger diameter rim you may need to lift your truck or suv to accommodate the larger wheel size it is also crucial to ensure that you don t purchase wheels too small in diameter as they probably won t fit over your brake calipers we recommend sticking with your oe wheel dimensions or size up as your current modifications or clearance will allow if a big brake kit was installed check with the manufacturer to determine if the design will accommodate larger calipers the width of your rim will determine what size tire you can safely run most tires should have a recommended rim width range measured in inches that identifies the narrowest to the widest rim widths on which you can safely mount the tire to determine the correct fitment check the specifications of your tires of choice if you cannot find the information contact the tire manufacturer alternatively you can purchase your new off road rims first and then find a set of tires to fit them bolt pattern when shopping for the best off road wheels for your ride pay attention to the bolt pattern specified in the product description the bolt pattern needs to match your vehicle this spec is the number of lugs on the vehicle s wheel along with the diameter of a virtual circle formed at the center of the lugs themselves before purchasing off road wheels know the pattern and size of your vehicle s bolts offset the offset is the distance from a rim s hub mounting surface to the centerline of the wheel the measurement is in millimeters and classified as negative positive or zero offset a negative offset means the mounting surface is closer to the inboard side of the wheel a positive offset means the mounting surface is nearer to the outboard or street side of the wheel if an offset is zero the mounting surface is located exactly at the wheel s centerline offset is essential because it determines whether a wheel will fit your vehicle clear your brakes and accommodate any suspension or other modifications you have made to your adventure rig if you plan to upgrade to a larger rim and wider tire you will need to make sure you purchase a wheel with the proper offset if you are sticking with a stock rim and tire size purchasing a similar offset to what your vehicle is currently running is fine if you have a modified ride or are planning to run a larger rim speak to a trusted tire and wheel shop to determine what offset will work best for your vehicle before making your purchase another great resource is this simple video on how to measure your wheel offset from driftworks load rating it s best to know your vehicle s maximum load capacity to match or exceed the correct load rating before purchasing a set of aftermarket off road wheels generally steel rims will have a higher load rating than aluminum although aluminum wheels should be more than sturdy enough to handle the weight of most standard trucks and suvs finish the finish of your off road wheels mostly depends on preference the most common finishes include painted matte or shiny black chrome bronze and silver pick the color that will best complement your adventure rig for painted or matte finishes note that they may show wear or scratches more obviously than polished chrome look for a corrosion resistant finish to help prevent premature wear material aluminum is the most common material used for off road wheels the properties of aluminum are ideal for creating a robust lightweight and highly durable rim aluminum is overall non corrosive and hearty enough to withstand rugged off roading conditions steel is another relatively common material for off road wheels it is generally more budget friendly and still of excellent quality most steel wheels will have some kind of paint to prevent rust but it is important to note that since steel is not corrosion resistant you will need to maintain this protective coating in the case of any nicks chips or scratches to prevent the wheel from rusting
by larry keane usa ammoland com new york times columnist david brooks is reminding america why they shouldn t put faith in opinion writers pontificating from their metropolitan ivory towers brooks recently said america would be a much safer country if americans would simply give up their freedoms and become more like europe if america wouldn t hold onto the individual right to keep and bear arms spelled out in the second amendment and affirmed by the u s supreme court he argues it would be a much safer place in his estimation giving up the ability for self defense and defense of loved ones would make crime just go away that would take a gigantic culture shift in this country a revamping of the way we think about privacy a revamping of the way we think about the role government plays in protecting the common good brooks said during a segment on pbs newshour i think it would be something i think it would be good not only to head off shootings but good to live in a society where we cared more intimately about each other and i would be willing to give up certain privacies for that to happen that s certainly out of the mainstream of how the rest of america views lawful firearm ownership there were over 21 million background checks for the sale of a firearm in 2020 the most ever in a single year last year americans submitted to 18 5 million background checks in 2022 background check figures are headed for the third strongest year on record during the week up to and including black friday the fbi s national instant criminal background check system nics tallied over 711 000 background checks with over 192 000 on black friday alone that was the third busiest day for fbi s nics ever the plan give up just how would america achieve this utopia that brooks imagines just give up he said give up your rights give up your freedoms submit to an orwellian state that provides you with all your needs he admits this wouldn t be easy but for many americans that would just be a massive cultural shift to regard our community and regard our common good in more frankly a european style brooks explained i think it would benefit our society in a whole range of areas but it s hard to see that kind of culture change to a society that s been pretty individualistic for a long long time america broke away from european style rule for a reason the founding fathers rejected the british crown s demands to give up guns then based on background checks for gun sales america continues to reject calls for strict gun control a recent gallup poll found that support for more gun control dropped nine points from 66 percent to 57 percent in an october survey failed disarmament the argument that individuals should surrender their gun rights has been tried elsewhere with predictable results gun owners that complied with gun seizures find themselves unable to protect themselves while criminals that ignore the law are empowered a recent report from abc news in australia showed that criminals find it easier now to obtain illicit firearms than before the multiple amnesty periods when government officials collected firearms from australians new zealand instituted its own gun confiscation program and crime spiked new zealand prime minister jacinda ardern ushered in draconian gun control including confiscation and the country and crime hit new peaks the only ones left with guns were the criminals that s a lesson that canada s grappling with now as canadian prime minister justin trudeau is eyeing his own gun confiscation scheme and banning the transfer of any handguns some canadian provinces are rejecting the heavy handed measures sadly history is replete with examples of regimes that took away its citizens firearms only to become tyrannical and turn their citizens into defenseless subjects those that fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them our founding fathers in the declaration of independence expressed their fear of a tyrannical government and enshrined our right to keep and bear arms for self defense in the bill of rights for a reason brooks is wrong to think that ridding ourselves of rights and lawful gun ownership would reduce crime the answer to rampant crime is more law enforcement the changes needed to safeguard america s communities don t begin with turning our backs on freedoms it starts with holding elected officials in the white house congress state capitols and district attorneys responsible for not enforcing the law and failing to hold criminals accountable brooks notion is a devil s bargain americans know it surrendering freedom has never resulted in anything less than creating a society of victims about nssf nssf is the trade association for the firearm industry its

medical device stocks potential gold mines or land mines medical device stocks are a very heterogeneous sector mike polark cfa is a director and senior analyst at wolfe research llc covering the medical device industry mr polark joined wolfe research after nearly 10 years with baird in this 2 870 word interview exclusively in the wall street transcript this month mr polark details his top picks and reasoning behind them in the worst of the pandemic surgical procedure volumes were net negatively impacted there were fewer surgeries done there were fewer physician office visits done so let me put it this way this group was not a covid beneficiary defined at the highest level covid created a headwind and so that was very much the story of 2020 and even some of 2021 i think we re obviously beyond the acute phase of covid and now we re kind of in a covid endemic world and covid is still creating some challenges they re less severe than they were but it s still a struggle for hospitals and health care providers and so yes i think the other way to frame it is if you were in 2019 and we re pre covid and you were projecting surgical procedure volumes in 2022 or 2023 and then you go to look where we are now with covid we re below where you would have thought we d be where you would have thought we d been in 2019 so we re still underperforming as a consequence of the pandemic and i don t think there s an overnight fix it s not going to catch up all of a sudden even if the patient demand is there and i think the reason it might struggle to catch up is because of the supply side the providers that help the hospitals the physician offices they just don t have enough bandwidth to allow all this potential pent up demand to come back all of a sudden and so it can be smoother sailing from here for sure versus what we ve had the last couple years but a lot of folks like to talk about the backlog or the pent up demand for health care services of all types because of covid and i conceptually believe that it s there but i also don t believe it can all of a sudden come back because of these supply constraints inflation is also a concern for medical device stocks as well as covid 19 inflation certainly it s a consideration a headwind that companies are working through at the highest level it seems to be more acute in companies that make equipment versus interventional products but i think the impacts are broad and i think what these companies are attempting to do and this includes the biggest of the med device companies like medtronic nyse mdt and boston scientific nyse bsx and abbott nyse abt that i follow historically they have not captured price increases historically their model was pricing each year flat to down a little bit and that seemed to work for their business when the cpi was 2 or 3 cpi is now 5 6 7 8 and pricing flat to down is no longer supportive of their overall business goals and so they are attempting to again at the highest level at the portfolio level to reorient and start to advocate for some modest price increases where appropriate and so i think you can only turn the aircraft carrier so fast it s slow to develop but the goal is that if historically pre covid your pricing was 1 or 2 at the enterprise level today i m sensing they kind of want it to be 1 or 2 given where cpi is to cover their costs and so that s how the industry is responding to clearly increased costs that they re facing innovation in automation is essential to the medical device stock sector robot assisted surgery is a major development all sorts of ways to advance minimally invasive surgical procedures continue to get adopted so robots are a piece of that but there are other tools and techniques in cardiovascular medicine that can further minimize the exposure for patients the amount of time they stay in the hospital you think about a procedure like tavr transcatheter aortic valve replacement a huge home run for the industry broadly the standard of care 10 years ago was surgical aortic valve replacement which is an open chest procedure and if you can avoid stopping a heart and opening the chest you would and tavr came along and allowed all sorts of aortic valves to get replaced without that intense intervention same for coronary angioplasty so this is a catheter based technique to clear out blocked coronary arteries the alternative is coronary artery bypass grafting which is an open chest procedure so open chest procedures still have their role in the field they re still used but you re seeing interventional cardiology these catheter based techniques where you access the heart from a blood vessel in the leg are continuing to ramp in popularity and adoption further medical device innovation is in the close tracking of bodily functions a different trend is smart sensors think about wearables defined broadly certainly you re seeing wearables play a bigger and bigger role in health care both in the hospital setting and outside the hospital setting certainly the consumer wearables ecosystem is massive but when i talk about wearables i m focused on companies with fda clearances medical grade wearables and you re seeing these devices really increase in popularity and use and i think the long term vision is more of this and more ways to watch patients monitor patients outside the hospital especially patients with chronic conditions and then you see wearables really change the paradigm in diseases like diabetes management the continuous glucose monitor patch based insulin pumps with huge benefits to patients and their daily living and you re really seeing companies that sell those devices have huge surges in their revenue performance one medical device stock that fits this thesis is masimo i like masimo nasdaq masi it s a mid cap stock 7 billion 8 billion in market cap it s a smart sensor company they have leading market share in the hospital for certain vital signs monitoring of respiratory vital signs so they re the global leader in hospital based pulse oximetry and they have some interesting opportunities outside the hospital in the home to help hospitals and health care systems watch patients more closely the stock has come down a lot this year they ve done an acquisition that s a little confusing but that s created an opportunity in valuation and i ve advocated for a sum of the parts approach to this stock and i don t think you re paying up too much for a really high quality core business at this point so you re getting it relative to this company s 10 year history you re getting the opportunity to invest in the core business at a below average multiple one recognizable medical device sector stock that is not high on mr polark s list is abbott i have an underperform rating on abbott laboratories abbott is a very large company they do a lot of stuff they have some great brands abbott a good company i just think right now it feels like a potentially bad stock and the primary issue for me or the primary concern for me is that the last two years they have had a surge in profit from covid testing they sell rapid tests like binaxnow here in the u s and obviously that s taken off so when you look at the last two years of financial performance it looks really good and differentiated versus other med techs through the pandemic but it seemingly was driven predominantly by the covid testing and we re coming down from the covid testing mountain top and i think we ve seen the peak there and i just worry as the next year or two unfolds as we enter a new normal or a new era of covid with maybe less testing generally obviously we re seeing the molecular testing go way down and i worry that the rapid testing might see a similar decline it creates a tough dynamic for their income statement to manage through that huge pop which is then kind of deflating i do a lot of work around what is the business earning otherwise and i just think that number is maybe not as high as some folks think and using an average valuation has gotten me a stock price that s been consistently a bit below where it s traded so it s not a table pounder but i do think as 2023 unfolds this whole covid testing tide going out will be more visible in the numbers and i just worry that it ll result in a little bit of a further reset of the stock price so that s one that i m kind of differentially cautious on vijay kumar is a senior managing director on evercore isi s healthcare services technology research team primarily focusing on the medical supplies and devices and life science tools subsector dr kumar s research expertise spans the diagnostic medical equipment medical supplies and life science tools subgroups in this june 10 2022 2 430 word

by tyler clifford new york reuters new york city s mayor eric adams on thursday unveiled a plan to boost its housing supply by 500 000 dwellings over the next decade by easing regulations for home builders and cutting construction time in half the goal is to combat declining affordability of housing in the city the nation s largest with nearly 8 5 million residents and ranking among its costliest rental and real estate markets with the plan adams pledged to more than double the number of homes developed in the city in the past 10 years new york s housing stock grew by 200 000 in those years while the city s residential population increased by 800 000 he said in announcing the plan we have more people than homes this shortage gives landlords the power to charge any price they want and leaves too many new yorkers with no place to go said adams a former new york city police captain who took office last january that needs to change adams who has focused much of his first year in office on the issues of rising crime and homelessness called for more than 100 changes to government policies that he blamed for slowing down house construction the changes include reforms to the environmental quality review zoning approval and building permit processes the mayor also proposed legalizing existing basement apartment units converting unused office buildings into housing and exempting small housing projects from often lengthy environmental reviews the plan also seeks to authorize the city to finance and preserve more affordable housing units if we do not deal with this housing crisis new york will no longer be a city for working people for families for immigrants or for elders adams said median rental prices in new york s manhattan borough topped 4 000 a month in november a nearly 20 increase from a year ago according to a monthly report by douglas elliman and miller samuel they were above 3 000 a month in brooklyn and queens reporting by tyler clifford in new york editing by john stonestreet

listen to this article listen to this article fort worth texas treasury secretary janet yellen on thursday helped mark a milestone in u s history when she held up a newly minted 5 bill signed for the first time ever by two women yellen s signature will appear alongside that of u s treasurer lynn malerba the first native american in that position yellen joked during a stop in texas about the bad handwriting of some of her male predecessors and said i will admit i spent some quality time practicing my signature two women on the currency for the first time is truly momentous added malerba who traveled with yellen to a bureau of engraving and printing facility in fort worth to provide their signatures they ceremonially signed fresh sheets of bills in 1 and 5 denominations and posed with samples to mark the history making moment the new notes will go into circulation next year yellen made her reputation as a stoic chair of the federal reserve and a shrewd forecaster and now is at the forefront of far flung efforts to use economic levers to help stop russia s war in ukraine employ tax policy to protect the planet from climate change and oversee a massive effort to strengthen the beleaguered irs that puts her at the center of domestic and global politics inviting new levels of pressure and second guessing by friends and foes she is tackling this challenge as the united states is suffering from inflation that hit a 40 year high this summer and sowed fears of a coming recession even as yellen watched the fresh bills carrying her signature roll out at the bureau of engraving and printing s western currency facility her remarks focused on biden administration policy accomplishments rather than her status as the first woman to serve as treasury secretary on the ukraine conflict instigated last february by russian president vladimir putin she said together with over 30 countries we have denied russia revenue and resources it needs to fight its war as for the domestic economy she said pandemic relief and a new law to boost production of semiconductors have positioned the u s to capitalize on a wave of economic opportunities for the american people including in communities often overlooked later talking to reporters yellen said she thinks the u s can avoid a recession obviously there are risks that the economy faces but i think we re not in a wage price spiral supply chain bottlenecks are clearly beginning to ease that s helpful she said i believe we re on the right track in terms of lowering inflation and a recession is not inevitable now two years into joe biden s presidency yellen has put to rest rumors she might be ready to leave the administration early and is strapping in for more economic as well as political battles ahead along with managing treasury s role in the ukraine war she faces the herculean task of revitalizing an irs that is getting a 80 billion funding boost and enforcing an anti money laundering effort that requires documenting the beneficial owners of tens of millions of u s businesses in hopes of crushing corruption around the world she occupies an increasingly politicized role in which congress and foreign governments matter as much as the financial markets her treasury department is seeking to hobble the russian economy with an oil price cap as house republican leader kevin mccarthy of california is questioning the level of u s support for ukraine the treasury is also putting together tens of billions in tax incentives to address climate change that have rankled some european allies and proved controversial with republicans and the wage gains in the most recent u s jobs report suggest the economy might have to endure more pain than expected to bring inflation back to the fed s target of 2 annually along the way yellen has not shied away from controversy or speaking her mind on issues that many americans look at solely through a cultural lens when sen tim scott r s c at a may congressional hearing told yellen she was harsh for speaking about the positive economic impacts of abortion access for women she replied this is not harsh this is the truth she also has challenged the view that havens for hidden cash lie outside the u s instead arguing that the u s has become the best place to hide illicitly obtained money yellen generated some tension with the white house this year when she veered somewhat from biden s insistence that his 1 9 trillion in coronavirus aid package did not contribute to inflation republican lawmakers have drawn on analyses by major economists such as harvard university s larry summers to say that the sum was excessive and sparked inflation breakages in the global supply chain and a jump in food and energy costs after russia invaded ukraine also have contributed to boosting prices to uncomfortable levels putting the economy at heightened risk of a recession yellen acknowledged on cnn in may that she had been wrong then about the path that inflation would take biden said he had been apprised of the possible risks of inflation when putting together the relief package but he told the associated press in an interview that the idea that it caused inflation is bizarre yellen s predictions at the treasury about financial markets on other points have been proved accurate her warnings about the risks of a deregulated cryptocurrency market foresaw the recent chaos crypto markets have seen at least two major crashes dozens of scams ponzi schemes and hundreds of billions of dollars made and evaporated overnight yellen has also used her platform as a top government official to warn that despite women s advancements in the workplace a glass ceiling prevents many from advancing to the very top positions yellen the only person ever to lead the treasury department the federal reserve and white house council of economic advisers still gets flak from members of both political parties for not being more dynamic and politically savvy at times and for being too direct at other times summers treasury secretary under president bill clinton said in a statement to the associated press that yellen continues a remarkable career in economic policy at the us treasury department no other treasury secretary has had a deeper commitment to social justice as a central goal of macro and financial policies the praise comes as summers has leveled criticism at the biden administration for the size of its coronavirus relief saying its excesses flooded the economy with money and pushed up prices he has argued that the fed must continue to raise rates to reduce inflation an action that could push the u s and other nations into recession anusha chari an economist who chairs the american economic association s committee on the status of women in the economics profession calls yellen s signature on u s currency a huge milestone but it also shows us how far we have to go the treasury department was created in 1789 and until yellen only white men had led it

see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements except as otherwise indicated references to we us our and the company refer to bullfrog ai holdings inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries business overview most new therapeutics will fail at some point in preclinical or clinical development this is the primary driver of the high cost of developing new therapeutics a major part of the difficulty in developing new therapeutics is efficient integration of complex and highly dimensional data generated at each stage of development to de risk subsequent stages of the development process artificial intelligence and machine learning ai ml has emerged as a digital solution to help address this problem we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to advance medicines for both internal and external projects we are committed to increasing the probability of success and decreasing the time and cost involved in developing therapeutics most current ai ml platforms still fall short in their ability to synthesize disparate high dimensional data for actionable insight our platform technology named bfleap is an analytical ai ml platform derived from technology developed at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory jhu apl which is able to surmount the challenges of scalability and flexibility currently hindering researchers and clinicians by providing a more precise1 multi dimensional understanding of their data we are deploying bfleap for use at several critical stages of development for internal programs and through strategic partnerships and collaborations with the intention of streamlining data analytics in therapeutics development decreasing the overall development costs by decreasing failure rates for new therapeutics and impacting the lives of countless patients that may otherwise not receive the therapies they need the bfleap platform utilizes both supervised and unsupervised machine learning as such it is able to reveal real meaningful connections in the data without the need for a prior hypothesis supervised machine learning uses labeled input and output data while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not in supervised learning the algorithm learns from the training dataset by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer unsupervised learning also known as unsupervised machine learning uses machine learning algorithms to analyze and cluster unlabeled datasets these algorithms discover hidden patterns or data groupings without the need for human intervention algorithms used in the bfleap platform are designed to handle highly imbalanced data sets to successfully identify combinations of factors that are associated with outcomes of interest together with our strategic partners and collaborators our primary goal is to improve the odds of success at any stage of pre clinical and clinical therapeutics development our primary business model is improving the success and efficiency of drug development which is accomplished either through acquisition of drugs or partnerships and collaborations with companies that are developing drugs we hope to accomplish this through strategic acquisitions of current clinical stage and failed drugs for in house development or through strategic partnerships with biopharmaceutical industry companies we are able to pursue our drug asset enhancement business by leveraging a powerful and proven ai ml platform trade name bfleap initially derived from technology developed at jhu apl we believe the bfleap analytics platform is a potentially disruptive tool for analysis of pre clinical and or clinical data sets such as the robust pre clinical and clinical trial data sets being generated in translational r d and clinical trial settings in november 2021 we amended the agreement with jhu apl to include additional advanced ai technology on july 8 2022 the company entered into an exclusive world wide royalty bearing license from jhu apl for the additional technology developed to enhance the bfleap platform the july 8 2022 jhu apl license provides the company with new intellectual property and also encompasses most of the intellectual property from the february 2018 license we believe bfleap will inform enable decision making throughout the development cycle 1 discovery phase analyze and categorize discovery phase data to better define highest value leads from groups of candidates for advancement to preclinical phase of development integrate data from high throughput screening pharmacodynamics assays pharmacokinetics assays and other key data sets to create the most accurate profile of a pool of therapeutic candidates there is often a high degree of similarity among closely related therapeutics in a candidate pool bfleap is able to harmonize disparate data streams for a more nuanced understanding of each candidate s characteristics potency 2 pre clinical data large scale multivariate analysis of pre clinical and or early stage clinical data sets in these settings bfleap could be used to find novel drug targets elucidate mechanism of action moa predict potential off target effects side effects uncover specific genetic phenotypic background s with highest correlation to therapeutic response etc these insights from bfleap analysis can be used to inform decision making study design at the subsequent step s of therapeutic diagnostic development including first inhuman phase i rcts 1 in an august 2021 publication in deepai org the algorithms used in bfleap were compared to 10 of the most popular clustering algorithms in the world using 12 data sets the end result showed that the algorithms used in bfleap had the highest average score when measuring speed and accuracy of prediction the bfleap platform currently has more advanced versions of these algorithms and is applying them in multiple data analytics projects 1 3 clinical development advanced multivariate analysis of phi and or phii clinical trials data to find niche populations of highly responsive patients and or inform patient selection for later stage ct s this can be used to decrease overall study risk for larger clinical trials including phase ii trials and any phase iii registration clinical trials the bfleap platform analysis can also be used to more precisely understand complex correlations between therapeutic treatment and adverse events side effects and other undesirable responses which could jeopardize clinical trial success our platform is agnostic to the disease indication or treatment modality and therefore we believe that it is of value in the development of biologics or small molecules the process for our drug asset enhancement program is to acquire the rights to a drug from a biopharmaceutical industry company or academia use the proprietary bfleap ai ml platform to determine a multi factorial profile for a patient that would best respond to the drug rapidly conduct a clinical trial to validate the drug s use for the defined high responder population and divest sell the rescued drug asset with the new information back to a large player in the pharma industry following positive results of the clinical trial as part of our strategy we will continue evolving our intellectual property analytical platform and technologies build a large portfolio of drug candidates and implement a model that reduces risk and increases the frequency of cash flow from rescued drugs this strategy will include strategic partnerships collaborations and relationships along the entire drug development value chain as well as acquisitions of the rights to developing failed drugs and possibly the underlying companies to date we have not conducted clinical trials on any pharmaceutical drugs and our platform has not been used to identify a drug candidate that has received regulatory approval for commercialization however we currently have a strategic relationship with a leading rare disease non profit organization for ai ml analysis of late stage clinical data we have also positioned the company to acquire the rights to a series of preclinical and early clinical drug assets from universities as well as a strategic collaboration with a world renowned research institution to create a hsv1 viral therapeutic platform to engineer immunotherapies for a variety of diseases in addition we have signed exclusive world wide license agreements with johns hopkins university for a cancer drug that targets glioblastoma brain cancer pancreatic cancer and other cancers we have also signed an exclusive worldwide license with george washington university for another cancer drug that targets hepatoceullar carcinoma liver cancer and other liver diseases our platform was originally developed by the jhu apl jhu apl uses the same technology for applications related to national defense over several years the software and algorithms have been used to identify relationship patterns and anomalies and make predictions that otherwise may not be found these discoveries and insights provide an advantage when predicting a target of interest regardless of industry or sector we have applied the technology to various clinical data sets and have identified novel relationships that may provide new intellectual property new drug targets and other valuable information that may help with patient stratification for a clinical trial thereby improving the odds for success the platform has not yet aided in the development of a drug that has reached commercialization however we own one drug candidate that has completed a phase 1 trial and a second candidate that is in the preclinical stages our aim is to use our technology on current and future available data to help us better determine the optimal path for development while we have not generated significant revenues from our ai ml operations we anticipate generating revenue in the future from the following three sources contract services our fee for service partnership offering model is designed for biopharmaceutical companies as well as other organizations of all sizes that have challenges analyzing data throughout the drug development process we provide the customer with an analysis of large complex data sets using our proprietary artificial intelligence machine learning platform called bfleap this platform is designed to predict targets of interest patterns relationships and anomalies our service model involves a cash fee plus the potential for rights to new intellectual property generated from the analysis which can be performed at the discovery preclinical or clinical stages of drug development collaborative arrangements we plan to enter into collaborative arrangements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies who have drugs that are in development or have failed late phase 2 or phase 3 trials the collaborations may also be at the discovery or preclinical stages of drug development our revenue will be a combination of fee for service cash payments and success fees based on achieving certain milestones as determined by each specific arrangement there may also be fees or legal rights associated with the development of new intellectual property 2 acquisition of rights to certain drugs we may acquire the rights to drugs that have failed late phase 2 or phase 3 trials and generate revenues by using our platform to accurately determine the profile of patients that would respond to the drugs conduct a clinical trial to test our findings either independently or with a clinical partner and finally sell the drug back to pharmaceutical companies we have and may continue acquiring the rights to drugs that have not yet failed any trials we will use our technology to improve the chances for success conduct a trial and divest the asset when divesting assets the transaction may involve a combination of upfront payments milestone payments based on clinical success and royalties on sales of the product our bfleap analytics platform we are able to pursue our drug rescue business by leveraging a powerful and proven ai ml platform trade name bfleap derived from technology developed at the johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory jhu apl the bfleap platform is based on an exclusive world wide license granted by johns hopkins university applied physics laboratory the license covers three 3 issued patents as well as a new provisional patent application non patent rights to proprietary libraries of algorithms and other trade secrets which also includes modifications and improvements on july 8 2022 the company entered into an exclusive world wide royalty bearing license from jhu apl for the additional technology developed to enhance the bfleap platform the new license provides additional intellectual property rights including patents copyrights and knowhow to be utilized under the company s bfleap analytical ai ml platform under the terms of the new license agreement jhu will be entitled to eight 8 percent of net sales for the services provided by the company to other parties and 3 for internally development drug projects in which the jhu license was utilized the new license also contains tiered sub licensing fees that start at 50 and reduce to 25 based on revenues we believe the bfleap analytics platform is a potentially disruptive tool for analysis of pre clinical and or clinical data sets such as the robust pre clinical and clinical trial data sets being generated in translational r d and clinical trial settings the input data for bfleap can include raw data preclinical and or clinical readouts categorical data sociodemographic data of patients and various other inputs thus the bfleap platform is capable of capturing the particular genetic and physical characteristics of patients in an unbiased manner and contextualizing it against other disparate data sources from patients e g molecular data physiological data etc for less biased and more meaningful conclusions it is also uniquely scalable the bfleap platform is able to perform analysis on large high volume data sets i e big data and also able to analyze highly disparate short and wide data as well in terms of visualization bfleap is able to integrate with most commonly used visualization tools for graph analytics we believe that the combination of a scalable analytics i e large data or short wide data b state of the art proprietary algorithms c unsupervised machine learning and d streamlined data ingestion visualization makes bfleap one of the most flexible and powerful new platforms available on the market the company will continue to evolve and improve bfleap and some of the proceeds from this offering may be used toward that effort either in house or with development partners like the johns hopkins university applied physics lab summary risk factors our business is subject to numerous risks as described in the section entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this prospectus you should carefully consider these risks before making an investment some of these risks include we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our performance and accordingly our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any new company encounters in order for the company to compete and grow it must attract recruit retain and develop the necessary personnel who have the needed experience the development and commercialization of our technology products and services is highly competitive the company s success depends on the experience and skill of the board of directors its executive officers and key employees we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents and licenses in order to operate our business from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights new product development involves a lengthy expensive and complex process we may not be able to conduct clinical trials necessary to commercialize and sell our proposed products and formulations our long term viability and growth will depend upon successful clinical trials we face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies our research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies which may limit our ability to achieve profitability even if we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for new pharmaceutical products generic or branded the success of those products is dependent upon acceptance of such products particularly by the pharmaceutical industry 3 we extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start up activities in house we may not be able to acquire the rights to any failed drugs or we may not be able to rescue failed drugs through analysis due to our technology or the lack of clinical data we have no current specific plan for a significant portion of the offering proceeds and it is possible that the proceeds will be invested in a way that does not yield a favorable or any return for you implications of being an emerging growth company as a company with less than 1 07 billion in

forms a part is declared effective by the securities and exchange commission but prior to the listing of our common stock on nasdaq and the closing of the offering the reverse stock split will not occur prior to the effectiveness of this registration statement going concern the company intends to overcome the circumstances that impact its ability to remain a going concern through a combination of expanding its revenues and additional equity and debt financing the company anticipates raising additional funds through public or private financing strategic relationships or other arrangements in the near future to support its business operations however the company may not have commitments from third parties for a sufficient amount of additional capital the company cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all and its failure to raise capital when needed could limit its ability to continue its operations the company s ability to obtain additional funding will determine its ability to continue as a going concern failure to secure additional financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial performance results of operations and stock price and may require it to curtail or cease operations sell off its assets seek protection from its creditors through bankruptcy proceedings or otherwise furthermore additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of the company s common stock and debt financing if available may involve restrictive covenants and strategic relationships if necessary to raise additional funds and may require that the company relinquish valuable rights please see note 1 in our financial statements for further information the company believes that following this offering it will have sufficient capital to sustain its operations for at least the next 15 months however there can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the subsequent year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources the

securities an investor should carefully consider all of the material risks described below together with the other information contained in this prospectus we cannot assure you that any of the events discussed below will not occur these events could have a material and adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if that were to happen the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment risks related to liquidity the company s business and industry we have a limited operating history upon which you can evaluate our performance and accordingly our prospects must be considered in light of the risks that any new company encounters we were incorporated under the laws of nevada on february 26 2020 accordingly we have no significant history upon which an evaluation of our prospects and future performance can be made our proposed operations are subject to all of the business risks associated with a new enterprise the likelihood of our creation of a viable business must be considered in light of the problems expenses difficulties complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the inception of a business operation in a competitive industry and the continued development of our technology and the results of our clinical data we anticipate that our operating expenses will increase for the near future there can be no assurances that we will ever operate profitably you should consider the company s business operations and prospects in light of the risks expenses and challenges faced as an early stage company if we are unable to attract and retain key management scientific personnel and advisors we may not achieve our business objectives our success depends on the availability and contributions of members of our senior management team the loss of services of any of these individuals could delay reduce or prevent our drug development and other business objectives furthermore recruiting and retaining qualified scientific personnel to perform drug development work will be critical to our success we face intense competition for qualified individuals from numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies universities governmental entities and other public and private research institutions we may be unable to attract and retain these individuals and our failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 8 the development of our technology products and services is highly competitive we face competition with respect to any products that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future our competitors include major companies worldwide many of our competitors have significantly greater financial technical and human resources than we have and superior expertise in research and development and marketing approved products services and thus may be better equipped than us to develop and commercialize products services these competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and acquiring technologies smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies accordingly our competitors may commercialize products more rapidly or effectively than we are able to which would adversely affect our competitive position the likelihood that our products services will achieve initial market acceptance and our ability to generate meaningful additional revenues from our products from time to time third parties may claim that one or more of our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights any dispute or litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming due to the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations a claim of intellectual property infringement could force us to enter into a costly or restrictive license agreement which might not be available under acceptable terms or at all could require us to redesign our products which would be costly and time consuming and or could subject us to an injunction against development and sale of certain of our products or services we may have to pay substantial damages including damages for past infringement if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe on a third party s proprietary rights even if these claims are without merit defending a lawsuit takes significant time may be expensive and may divert management s attention from other business concerns any public announcements related to litigation or interference proceedings initiated or threatened against us could cause our business to be harmed our intellectual property portfolio may not be useful in asserting a counterclaim or negotiating a license in response to a claim of intellectual property infringement in certain of our businesses we rely on third party intellectual property licenses and we cannot ensure that these licenses will be available to us in the future on favorable terms or at all although dependent on certain key personnel the company does not have any key man life insurance policies on any such people the company is dependent on vininder singh in order to conduct its operations and execute its business plan and the loss of vininder singh or any member of the board of directors or executive officer could harm the company s business financial condition cash flow and results of operations however the company has not purchased any insurance policies with respect to those individuals in the event of their death or disability therefore if vininder singh or any member of the board of directors or an executive officer dies or become disabled the company will not receive any compensation to assist with such person s absence the loss of such person could negatively affect the company and its operations the company s business operations may be materially adversely affected by a pandemic such as the coronavirus covid 19 outbreak in december 2019 a novel strain of coronavirus was reported to have surfaced in wuhan china which spread throughout other parts of the world including the united states on january 30 2020 the world health organization declared the outbreak of the coronavirus disease covid 19 a public health emergency of international concern on january 31 2020 u s health and human services secretary alex m azar ii declared a public health emergency for the united states to aid the u s healthcare community in responding to covid 19 and on march 11 2020 the world health organization characterized the outbreak as a pandemic covid 19 resulted in a widespread health crisis that adversely affected the economies and financial markets worldwide the company s business could be materially and adversely affected the extent to which covid 19 impacts the company s business will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of covid 19 and the actions to contain covid 19 or treat its impact among others if the disruptions posed by covid 19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extended period of time the company s operations may be materially adversely affected a chief concern related to such events is that they could cause a disruption to our clinical trials 9 new product development involves a lengthy expensive and complex process we may be unable to develop or commercialize any product candidates moreover even if we develop such candidates they may be subject to significant regulatory review approval and other government regulations there can be no assurance that our technologies will be capable of developing and commercializing products at all new product development involves a lengthy expensive and complex process and we currently have no fully validated diagnostic candidates in addition before we can commercialize any new product candidates we will need to conduct substantial research and development conduct validation studies expend significant funds develop and scale up our laboratory processes and obtain regulatory approval and acceptance of our product candidates this process involves a high degree of risk and takes several years our product development efforts may fail for many reasons including failure of the product at the research or development stage and lack of clinical validation data to support the effectiveness of the product few research and development projects result in commercial products and perceived viability in early clinical trials often is not replicated in later studies at any point we may abandon development of a product candidate or we may be required to expend considerable resources repeating clinical trials which would adversely impact the timing for generating potential revenues from those product candidates in addition as we develop product candidates we will have to make significant investments in product development marketing and sales resources we may not be able to conduct clinical trials necessary to increase the value of our proposed products and formulations in order to conduct clinical trials that are necessary to obtain approval of a product by the fda it is necessary to receive clearance from the fda to conduct such clinical trials the fda can halt clinical trials at any time for safety reasons or because we or our clinical investigators do not follow the fda s requirements for conducting clinical trials if we are unable to receive clearance to conduct clinical trials or the trials are halted by the fda the likelihood of our ability to sell or license our products would be greatly reduced as it is the fda approval which will enhance the value of our products our ability to resell and or license our products will depend upon successful clinical trials only a small number of research and development programs result in the development of a product that obtains fda approval success in preclinical work or early stage clinical trials does not ensure that later stage or larger scale clinical trials will be successful conducting clinical trials is a complex time consuming and expensive process our ability to complete our clinical trials in a timely fashion depends in large part on a number of key factors including protocol design regulatory and institutional review board approval the rate of patient enrollment in clinical trials and compliance with extensive current good clinical practices if we fail to adequately manage the design execution and regulatory aspects of our clinical trials our studies and ultimately our regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates clinical trials may indicate that our product candidates have harmful side effects or raise other safety concerns that may significantly reduce the likelihood of regulatory approval result in significant restrictions on use and safety warnings in any approved label adversely affect placement within the treatment paradigm or otherwise significantly diminish the commercial potential of the product candidate also positive results in a registrational trial may not be replicated in any subsequent confirmatory trials even if later stage clinical trials are successful regulatory authorities may disagree with our view of the data or require additional studies and may fail to approve or delay approval of our product candidates or may grant marketing approval that is more restricted than anticipated including indications for a narrower patient population than expected and the imposition of safety monitoring or educational requirements or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies in addition if another company is the first to file for marketing approval of a competing drug candidate that company may ultimately receive marketing exclusivity for its drug candidate thereby reducing the value of our product 10 we face significant competition from other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies while we believe that our technology development experience and scientific knowledge provide competitive advantages we face potential competition from many different sources including major pharmaceutical specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the development of drug candidates as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those drug candidates in the united states and in foreign countries mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries our competitors may succeed in developing acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis drug candidates that are more effective or less costly than any drug candidate that we may develop our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to identify drugs that have suffered set backs in the clinical development and regulatory process which we believe can be assisted by our platform s ability to design a better study group attract qualified scientific product development and commercial personnel obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our drugs and technologies obtain required regulatory approvals successfully collaborate with pharmaceutical companies in the discovery development and commercialization of new drugs and negotiate competitive pricing and reimbursement with third party payors the availability of our competitors technologies could limit the demand and the price we are able to charge for our services and for any drug candidate we develop the inability to compete with existing or subsequently introduced drug development technologies would have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and prospects established pharmaceutical companies and research institutions may invest heavily to accelerate discovery and development of novel compounds or to in license novel compounds that could make bfleap less competitive which would have a material adverse impact on our business we may not be able to acquire the rights to any failed drugs or we may not be able to rescue failed drugs through analysis due to our technology or the lack of clinical data our business model is based on the use of ai ml technology which technology may not uncover actionable insights or we may not be able to access sufficient clinical data to uncover such insights that lead to a successful project clinical trial or product the failure of such projects clinical trials or products would result in a loss of revenue from one of our three sources which could have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole we may not succeed in acquiring the rights to failed drugs which could limit one of our main sources of revenue our business model is partly based on our ability to acquire drugs that have failed to pass phase 2 or phase 3 of the fda approval process however there is no guarantee that we will be able to acquire the rights to such drugs which would significantly impact our ability to generate revenue and as a result would have a material adverse impact on our business we intend to invest in early stage experimental technologies which have a high risk of failure to continue supporting our business model we intend to invest in early stage and experimental technologies some or all of which may not be useful to us there is a risk that we will invest in technology that will not ultimately contribute to the success of our projects which could have a material adverse impact on our business we are dependent on our collaborative agreements for the development of products and business development which exposes us to the risk of reliance on the viability of third parties in conducting our research and development activities we currently rely and will in the future rely on collaborative agreements with third parties such as manufacturers contract research organizations commercial partners universities governmental agencies and not for profit organizations for both strategic and financial resources the loss of or failure to perform by us or our partners under any applicable agreements or arrangements or our failure to secure additional agreements for other products in development would substantially disrupt or delay our research and development and commercialization activities any such loss would likely increase our expenses and materially harm our business financial condition and results of operation 11 we extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start up activities in house we rely on independent third party contract research organizations cros to perform most of our clinical studies including document preparation site identification screening and preparation pre study visits training program management and bioanalytical analysis many important aspects of the services performed for us by the cros are out of our direct control if there is any dispute or disruption in our relationship with our cros our clinical trials may be delayed moreover in our regulatory submissions we rely on the quality and validity of the clinical work performed by third party cros if any of our cros processes methodologies or results were determined to be invalid or inadequate our own clinical data and results and related regulatory approvals could be adversely impacted we are a biotechnology company with no significant revenue we have incurred operating losses since our inception and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception to date we have not generated any revenue and we may not generate any revenue from sales of our clinical analytics services or drug candidates for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to incur significant operating losses and we anticipate that our losses may increase substantially as we expand our drug development programs to achieve profitability we must successfully develop and obtain regulatory approval for one or more of drugs and effectively commercialize any drugs we develop even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more drug candidates we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue and we may never be able to achieve or sustain profitability we will continue to require additional capital for the foreseeable future if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed we may be forced to delay reduce or eliminate our drug acquisition efforts we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses in connection with our ongoing activities including conducting clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval of drug candidates our ongoing future capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including the rate of progress results and costs of completion of clinical trials of drug candidates the size scope rate of progress results and costs of completion of any potential future clinical trials and preclinical tests of our drug candidates that we may initiate the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of drug candidates the scope prioritization and number of drug development programs we pursue the costs for preparing filing prosecuting maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property related claims the extent to which we acquire or in license other products and technologies and the costs to be able to obtain regulatory approval of such products our ability to establish strategic collaborations and licensing or other arrangements on terms favorable to us and competing technological and market developments any additional fundraising efforts may divert our management from their day to day activities which may adversely affect our ability to identify and acquire new drug candidates and to further the regulatory process of such products our ability to raise additional funds will depend in part on the success of our product development activities and other factors related to financial economic and market conditions many of which are beyond our control there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital when needed or on terms that are favorable to us if at all if adequate funds are not available on a timely basis we may be forced to delay reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our drug development programs 12 limit the amount of new products that we acquire or relinquish license or otherwise dispose of rights on terms that are less favorable than if we were able to further the regulatory approval process or liquidate and dissolve the company if our operating plans change we may require additional capital sooner than planned such additional financing may not be available when needed or on terms favorable to us in addition we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current and future operating plan we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber attack or other breach of our systems or those of third parties on whom we may rely could subject us to liability or interrupt the operation of our business we are increasingly dependent on information technology systems to operate our business a breakdown invasion corruption destruction or interruption of critical information technology systems by employees others with authorized access to our systems or unauthorized persons could negatively impact operations in the ordinary course of business we collect store and transmit confidential information and it is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality and integrity of such information additionally we outsource certain elements of our information technology systems to third parties as a result of this outsourcing our third party vendors may or could have access to our confidential information making such systems vulnerable data breaches of our information technology systems or those of our third party vendors may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public for example the loss of clinical trial data from completed or ongoing clinical trials or preclinical studies could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data while we believe that we have taken appropriate security measures to protect our data and information technology systems and have been informed by our third party vendors that they have as well there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems or those of our third party vendors that could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition we must complete extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates if we are unable to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our drug candidates we will not be successful the success of our business depends primarily on our ability to further the regulatory approval process to increase the value of our drug candidates drug candidates must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved for sale which greatly enhances their value to satisfy these standards we must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of drug candidates we may not be able to obtain authority from the fda or other equivalent foreign regulatory agencies to move on to further efficacy segments of the phase 2 or phase 3 clinical trials or commence and complete any clinical trials for any of our drug candidates positive results in preclinical studies of a drug candidate may not be predictive of similar results in human clinical trials and promising results from early clinical trials of a drug candidate may not be replicated in later clinical trials a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in early stage development accordingly the results from the preclinical tests or clinical trials for our drug candidates may not be predictive of the results we may obtain in later stage trials the failure of clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of one or more of our drug candidates will have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition delays in the commencement of clinical trials of our drug candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to successfully license or sell such products our drug candidates will require continued extensive clinical trials to increase the value and desirability of the products because of the nature of clinical trials we do not know whether future planned clinical trials will begin on time if at all delays in the commencement of clinical trials could significantly increase our drug development costs and delay our ability to successfully sell or license our drug candidates in addition many of the factors that may cause or lead to a delay in the commencement of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to denial of regulatory approval of a drug candidate the commencement of clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons including delays in demonstrating sufficient safety and efficacy in past clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval to commence a further clinical trial 13 convincing the fda that we have selected valid endpoints for use in proposed clinical trials and obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site in addition the commencement of clinical trials may be delayed due to insufficient patient enrollment which is a function of many factors including the size of the patient population the nature of the protocol the proximity of patients to clinical sites the availability of effective treatments for the relevant disease and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial if we are unable to obtain u s and or foreign regulatory approval we will be unable to resell or license our drug candidates our drug candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to among other things research testing development manufacturing safety efficacy record keeping labeling marketing and distribution of drugs rigorous preclinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process are required in the u s and in many foreign jurisdictions prior to the commercial sale of drug candidates satisfaction of these and other regulatory requirements is costly time consuming uncertain and subject to unanticipated delays it is possible that no drug candidate that we present to the fda will obtain marketing approval which will significantly diminish the value and desirability of our product candidates in connection with the clinical trials for our drug candidates we face risks that the drug candidate may not prove to be efficacious the drug candidate may not prove to be safe the drug candidate may not be readily co administered or combined with other drugs or drug candidates the results may not confirm the positive results from earlier preclinical studies or clinical trials the results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the fda or other regulatory agencies and the fda or other regulatory agencies may require us to carry out additional studies we have limited experience in conducting and managing later stage clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approvals including approval by the fda however this risk would be mitigated in the event the company is successful entering into a co development agreement with a pharma partner for late stage clinical development the time required to complete clinical trials and for the fda and other countries regulatory review processes is uncertain and typically takes many years our analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical trials is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities which could delay limit or prevent regulatory approval we may also encounter unanticipated delays or increased costs due to government regulation from future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy during the period of product development clinical trials and fda regulatory review we will rely on third parties for manufacturing of our clinical drug supplies our dependence on these manufacturers may impair the development of our drug candidates we have no ability to internally manufacture the drug candidates that we need to conduct our clinical trials for the products that we acquire for the foreseeable future we expect to continue to rely on third party manufacturers and other third parties to produce package and store sufficient quantities of our drug candidates and any future drug candidates for use in our clinical trials we may face various risks and uncertainties in connection with our reliance on third party manufacturers including reliance on third party manufactures for regulatory compliance and quality assurance the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party manufacturer because of factors beyond our control the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of our manufacturing agreement by the third party manufacturer at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us the potential that third party manufacturers will develop know how owned by such third party manufacturer in connection with the production of our drug candidates that is necessary for the manufacture of our drug candidates and reliance on third party manufacturers to assist us in preventing inadvertent disclosure or theft of our proprietary knowledge 14 our drug candidates may be complicated and expensive to manufacture if our third party manufacturers fail to deliver our drug candidates for clinical use on a timely basis with sufficient quality and at commercially reasonable prices we may be required to delay or suspend clinical trials or otherwise discontinue development of our drug candidates while we may be able to identify replacement third party manufacturers or develop our own manufacturing capabilities for these drug candidates this process would likely cause a delay in the availability of our drug candidates and an increase in costs in addition third party manufacturers may have a limited number of facilities in which our drug candidates can be manufactured and any interruption of the operation of those facilities due to events such as equipment malfunction or failure or damage to the facility by natural disasters could result in the cancellation of shipments loss of product in the manufacturing process or a shortfall in available drug candidates we may rely on technology solution partners for the development and deployment of our ai technology our partners may experience technical financial operational or security issues that reduce or eliminate their ability to support the company this could prevent the company from generating revenue and eliminate our ability to operate in addition to the risks listed above businesses are often subject to risks not foreseen or fully appreciated by the management it is not possible to foresee all risks that may affect us moreover the company cannot predict whether the company will successfully effectuate the company s current business plan each prospective purchaser is encouraged to carefully analyze the risks and merits of an investment in the securities and should take into consideration when making such analysis among other the risk factors discussed above risks related to intellectual property rights we rely on various intellectual property rights including patents and licenses in order to operate our business our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage in addition the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged invalidated circumvented or designed around particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected in some circumstances enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property could adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations we also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees consultants and other parties to protect in part trade secrets and other proprietary rights there can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect our trade secrets and other proprietary rights and will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or other proprietary rights as we expand our business protecting our intellectual property will become increasingly important the protective steps we have taken may be inadequate to deter our competitors from using our proprietary information in order to protect or enforce our patent rights we may be required to initiate litigation against third parties such as infringement lawsuits also these third parties may assert claims against us with or without provocation these lawsuits could be expensive take significant time and could divert management s attention from other business concerns the law relating to the scope and validity of claims in the technology field in which we operate is still evolving and consequently intellectual property positions in our industry are generally uncertain we cannot assure you that we will prevail in any of these potential suits or that the damages or other remedies awarded if any would be commercially valuable 15 the company could be negatively impacted if found to have infringed on intellectual property rights technology companies including many of the company s competitors frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights in addition patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained as the company grows the intellectual property rights claims against it will likely increase the company intends to vigorously defend infringement actions in court and before the u s international trade commission the plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages regardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants the company may have to engage in protracted litigation if the company is found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights regardless of whether it can develop non infringing technology it may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party or it may be subject to a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting the company from marketing or selling certain products in certain cases the company may consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur these licenses may also significantly increase the company s operating expenses regardless of the merit of particular claims litigation may be expensive time consuming disruptive to the company s operations and distracting to management in recognition of these considerations the company may enter into arrangements to settle litigation if one or more legal matters were resolved against the company s consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected further such an outcome could result in significant compensatory punitive or trebled monetary damages disgorgement of revenue or profits remedial corporate measures or injunctive relief against the company that could adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations we rely heavily on our technology and intellectual property but we may be unable to adequately or cost effectively protect or enforce our intellectual property rights thereby weakening our competitive position and increasing operating costs to protect our rights in our services and technology we rely on a combination of copyright and trademark laws patents trade secrets confidentiality agreements and protective contractual provisions we also rely on laws pertaining to trademarks and domain names to protect the value of our corporate brands and reputation despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services or technology obtain and use information marks or technology that we regard as proprietary or otherwise violate or infringe our intellectual property rights in addition it is possible that others could independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property if we do not effectively protect our intellectual property or if others independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property our competitive position could be weakened effectively policing the unauthorized use of our services and technology is time consuming and costly and the steps taken by us may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or other proprietary assets the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective and unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our services use similar marks or domain names or obtain and use information marks or technology that we regard as proprietary we may have to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of others proprietary rights which are sometimes not clear or may change litigation can be time consuming and expensive and the outcome can be difficult to predict we rely on agreements with third parties to provide certain services goods technology and intellectual property rights necessary to enable us to implement some of our applications our ability to implement and provide our applications and services to our clients depends in part on services goods technology and intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties these third parties may become unable to or refuse to continue to provide these services goods technology or intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms consistent with our business practices or otherwise discontinue a service important for us to continue to operate our applications if we fail to replace these services goods technologies or intellectual property rights in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms our operating results and financial condition could be harmed in addition we exercise limited control over our third party vendors which increases our vulnerability to problems with technology and services those vendors provide if the services technology or intellectual property of third parties were to fail to perform as expected it could subject us to potential liability adversely affect our renewal rates and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations if any third party owners of intellectual property we may license in the future do not properly maintain or enforce the patents underlying such licenses our competitive position and business prospects will be harmed we may enter into licenses for third party intellectual property in the future our success will depend in part on the ability of our licensors to obtain maintain and enforce patent protection for their intellectual property in particular those patents to which we have secured exclusive rights 16 if applicable our licensors may not successfully prosecute the patent applications to which we are licensed even if patents issue in respect of any such patent applications our licensors may fail to maintain these patents may determine not to pursue litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents or may pursue such litigation less aggressively than we would in addition our licensors may terminate their agreements with us in the event we breach the applicable license agreement and fail to cure the breach within a specified period of time without protection for the intellectual property we license other companies might be able to offer substantially identical products for sale which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position business prospects and financial condition because our research and development of drug candidates often incorporates compounds and other information that is the intellectual property of third parties we depend on continued access to such intellectual property to conduct and complete our preclinical and clinical research and commercialize the drug candidates that result from this research we expect that future licenses would impose numerous obligations on us for example under our existing and future license agreements we may be required to pay i annual maintenance fees until a drug candidate is sold for the first time ii running royalties on net sales of drug candidates iii minimum annual royalties after a drug candidate is sold for the first time and iv one time payments upon the achievement of specified milestones we may also be required to reimburse patent costs incurred by the licensor or we may be obligated to pay additional royalties at specified rates based on net sales of our drug candidates that incorporate the licensed intellectual property rights we may also be obligated under some of these agreements to pay a percentage of any future sublicensing revenues that we may receive future license agreements may also include payment obligations such as milestone payments or minimum expenditures for research and development we expect that any future licenses would contain reporting insurance and indemnification requirements we are actively reviewing and preparing additional patent applications to expand our patent portfolio but there can be no assurances that patents related to our existing patent applications or any applications we may file in the future will be issued or that any issued patents will provide meaningful protection for our drug candidates which could materially adversely affect our competitive business position business prospects and financial condition confidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property we rely on trade secrets to protect our technology especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable however trade secrets are difficult to protect in order to protect our proprietary technology and processes we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners employees consultants outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information nor result in the effective assignment to us of intellectual property and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or other breaches of the agreements in addition others may independently discover our trade secrets and proprietary information and in such case we could not assert any trade secret rights against such party enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable in addition courts outside the u s may be less willing to protect trade secrets costly and time consuming litigation could be necessary to seek to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights and failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition risks related to ownership of our securities and this offering the market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and you could lose all or part of your investment the trading price of our common stock is likely to be volatile upon the consummation of this offering we will have a relatively small public float due to the relatively small size of this offering and the concentrated ownership of our common stock among our executive officers and directors and greater than 5 stockholders as a result of our small public float our common stock may be less liquid and have greater stock price volatility than the common stock of companies with broader public ownership our stock price could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of other factors which include whether we achieve our anticipated corporate objectives changes in financial or operational estimates or projections termination of the lock up agreement or other restrictions on the ability of our stockholders and other security holders to sell shares after this offering and general economic or political conditions in the united states or elsewhere in addition the stock market in general has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies such rapid and substantial price volatility including any stock run up may be unrelated to our actual or expected operating performance and financial condition or prospects making it difficult for prospective investors to assess the rapidly changing value of our stock this volatility may prevent you from being able to sell your securities at or above the price you paid for your securities if the market price of our common st

photo credit andy dean photography shutterstock the housing market is entering the traditionally quieter winter season but recent indicators suggest that the market has already been slowing in the last few months new listings pending sales and prices are all on the decline signs of rapid cooling after a two year frenzy in the market one of the primary factors driving the slowing of the market has been inflation including for housing costs during the covid 19 pandemic the median home sale price in the u s increased by more than 38 from 329 000 in the first quarter of 2020 to 454 900 in the third quarter of 2022 and as home prices have rapidly become more expensive so has everything else inflation as measured by the consumer price index has topped 5 for 18 straight months driven by increases in major expenses like food and rent the effects of inflation have left potential buyers with less ability to save up for a purchase adding to this pressure is an increase in interest rates the u s federal reserve has engaged in aggressive rate hikes throughout 2022 to curb inflation and mortgage lenders have pushed up rates for consumers as a result the average interest rate for a 30 year fixed rate mortgage has increased from around 3 at the end of 2021 to about 6 5 now in october the average 30 year rate briefly passed 7 for the first time since before the great recession as a result of these factors total home sales per month have been down year over year for every month in 2022 and the gap between 2021 and 2022 monthly figures has widened as the year has gone on in october 2022 home sales fell to 439 596 a decline of nearly 30 as total sales have declined another important metric the time homes sit on the market before selling is on the rise september was the first month since february 2021 where the median days on market for home listings exceeded 30 days at the height of the market the typical listing spent just 15 days on the market but today the median listing will sit on the market for 35 days few places have escaped the slowing of the market but some locations are experiencing especially stark drops in activity nine of the top 10 states with the steepest drops in home sales from 2021 to 2022 are found in the western u s led by utah with a 43 2 decline the region includes expensive states for housing like california 37 4 and washington 36 7 along with states that boomed during the pandemic like nevada 40 8 arizona 37 0 and idaho 35 4 local markets in the western region are also among the nation s leaders in decreased home sales the data

president joe biden announced thursday he s bailing out a struggling union pension fund with 36 billion of taxpayer money the largest federal bailout of a pension fund ever the central states pension fund which provides benefits to teamsters union members in the trucking warehouse and construction industries was projected to run out of money by 2025 due to rising inflation weak stock markets and a lack of active workers participating in the fund the washington times reported biden plans to save the fund from insolvency by using money from his 1 9 trillion dollar american rescue plan which even democrat lawmakers admit caused the country s record high inflation the announcement comes a week after biden upset rail workers by not backing their strike to fight for paid sick leave blowing his campaign commitment to become the most pro union president in u s history ensuring that workers and their families enjoy the retirement security they earned through a lifetime of work is a central part of president biden s economic plan the white house said president biden is building the economy from the bottom up and middle out including helping to ensure a dignified retirement for all american workers and their families george mason university s charles blahous said the bailouts encourage more of the irresponsible behavior that got pensions into trouble in the first place the central states pension fund spends more than 2 billion per year more than it is taking in from contributions according to the times without biden s bailout the fund would have cut teamsters union members benefits by an average of 60 percent the central states pension fund is not the only pension fund struggling under biden s economy the times reports a report by the pension benefit guarantee corporation pbgc found that out of roughly 1 400 insured multi employer pension plans 124 have reported that they will run out of money within 20 years those 124 pension plans represent about 1 million workers as plans become insolvent they apply to the pbgc a government organization aimed to protect the plans but the multi employer program was in bad shape and faced the likelihood of insolvency in 2026 and a near certainty of insolvency by 2027 due to the cost of covering pension failures the money going to the central states pension fund accounts for about one third of the estimated total cost of the pbgc aid program the associated press reports biden s massive pandemic relief package is expected to keep the pbgc afloat through 2051 sen chuck grassley r iowa among other republicans opposed the bailout in march calling it a blank check with no measures to hold mismanaged plans accountable

what has happened in ghana is a sovereign debt default by another name the government in accra calls it a debt operation programme but as we all know any unilateral scheme by a sovereign to postpone payment reduce or not pay interest on government securities as contracted amounts to a sovereign default if there is a big lesson for kenya to learn from what ghana has done it is that difficult and bold decision on restructuring and managing debt are options you cannot postpone forever until recently we were still able to borrow from the credit markets to fill gaps in our budgets these options won t last forever the second lesson when you consistently run primary budget deficits when your revenues minus expenses are perpetually negative and when your expenditure exceeds your revenues before you factor in debt repayments persistently it will only be a matter of time before you end up where ghana is right now the government of former president mwai kibaki used to run primary budget surpluses since 2013 we have been persistently running primary budget deficits and when your problems spread into a situation where the centre can no longer hold it s hypocritical to start quoting from the bible and invoking the name of the almighty an unsustainable debt situation is an economic consequence of over reliance on borrowing instead of living off currently produced wealth this is a man made problem i confess how i was thoroughly amused to hear ghanaian finance minister ken ofori atta resorting to quoting the bible even as he announced unilateral haircuts on domestic bonds he quoted from 1 samuel 30 19 which says nothing was missing small or great i say to you nothing will be lost nothing will be missing and nothing will be broken we will together recover all then mr atta continued we shall overcome our current difficulties and with the help of god put our economy back on the path of renewed and robust growth difficulties how do you insist that nothing will be lost when you will be paying nothing to bondholders for the whole of 2023 in brief the so called debt operation programme has the following planks first as of december 1 2022 existing domestic bonds will be exchanged for a set of new bonds maturing in 2027 2029 2032 and 2037 the coupon on the new bonds will be at zero per cent in 2023 five per cent in 2024 and 10 per cent from 2025 until maturity pension funds that hold those pieces of paper that were until recently deemed to be risk free will pay a heavy price from the imposed haircuts the impact will be felt on balance sheets of commercial banks especially in cases where the bonds are marked to market the ghanaians have announced they are creating a financial stability fund to help the situation it s as futile as applying a bandage on a festering wound the third lesson the imf will be the first to ask you to reduce your debt to a level they deem as sustainable as per their own numbers when you default the playbook for the imf is the same for all its clients you must impose haircuts on your debts first before we bail you out the imf will only give an umbrella when it is not raining when rains they take the umbrella away is kenya headed to the situation in ghana i don t want to shout fire in a crowded hall a recent imf mission reportedly asked us to table a workable proposal on how we intend to repay a huge 2 billion eurobond maturities that will be crystalising in 18 months a treasury official told me the visitors from washington dc opposed the idea of creating a sinking fund to settle the 2024 eurobond maturities that represent the biggest challenge for kenya in the management of its external debt liabilities according to official statistics the projections are that as a consequence of the 2024 eurobond maturities total maturities on the country s stock of external debts will rise exponentially to nearly twice the annual average to a massive sh 475 5 billion within 18 months from now

rochester ny accesswire december 8 2022 dividend and income fund stock symbol dnif net asset value symbol xdnix the fund a closed end fund with the primary investment objective of seeking high current income with capital appreciation as a secondary objective announced today that it anticipates that its quarterly distribution amount will remain at 0 25 per share for each quarter of 2023 the following dates apply to the 2023 quarterly distributions shareholders should not draw any conclusions about the fund s investment performance from the amount of its distributions or from the terms of the fund s distribution policy distributions may be paid from net investment income net realized capital gains or return of capital or a combination thereof to the extent that the fund has estimated that it has distributed more than such income and gains the distribution may be a return of capital a return of capital may occur for example when money invested in the fund is paid back to shareholders a return of capital distribution does not necessarily reflect the fund s investment performance and should not be confused with yield or income additionally a return of capital is not taxable rather it reduces the tax basis of the shareholder s fund shares thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing potential loss on the shareholder s subsequent sale of those shares the fund intends to send shareholders a form 1099 div for the calendar year that will instruct shareholders how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes the quarterly distributions reflect the fund s current distribution policy to provide shareholders with a relatively stable cash flow per share there is no guarantee that the fund s current distribution policy will reduce or eliminate the fund s market price discount to its net asset value nav per share if any and the fund s trustees have no fiduciary duty to take action or to consider taking any action to narrow any such discount the distribution policy and the above distributions including without limitation the distribution amounts and dates may be amended suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice about the fund the fund is a closed end fund with the primary investment objective of seeking high current income capital appreciation is a secondary objective the fund seeks to achieve its objectives by investing under normal circumstances at least 50 of its total assets in income generating equity securities from time to time shares of the fund may trade at a premium to nav or a discount to nav during such periods when the fund s nav per share is above the market price there may be an opportunity for investors to purchase shares of the fund at a discount to their underlying value the fund s premium or discount to nav may vary over time and shares of the fund may subsequently be worth more or less than their original cost shares of closed end funds frequently trade at a discount from their nav this characteristic is a risk separate and distinct from the risk that the fund s nav has decreased in the past and may decrease in the future as a result of its investment activities and other events neither the investment manager nor the fund can predict whether shares of the fund will trade at below or above nav the risk of holding shares of the fund that might trade at a discount is more pronounced for investors expecting to sell their shares in a relatively short period of time after acquiring them because for those investors realization of a gain or loss on their investments is likely to be more dependent upon the existence of a premium or discount than upon portfolio performance the shares of the fund are designed primarily for long term investors and should not be considered a vehicle for trading purposes the nav of the fund s shares typically will fluctuate with price changes of the fund s portfolio securities and these fluctuations are likely to be greater in the case of a fund which uses leverage as the fund may from time to time in the event that shares of the fund trade at a premium to nav there is no assurance that any such premium will be sustained for any period of time and will not decrease or that the shares of the fund will not trade at a discount to nav thereafter the market price for the fund is based on supply and demand which fluctuates daily based on many factors such as economic conditions and global events investor sentiment and security specific factors there is no assurance that the fund s investment objectives will be attained past performance is no guarantee of future results you should consider the investment objectives risks charges and expenses of the fund carefully before investing the fund s investment policies
