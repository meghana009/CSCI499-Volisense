wilmington del reuters as elon musk is engulfed in his overhaul of twitter the entrepreneur is headed to trial to defend his record 56 billion tesla inc pay package against claims it unjustly enriches him without requiring his full time presence at the carmaker a tesla shareholder is seeking to rescind musk s 2018 pay deal claiming the board set easy performance targets and that musk created the package to fund his dream of colonizing mars tesla has countered that the package delivered an extraordinary 10 fold increase in value to shareholders the trial begins nov 14 and will be decided by kathaleen mccormick on delaware s court of chancery she oversaw twitter s lawsuit against musk that ended last month when he agreed to close his 44 billion deal for twitter an acquisition which he financed largely with his tesla stock if musk loses this pay package in some massive way i think we can expect to see a lot of things that are going to be really hard to predict like what happens going forward in terms of how tesla is run and how twitter is paid for said ann lipton a professor at tulane law school however lipton and other legal experts said the lawsuit by tesla shareholder richard tornetta is going to be much more difficult than twitter s case against musk musk founded and is ceo of spacex one of the world s most valuable private companies and founded or co founded neuralink which makes brain implants tunneling venture the boring co and openai an artificial intelligence research lab last week he appointed himself twitter ceo part time ceo tornetta s lawyers argue the 2018 package failed its stated purpose of focusing musk on tesla they portray musk as a part time ceo citing his testimony that in 2018 he worked tuesday wednesday and friday at the electric carmaker and monday and thursday at rocket company spacex according to his deposition according to the lawsuit tesla s board chair robyn denholm said the minimal time musk was at tesla was becoming more and more problematic in a 2018 email to gabrielle toledano who at the time was the tesla chief people officer the company has argued the package was not about requiring musk to punch a clock and be on site specific hours each week but to hit audacious targets enriching musk but also shareholders like tornetta the disputed pay package allows musk to buy 1 of tesla s stock at a deep discount each time escalating performance and financial targets are met otherwise musk gets nothing tesla has hit 11 of the 12 targets as its value ballooned to 650 billion from 50 billion on the back of ramped up model 3 production according to court papers musk s vested grants are worth around 50 billion according to amit batish at equilar an executive pay research firm the grants contribute to his 200 billion fortune the world s largest musk s package of stock grants is larger than the combined pay of the 200 highest paid ceos last year six times over according to batish the trial is likely to focus on tornetta s claims the package was developed and approved by directors beholden to musk and promoted to shareholders without revealing the first tranches were probable of being met based on internal projections board control tornetta s filings are full of examples of a board controlled by musk for example antonio gracias described by the plaintiff as a close friend of musk and who was lead independent director from 2010 19 testified in his 2021 deposition that musk could sell tesla if he wanted and the board could not stop him who worked for who does elon musk work for the board or does the board work for elon musk said minor myers a professor at uconn school of law myers said if the pay package is rescinded the board could simply create a new one and do so with mccormick s ruling to guide them but circumstances have changed complicating the process he now owns twitter how do they want to factor that in said myers who added that it will be a challenge to determine how to keep musk from being distracted by other ventures how much money do they need to put in front of this guy to get his attention he said reporting by tom hals in wilmington delaware additional reporting by hyun joo jin in san francisco editing by noeleen walder and nick zieminski by tom hals and hyunjoo jin

meaningful gop gains could support high defense spending morgan stanley says a shift in political party control affects the outlook for defense contractors and this tuesday s election should be no different if republicans gain a majority in one or both chambers of congress according to morgan stanley all else equal we see gop gains as potentially supportive of higher defense spending levels unless deficit hawks emerge analyst kristine liwag wrote in a note tuesday while higher defense spending is a tailwind for defense contractors there are also potential headwinds a loss of democratic control of congress could also drive further delays to finalize the defense budget for fiscal year 2023 she said the current continuing resolution which funds the government at last year s fiscal levels expires on dec 16 we see the likelihood of extension growing should republicans take control of either the house or senate given potential conflicting priorities vis à vis the white house liwag said an extended continuing resolution poses a risk to defense companies because it typically curtails the defense department s ability to start or ramp up new programs she added michelle fox s p 500

recycling program whereby we will sell non core assets and use the proceeds to de lever our portfolio as well as acquire properties in our target growth markets thus far in 2022 we successfully exited four non core assets recognizing a capital gain of 8 9 million and we have additional non core assets we anticipate selling in the next one to two years that we believe will result in additional capital gains we will continue to opportunistically sell non core assets and redeploy the proceeds into stronger target growth markets with a focus on industrial investment opportunities while we

the us administration of joe biden is privately encouraging ukraine s leaders to signal an openness to negotiate with russia and drop their public refusal to engage in peace talks unless president vladimir putin is removed from power the washington post reports the paper quoted unnamed sources familiar with the discussions as saying that this is a calculated attempt to ensure kiev maintains the support of other nations who are now finding themselves faced with constituencies worried about having to pay for a war for many years to come the report comes as us officials are publicly vowing to support kiev with massive sums of aid for as long as it takes while hoping for a resolution to the eight month conflict that has taken a big toll on the world economy and triggered fears of nuclear war the paper said us officials acknowledged that ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky s ban on talks with putin had caused concern in many parts of europe africa and latin america where the war s effects on costs of food and fuel are felt most sharply ukraine fatigue is a real thing for some of our partners the post quoted one unnamed us official as saying us national security advisor jake sullivan said during a visit to kiev last friday that washington s support for ukraine would remain unwavering and unflinching following today s midterm congressional elections meanwhile secretary general of nato jens stoltenberg claimed it is vladimir putin the president of russia who is attacking another country and we should know that putin started this war this is a war of choice and he can finish it tomorrow stoltenberg added that russia must understand that no one wins a nuclear war and such an action will have severe consequences for russia the probability of using nuclear weapons in ukraine is low but at the same time the consequences will be very large and very destructive us president biden and former presidents barack obama and donald trump have each sounded the alarm over threats to democracy in the us in the countdown to today s congressional midterm elections they all converged on pennsylvania on saturday to push their parties to the finishing line in a race that the incumbent biden described as a defining moment pennsylvania is one of a handful of swing states that will decide the overall balance of power when us voters determine who will control congress during the last two years of biden s term speaking to thousands in a philadelphia arena biden said us voters face a choice between two vastly different visions of america democracy is literally on the ballot this is a defining moment for the nation and we all we all must speak with one voice he said obama who is seen as the democratic superstar warned that fundamental rights reason and decency are on the ballot he attacked the republicans for being increasingly averse to everything from science to respect for rules democracy itself is on the ballot the stakes are high obama said in an echo of biden s warning his voice going hoarse trump blamed biden for turning the country into a police state if you want to stop the destruction of our country and save the american dream then this tuesday you must vote republican in a giant red wave he told a rally referring to the party s traditional colour as they spoke a washington post abc news poll showed that as the midterms near more and more americans some nine out of ten 88 per cent are afraid that political divisions have intensified to the point that there s an increased risk of politically motivated violence breaking out in the united states last wednesday biden pleaded with the people of america to accept election results and avoid resorting to violence we must with one overwhelming unified voice speak as a country and say there s no place no place for voter intimidation or political violence in america whether it s directed at democrats or republicans biden said no place period no place ever sales of us weaponry and other military hardware to europe are skyrocketing thanks to the persisting western backed conflict in ukraine with european countries vowing to expand their arsenals by 230 billion a research group says in many european countries over half of the recent military expenditures went to american arms manufacturers with norway devoting 83 per cent to us purchases the uk 77 per cent italy 72 per cent and the netherlands spending 95 per cent on us made weapons in the period from 2017 to 2021 according to stockholm international peace research institute sipri total european arms imports jumped 19 per cent during that time frame from the previous five years this is certainly the biggest increase in defence spending in europe since the end of the cold war said ian bond director of foreign policy at the centre for european reform as quoted in a report by yahoo news last saturday according to the report since the ukraine conflict began in late february countries in the european union have pledged to beef up their arsenals by some 230 billion with germany alone planning to modernise its military to the tune of 100 billion this year the us arms industry which produces and exports more weapons than any other country selling over 39 per cent of the estimated 210 billion annual global arms sales from 2017 to 2021 has been the biggest beneficiary it added many european countries have plans to increase their military spending very significantly and to increase their purchases of arms as part of that said pieter wezeman a senior researcher with the sipri arms and military expenditure programme as quoted in the report and in some countries they re accelerating purchases originally slated for later this decade he said even before the war according to sipri european arms imports from 2017 through 2021 were up 19 they re growing at a rapid clip said william hartung a senior research fellow at the quincy institute for responsible statecraft adding the amount of european arms deals being negotiated since february has almost doubled from last year and we ve still got a few months left this is all very much driven by russia s attack on ukraine and the realisation in europe that defence stocks had been run down quite considerably over the last 30 years said bond he said that one reason so many countries turn to us arms manufacturers is that the american defence industry is so large countries don t have to wait for cutting edge arms to be developed another reason is that countries in east and central europe want to keep the us on their side and show that they attach value to the transatlantic alliance including to nato and supporting american defence manufacturers is one way in which you can do that according to hartung since president biden took office european countries account for some 33 billion of arms offers as the initial stage of arms negotiations is called with 21 billion in deals on the table since february although some sales have not yet been officially contracted hartung told yahoo news that the 21 billion estimate is assuredly low as it represents only government to government deals not direct commercial sales which are more difficult to track by far the most popular high end item from the us in europe is the american f 35 combat airplane with finland putting in an order for 54 of them in 2020 while poland ordered 32 another 71 planes were ordered by norway the netherlands and the uk and even neutral switzerland ordered three dozen of the fighter planes in september for over 6 billion the pentagon says us troops are inspecting stocks of american supplied military equipment in ukraine as part of efforts to keep track of gear supplied to the country s forces those kinds of big money sales cause a lot of tension with european arms manufacturers said hartung since across europe the american f 35 often outsells european made fighter jets based on what arms buyers have told him sipr s wezeman said the f 35 has more bells and whistles than domestic models such as the eurofighter typhoon or saab jas 39 gripen the us however doesn t lead every arms sector in europe where countries tend to buy tanks from germany artillery from france and submarines from germany france or the uk but because of their high price f 35s often take a large part of a country s defence budget pie

market share and aid in maintaining a healthy top line in an uncertain macroeconomic environment third avenue management shared its stance on w w grainger inc nyse gww in its q1 2022 investor letter here s what the firm said held in the fund since 2019 grainger plc grainger is a uk based real estate operating company that is the leading owner manager and developer of multi family properties in the supply constrained markets of the uk where the multi family business is more commonly referred to as the private rental sector or prs at the end of the 2021 calendar year the company owned a portfolio of 7 100 prs units that were 95 0 leased with two thirds of the value in the greater london area and the remaining one third in the other uk regions in addition to its stabilized portfolio of market rate prs properties grainger also owns a portfolio of approximately 2 500 rent controlled units dating back to its roots as a more diversified residential company grainger was founded in 1912 due to the regulated nature of these properties only about 8 10 of the units can be disposed of each year however the proceeds from these sales as well as the earnings the company retains as an operating company as opposed to a reit are being utilized to build out its strategic development pipeline with planning for almost 8 400 additional prs units including 3 000 very well located units through its joint venture with the transport for london tfl despite being well capitalized with a loan to value ratio of approximately 30 alongside prospects to self finance its development pipeline that is expected to increase its recurring cash flows by more than 90 through 2025 grainger s common stock continues to trade at a discount to its stated nav which is provided annually based upon third party appraisals under international financial reporting standards this inefficiency may very well relate to grainger s status as an operating company not a reit which leaves the company out of certain real estate indices and mandates it is not inconceivable though that as the company further builds out its stabilized prs portfolio it may ultimately elect reit tax status serving to boost its annual dividend and widening its potential investor base should such a modification not materialize and the price to value gap remain there would also likely be a great deal of strategic interest in the platform given grainger s scale in this emerging asset class within the uk number of hedge fund holders 32 dpz ranks 9th on our list of the best reddit stocks to buy now domino s pizza inc nyse

billion wedgewood partners mentioned visa inc nyse v in its q3 2022 investor letter here is what the firm has to say visa inc nyse v continues to report strong double digit growth in payment volumes throughout the first two months of the calendar third quarter the stock suffered after concerns about potential adverse legislation related to its credit card routing practices began to surface similar legislation related to the company s debit routing practices was passed into law back in 2010 not unlike the previous legislation the company s value proposition to merchants consumers and bank issuing customers and acquirers is robust enough to help blunt the potential effects the legislation might have in the near term over a multiyear time horizon it would be quite difficult for any

rating agency and data provider whose stock declined 29 0 year to date and 17 5 during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance while debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline the worst quarterly decline in a decade down 41 year over year in the second quarter based on goldman sachs estimates and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early june we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital first ratings represent only about 30 of s p global s total revenues second despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance over the long term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding which has compounded in the mid single digits for many years lastly we believe that

hypertension at this year s aha conference said mason freeman m d chief medical officer at cincor baxdrostat significantly decreases aldosterone in plasma and urine while increasing plasma renin as a physiological compensatory change these changes in aldosterone and renin following treatment with baxdrostat reflect less salt exposure to the kidney and reduced blood pressure over time and unlike earlier generations of aldosterone synthase inhibitors serum cortisol levels were not reduced once again confirming the highly selective mechanism of baxdrostat collectively these findings demonstrate how baxdrostat uniquely helps address a known cause of elevated blood pressure potentially offering a much needed treatment option for patients with tough to control hypertension brightn trial highlights aldosterone and renin activity reinforce the biological mechanism of baxdrostat dose dependent reduction in both plasma and urine aldosterone support inhibition of aldosterone synthase and the mechanism of action of baxdrostat urine aldosterone levels 24 hours post treatment quantitatively measure total body aldosterone production with less variation than plasma to provide direct evidence of baxdrostat s aldosterone lowering capabilities dose dependent changes in renin activity support physiological salt response no meaningful impact on cortisol confirms baxdrostat is highly

reported across all three dose cohorts tested after 12 weeks of treatment transient and manageable adverse events of special interest included hypotension hyponatremia or elevated potassium levels low discontinuation rate of less than 1 2 patients due to transient treatment related adverse events all patients completed the study on drug well tolerated profile and ifferentiated mechanism of action supports combination approaches brightn trial was a phase 2 randomized double blind placebo controlled dose ranging clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of baxdrostat in subjects who have not achieved their target blood pressure despite receiving three or more antihypertensive agents at their maximally tolerated doses one of which must be a diuretic the trial evaluated three active doses of baxdrostat 0 5 mg 1 0 mg and 2 0 mg compared to placebo control in 275 patients randomized across all four dosing cohorts with 248 patients completing the primary endpoint of brightn

for the third quarter of 2022 the third quarter marked significant progress for danyelza we are thrilled to report record sales of 12 5 million a 28 increase compared to the previous quarter in addition danyelza was approved in israel and submitted for marketing authorization in brazil and we look forward to our partners continued efforts to expand danyelza said thomas gad president and interim chief executive officer while we are truly disappointed by the outcome of the recent odac meeting for omburtamab after working tirelessly to receive breakthrough designation and submit the bla to the fda we remain steadfast in our commitment to patients and caregivers who do not have access to an approved treatment where there is a clear unmet need however while we await fda s formal decision on the bla we remain confident knowing that that y mabs has never been defined by a single program or technology our expertise spans multiple verticals and disciplines and we continue to invest confidently in our future with the promise of sada while looking to maximize danyelza as the cornerstone of a sustainable pediatric oncology franchise funded by a strong balance sheet with 114 5 million in cash that is sufficient to support our business operations as currently planned into mid 2024 third quarter 2022 and recent corporate developments on october 28 y mabs announced the outcome of the fda oncologic drugs advisory committee meeting where the committee voted 16 to 0 that the company had not provided sufficient evidence to conclude that omburtamab improves overall

revenues in the nine months ended september 30 2022 included 1 0 million of license revenue compared to 2 0 million of license revenue in the corresponding period in 2021 danyelza product revenue for the third quarter 2022 and nine months ended september 30 2022 was 12 5 million and 32 8 million respectively which represented increases of 40 and 41 respectively over the corresponding periods in 2021 and an increase of 28 compared to the second quarter of 2022 danyelza product revenues of 9 8 million the increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of new u s patients in treatment during the third quarter of 2022 as of september 30 2022 y mabs has delivered danyelza to 43 centers across the united states corresponding to an increase of more than 19 in the number of centers since the end of the second quarter of 2022 during the third quarter of 2022 approximately 40 of the vials sold in the united states were sold outside memorial sloan kettering msk a decrease from the prior quarter as a result of msk s growth of new patients outpacing the growth of new patients at institutions outside msk operating expenses research and development research and development expenses were 22 4 million for the three months ended september 30 2022 compared to 23 1 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 the 0 7 million decrease reflects decreased spending for clinical trials partially offset by increased costs for outsourced manufacturing services having completed the resubmission of the bla for omburtamab in the first quarter of 2022 we are focusing on pipeline development programs for potential danyelza label expansion and advancing sada constructs into the clinic research and development expenses increased by 7 3 million to 71 8 million during the nine months ended september 30 2022 compared to the prior year period the 7 3 million increase mainly reflects an increase in outsourced manufacturing services and increased personnel costs dedicated to our advancement of danyelza omburtamab and the sada constructs selling general and administration selling general and administrative expenses decreased by 0 4 million to 13 6 million for the three months ended september 30 2022 compared to 14 0 million for the three months ended september 30 2021 the decrease in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a 2 1 million decrease in salary and stock based compensation expense partially offset by increased costs related to the commercialization of danyelza selling general and administrative expenses increased by 10 7 million to 50 1 million for the nine months ended september 30 2022 compared to 39 4 million for the nine months ended september 30 2021 the increase in selling general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an 8 9 million increase in severance and share based compensation expense related to our former chief executive officer in the nine months ended september 30 2022 and to a lesser extent the commercialization of danyelza net loss we reported a net loss for the quarter ended september 30 2022 of 27 5 million or 0 63 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of 28 9 million or 0 66 per basic and diluted share for the quarter ended september 30 2021 the decrease in net loss was primarily driven by the positive gross profit impact from increased revenues we reported a net loss for the nine months ended september 30 2022 of 96 7 million or 2 21 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of 18 4 million or 0 43 per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended september 30 2021 net loss in the nine months ended september 30 2021 included a 62 0 million net gain from the sale of our danyelza priority review voucher after sharing 40 of the net proceeds from the sale with msk pursuant to the terms of our license agreement with msk the increase in net loss in the nine months ended september 30 2022 also reflects the impact of contractual severance related benefits for our former chief executive officer and increased research and development expenses both as noted above partially offset by the gross profit impact of danyelza s revenue growth cash and cash equivalents we had approximately 114 5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of september 30 2022 and we continue to expect a full year 2022 cash burn of 78 83 million our cash and cash equivalents balance when combined with anticipated danyelza revenues is expected to be sufficient to fund our operations as currently planned into mid 2024 this estimate is based on our current business plan and we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect this estimate does not include any potential product revenues for omburtamab if approved or any potential net proceeds from the potential receipt and sale of any priority review voucher which we expect would be awarded to us if we receive approval of omburtamab the estimate assumes receipt of a regulatory milestone payment for danyelza approval in china but no new partnerships or other new business development related sources of income financial guidance management reiterates all elements of its 2022 financial guidance including anticipated danyelza product revenues of 45 50 million operating expenses of 162 167 million total cash burn of 78 83 million and cash position sufficient to fund current operations as planned into mid 2024 the danyelza revenue guidance includes an

more bloody and deadly than world war ii and yetinvolving all manner of weapons conventional and non conventional of mass destruction we are not talking about iraq under saddam hussein or afghanistan under the taliban our enemies russia and china are stockpiling wheat and petroleum in preparation for war in fact the us exported a record amount of wheat in september why even more shocking the top three recipients of u s wheat last year were mexico philippines that trend has continued into 2022 despite the fact that china is siding with russia against the u s nato in a major realignment of nations world war iii will be fought to determine who gets to call the shots in the new world order you can see which nations are receiving the bulk of u s wheat in the graph below most of them make sense but why is china number 3 china is the economic leader of a growing coalition of nations that would like to see the u s knocked off its perch as the world s policeman and the u s dollar replaced as the world s reserve currency according to christian westbrook who has been closely following world grain movements for years and runs the ice age farmer youtube channel it was liquidated over a decade ago westbrook said in a telegram post this morning just like the biden administration are draining the strategic petroleum reserve now westbrook stated in the telegram post the global wheat supply has been massively disrupted because of the russia ukraine war both nations are major wheat producers these draw downs in the u s national stockpiles of diesel fuel and grain stocks are particularly worrisome given the context of today s geo political climate notably the fact that the superpowers are on a collision course toward world war iii and neither side is backing down if you knew that world war iii was right around the corner which the biden administration clearly must know as the leader of nato which has been stoking war with russia ever since biden took office would you be drawing down key supplies needed during a chaotic war time economy things like petroleum and wheat but it gets even worse not only is the biden administration not stocking up on fuel and key grains such as wheat it is shipping these key commodities out and not just to allies but to our enemy in china and that s not all this administration is doing while rushing toward world war iii with russia china so let s take a look at all the other things no rational government would be doing if it knew it was on a collision course with a nuclear armed opponent with the stakes being who gets to control the new world order that would shake up the world order in a hurry it would expedite the global digital currency replacing the u s dollar as the global reserve currency and relegating the u s to second class status following a humiliating defeat to russia china et al oh and expect nato member turkey to officially switch sides as soon as the missiles start flying there is no way turkey s wily islamist dictator president erdogan is going down with this ship
washington d c the annual price of newly launched cancer drugs in the u s averaged 283 000 last year a 53 percent increase from 2017 reported u s democratic representative katie porter in august reuters reported the record high launch prices of new drugs in 2022 compared to 2021 which has driven the profits of drugmakers and limited year over year price increases on existing drugs due to pressure from lawmakers and the public the report highlights the reliance of cancer drugmakers on high launch prices an area left out of the medicare pricing limits in the inflation reduction act ira signed by u s president joe biden in august while focusing on medicare price negotiation for older drugs and caps on price increases the bill also limits annual out of pocket drug costs for beneficiaries to 2 000 as medicare will be responsible for costs over that amount by law medicare is required to cover the cost of all cancer medications porter who championed inflation based caps on drug prices has called for additional national legislation to link launch prices to drug performance the trend toward ever higher launch prices is ongoing and accelerating and i think we should expect it to continue unless we do something about it she told reuters in response the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of america the drug industry s main trade group said that government price setting has a devastating impact on biopharmaceutical research and development and places an additional barrier between patients and innovative medicines

one of the key challenges for africa in confronting the climate challenge is how to finance the necessary transformation of regional economies flows of climate finance from the global north on the scale required remain more of a promise than a reality part of the solution as obtained in other climes is to unlock the vast potential of carbon markets the realisation is dawning across africa that private sector led voluntary carbon markets represent a major opportunity to accelerate economic development and simultaneously curb greenhouse gas emissions but seizing this opportunity will take thoughtful and deliberate action including by african governments that s why we re excited to be taking part in a new initiative to be launched at the cop27 climate summit at sharm el sheikh egypt the african carbon markets initiative seeks to support a dramatic increase in the production of african carbon credits while ensuring that carbon credit revenues are transparent equitable and create good jobs crucially these must be high integrity credits that are used to supplement direct decarbonisation and which deliver real climate action global demand in vcms as measured by retirements of carbon credits has nearly quadrupled in the last five years driven principally by companies buying credits to help meet their climate pledges demand for african credits is also increasing but from a low base and the continent currently produces only a small proportion of its potential boosting the supply of credits would enable much needed sustainable investment in sectors ranging from renewable energy and clean cookstoves to agriculture and forestry our experience s in government in colombia and nigeria show the potential of carbon markets but also the hard work that will be required to realise it the colombian voluntary carbon market platform was launched in 2016 as part of a government effort to meet colombia s climate targets by stimulating demand for carbon credits between 2016 and 2019 colombian carbon credits grew more than four fold to become a 20m market leading to among other impacts the planting of over 180 million trees but it didn t happen by accident it was a top presidential priority and required extensive coordination across society including collaboration with the colombia stock exchange to begin carbon trading and the launch of the first green taxonomy in latin america in the same vein nigeria has its own ambitions to be a climate leader in africa set out in its 2021 climate change act and commitment to net zero by 2060 last month the president major general muhammadu buhari retd inaugurated nigeria s national council on climate change the government is committed to using carbon credits as a tool for achieving nigeria s climate goals while financing sustainable economic development we estimate nigeria could produce between 25 and 30 million tons worth of carbon credits annually by 2030 generating over 500m per year the nascent carbon credit market faces numerous challenges to growth in many parts of africa including a lack of project developers capable of operating at scale a complex regulatory landscape inadequate methodologies for valuing and certifying credits and concerns about integrity the africa carbon markets initiative where we sit on the steering committee alongside twelve other african leaders and carbon markets experts will use cop27 to launch an initial road map for action to address these challenges that touch every part of the vcm ecosystem one key focus will be supporting african governments in establishing voluntary carbon market country plans along the lines of the successful effort undertaken in colombia in recent years nigeria will be one of the first countries to launch a plan with the goal of rapidly increasing the development and sale of carbon credits these plans will aim to support carbon credit production by clarifying government responsibilities setting out market incentives and establishing transparent regulation of the sector within the context of each government s commitments under the paris agreement on climate change this latter point is of central importance there has been some confusion around paris agreement rules on carbon credits which state that when two countries trade carbon credits to avoid double counting only one of these two countries can use the credit towards their nationally determined contributions their target for reducing emissions however for sales to foreign corporations there is certainty buyers can with high integrity use african credits without concerns around double counting our view is that this approach is fully in line with both the letter and the spirit of international climate agreements this way funding from foreign buyers in the vcm provides the resources to help african countries meet their ndcs which they have made clear cannot be achieved without international financing we recognise that some buyers may require a commitment that host countries will not use sold credits towards their ndcs either to drive additional impact or to comply with regulations in their home countries african countries can choose to make these commitments for a portion of credits produced with an expected premium in price but we do not believe they need to play a major role in corporate voluntary carbon credit use the acmi steering committee has set the ambition that 300 megatons of african credits will be retired annually by 2030 19 times the 2020 level this sounds daunting but actually it merely requires demand and supply to continue growing at roughly the rate they have been growing in recent years by 2050 the committee has set an even more impressive goal of 1 5 gigatons mobilising 120bn in capital

ride hailing company lyft lost 135 7 million in the third quarter due to the shutdown of autonomous vehicle company argo ai in which lyft had a small stake late last month argo ai closed its doors as its main backers ford and volkswagen pulled their investments in order to focus on more near term goals like advanced driver assistance systems in passenger vehicles lyft and argo were working together to test autonomous ride hailing using argo s tech on the lyft platform the two companies had launched public robotaxi services in austin texas in september and miami florida in december of last year both of those services have now been discontinued a lyft spokesperson told techcrunch lyft did not say how it will adjust its av strategy in the future but the company has also partnered with motional another av tech company to launch robotaxis in las vegas in august lyft s losses incurred by the argo shutdown only account for about a third of the company s total losses for the quarter in q2 lyft lost 422 2 million which is a larger cost than the 99 7 million in the same period of 2021 and a net loss of 377 2 million in the second quarter of this year a bigger portion of lyft s losses are attributable to 224 1 million in stock based compensation and related payroll expenses an increase from 179 1 million in the second quarter the uptick is related to the top up that lyft issued to employees when its stock price declined earlier in the year according to a lyft spokesperson lyft said the increase isn t yet related to the rounds of layoffs from the company the first of which occurred in july and the second just last week as lyft tries to cut down on operating expenses in regards to that reduction in workforce lyft expects to incur a charge of between 27 million and 32 million in q4 as well as a stock based compensation charge and corresponding payroll tax expense related to affected team members as well as restructuring charges related to a decision to exit and sublease or cease use of certain facilities said elaine paul lyft s chief financial officer during monday s earnings call however we aren t able to estimate these charges at this time because they depend in part on our future stock price paul also said lyft has been working to reduce stock based compensation next quarter by ceasing new hires in the u s and shifting the nexus of hiring away from the u s and toward international markets like canada and eastern europe where there s a different compensation model with low or no equity lyft misses q3 estimates for the third quarter lyft reported revenue of 1 05 billion which is slightly less than wall street expectations of 1 06 billion the company s earnings per share hit 1 18 versus the 0 09 that was expected even active riders which saw an improvement quarter over quarter only topped 20 3 million and the street had hoped for 21 1 million that said lyft s revenue per active rider beat expectations of 49 94 at 51 88 lyft s stock which had started to climb after uber reported strong earnings last week fell 14 36 monday in after hours trading the company s shares have slid 69 29 since the start of the year lyft closed the quarter with 143 7 million in cash looking forward lyft expects revenue to be between 1 145 billion and 1 165 billion in the fourth quarter with revenue growth reaching between 9 and 11 quarter over quarter and 18 to 20 year over year part of that growth will come from increased revenue per rider which is backed by lyft s recent decision to increase service fees for riders paul said lyft intends to cut its operating expenses by roughly 20 million in q4 versus q3 which is in part due to the reduction in force john zimmer lyft s president said he was confident that lyft would be able to achieve its q4 goals regardless of the macro environment we ve been using internally two main cases one is the growth case which assumes market bookings grow in the low to mid 20 year over year and that the labor market stays as tight as it currently is said zimmer during the q3 earnings call and then internally what we call a recession case where the market growth slows and we see operating leverage through lower driver engagement and acquisition costs if unemployment rises so in both cases we have a very confident path to the billion dollars and in both cases we ll continue to focus our r d spend on marketplace innovation that helps improve the cost basis of the business

is one of the core conventions in international trade law it was adopted in vienna in 1980 and came into force eight years later it forms part of the law of hong kong by reason of the sale of goods united nations convention ordinance cap 641 which was passed by the legislative council on 29 september 2021 its introduction follows a six month consultation amongst a wide variety of stakeholders that took place in 2020 as of january 2022 there were 94 contracting states to the cisg in total representing over two thirds of the global economy these include some of hong kong s top trading partners such as the mainland of china the united states japan singapore vietnam south korea germany france the netherlands italy and australia the provisions of the cisg will prevail over those of existing hong kong law subject to a right of parties to opt out the cisg will apply to most contracts for the international sale of goods subject to a few exceptions see further below it does not apply to contracts where the preponderant part is in respect of the provision of labour or services the ordinance consists of only five sections and adopts the cisg in an unamended form in the schedule this preserves the original form and language of the cisg which may encourage courts considering the application and interpretation of its provisions to refer and rely upon the extensive authorities and learned writings in other jurisdictions which have adopted the cisg application the cisg applies to a transaction if three requirements are met there must be a contract for sale of goods and will not apply where a preponderant part of the obligations consist of the supply of labour and other services article 3 2 the contract is between parties whose places of business are in different states article 1 1 the states concerned must either a be contracting states to the cisg article 1 1 a or b the rules of private international law lead to the application of the law of a contracting state article 1 1 b some states have opted out of part b of this test hong kong has not done so the cisg will not cover contracts between parties whose places of business are in hong kong and mainland china respectively although it is understood that discussions are underway with respect to the possibility of a mutual arrangement following favourable comment during the consultation we wait to see how this might develop the cisg will apply to contracts of sale of goods meaning items that are moveable and tangible at the time of delivery this includes livestock plants and materials minerals and growing crops the cisg does not include intangible rights such as intellectual property company shares assigned debts and so on exclusions under article 2 the cisg does not apply to sales of consumer goods i e goods purchased for personal family or household use unless the seller knew or ought to have known that the goods were purchased for any such use by auction on execution or otherwise by authority of law of stocks shares investment securities negotiable instruments or money of ships vessels hovercraft or aircraft of electricity the cisg governs the formation of a contract of sale and the rights and obligations of the seller and the buyer arising from the contract the cisg is not concerned with the validity of the contract or its provisions the effect of the contract on the property in the goods sold for example retention of title clauses and issues to do with product liability articles 4 and 5 there are some contracts that are expressly not covered by the cisg including where a party orders goods to be manufactured yet undertakes to supply a substantial part of the materials necessary for the manufacture article 3 1 and contracts in which the preponderant part of the obligations of the party who furnishes the goods consists in the supply of labour or other services article 3 2 opting out as form 1 december 2022 the cisg will apply by default to international contracts where the conditions are met however under article 6 parties to the contract may agree to derogate from or vary the effect of any provisions within the cisg or exclude the cisg s application in its entirety it is therefore important that clients consider whether they want the cisg to apply to their contracts and if not add appropriate language to their contracts opting out can be done by parties expressly agreeing that the cisg is excluded by including in their written contract provisions replacing some or all the cisg provisions or by choosing the law of a non contracting state as the applicable law comparisons with existing hong kong law there are some significant differences between the cisg and existing hong kong law generally the cisg is thought to be more pro contract than existing hong kong law providing remedies for breach that currently have no direct equivalent under hong kong law hong kong law cisg offer and acceptance according to the postal rule acceptance is effective once the acceptance is sent acceptance of an offer is effective when it reaches the offeror article 18 2 fitness for purpose goods must be of merchantable quality and conform to their description under the sale of goods ordinance cap 26 articles should be fit for the ordinary purposes for which goods are used or a particular purpose made known to the seller article 35 non conforming goods the buyer may reject the goods the seller may be allowed to cure defects article 37 time for inspection the buyer must inspect the goods within a reasonable time the buyer must inspect the goods within as short a period as is practicable in the circumstances article 38 1 but can only reject based on non conformity of the goods supplied if a notice specifying the defect has been given within a reasonable time after the buyer either discovered or should have discovered the defect article 39 1 practical tips for businesses generally the cisg is considered to be pro contract helping create a valid and enforceable contract where lacuna might otherwise have given rise to uncertainty businesses should consider whether they wish to exclude any of the cisg s provisions and if so which a contract of sale will fall outside the scope of the cisg if it is not apparent from the contract that the parties to the contract are located in different states at the time of contracting businesses are advised to make sure that the place of business is made clear in the contract of sale businesses should consider including an entire agreement clause in the contract of sale since any evidence can be used under the cisg to prove a contract article 11 states that a contract of sale need not be concluded in or evidenced by writing and is not subject to any other requirement as to form it may be proved by any means including witnesses a no oral modification clause should also be considered for inclusion so that parties cannot modify the contract terms or terminate the contract unless by written agreement this is to counter the effect of article 29 which states that a contract may be modified or terminated by the mere agreement of the parties once the contract is in place and goods have been delivered purchasers should make a note to inspect the goods as soon as practically possible in order to check for defects the buyer should give a notice specifying any defects found to the seller as soon as practically possible in summary the coming into force of the cisg has the potential to drive trade between hong kong and some of its major trading partners it should also help to guard against hong kong businesses having to cope with foreign laws that may be unfamiliar the application of the cisg should help bolster the position of hong kong as a leading centre for dispute resolution services in the region the cisg may also help to act as a bridge between different legal systems of belt and road initiative bri member countries and help hong kong to maximise the opportunities afforded by bri around 45 per cent of the countries participating in bri are contracting parties the cisg is often described as pro purchaser since buyers have a wider range of remedies available to them these include requiring the seller to undertake repairs offer price reductions or deliver replacement goods these concepts derived from civil law and may explain the reluctance of some common law jurisdictions to adopt its provisions through our offices in france germany and italy hogan lovells has a wealth of experience in the application of the cisg whilst businesses may expect to bear some costs in terms of reviewing their standard contracts it will be important for them to understand the possibilities available to them starting 1 december 2022

historically the months leading up to midterm elections have generally been the worst in what is known as the four year presidential election cycle since 1962 the average return during this time has been about 0 3 percent however this is no average year with persistent high inflation continued interest rate hikes recession fears the war in ukraine supply chain issues and china s strict covid policies investors have seen their portfolios plummet steve spaulding a financial advisor with edward jones joined us on kpcw s mountain money monday to discuss the financial impacts of midterm elections the s p 500 is down about 21 percent year to date and then a diversified portfolio is also going to have some bonds in it so if we think about bonds those are down about 16 percent year to date right now and then of course a lot of investors own other things which might include tech stocks so nasdaq down about 33 percent spaulding said the midterms could be a turning point and not necessarily because of who controls congress history shows us that stocks usually rally in the year after the midterms no matter which side wins in 17 of the 19 midterm elections since 1946 the market has performed better in the six months following an election than it did in the six months leading up to it republicans in recent weeks have picked up momentum in the polls and most analysts see a split government with republicans regaining control of the house and possibly the senate a divided government typically leads to partisan standoffs and not much in the way of legislation and policy being passed but investors say gridlock tends to benefit the economy spaulding said markets tend to prefer a divided government we may not like when there is gridlock in congress but the market loves gridlock spaulding said the reason for that is it means that nothing is going to be passed there won t be any changes in legislation anything significant that changes and investors and companies like that because it means that there s predictability there s clarity on what s coming up down the road united or divided the stock market has increased under every political combination in washington with an annual average return of 10 percent per year however edward jones shared data collected from 1901 to 2020 that shows the stock market and the economy have performed better under the control of democrats the stock market and the economy have performed better under democratic presidents and a democratic majority in congress spaulding said however inflation has been lower during republican presidencies and congressional majorities

portland naacp president sharon gary smith and vice president donovan scribes held a press conference this morning to remind voters of the organization s priorities to call out some troubling public stances and to emphasize the importance of voting while the naacp portland does not endorse individual candidates they urged voters to consider the authenticity of those running for office we have to notice when we re having these discussions who is asking these types of questions about affordability on our council and in our county and our state are they voting for the status quo or are they actually challenging it scribes said flaws in affordable housing both scribes and gary smith took issue with portland s approach to affordable housing in the current campaign season much has been made about expanding portland s available stock which currently falls far short of need but the portland naacp expressed its concern about holes in city policy a tax exemption program meant to entice residential developers into creating affordable housing offers these same companies loopholes around affordability program participants are not subject to the state s recent rent control law and units are only required to remain affordable for 10 years at which point they can be leased out at market rate meanwhile the state is coming up on a 14 6 rent cap increase that will go into effect next year when we look at where the affordable housing tracks are now up and down mlk up and down williams and vancouver avenues we re talking about the heart of a community that was taken where our homes and property were taken without reasonable compensation gary smith said and then we re talking about speculation and the developers who are able to get at the land that belonged to african americans in lower albina in north and northeast and then build affordable housing that has all kinds of tax incentives and abatements and profit off of this continuing cycle of push out eliminate remove gentrify that vicious cycle is a very large contributor to housing insecurity and vulnerability for african americans for poor people for people of color when you look at houselessness and homelessness there s also the possibility of being vulnerable because your homes bring profit to others outside of the community and families that we have formed police and safety the naacp portland leaders encouraged a more effective and nuanced understanding of the surge in gun violence throughout the region beyond the popular campaign platform of bulking up police recruitment and response we know that some of it is the contribution of the pandemic and people having lost so much and fearful of losing more gary smith said we know for those who are in behavioral health care who know that all the isolation and the further losses for those most vulnerable creates this state of feeling like nothing matters but we also know some of the issues of young people feeling like their future is not much there are all these sociological and psychological reasons space and place where you live where the services are where you lack resources where there s nothing but a police response to all kinds of emergencies we know those are contributors we don t excuse it and we don t want the violence to continue but she said police presence is often strong in communities of color and other vulnerable areas at issue was the fact that police response is often the only kind of public response such populations experience she praised solutions like portland street response that allow community members and people who are most impacted to also be participants in solutions that include law enforcement but don t always lead with law enforcement as though that s the only solution scribes called out a more conservative tendency to tie blame for the uptick in violence to the black lives matter protests of 2020 we ve started to see defunding used as a weaponized term during this election season the false claims that defunding the police is what s caused the surge in violence but most of the country is seeing a surge in violence post covid so these knee jerk reactions to any black uprising any civil rights movement is pretty familiar in terms of now weaponizing the language that was used during that time of unrest and it kind of leads to the same tail chasing that we ve seen for decades and decades scribes pointed out that gubernatorial candidates christine drazan and betsy johnson enjoy a ratings from the national rifle association which he called an obstructionist organization stopping meaningful changes to gun laws intentionally misleading although the naacp portland did not issue an endorsement for governor scribes and gary smith criticized candidate christine drazan for stating that she did not think systemic racism exists in oregon we cannot let the unintentional misinformation go unanswered gary smith said i think it s critical to deny racism in a country that was founded on it and in a state that carried it in when we became a part of this larger union i think it s disingenuous and it s intentionally misleading and it has everything to do with housing and homelessness school to prison pipeline education inequity they re all impacted by this state and the history of racism and denial and exclusion asked about the organization s support of ranked choice voting scribes pointed out that vote splitting criticisms of johnson the unaffiliated gubernatorial candidate who is not likely to win but may attract support away from drazan and tina kotek would be made obsolete finally they drew attention to the exorbitant campaign funding from this election cycle criticizing billionaire nike co founder phil knight for first donating millions to johnson s campaign then to drazan s the richest man in oregon has no modesty about his intention of transforming politics in our state flipping our state that has been considered in many ways much more progressive than it actually is gary smith said he wants that turned back then there s the threat of taking business elsewhere when we know we re at a time of real vulnerability where people are lacking jobs and security where companies are removing a lot of the protections or trying to where workers are organizing for justice in the workplace and we have these billionaires people with excess income and benefit who are setting the tone and that s phil knight in oregon read also the skanner news endorsements november general election 2022

new york stocks rose monday on the eve of election day as wall street looked ahead to the benefits of a possible split government in washington though trading is likely to stay bumpy in a week full of events that could shake the market the s p 500 rose 1 while the dow jones industrial average gained 1 3 and the nasdaq composite added 0 9 analysts say many investors seem to be making bets that republicans will take control of at least one house of congress with a divided government gridlock is more likely than big sweeping policy changes that could upend tax and spending plans and historically when a democratic white house has shared power with a split or republican congress stocks have seen stronger gains than usual the conventional wisdom that the stock market likes political gridlock is supported by the historical data in this instance according to lori calvasina head of u s equity strategy at rbc capital markets of course that means a better than expected performance by democrats in the midterm elections could hurt stocks investors may fear emboldened democrats in such a scenario would push for increased spending to help the economy that could signal that the federal reserve would have to hike interest rates even higher to get inflation under control a republican win would also introduce its own risks it could again encourage republican brinksmanship around the nation s debt limit and threaten another government shutdown according to strategists at morgan stanley advertisement either way markets may have to wait a while to get clarity because of the process to count votes that came in through the mail in the meantime wall street is looking ahead to a report scheduled for thursday when the u s government will show how bad inflation was across the country last month and that will influence what s been the main driver on wall street this year much more than politics what the federal reserve does on interest rates economists expect the report to show that the consumer price index was 8 higher in october than a year earlier which would be a slight slowdown from september s 8 2 inflation rate a fourth straight month of moderating inflation from june s 9 1 rate could offer some relief such a trendline could also give the federal reserve leeway to loosen up a bit in its campaign to hike rates aggressively to force inflation lower the fed has said that it may soon dial down the size of its increases to half a percentage point after pushing through four straight mega increases of three quarters of a point higher rates put the brakes on the economy by making it more expensive to buy a house car or anything else on credit but too high rates also raise the risk of a recession while also dragging on prices for stocks and all kinds of investments and rate hikes take a notoriously long time to take full effect though economists debate exactly how long that is advertisement the lags are different each cycle and for different reasons and we just don t know when the tightening will have the impact that was intended said keith buchanan portfolio manager at globalt investments it boils down to one question buchanan said what impact has the tightening from the fed had on inflation even though the fed has said that it may soon pare back the size of its increases it is still warning markets that it may ultimately hike rates higher than expected because of just how stubborn high inflation has been the fed has already hiked its key overnight rate to a range of 3 75 to 4 up from virtually zero in march and more investors are expecting it to top 5 next year monday s gains for wall street came despite a shaky showing for its most influential stock apple rose 0 4 after dropping earlier in the day it had warned customers they ll have to wait longer to get the latest iphones after anti covid restrictions were imposed on a contractor s factory in china speculation has been rising recently that china may move away from its business damaging zero covid policies if the world s second largest economy did it could provide a boost to a global economy facing wide ranging threats as central banks worldwide hike rates because of high inflation besides the election inflation and china earnings reports from u s companies are also pushing stock prices to swing advertisement the reporting season for summertime profits is roughly 85 done and s p 500 companies are on track to deliver growth of a little more than 2 that s close to analysts forecasts though several companies have been warning of tougher times ahead as inflation remains high and the economy appears increasingly fragile analysts are now forecasting a drop in s p 500 profits for the final three months of the year by nearly 1 5 they had been forecasting growth of 4 at the end of september bond yields rose the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 4 21 from 4 16 late friday the yield on the two year treasury rose to 4 73 from 4 66 the s p 500 gained 36 25 to 3 806 80 the dow rose 423 78 to 32 827 00 and the nasdaq climbed 89 27 to 10 564 52 send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under
it s generally accepted among economists and investors that the federal reserve has an impossible task of getting inflation under control without broad and lasting damage to the economy it s time for a reality check in fact it s looking more and more like the central bank may have a far easier time curbing inflation than is widely expected the reason is this deep structural shifts in the economy caused by the pandemic changes in the composition of the housing stock and an evolution in cultural norms have made household formation much more flexible than at anytime in the past that may prove to be the difference between an economy that requires a sharp rise in unemployment to bring down inflation and one that simply needs a brief but firm tap on the brakes when the fed began boosting rates earlier this year there was justifiable concern that the effort would backfire after all many of the drivers of inflation were outside the central bank s direct control take residential real estate for example the fed doesn t have any direct control over rents and what indirect control it does have tends to push rents in the wrong direction a straightforward consequence of the fed s tightening of monetary policy and the resultant jump in mortgage financing costs was that demand for homes fell a natural corollary to falling home demand should have been upward pressure on rents after all if fewer americans could afford to buy doesn t that mechanically lead to more renters and the trouble is that s a problem because the largest component by far in core inflation is housing costs the quandary then was how could the fed bring down core inflation when the largest component is determined by rents and the central bank s primary tool raising interest rates was working to drive rents upward the traditional answer has been to drive up unemployment as unemployment rose more young adults would be forced to move back in with their parents or double up that s exactly what happened in the wake of the great recession when new home construction collapsed to record lows and only very slowly recovered despite the plunge in supply rent inflation as well as overall inflation was subdued because of a large slowdown in household formation which brings us back to why the fed s job may get easier from here anecdotal evidence suggests that household formation is rapidly slowing a ubs ag survey found that found that the percentage of adults living rent free with friends or family jumped from 11 a year ago to 18 in september the highest on record and according to rental data tracking firm realpage demand for apartments fell from more than 200 000 units in third quarter of 2021 to a negative 82 000 the same time this year that marks the first ever negative reading for the third quarter typically the strongest leasing season in over 30 years several forces seem to be at work first the pandemic caused an explosion in household formation between the spring of 2019 and the spring of 2020 some 4 million new households formed about four times the average annual rate as shared living arrangement became cramped as working from home soared during the lockdowns then the ability to work remotely and the extra cash provided by fiscal stimulus programs gave more people the opportunity and the means to seek larger homes further away from urban centers in addition the median size of new homes has grown by more than 10 since the great recession to 2 312 square feet by comparison the median existing home size in the u s is just 1 650 square feet this implies that an increasing number of americans particularly those who are older and more well established now have the ability to house family and friends if the need arises here again covid seems to have accelerated these trends during the height of the pandemic more than half of all young people aged 18 29 lived with one or both of their parents according to pew in many cases these were college students returning home as campuses shut down which explains how both household formation and young adults living with their parents could increase at the same time crucially however even before covid the norms were changing in february 2020 47 of young adults lived with a parent the most since 1930 in 1960 only 29 of young adults had lived with a parent these shifts in work flexibility home size and cultural norms are working together to make household formation more sensitive to economic conditions than in the past on top of that there are a record number of housing units under construction rising interest rates are likely to slow construction but with apartment demand already showing signs of rapidly cooling the net effect is that new homes are likely to run well ahead of household formation for the next year or two that will bring down rents and overall core inflation it will take some time for this to all show up the consumer price index data given the way the government calculates the data but given the current softening trajectory of real time measures like the zillow rent index expect cpi shelter inflation to peak soon maybe as soon as early next year
