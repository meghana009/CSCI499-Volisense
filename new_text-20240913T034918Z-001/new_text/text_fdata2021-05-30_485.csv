may 29 is nationally recognized at 529 college savings day a day mostly celebrated by a niche group of higher education experts and personal finance enthusiasts to draw attention to the tax advantaged savings plans offered by all 50 states and the district of columbia first created in 1996 529 plans are state sponsored investment accounts that savers can contribute to for a beneficiary s education expenses including tuition fees books housing and technology savers can choose any individual to be a beneficiary and when funds are withdrawn from a 529 plan for educational expenses the money earned in the account while it was invested is not subject to federal income taxes and in many cases state taxes as well everyone s situation is different but 529 plans for most people are an excellent choice says cliff robb associate professor of personal finance at the university of wisconsin madison the most important benefits of 529s are the flexibility flexibility in what you re investing in within those plans and flexibility to pick any state s plan and the true benefit of tax free growth upon withdrawal admittedly the flexibility robb mentions can also be overwhelming savers can choose which state s 529 plan or plans they want to take advantage of and many states offer several plans to choose from robb says the first variable families should consider when picking the right plan for them is if their local plan includes a state income tax benefit for residents get new england news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for necn newsletters momo productions digitalvision getty images julio martinez executive director of the investment board for scholarshare california s college savings plan adds that savers should also consider how old their beneficiary is how much they are able to save and how aggressive they want to be with their investment strategy i encourage families to look first at their home state programs to see if they have some kind of additional tax benefit whether it s a tax credit or tax deduction because that may contribute to their decision to choose their own state however with that being said families are not obligated to stay with their home state plans and they can shop around and compare fees and compare investment options says martinez for example scholarshare 529 offers 19 investment options that are designed to help families with different savings goals and different management styles these different management styles range from passive investment strategies to socially conscious actively managed funds some are designed to invest funds conservatively and some more aggressively understanding when a given beneficiary will start need to use the funds and how much they will need are key to deciding which option is best for them the college savings plans network cspn an affiliate of the national association of state treasurers offers an online tool for individuals to compare plans across each state and lets you see if a plan has tax benefits for state residents enrollment fees minimum contribution amounts and more over the past year 529 plans have ballooned due to growth in the stock market and because families have begun contributing more perhaps because the pandemic allowed some families to save more and or because of growing demands to save for college student loan debt is at an all time high we re nationally over 1 6 trillion in student loan debt and it s become quite the burden on families says martinez every dollar you save is 1 less you have to borrow but when you factor in the tax savings and also the earnings potential your child could end up with 25 more money in a 529 according to cspn as of december 2020 americans have saved some 425 2 billion a 14 increase from 2019 across over 14 8 million 529 accounts the impact of this pandemic has been most harsh on those families with low education levels the greatest job losses were in that sector says martinez we think that this was an inflection point for families that were either impacted or who saw other families being impacted in terms of valuing what an education can do to mitigate against these kinds of events and with the price and value of college increasing martinez says his baseline advice is simple save as much as you can don t miss
have you ever wondered about the impact music has had on other forms of art you may have felt the sensations yourself as the melody traveled through you triggering a feeling you didn t even know existed inspiring you to create something that made you feel the same way various painters notably displayed this stimulation from the past and present as they splattered canvases with their visual depiction of music ten such pieces have been discussed below to demonstrate the impact music had in the world of art 1 impression iii concert by wassily kandinsky after attending a concert held by the austrian arnold schönberg in 1911 kandinsky would create one of his most famous works impression iii concert the artist was particularly taken by the rapturous music he heard and found himself conveying his feelings on a canvas 2 polyphony by paul klee paul klee was known for admiring compositions who himself had been an excellent violinist since just eleven years of age polyphony was painted in 1932 and presented music as a multilayer overlapping and simultaneously occurring phenomenon 3 music by henri matisse matisse painted music in 1910 which sergei shchukin commissioned the french artist was inspired by bach s music which directly inspired this artwork 4 victory boogie woogie by piet mondrian mondrian appreciated jazz music and was inspired by it a lot this admiration only increased when he traveled to new york where he found himself particularly taken by boogie woogie so much so that his painting victory boogie woogie although unfinished conveyed the rhythm and the joy of the music he held in such high esteem 5 music pink and blue no 2 by georgia o keefe georgia had always been inspired by how paintings could somehow emulate the way music made her feel she was utterly enthralled by the idea that music could be translated into something for the eye music pink and blue no 2 helps propose how music swells and moves in visual form 6 chagall color and music by marc chagall chagall color and music was an exhibition of various works by chagall inspired by music the influence of music was so great that the exhibition was solely focused on 340 pieces of art accompanied by music 7 listening to schumann by fernand khnopff khnopff was a symbolist belgian painter who painted listening to schumann in 1883 while nothing can be assumed about the type of music being played the painting gives off a feeling similar to something many of us have encountered when listening to music 8 marguerite gachet at the piano by van gogh while the fact is not well known van gogh had always been inspired by music van gogh took piano lessons as a child and expressed his passion for music in multiple letters marguerite gachet at the piano shows van gogh s seems to reflect the artist s passion for the instrument 9 großstadt by otto dix in großstadt otto dix has recreated the inside of a dance bar the middle panel of the painting focuses on a jazz band and how music became an outlet for expression after the end of world war i 10 one number 31 by jackson pollock pollock s painting one number 31 is a spray painted piece of art the artwork resembles the same energy in jazz music which pollock was intricately acquainted with conclusion the artworks listed here are only a fraction of the pieces which were touched by music artists who truly understood music produced art pieces that were a mirror image of their strong emotional response the choice of color and the artists brushstrokes were a direct result of the melody that played through them music inspired art is wondrous

although ocean related weather is relatively quiet now with only one named storm so far this year the 2021 atlantic hurricane season begins on june 1 and follows an active 2020 hurricane season that serves as a stark reminder of the need to plan ahead for hurricanes after a record breaking 2020 season with 30 named storms 13 hurricanes six major hurricanes and 12 storms that made landfall forecasters are predicting another above average hurricane season for 2021 virginia was spared the brunt of last year s storms but certain areas of the commonwealth felt them indirectly in the form of remnant rainfall and accompanying floods hurricane season runs from june 1 through nov 30 each year the state corporation commission s scc bureau of insurance encourages virginians to review their insurance policies now to make sure they have the coverage needed if a hurricane or other disaster strikes once the threat of a hurricane or other weather system arises it may be difficult to find an insurance company willing to write related coverage until the storm passes tropical cyclones such as hurricanes are among the strongest and most destructive forces of nature all it takes is one storm to change your life dramatically so the time to plan is now said virginia insurance commissioner scott a white white encourages virginians to review their insurance policies as part of their disaster preparedness checklist assess your risk and make sure you have the coverage you need to repair or replace your home and property if they are damaged or destroyed during a hurricane or other disaster contact your insurance agent or company or the bureau of insurance if you have questions he said even areas hundreds of miles inland from the coast can experience floods and other damage caused by hurricanes high winds and torrential rains in fact most hurricane damage comes from flooding not high winds even minor floods can cause extensive damage to your home business or belongings keep in

one way for income hungry investors to keep cash flowing is to assemble a portfolio that shells out dividends every month the idea is to assemble 12 stocks or funds with alternating distribution dates so that you never wait long for cash this strategy can be a complement to a bond ladder another time tested tool for automating cash flow because share prices are soaring the current yields on some former dividend favorites have dipped well below 2 however many other dividend aces still yield at or above 3 so with the full s p 500 index priced to yield about 1 5 down from 2 4 a year ago here s a dividend a month portfolio whose 12 elements average 3 or better on new money yields are as of early april capital is spread over numerous sectors a critical diversification advantage over an undisciplined chase for maximum yield and you have growth opportunities keep your cool do not get impatient over cyclical or short term principal losses a big dividend means these shares oil stocks excepted tend to trade in a tight price range realty income o the choice for november is an exemplar every time realty income dips a few bucks it bounces up the same holds for verizon communications vz you can buy these sorts of securities on dips with confidence presuming we don t suffer another bear market even in the spring of 2020 not every company or industry got scared or scarred enough to hack or eliminate dividends the timing for the portfolio is based on when you truly get paid not the earlier date of record for shareholders to qualify for the next distribution at t and verizon are a dual entry both pay together in early february may august and november pick one if you prefer or hold some of each but if you had scheduled them separately the communications services sector would account for too much of the whole portfolio january physicians realty trust doc february valero energy vlo march american electric power aep april coca cola ko may at t t verizon vz june pfizer pfe july cisco systems csco august general dynamics gd september truist financial tfc october kimberly clark kmb november realty income o december chevron cvx these are familiar names and you may already own a few they may not be cheap though none scream overvalued buy these stocks on dips or make phased purchases but that s not to say there aren t equally good alternatives american electric power is not the only fine utility but its straightforward business model is appreciated kimberly clark just declared a 5 5 dividend boost and general dynamics raised its payout by 8 both are generous at this time you get the idea enjoy your dividends
photos taken by shae pastrana and edited in adobe spark what a bare garden bed can look like a month and a half later sunflowers are almost blooming between the sunlight and my plants a misty rainbow greets me every morning as i water my lush green babies the dopamine from a hand glued to a smartphone doesn t compare to the mood that i get from a thriving garden no snapchat filter or abundance of likes simulates that feeling spring marks the start of my ultimate self care routine i think gardening is the best medicine for recovering our health wellbeing academic focus and also helps with food security looking around butte county i see a community that wants this view on gardening to be societally normalized as much as i do chico state s horticulture professor lee altier of the college of agriculture started california s first horticultural therapy course in 2016 he was inspired by his past work helping small farmers establish food security he said teaching has made him appreciate how horticulture offers so much more than commodity production for years altier worked with chico state s 3 acre farm through the organic vegetable project providing research opportunities for students learning regenerative farming methods the ovp educates students on food security and cultivation and donates excess produce to the hungry wildcat food pantry altier sees sustainability beyond just environmental science looking further to the realm of social aspects by this he means that sustainability requires a network of social support including support for disabilities and mental disorders altier said applied social sustainability is about making sure we take care of each other altier added that he feels like he helps to promote this more holistic view of sustainability through his class which attracts students of disciplines ranging from nursing to teaching altier taught horticultural therapy to many places outside of academia including chico s non profit organization little red hen one of my favorite plant nurseries little red hen employs developmentally disabled adults all sales and donations benefit programs for people with developmental disabilities photo taken by shae pastrana from inside little red hen plant nursery little red hen s executive director and founder teresa wolk hayes conceived the idea for the nursery when she used gardening to support her 3 year old son she said gardening s therapeutic benefits invoke a feeling of accomplishment that s gained through the process of cultivation as gardeners we write a seed to food story that reciprocates in the end that feeling gave me strength during last year s lockdown amid worries about food security hayes estimated the increase in plant sales especially houseplants to be related to isolation from social distancing and quarantine she advised that observance is key when learning to garden noting overwatering as a common problem watering is the hardest thing in a nursery hayes said drought tolerant plants are great beginner choices given butte county s climate and california s recurrent droughts well documented evidence validates gardening s power to restore health and wellbeing sunlight regulates serotonin a brain chemical or neurotransmitter that elevates the mood sun rays provide vitamin d which plays a role in serotonin synthesis a canadian study recorded experiences of secondary school aged children engaged in gardening one student said they had noticed a benefit in planning and doing something instead of just worrying about my homework calling the experience my safe place where i escape from my problems and embrace the things that make me happy paradise community guilds board member and garden director jennifer petersen continues to rebuild paradise s community gardens after the destruction caused by the camp fire in 2018 the guilds currently offer free plots while they re still available the butte county local food network made her efforts possible through their creation of a coalition of community gardens throughout the county having formed since the camp fire the network welcomes all who are interested to participate in their gardens after the fire petersen found therapy in just being able to nurture something and watch it grow underlining the importance of having space where people can gather to work on building something new touching on food security petersen added that urban gardening and other small space methods like using window sills balconies and potato barrels eases the restriction of garden space petersen said that food security can be addressed through educating people on how to grow and knowing where our food comes from since fossil fuel is widely used in agricultural production i agree with her claim that seasonal and local production improves the economy and the environment petersen oversees the paradise seed lending library serving all of butte county but with emphasis on the paradise and magalia areas the library currently operates a mobile doorstep delivery service the butte county library in paradise reopened which makes the seed lending library able to stock seeds on their shelves again unfortunately petersen said that the seed lending library lost a lot of membership since the pandemic having facilitated seed swaps for six years their next one will be this fall those who want to order seeds can contact them through their facebook page community efforts to restore sustainability and teach self reliance persists in spite of our struggles along with the county s local food network camp fire restoration project group played a huge role in restoring paradise and helping rebuild the gardens such help included giving trees away and educating locals about care and planting my garden story spans across a variety of climates and states since 2014 i downsized in space resources plants and time once i became a full time college student when the pandemic struck last year empty grocery shelves and reports of food insecurities signaled for me to revive my past commitment to gardening photo taken by shae pastrana a young melon transplanted between sunflower seedlings and a marigold i yielded enough vegetables for donations and personal storage along with recovering my peace of mind from the backburner where it sat since i became a student slowly simmering with anxiety gardening s metaphorical lessons teach valuable skills in coping with life the canadian study on children s gardening experiences also stated that bserving the natural cycle of new growth and budding of the plant also becomes a metaphor for patience possibilities and recognition of the natural cycles in life this apt realization reflects our daily reality weeds pose a metaphorical problem in the garden their tendency to choke my efforts teaches patience and diligence many of my problems roots run deep but they re nothing i can t get to the bottom of i recently dealt with a stray cat who s been posing another problem by uprooting some young plants to get to the yummy organic fertilizer that s deep in the soil after a few shopping trips and some low budget improvisation i realize this cat is a lot like my other problems in life forcing my creativity out of the box and into my personal investments anything worth doing is worth the challenge overcoming obstacles in the garden and

memo to us donâ t do the dirty on the lankan people has the american government developed second thoughts on sharing its oxford astrazeneca vaccine largess with sri lanka view s view s on the day following the enactment of the controversial port city bill which enshrined chinaâ s solid presence on the island as a legal tenant in the lankan law books enjoying undisturbed possession of a 2 69 square km land mass next to the capitalâ s heart for the next 99 years the american government may have showed its evident displeasure toward the countryâ s paradigm shift east by pricking the nation where it hurt most the health of the lankan people americaâ s self proclaimed paternalistic role as the worldâ s sole reigning superpower professing a creed of reaching out to humanity beyond borders sounded a discordant note last saturday when it was revealed that the biden administration was wavering over their decision whether to include sri lanka in its list of nations earmarked to get a share of its stockpile of some 60 million oxford astrazeneca vaccines in june hopes that sri lanka was a confirmed recipient of the astrazeneca vaccine had been raised when the chairman of the state pharmaceuticals corporation of sri lanka said at a meeting held at the presidential secretariat last friday that the us state department is to give 2 5 million doses of astrazeneca out of which 600 000 doses are expected to arrive by june state health minister of production supply and regulation of pharmaceuticals professor channa jayasumana also told the media on may 18 three days before the port city bill was enacted that sri lanka was on the list of nations to be given a consignment of the astrazeneca vaccines under president bidenâ s plan to donate americaâ s excess vaccines â we expect to receive a portion of these excess astrazeneca vaccines â he said us embassy spokesperson nancy vanhorn told the media last saturday of us plans to share about 13 percent of the vaccines produced for the united states by the end of june she said â we will work with covax and other partners to ensure these vaccines are delivered in a way that is equitable and follows the science and public health data we donâ t yet know which countries will be receiving vaccines but a decision will be made soon â vanhorn said that on may 17 president biden reaffirmed his commitment to leading an international and coordinated vaccination effort announcing that the us will provide 80 million doses of vaccines to meet global needs but warned the united states still remained in two minds whether to include sri lanka in the list of beneficiaries of covid vaccines it intends to share with the world from a broad american perspective americaâ s bad blood over lankaâ s slippery slide towards chinaâ s gravitational pull is perhaps understandable â for years she has treated the former british colony lanka as a natural ally sharing the same democratic ideals and a capitalistic economic policy which had made her lankaâ s largest trading partner throughout the years a generous amount of american aid had flowed even though it had not been in tidal waves successive lankan governments may have expected it to be but the once sweet chummy relationship that existed between the two unequal nations soured no sooner an oriental genie appeared on the desolate lankan land scape promising to grant lankaâ s every wish in her quest for prosperity provided it met with its own hegemonic interest to expand her regional and global power with one whispered condition though should lanka default on payback day she would forfeit hocked assets as punishment giving a twist to britainâ s old colonial policy used to build her far flung empire of â the flag following tradeâ here was the new neo colonial version of â the flag following loans â thus while the lankan government with a loud roar of patriotism tore up americaâ s mcc agreement scorning a gift of us 480 million to improve the countryâ s infrastructure it had displayed no such chauvinistic inhibitions when it came to accepting unlimited chinese aid to develop its ports to build the mattala airport to build its highways its coal plant even to build on lankan waters a brand new city they themselves would occupy for the next 99 years if the american government had been miffed at the rate of chinese expansion in lanka and appalled at lankaâ s inordinate worship to the eastern hemisphereâ s new rising sun then the incorporation of the chinese built chinese hoisted chinese occupied and dominated colombo port city into law and to the body politic would have been the last straw needed to awake the superpower to the consequences that ensue when it takes long held relationships for granted and abandons friendly impoverished nations to the mercy of their foes on wednesday us president joe biden called for a deeper investigation to probe the origins of the virus and called on china to assist the international probe in a statement biden said the majority of the us intelligence community had coalesced around two likely scenarios that the virus was transmitted to humans via contact with an infected animal or it emerged from a lab accident â the chinese embassy in washington immediately dismissed the idea as a conspiracy theory â â but while biden may deem it necessary to probe the source of the virus whether it came from a wuhan bat or a wuhan lab the more important task at hand is to treat the wound and not the arrowâ s source the arrow may belong to a government but the sore suffered belongs to the people take the present wretched plight of the 600 000 who along with 325 000 others first received the first dose of the oxford astrazeneca vaccine shortly after it was approved for emergency use by the world health organisation the vaccine was first administered to the frontline workers to those in the health sector members of the armed forces and police and to parliamentary members after these prioritised groups were inoculated colombo residents were then in line to receive their vaccinations the second round of vaccinating the prioritised groups with the remaining 300 000 odd astrazeneca doses saved for the purpose began in late april with the government promising steps will be taken to procure the second dose for the remaining 600 000 before the deadline for the period during which the second dose must be given for optimum effect ran out on may 1 government health officials said sri lanka is looking at sources other than india to purchase the oxford astrazeneca vaccine in view of delay in securing the vaccines from the serum institute of india desperate at its failure to procure the astrazeneca vaccine on time the government even toyed with the idea of giving mix and match cocktails until the who declared it had not approved of giving one brand as the first dose and another as the second hopes faded fast with the government giving up on its bid to secure the astrazeneca vaccine from india and announcing it planned to turn to other nations to secure it in mid may colombo mayor rosy senanayake issued a statement assuring the people that she has used her local and international network to obtain the oxford astrazeneca vaccine and that it will be available within two weeks similarly the ceylon chamber of commerce also issued application forms on its own asking its members to register themselves and their staff to obtain the astrazeneca vaccine they hoped to secure soon and provide at rs 5000 per jab the following day may 19 the government shot down the private sector initiative stating the government was not in a position to acquire a separate stock for the private sector of the astrazeneca doses and the private sector would be included in the national vaccination programme where jabs would be administered free of charge soon the government which had initially dragged its feet in securing the vaccines at the market price finally decided it will be willing to pay any price to obtain the elusive astrazeneca the daily mirror newspaper reported on wednesday a senior cabinet minister as saying the cabinet of ministers yesterday discussed the issue and decided the government was willing to purchase the stocks at any quoted price we just desperately need these 600 000 doses of astrazeneca as the government is aware of its obligation to provide the dose to those who received the first jabs this thursday in response to an inquiry from the chairman of the state pharmaceutical corporation as to the possibility of astrazeneca validating as genuine vaccines obtained from third parties astrazeneca ltd warned of the inherent dangers in such seedy transactions in a letter to the chairman it said it had learnt that numerous private traders and companies had been approaching the government in sri lanka to sell the covid 19 vaccine from astrazeneca it said â there is currently no private sector supply sale or distribution of the vaccine if a trader or company other than astrazeneca offers private vaccines it is likely counterfeit so should be refused and reported to the relevant authorities while the government rush was on to find the elusive astrazeneca the situation on the ground turned grim when it was revealed that the all powerful government doctorsâ union the gmoa had used its privileged position to get doctorsâ wives children fathers mothers family members even their servants vaccinated with the astrazeneca second dose this caused a furore in the ranks of the public health inspectors union on tuesday at the health ministryâ s decision to grant this privilege only to doctors ignoring other health workers who also face the same risk in the fight against covid the infuriated phis union head upul rohana declared that it is important to vaccinate the family members of other officials such as nurses paramedics junior staff members and all other members linked to the health sector â accordingly â upul rohan said â we have decided to withdraw from all services at these moh offices in a bid to show our protest â next in line to join the queue to strike was the grama niladhari association gna which rightly complained that let alone their families even they had not received the vaccine condemning the arbitrary action of the gmoa of taking power into its own hands the gna president sumith kodikara said on wednesday â a total number of 12 000 grama niladharis across the country have decided to stay away from all their duties and to join hands with the tu and continue our action from tonight â faced with the possible crippling of the system at grassroots level the governmentâ answer was not to give them the vaccinations they desperately sought but by an extraordinary gazette notification issued the following day to proclaim services rendered by grama niladharis among others as an essential service meanwhile the connected the influential the monied or simply the fortunate out of the stranded 600 000 made prisoners to the astrazeneca after getting it as their first dose had no qualms of making their own hay while the sun shone on a privileged grouping alerted by a network of contacts through whatsapp messages they rushed from one centre to another in the hope of getting the jab for them as it was for the doctors and their families and friends as it was for similar groups who exploited the opportunity their privilege granted to get their kith and kin vaccinated on the sly it was a case of â each one for oneself and god for us all â and who can blame them when negligence and total mismanagement by the authorities to procure adequate doses of the astrazeneca on time and organise its dispensation in an orderly systematic manner which guaranteed fair distribution to all lay at the heart of the original sin thus even at this eleventh hour when more than 500 000 astrazeneca hostages still remain in a wretched state hapless and forsaken in the midst of this virulent covid third wave a public appeal must be made to us president joe biden to touch the rosary he carries with him in his pocket gifted to him by his dead son beau and remember the words he quoted from the ecclesiastes in his victory speech this january that there is a â time to build a time to reap a time to sow a time to healâ and remind his catholic heart that this is the time to forgive the time to transcend american distaste toward foreign governments which publicly embrace american foes and in the name of humanity to grant the grace of life saving 600 000 astrazeneca doses from his nationâ s 60 million stockpile earmarked to be shared with the world to the lankan people and thus ensure that the sins of the state do not visit its helpless citizens

auto industry analysts disagree about the timeline for the electrification of the world s transport system but there s one thing they all agree on china has pulled far ahead of the us above tesla s model s photo by above tesla s model s photo by eugenio pastoral a recent article in the atlantic by michael schuman the author of several books about china s history and economy explains that the meteoric rise of china s ev industry has relied heavily on state support exhibit a is xpeng a startup automaker that recently began exporting vehicles to europe fulfilling a long held dream of the chinese auto industry in the past year the company has signed deals with investment funds linked to the city of guangzhou xpeng s hometown and the surrounding province guangdong worth 700 million schuman writes xpeng has also gotten preferential terms on land low interest loans and tax breaks and state subsidies that have helped it reduce all governments support domestic firms in various ways but china s system of state capitalism manipulates markets to a far greater extent than would be tolerated in the laissez faire us by offering funds and protection for nascent high tech industries including electric cars could potentially swamp the world with subsidized products schuman warns it isn t just economic leadership that beijing seeks if china succeeds in supplanting the us as the world s foremost superpower it would send an ominous message that autocratic repressive regimes are destined to prevail over liberal democracies in schuman s view the global competition over electric vehicles is nothing less than a proxy war between the west and china between their economic models and political ideologies of course ev advocates have long argued that the us government should take a more active role in promoting electromobility and lately these views have been getting more attention in washington jake sullivan now president joe biden s national security adviser wrote in a paper last year that us firms will continue to lose ground in the competition with chinese companies if washington continues to rely so heavily on private sector research and development the president seems to agree his sprawling infrastructure bill includes 174 billion in new funding for charging infrastructure support for automakers and tax breaks for ev buyers china and other countries are eating our lunch biden said and the bill will put us in a position to win the global competition with china above president biden comments on china s competitive advantages in the electric vehicle sector youtube cgtv electric vehicles were one of the primary targets of the made in china 2025 initiative which was unveiled in 2015 the state has made direct investments in ev manufacturers granted them subsidies to reduce prices invested in r d and charging infrastructure and offered benefits to ev drivers including privileged access to vehicle registrations which are limited in many cities foreign automakers have also benefitted from the largesse as long as they build cars in china creating chinese jobs and allowing chinese suppliers to learn the latest technology tesla received a larger helping of the gravy than most when the california carmaker announced plans to build its shanghai gigafactory china s government rolled out the red carpet relaxing regulations on foreign ownership expediting building permits and even offering a residence permit to elon musk of course as any good capitalist would agree heavy handed industrial policy has its limits there have been abuses and scams including a couple of fictional electric bus factories invented out of thin air in order to claim cash subsidies as well as unintended consequences in order to qualify for otherwise unobtainable vehicle registrations many drivers bought plug in hybrid suvs with no intention of ever plugging them in more importantly despite the billions of yuan in taxpayer money poured into the ev sector chinese automakers show no signs of conquering the west any time soon despite growing competition tesla s model 3 was the best selling ev in china last year check out these related stories china watchers point out that domestic startups suffer from a lack of brand recognition compared with tesla and other valued global brands and they haven t closed the technology gap tu le founder of the beijing based consultancy sino auto insights told michael schuman that even xpeng which is considered one of china s most advanced ev makers is still a ways away from tesla s capabilities from a technology and software standpoint beijing s industrial policies have encouraged companies to pile into the ev sector including a cellphone maker a video game developer and a couple of internet commerce firms by one estimate there are now at least 119 would be ev sellers in china far more than the market can sustain in a capitalist economy most of these would quickly go belly up or be acquired but subsidies which come not only from the federal government but also from provincial and city governments could prop up money wasting zombies for years schuman tells us that nio a darling of the us media and stock market was rescued from probable ruin last year by a 1 billion investment organized by the city of hefei where the company agreed to base some of its operations as schuman sees it china s industrial program has resulted in a lot of production but only questionable competitiveness beijing seems to have caught wise to this and has been rolling back direct subsidies to carmakers xpeng vice chairman brian gu believes chinese leaders are realizing that current policies may not be the most efficient way to support this industry they have given a lot of subsidies but it did not really build world class companies or world class products us policymakers are on track to expand federal support for the ev industry but they would be wise to study and learn from beijing s experience as schuman concludes subsidies to automakers and ev buyers may be necessary for now but in the long term taxpayer money might be more productively spent supporting r d and building infrastructure such as charging stations because in the end the electric vehicle war will be won in research labs and car showrooms not the halls of congress read more about evs in china written by charles morris source the

new york ap as covid 19 ravaged the world last year ceos big pay packages seemed to be under as much threat as everything else fortunately for those ceos many had boards of directors willing to see the pandemic as an extraordinary event beyond their control across the country boards made changes to the intricate formulas that determine their ceos pay and other moves that helped make up for losses created by the crisis as a result pay packages rose yet again last year for the ceos of the biggest companies even though the pandemic sent the economy to its worst quarter on record and slashed corporate profits around the world the median pay package for a ceo at an s p 500 company hit 12 7 million in 2020 according to data analyzed by equilar for the associated press that means half the ceos in the survey made more and half made less it s 5 more than the median pay for that same group of ceos in 2019 and an acceleration from the 4 1 climb in last year s survey advertisement at advance auto parts ceo tom greco s pay for 2020 was in line to take a hit because of a mountain of pandemic related costs extended sick pay benefits and expenses for hand sanitizer and other safety equipment totaling 60 million dragged on two key measurements that help set his performance pay but because the board s compensation committee saw these costs as extraordinary and unanticipated it excluded them from its calculations that helped greco s total compensation rise 4 7 last year to 8 1 million at carnival the cruise operator gave stock grants to executives in part to encourage its leaders to stick with the company as the pandemic forced it to halt sailings and furlough workers for ceo arnold donald s 2020 compensation those grants were valued at 5 2 million though their full value will ultimately depend on how the company performs on carbon reductions and other measures in coming years that helped donald receive total compensation valued at 13 3 million for the year up 19 from a year earlier even as carnival swung to a 10 2 billion loss for the fiscal year meanwhile regular workers also saw gains but not at the same rate as their bosses and millions of others lost their jobs wages and benefits for all workers outside the government rose just 2 6 last year that s according to u s government data that ignore the effect of workers shifting between different industries it s an important distinction because more lower wage earners lost their jobs as the economy shut down than professionals who could work from home advertisement this should have been a year for shared sacrifice said sarah anderson who directs the global economy project at the left leaning institute for policy studies instead it became a year of shielding ceos from risk while it was the frontline employees who paid the price the ap s compensation study included pay data for ceos at s p 500 companies who have served at least two full fiscal years at their companies which filed proxy statements between jan 1 and april 30 it doesn t include some highly paid ceos who don t fit that criteria the pay figures for ceos sometimes include grants of stock and options they may never ultimately receive unless they hit certain performance targets complexity and coronavirus last year s 5 gain for median ceo pay masks how much variation in pay there was beneath the surface some companies thrived as a direct result of the pandemic sales boomed for lowe s amid a great nesting across the country and ceo marvin ellison s pay nearly doubled after its stock more than doubled the s p 500 s total return through its fiscal year other ceos meanwhile saw their compensation cut at duke energy the board reduced ceo lynn good s short term performance pay after its earnings per share fell short of its initial target partly because industrial customers used less power during the pandemic good s pay dipped 2 6 to 14 3 million even though earnings ended up within the range duke forecast for wall street early in the year duke didn t adjust formulas to raise good s pay because of the pandemic overall 61 of the 342 ceos in this year s survey did get a boost in compensation last year that s almost the exact same percentage as the 62 in 2019 when the economy and corporate profits were growing advertisement that s also despite several ceos taking high profile cuts to their salary during the year as an act of shared sacrifice and to conserve a bit of cash for the company roughly one of every five ceos in this year s survey had a smaller salary for 2020 than the year before but salary is often just a minor piece of a ceo s total compensation which is derived from notoriously complex formulas each year companies fill pages of their proxy statements with charts and footnotes showing how the bulk of their ceo s pay rises and falls with corporate performance it s here in the nuanced area where many companies adjusted levers that ultimately helped ceos get more in compensation a sudden change boards typically stick with the formulas set for ceo pay early each year but the global economy s sudden crash forced a reconsideration what made things even cloudier was that they had few historical guides for how to proceed many committees asked us this very question does this compare to the financial crisis what did people do then said melissa burek partner at compensation advisory partners a consulting firm that works with boards but the pandemic was very different than the 2008 economic collapse mainly because this crisis was caused by a virus rather than by ceos taking on too much debt and risk as boards adjusted targets to make ceos incentive pay less difficult to get many also limited the size of the possible payouts advertisement i think there is a recognition when unemployment is so high of do we feel good about paying our ceo at this level said kelly malafis also a partner at compensation advisory partners of the thinking by boards of directors the answer is we re doing this for performance when performance is not good we don t pay when performance is good we do pay at carnival for example the company says that much of its ceo s compensation is tied to the company s financial and operational performance the company said donald received no cash bonus tied to 2020 and to preserve cash in the pandemic the company gave him grants of restricted stock instead of salary from april through june then from july through november it cut donald s salary by half rattling at the gates progressives in washington are pushing for rules changes to narrow the gap between ceos and workers companies have to show how much more their ceo makes than their typical worker and the median in this year s survey was 172 times that s up from 167 times for those same ceos last year and it means employees must work lifetimes to make what their ceo does in just a year one bill in congress proposes to raise taxes on corporations where the ceo makes 50 times or more than the median worker at the company at some companies shareholders are pushing back on compensation packages approved by the board at the annual meeting of chipotle mexican grill s shareholders earlier this month just 51 of voting shares gave a thumb s up to its executives pay packages compared with 95 a year earlier across the s p 500 such say on pay votes routinely get more than 90 approval advertisement chipotle s board excluded three months of sales results from the worst of the pandemic along with several other items while calculating pay for its ceo brian niccol that allowed him to get bigger compensation than he would have otherwise chipotle called the move a one time modification that s not reflective of niccol s ongoing pay package chipotle was one of the relative winners of the pandemic with revenue rising 7 1 and its stock soaring 65 7 while they re nonbinding say on pay votes are getting increasing attention from wall street between 2017 and 2019 stocks of companies that failed their votes lagged sharply behind the s p 500 in the following 12 months according to morgan stanley the trend didn t hold last year when the pandemic may have unsettled everything but morgan stanley strategists say they still see failed say on pay votes as a red flag that a stock may struggle
the solar energy industry has been blazing hot for a while now on growing awareness about climate change president biden s positive stance on the clean energy industry and declining installation costs however the solar space is now under some pressure due to supply chain issues amid record demand as such solaredge technologies sedg sunrun run sunnova energy nova and renesola sol have recently experienced a sell off and their share prices are expected to continue declining hence we think it is wise to avoid these stocks for now read on this story originally appeared on stocknews growing concerns about climate change are forcing global leaders to focus more on transitioning their countries to sustainable energy based economies on the domestic front the biden administration has proposed to spend 2 trillion plus on infrastructure development including clean energy massachusetts lawmakers recently proposed a bill that would require rooftop solar panels on new residential and commercial buildings and the federal government plans to add more than 500 million solar panels to america s energy infrastructure over the next five years hence with the rising focus on clean energy the industry is well positioned for multi decade growth to put things in perspective solar energy contributed nearly 4 of total renewable generation in 2016 this is expected to increase to 17 by 2030 however the industry has been seeing a sell off lately because companies are facing supply chain constraints and higher shipping costs amid record demand for solar panel installations the mounting pessimism over the industry s near term prospects is evident in the invesco solar etf s tan 21 7 loss over the past three months compared to spdr s p 500 etf trust s spy 10 2 gains furthermore investors expect the fed to increase interest rates sooner than expected thanks to rising inflationary pressures this is a huge negative for the solar industry because solar projects require huge upfront costs which are typically financed with debt so acknowledging these near term headwinds we believe shares of solaredge technologies inc sedg sunrun inc run sunnova energy international inc nova and renesola ltd sol could remain under pressure for some time and so it s wise to avoid these stocks for now solaredge technologies inc sedg sedg designs develops and sells direct current dc optimized inverter systems for solar photovoltaic pv installations worldwide its solaredge system consists of inverters power optimizers communication devices and smart energy management solutions

ducato light commercial vehicle and to grow the company s business beyond solar sedg s revenues declined 6 year over year to 405 5 million in the first quarter ended march 31 2021 this can be attributed to an 8 year over year decline in the sale of solar products that contributed 376 4 million to its top line however its adjusted gross margin came in at 36 5 up from 33 6 prior year value sedg shipped 1 69 gigawatts ac of inverters during the quarter the company reported a non gaap eps of 0 98 rising 3 year over year nevertheless its adjusted eps remained flat sequentially sedg has lost 11 6 over the past month to close yesterday s trading session at 256 56 in fact the stock is down 19 6 so far this year sedg is innovating fast which should drive the company s future financials as such its management expects revenue for the current quarter to be in the 445 million 465 million range however its non gaap gross margin is expected to be within the 32 34 range which is lower than its last reported quarter sedg s powr ratings are consistent with this bleak outlook the stock has an overall d rating which equates to sell in our proprietary rating system the powr ratings are

dubai temporary jobs have become all the rage in the uae as demand for short term opportunities see an upsurge amidst the global pandemic popularly known as temping these temporary positions are not unique to the uae and are reflective of a global phenomenon as the employment market aligns itself with the need of the times according to recruiters and hr consultants achal ghai group managing director legacy emirates group which runs legacy smart employment services and temp ae a portal dedicated to temp jobs told gulf news requests for new permanent hires are suddenly converting to two

achal ghai hiring temporary staff is one of the steps in that direction which many businesses contemplate as it is cost effective ghai said though temping or gig work has been around in developed nations for several years especially with the rise of the gig economy due to popular apps it has seen a resurgence lately in the uae the word has gained a lot of traction due to the increasing number of graduates spouses on sponsored visa who are looking to gain experience and earn some quick money with temporary roles the government has also relaxed rules allowing dependents and young professionals to take on multiple temporary assignments hard to predict according to him the pandemic has also made the future hard to predict hiring a temp staff for the interim period until the dust

allowing employees to earn additional income nikhil nanda the one shining light during the covid 19 period was that companies kept all their employees visas open and allowed them to work for other companies that might need them he said but nanda noted that not all industries have suffered during the pandemic industries such as logistics healthcare and manufacturing for example were in dire need of assistance as their entire recruitment pipeline came to a standstill when people could not fly into the country such companies were left with no choice but to hire part time workers locally at

marc ellis recruitments said employers have actually realised the huge advantages of temping thanks to covid 19 hiring employees on temporary contracts was popular in europe but now employers here too

gunahgar samjhe ki duniya tujhe bas inti bhi zyada safai na de the world will conclude that you are guilty if you give so many explanations to show your innocence this simple couplet came to my mind while reading the press release issued by pib on may 27 titled myths and facts on india s vaccination process the government s adamancy in winning the publicity war even when the case is indefensible leads responsible technocrats like dr vinod paul member health and chair of the national expert group on vaccine administration for covid 19 negvac to author such press releases dr paul lists out seven myths regarding the critique of the government s vaccination policy and bravely sets out to give the correct facts in doing so he ends up only further revealing how highly incompetent the government has been on this front let us take up the seven points raised by dr paul the first is that the centre is not doing enough to buy vaccines from abroad his defence is that buying vaccines internationally is not similar to buying off the shelf items and that vaccines are in limited supply globally thank you very much dr paul for educating us on these simplicities but the question is given these obvious constraints could not have the government done better the answer is an emphatic yes with the same constraints the united states has purchased enough vaccines to inoculate its population three times over the eu countries have done much the same canada has bought five times of what it needs and japan four times these countries had foresight they were proactive in anticipating the needs of their population the us even went to the extent of booking orders with pharmaceutical companies even when the trials were still on even now the extra stocks with these countries are available for bulk purchase contrast our record we gave away from what precious little we had and did not aggressively buy in time for our own needs myth two is that the government has not approved vaccines available globally dr paul s defence is that no application of any foreign manufacturer for approval is pending with the drugs controller this in fact is the real lament why did the government not move fast enough with foreign vaccine manufacturers well in time so that by now applications would have been cleared or were pending and production was on the anvil to say in a bureaucratic way that nothing is pending with us is no defence for the absence of proactively seeking out such collaborations before the second wave was upon us myth three is that the centre is not doing enough to ramp up domestic production of vaccines this myth is so much a fact that it barely needs rebuttal it is now in the public domain how serum institute of india sii sought financial assistance from the government to ramp up production but that this vital input was not provided till as late as april 2021 when we were in the throes of the second wave nor was bharat biotech the producers of covaxin encouraged to expand production through adequate funding and nor was the ipr of their vaccine shared with other indigenous pharma companies to boost total output all such efforts are being made only now after the mayhem and suffering we have witnessed during the second wave competent governments work in advance not in hindsight myth four is that the centre should invoke compulsory licensing dr paul says that this is not a very attractive option since it is not a formula that matters but active partnership training of human resources sourcing of raw materials and highest levels of bio safety labs which is required true but everybody knows that the real challenge was to use diplomacy at the right time to persuade foreign pharma companies to part with their technology and know how and obtain either indigenously or otherwise the material required to make the vaccines our foreign minister dr jaishankar has only now gone to the us for this purpose what was the government doing for all the months before compulsory licensing and the waiving of patents is permissible under the trips agreement during emergencies so it is not a question of whether it is an attractive option or not myths number five and six deal with the policy being adopted towards the states the argument is so laboured that it begs disbelief it is absolutely clear to anyone that a system where the centre and each state separately bid for global vaccines in short supply is a prescription for anarchy the lame argument that health is a state subject does not dilute the express assumption of powers by the centre when a national emergency has been declared since march 2020 under the national disaster management act the second argument that states themselves wanted powers to procure vaccines does not hold water either firstly many states are clear that they never asked for such powers secondly even if some states did surely the centre is duty bound to override their requests in the larger interest of central procurement which is the only rational policy to follow passing the buck to the states is a cynical cover up for a total abdication of responsibility and clearly against the provisions of the national disaster management act myth seven is that the centre is not taking any steps to vaccinate children dr paul s defence that no country in the world is giving vaccines to children may be literally correct but it ignores the fact that many countries have announced dates when they plan to do so the basic truth is that when adults are running from pillar to post to get vaccinated there are just not enough doses for children the government has quite simply been found starkly wanting on the issue of vaccines that is the fact the myth is that there can be a defence of the indefensible

schools has led to new calls for an elected school board but that s a bad idea you need one person in this case the state education commissioner to have clear responsibility and authority for school reform an elected school board would weaken reform efforts by overly dispersing power and it could lead to excessively political and parochial decision making demagoguery short term thinking and perhaps district wide or local corruption the state now oversees providence schools previously a school board with members selected by the mayor oversaw the district the state takeover which came in 2019 followed years of failure to raise outcomes in most of the city s schools it should be said that there are exceptions to bad performance especially classical high school the failures are in general continuing and the forced departure of supt harrison peters who only came aboard in february 2020 has added some more chaos mr peters resigned in the controversy around his hiring of olayinka alege to be a providence schools administrator despite past complaints of him toe popping five students when he worked in florida and then of giving a teenage boy a non consensual foot rub in a warwick gym bizarre enough for you the state not the city has the resources and authority to finally turn around this large complex district a takeover that will require much experimentation and patience to do this it needs to find the best national reform models and then whatever the political heat stick with the most promising ones are there large school system professionals in nearby

this summer of pent up demand this is not only a matter of public safety it s also an economic issue rhode island s beaches draw many visitors and their money from out of state for the state s beaches to develop a reputation for rowdiness or worse will scare many away i ve always been surprised by the number of people who want to be at a beach with hundreds or thousands of other people cheek by jowl with at least a few stoned drunk or both it seemed particularly strange that so many people showed up last weekend with the water still quite frigid then there s the glare of the sun that vaguely itchy feeling of salt on your face sand in and on everything i don t get the allure but i do hope that beach lovers will bring their wallets from out of state to the ocean state s many lovely beaches

efforts to encourage the building of multi unit housing be it brand new or by retrofitting more of the state s still large stock of old but sturdy and attractive in their antique way mill buildings how about converting parts of closed hospitals and stores into housing more happily the housing cost surge reflects the fact that especially after covid erupted lots more people want to live in the ocean state but long term sky high prices could hurt the state s economy by making it impossible for many workers to live and work in rhode island view larger the identity thieves taking advantage of

women having fewer babies means that households will have more money to pay for education and other services for the children they do have now if we could bring back the two parent family but of

wishes of a majority of texans if polls are accurate the far right legislature has come up with a new law that will let people carry handguns without a license background checks and training the national rifle association the gun and ammunition industry lobbying body loves this so much for the need for a well regulated militia cited in the second amendment instead it s an unregulated free for all of course military style rifles are the favored tool of mass shooters but the handgun law will lead to more individual murders in households bars and other public places as well as robberies and suicides and it will encourage more people to travel to the lone star state to stock up it s all crazy and we can t do anything about it in last week s san jose mass killing of nine followed by the suicide of the killer the murderer had three semi automatic handguns and a massive quantity of ammunition handguns aren t nearly as efficient as rifles in mass murder but still some of those texas guns will end up in new england what would be critical mass to get spineless legislators to enact real gun control how about 200 people killed by one man with an assault rifle which he had no trouble buying in a red state and using it at a qanon rally hamas kills gazans as the international media continue to do sad repetitive human interest stories on the devastation in gaza caused by the terrorist group hamas s war with israel whose destruction hamas seeks the implication all too often is that israel killed the civilians it would be more honest to say that hamas killed them by sending off rockets into israel from tightly packed gaza hoping not only to scare and kill a few israelis but especially to draw israeli fire that of course kills gazan civilians which hamas uses in its propaganda war meanwhile the israelis help keep the temperature high by illegally taking some palestinian properties in jerusalem early leisurely reading we re heading into summer reading weeks some of my most pleasant boyhood memories are of enjoying first say stuff like the dr doolittle books then the likes of kidnapped and treasure island old editions of which i still have they were brought over by my great grandparents from edinburgh scotland which these classics author robert louis stevenson came from then i took out from the library such historical novels as c s forester s horatio hornblower series more modern stuff such as hemingway s the sun also rises and fitzgerald s the great gatsby grabbed me later along with long histories and biographies i still remember having felt that i had joined hemingway in that crazy exhausting week in pamplona and fitzgerald through that summer in the early twenties and just before college i even tackled a bit of reading in french the very clear and simple french of albert camus s novel the stranger and a couple of the belgian george simenon s inspector maigret s books then more onerous summer jobs and other distractions halted my long golden age of summer reading books whose details i remember better than those i read in the crowded hectic midst of adult life i wonder what with all the distractions of our internet and cell phone age how many young people lose themselves in summer books i often think of these books when i look up into the summer sky and see contrails which i gazed at from time to time as i read outside on a frayed lawn chair near a big oak many decades ago contrails evoking freedom and trips to far away places always seem to me romantic newport death march newport has a long history of exotic criminal cases all part of the weird international romance of the place consider the late tobacco heiress doris duke s killing with a car of aide and designer eduardo tirella in 1966 she was never charged in the death then in 1982 there was the late claus von bulow s alleged attempted murder via insulin she died years later of his rich wife martha nicknamed sunny he was first convicted but a second sensational trial cleared him perhaps it s past time to offer summer tours of newport high society crime scenes followed by oysters and locally produced wine at one of the city by sea s fine

it was always crystal clear that the last thing the united workers party uwp wanted was to face a general election under covid 19 but wish and pray as it may at the end of the day this is exactly what it s got today despite his earlier assurances that would never be the prime minister has elected to have the nation prepare for a covid election with curfew and a state of emergency unless as he s also repeatedly said since its passage the governor general decides to end the emergency by simply issuing a declaration with no date forthcoming and the fifth anniversary of the june 6 2016 general elections exactly one week away the pm has made it known that the date for the next national poll will be attached to the achievement of the government s main battle victory in the war on covid herd immunity like playing lucky bag or likewise choosing a date from suggestions on slips of paper in a bowler hat determination of the election date has been fixed to everything from application of the outdated and never used 90 day extension of the government s life allowed by law to changing the traditional measurement of the five year term from the date of the election to the date of the first meeting of the new parliament to the five month extension of the february emergency from 90 days to 240 ending friday october 15 sponsored article continues below with several possible starting points and just a deadline date on the line it will take opposition leader philip j pierre more than just a simple understanding of the new applications of multiple mathematical political metamorphoses in the age of global warming climate change and electoral politicking to decide from where to start counting and how many days weeks or months are left before polling day the only card with a date on the table right now reads friday october 15 leaving average minds boggling while the prime minister tries his best to play the rest closest he can to his chest but with the opposition leader recently again reminding his parliamentary opponents that he always scored higher in maths than in english at college it can be safely assumed that the man of figures will already have figured out the shortest fraction of a distance between whenever the government decides it s five year term is up and the endgame date of friday october 15 but it would also appear that there s more in the 2021 elections mortar than just the herd immunity pestle as the government has also made it clear the election date is also connected to its ability to complete infrastructural development and construction projects aimed at influencing voters ahead of the crucial poll sponsored article continues below here again the hold up is also covid related having to do with delayed and uncertain arrivals of shipments of construction materials and building supplies needed to start and complete the likes of road and housing and other employment generating projects before election day by tying the election date to herd immunity and completion of pre election projects delayed by covid restrictions on shipping the government has made it even clearer that these two elements in the mortar might just be the first ingredients for an electoral concoction that s still awaiting some more spicy additions with the scientists saying covid will be with us until at least 2024 and saint lucia being the only caricom government with an expressed unwillingness to go to the polls under covid there s understandable speculation that the prime minister is likely being advised at home and abroad to continue playing by the book related word is that the pm is actually being advised abroad to find sufficient reasons to invoke laws and constitutional provisions that will allow him to continue to legally extend the war on covid and the emergency and consequently the government s life even if only through the prime minister who remains in office until a new pm is appointed by the governor general after the elections sponsored article continues below but word from home is also that an increasing number of uncertain cabinet ministers and new candidates are telling the pm that as far as the vibes they can hear see and feel the longer he waits the worse it will be of course uwp stags continue to brandish and blow their horns about winning the elections 16 1 anytime it is called but that s quite baffling especially when one considers that prime ministers call elections when and only when they are convinced their party will win the opposition loudly claiming to have been stumped into having to watch the government and ruling party successfully skirting the restrictions through silent but selective policing of the prevention protocols is betting highly on the electorate not abandoning its three times manifested and punishing 15 year formula of selecting to elect for regime change every five years accusing the prime minister of resorting to flashing mirror types of diversions like dancing on tv for votes the opposition leader is also counting on his long held belief that young people cannot be fooled and would therefore not be attracted by the dollars being offered for votes or hampers for vaccines sponsored article continues below but this being the first general elections to be openly held under covid lockdown and policed by a force being encouraged by its commissioner not to be forced into fear of not using force when they deem force necessary there are also understandable opposition fears that the next elections might see a greater degree of policing than any other indeed some are loudly arguing that the recent shuffling or reshuffling of top cops that resulted in the appointment of a new police commissioner on a two year contract less than a year before due general elections might very well have been the first major ingredient quietly placed even before the pestle in the covid election mortar meanwhile with news that the americans may soon dump a heavy dose of gifted vaccines saint lucia s way from its hundreds of millions of hoarded stocks and the local health authorities still sounding very confident that the un s covax vaccines will get here before friday october 15 it would normally have been safe to assume that herd immunity may very well be in sight but here again the distant light being hoped for at the end of the long covid 19 tunnel that s growing even longer in 2021 and may last until 2024 is growing dimmer by the day and even more distant by night sponsored article continues below the next question might therefore very well be whether herd immunity will still be the untested yardstick or the big global covid litmus test the prime minister is accused of inviting big pharma to make saint lucia a small lab and if saint lucia gets to the point of vaccinating the least 126 000 persons required to qualify for testing the truthfulness of the claimed effectiveness of the herd immunity before friday october 15 will the prime minister consider that mission accomplished or will he await the findings as per evidence of national covid immunity before deciding if and when to end the war on covid and call the election which has thus far proven to be at least as elusive as the coronavirus and what about friday the 15th sponsored article continues below if that s the preferred or inescapable final endgame deadline does it mean that saint lucia would break with tradition and not hold the election on a monday the only choice right now seems to be to wait and see what other ingredients might be placed into the mortar before the pestle is put to work but from all appearances in keeping with the global climate change that s also affected politics across the caribbean it must also be expected that the accumulated effects of covid fatigue and still high levels of vaccine hesitancy and or resistance may also effectively serve to immunize the same body politic the mortar and pestle concoction is supposed to vaccinate against which would take us back to square one of the original covid election date conundrum only this time three times squared
the secret republican plot to make democrats looks like completely incompetent imbeciles called operation let them govern seems to be working the snarky conservative regarding commissioner arkoosh and next year s us senate race i wouldn t fault her for the initial lack of vaccine in the county that said she could be the poster child of fear lockdowns and government overreach mask shaming commissioner gale for putting flags on veterans graves cemeteries are outside people placing flags wouldn t even get close to each other such contentiousness is all too emblematic of what we already see in washington will wonders never cease after months of denying it dr fauci finally admitted that he authorized grants to the wuhan lab in china the grants were to investigate coronavirus and bats then 3 lab workers got sick and all of a sudden the coronavirus was killing people i don t think this was a coincidence rick m i applaud the young lady running for school board director in boyertown good to see young folks get involved after doing some research i found out a lot partial screenshots edited to make her look bad negative comments from folks from other states and countries 5 000 signatures on a so called petition are they from this area this is a smear campaign folks this girl is being bullied dirty politics the unscientific fear of kids dying from covid is easily demonstrated in the following statistics pediatric deaths per year murder 864 car accidents 636 bike accidents 100 200 depending on the year drowning deaths just ages 0 5 350 flu 180 in a recent year and deaths from covid 200 obviously one death is too many florida has had its schools open since last august with no rise in deaths ruth mutter the democrats are pushing clean air i have a question are they doing it for us or is there another angle who would benefit from it big money backers you can count on that they will own the land and construction companies they will make money from their stocks in china where the turbines and panels and other equipment that is needed are made china is the most polluted country in the world the shootings continue and the conservatives as usual do nothing to help they love to say a good man with a gun will take out a bad man with a gun don t wait for that to happen because it never will the gun guys are running the other way while the defenseless get killed they like the idea of carrying a gun but shooting it to protect someone is something they can t do sad but true lefty would today s americans purchase gold jewelry fashioned from the dental fillings of holocaust victims the australian strategic policy institute identified 80 brands with ties to chinese labor camps linked to uighur extermination among them nike apple amazon that globalists are as nonplussed about genocide as they are china s role in virus spread is telling locally townships and school boards should reflect on support of blood brands with tax dollars m furlong well well well there is evidence that dopey joe does have one brain cell left as he backpedals on his promise to forgive college debt how can we not laugh about this which is worse offering such an outlandish reward for your vote or actually believing it would come true i do know that it is more concerning the number of people who actually believed it would happen and that includes madeleine dean markc923 last night in portland mostly peaceful folks celebrated the passing of george floyd by setting fires throwing frozen water bottles and eggs at police smashing windows painting graffiti on the justice building throwing metal spikes in the streets and generally destroyed as much property as they could sounds like my idea of a party how about you cynthia hutchins if the right would have demanded the vax passports first the narcissist leftists would have said no way and called this discrimination or racist because narcissists always disagree with something they don t think of first and always want to do just the opposite of what is being discussed if they don t think of it first and if the right says to do it for your health it s called reverse psychology quote from michael steele former rnc chair about current radical republican party this is not the party of the working man but it is more becoming the party of angry white nationalists and faux patriots afraid of their future and stewing in their victimhood as they dine on a steady diet of gop cancel culture conspiracies and lies patriot54 the intelligence of president biden was on display today according to joe a reason african americans have been hesitant to get vaccinated is that they don t live close to a drug store he said older african americans may theoretically live within 5 7 miles of a drug store but guess what that might well be 500 miles from a drug store that is a lol stupid comment jane b murder rates have soared in most major cities over the last year and the trend is accelerating since joe biden was elected joe biden says not a word about it his answer for it along with the democrats running these cities is to defund the police and cut the number of police if the democrats think that will work they are insane matt dorsey banks lend money to credit cardholders to buy products those who make time payments will pay the bank 15 interest banks use our money in banks pay us 003 interest no wonder banks are making billions sen inhofe gave a seminar to a small audience at the heritage foundation cspan on the importance of the electoral college and why the state compact on electors must be defeated he s was up front about it to paraphrase without the electoral college we republicans can cannot win the popular vote and cannot be elected so the majority won t accept the gop policies let s force it on them high gas prices aren t a democrat or republican thing it s simply the law of demand and supply the gas companies demand more money before they supply you with more gas period bad news for you democrats president trump s air plane is getting a safety check and a new paint job he will not be using it to campaign but to encourage people not to lose hope biden was sworn into office under oath to keep our country safe now he s letting terrorists walk into our country and we re losing the respect of foreign countries some are threatening us how dare biden degrade the military when his own son got a dishonorable discharge thank you markc923 for your congratulations to gov wolf madeleine dean chrissy houlahan joe ciresi and katie muth

this was my first trip to shelburne falls and i was awfully glad to have made its acquaintance as i peer into its broad storefront window filled with eclectic impulse buys the proprietor of wandering moon laura felsch waves for me to come on in inside there s handcrafted silver jewelry by felsch herself as well as medieval themed wall tapestries a smart looking collection of international pocketknives a mix of books about architecture animals and social commentary and curated gift cards we re kind of a mix of all sorts of things felsch explains when we first opened 26 years ago we had a medieval theme but now we incorporate different periods like arts and crafts she continues pointing to several period lamps i can t really sum up what we are except it feels like a living room filled with beautiful things we re unique so i recommend you just look around and enjoy yourself which is how i d sum up shelburne falls itself deliciously unique in a way that instills the desire to browse and explore a 90 minute drive from great barrington and about an hour s drive from pittsfield shelburne falls fits what i m looking for when it comes to a successful daytrip a friendly destination well under two hours away with a scenic drive natural and cultural attractions quirky feel great strolling and an array of unusual yet delicious restaurants this was my first trip to shelburne falls and i was awfully glad to have made its acquaintance first there s the drive out there sure you can take the masspike head up i 91 then jog back west but the better drive is the one through the hill towns east of pittsfield through dalton and then up up and more up the more altitude you gain the more rural it becomes this is a region of massachusetts that s filled with scenic byways if you drive out from south county you re likely to travel along at least two of them if you take a longer route back via north adams on the granddaddy of scenic byways mohawk trail you ll travel along or cross another two or three if you do travel up through dalton and the hill towns you might consider visiting zoar outdoor adventures in charlemont about eight miles west of shelburne falls and the go to place for whitewater rafting kayaking and ziplining when you arrive in shelburne falls the first thing you ll notice is how it straddles the deerfield river the two bridges connecting the riverbanks are immediate visual standouts the car bridge is an old iron structure dating back well over 100 years and right next to it is a popular local attraction named the bridge of flowers a defunct trolley bridge that was repurposed into a landscaped pedestrian bridge 80 years before manhattan s high line was similarly transformed reopening in june check website for date just downriver from the bridges are the falls themselves and below them are the famous glacial potholes bowl like rock formations that while not actually formed by glaciers were formed over thousands of years by this impressive cataract in the deerfield river shelburne falls is an historic village designation and not an actual municipality rather each bank of the river is its own town buckland on the west and shelburne on the east once a popular salmon fishing spot for the region s indigenous peoples the area was incorporated in 1775 it was mainly agricultural until the start of the industrial revolution at which time the river was harnessed to power mills those mills kept going until recent decades when they either closed or moved shop remnants of that era include a factory outlet for lamson famous for its forged cutlery and located on the buckland side of the river sprinkled among all the durable kitchen knives and utensils are factory seconds which are great bargains i couldn t even locate the imperfections on the spatula and the mighty mini masher that i bought perfect for hand mashing potatoes and cauliflower with ease the next economic wave to hit shelburne falls was a creative one artists gallery owners restaurateurs who helped restore aging buildings along bridge street as well as the old mill buildings it s this creative influx that gives the historic village its unique charm as you stroll along bridge street on the shelburne side of the river you ll come across eclectic stores like felsch s wandering moon or flora in a building the size of a railcar cantilevered over the river watermark gallery at 1 deerfield avenue sells contemporary art the biggest gallery in town is perched above the buckland side of the river the salmon falls gallery it s owned by renowned glassblower josh simpson and features his work and that of other artists using different media down the street is the shelburne falls trolley museum reopening july 3 that features a 15 minute trolley ride as well as an old pump handcar guaranteed to be popular with youngsters when it comes to food shelburne falls is uniquely equipped for a small village it has some of the grooviest restaurants i ve come across in a while queen of the ball here is the gypsy apple café located in a storefront on bridge street it seats fewer than 20 and chef wescott s menu is similarly spare yet beckoning in the warm weather a back patio adds seating for another dozen another minuscule favorite this one seating fewer than a dozen is delicatesse take out only at this writing which features hand rolled bagels with lox potato latkes a pickle plate and frisée aux lardons with poached eggs yum i stumbled across another restaurant on bridge street called hearty eats and was psyched to see all sorts of salads and fish dishes on the menu not in the mood for a big meal i opted for the fresh falafel and slaw plate you d be amazed at how many people don t get falafel right but here it was perfect as was the bed of fresh slaw it was only later when ordering a dairy free and gluten free seed filled cookie that i realized this cozy stop was actually vegan and free of gluten put simply the food was so delicious that i hadn t even realized i quickly made up for that lack of gluten when i walked over to baked a bakery on deerfield avenue and ordered a scone sadly there was little room left for an ice cream shake at the local pharmacy baker s that still features a counter with swivel stools and a soda jerk and it s not for show this is just how shelburne falls rolls groovy authentic unique if i hadn t been pushing the clock i d have opted for a hike up to the high ledges a series of trails on audubon land above town that have views of the entire valley and mount greylock in the distance shelburne falls is nestled between two peaks massamet and bray mountains so there s plenty of great hiking this time around i settled for a view of the falls around the corner from the bakery with its brick stone and wooden buildings dating back well over 100 years its functional supermarkets and food co ops three bookstores and a gem of a public library shelburne falls is a joy to stroll around it s so picturesque that hollywood has come calling several times the judge with robert duvall and labor day with kate winslet were both filmed there star shaped plaques reminiscent of hollywood s walk of fame are affixed to many a building in town including the town hall which happens to house a volunteer run movie theater on the top floor as if a turn of the century town hall with a movie theater weren t enough around the corner and down an alley there s the nation s second oldest continuously operated bowling alley and as if that weren t enough it s candlepin bowling cozy with just eight lanes the shelburne falls bowling alley has been in operation since 1906 closed due to covid reopening soon candlepin if you haven t played is akin to ten pin bowling except that the balls are the size of pomelos the pins are skinny and if they fall down and remain in place you just play on the best part is you get three tries per turn and if you wanna celebrate a win the other best part is the 3 16 oz drafts of pabst blue ribbon if bowling makes you hungry as well as thirsty you ll have a good excuse to walk back across the river to the popular west end pub or blue rock restaurant or if you re an occasional health geek like me you can pop over to the historic mccusker s market now run as a satellite natural foods store by franklin community co op of greenfield you re bound to meander across many of your own finds in addition to the three bookstores there s an artists co op and a bunch of nicely curated thrift clothing stores on your way home if there s still time in the day and room in your tummy don t forget to make a stop at the old creamery only outdoor seating at the moment in cummington a delightful food co op and gathering place up among the hill towns
we should not forget that with more than 1 5 billion people india alone accounts for about 1 6 of the entire humankind it means that the indian crisis definitely will not be limited to its own territory by professor jayantha lal ratnasekera second wave of the covid 19 pandemic started in the latter part of april in india is continuing to be threatening though there is a significant decrease in the daily count of fresh corona patients from 400 000 in the first week of may to 200 000 in the fourth week the situation is still far from satisfactory the total number of corona deaths has passed the 300 000 mark and the total number of covid 19 patients has exceeded 275 million as of may 28 2021 eventhough the vaccination process has been accelerated during past few days india s healthcare system has not fully recovered yet still there is a severe shortage of some drugs hospital beds oxygen ventilators etc in many rural areas furthermore the rapid spread of the black fungus or mucormycosis disease has added fuel to the already burning crisis the health ministry reported 3 498 deaths in the last 24 hours reuters adnan abidi obviously a number of factors have contributed to this unexpected surge in april and the emergence of new more infectious virus variants is considered to be one of the main reasons experimental data show that the variant b 1 1 7 first found in uk is the dominant virus variant in the state of punjab a new more dangerous variant called b 1 167 first identified in india late last year was found to be dominant in the state of maharashtra b 1 167 variant which has already found in more than 50 countries is said to be containing two mutations having an increased transmissibility further the slow progress in the vaccination process till april has been another contributory factor to the devastating second coivd 19 wave india while being the leading manufacturer of anti covid vaccine has commenced the vaccination process in january 2021 but the progress has been rather slow by mid april the first dose of the vaccine was administered to only 10 of the total population and both two doses were given only to 2 however after the vaccination process started in january the attitude of the majority of people in india including the political authorities towards the pandemic has changed significantly the arrival of the vaccine has pushed everyone to a relaxed mood and there was a misapprehension among many that india has already conquered the covid 19 pandemic in february 2021 bharatiya janatha party has passed a resolution praising the prime minister narendra modi for his leadership in turning india to a victorious nation in the fight against covid 19 under these circumstances the travel restrictions were relaxed and political rallies and religious ceremonies with mass gatherings were allowed elections were held in a number of states and thousands of people have gathered in political rallies in a rally held in west bengal prime minister narendra modi said that he was thrilled to see such a large crowd simultaneously a number of religious festivities were held and the hindu pilgrimage kumbh mela has drawn millions of worshippers as reported by hindustan times more than 9 million people have bathed in ganga river during the period from january 14 to april 27 2021 as a ritual of the kumbh mela festival thus the false assumption that india has conquered the pandemic and the resultant relaxed behaviour have in turn contributed to the disastrous second wave of the pandemic however what we should understand is that the current covid crisis in india will not be contained within its borders but is a real threat to the entire world the first coronavirus patient was found in wuhan city hubei province china in december 2019 and in january 2020 the world health organization who has declared a public health emergency of international concern as the virus has spread outside china later in march 2020 the who has declared the novel coronavirus or covid 19 virus as a global pandemic according to experts definition a pandemic is an epidemic of an infectious disease that has spread across the world and created havoc though this pandemic has been torturing the entire world for more than one and half years now some of the countries especially the so called developed countries were reluctant to accept its global world wide nature instead of joining hands with the who to curb the virus some countries have been trying control the virus on their own however the current indian covid crisis has shocked the entire world including the developed countries and forced them to change their approach and attitudes towards the pandemic now it is apparent that many countries have accepted the fact that indian crisis may easily turn into a global crisis firstly we should not forget that with more than 1 5 billion people india alone accounts for about 1 6 of the entire humankind it means that the indian crisis definitely will not be limited to its own territory as emphasized by dr saumya swaminathan who s chief scientist once the virus does not respect borders or nationalities or age or sex or religion when the number of infectious persons increases in such a populous country there is a high probability of the emergence of new virus variants every single infection provides the virus an opportunity to evolve and produce a mutation in other words when the number of covid infections in a country is high then the probability of emergence of new variants is also high in turn these new virus variants might spread into other countries for example it was reported that on a recent flight from new delhi to hong kong 50 passengers were tested positive for coid 19 as mentioned above the more dangerous variant b 1 167 has now found in more than 50 countries it has to be noted that the threat of spreading the indian b 1 167 variant to the neighbouring countries such as bangladesh nepal sri lanka is even higher with a 1 770 km long border the indian virus variant may easily penetrate to the nepal territory in fact a significant increase in the number of covid 19 patients was observed from early may in nepal the total number of corona patients in nepal has already exceeded 540 000 and total number of corona deaths has reached the 7 000 mark with a relatively weaker healthcare system only 2 2 of the total population of nepal has been vaccinated to date dr netra prasad timsina chairman of the nepal red cross society has warned that if the present trend is not arrested immediately nepal will have to face a situation very much similar to the current indian one in a few weeks time likewise threat to sri lanka also cannot be underestimated few weeks ago it was reported that an indian national was found infected with the b 1 167 variant in a quarantine center also there were news reports about attempts by sri lankans living in india especially in tamil nadu to come to sri lanka illegally using boats with the deteriorating conditions in the refugee camps in tamil nadu these illegal attempts might increase further furthermore it has been a long tradition of sri lankan fishermen to have contacts with their indian counterparts in the deep sea the negative impact of the on going indian covid crisis is not limited only to the possibility of virus spread but to many other spheres first of all india is supposed to produce 70 of the world s covid vaccine requirement and the serum institute of india was given the rights to produce astrazeneca vaccine india is supposed to provide a large quantity of the vaccine to low and middle income countries under the covax facility backed by the un and who however india has temporarily suspended the export of the covid vaccine due to the current crisis although the indian authorities have announced that they might recommence the export of vaccines in october the temporary suspension has already adversely affected vaccination roll outs in many countries including sri lanka moreover the pharmaceutical industry in india is the third largest in the world in terms of volume and 20 of the global exports of generic drugs is done by india obviously if there will be a jeopardy in the indian pharmaceutical industry as well it will have dire consequences for the healthcare systems around the world in such a scenario a severe shortage of drugs around the world could also be anticipated in addition india is the fifth largest economy in the world and india s contribution to the global economic growth is extensive with a relatively high annual growth rate of 4 to 8 during last few years india has had a significant impact on the world economy however if india s economy go downhill due to the present crisis it will have a devastating effect on the economies of many countries including the developed ones if the current travel restrictions with india will continue for a long time it will be a real bad news for many businesses around the world furthermore india provides a large number of back office staff for many sectors in the europe and usa considering all these issues it is imperative for all the countries to help india to come out of this crisis us president joe biden was one of the first world leaders to announce the readiness to support india and us has already sent several flights with essential goods to india it is noteworthy that even pakistan has come forward to help india in this difficult time russia has sent a stock of its covid vaccine sputnik v to india and granted permission to india to produce its vaccine so the current covid crisis in india has given a severe warning to the entire world and it has taught the world many lessons it has proved that this is a real global pandemic a real threat to the entire humanity and as such a collective effort from the entire world is needed at this crucial moment it has reminded us again that the human civilization is so interconnected today that no one will be safe until everyone is safe the writer vice chancellor uva wellassa university sri lanka

as hopes rise that the pandemic is ebbing in the united states and europe visions of a second roaring twenties to match last century s post pandemic decade have proliferated months of lockdown and restrictions on social life have given way to dreams of a new era of frivolity and decadence for some it feels like party time in many parts of the world such thoughts are unthinkable india is engulfed in crisis the virus is raging in south america japan is grappling with a punishing new wave of cases and even in places where cases are falling and vaccinations are expanding deep wounds remain from more than a year of death illness and isolation covid 19 won t disappear more infectious variants are circulating herd immunity may be elusive long term health effects will linger there will be no hollywood ending but a coming summer and a soaring stock market have lifted optimism and fueled predictions of a new roaring twenties this time bill maher has suggested we do it without the depression at the end of it the new yorker joked that prohibition in the new roaring twenties should be on company mandated virtual happy hours madison avenue has turned up the heat suitsupply a men s fashion brand is running a suggestive ad campaign with writhing models and the tagline the new normal is coming summer travel is booming a summer of love sexplosion is predicted even the bob is back in style is it fair to connect these twin 20s both decades that follow closely on the heels on of worldwide pandemic could two 20s really roar do we all need to start buying flapper dresses and brushing up on our f scott fitzgerald some of the parallels are legitimate says nicholas christakis professor of sociology and medicine at yale university and author of apollo s arrow the profound and enduring impact of coronavirus on the way we live after an interim period of coping with the clinical psychological and economic shock of the virus he says we ll see an uplift this summer with a post pandemic period taking root by 2023 it will he says be a bit of a party understandably people will be very relieved when this is all finally over people have been cooped one way or another for a very long time christakis says we re going to see people relentlessly seeking out social opportunities in nightclubs and restaurants and bars and sporting events and musical concerts and political rallies we might see some sexual licentiousness some loosening of sexual mores such prognostications have tantalized many eager for the fabled liberation of a century ago what fitzgerald described as the most expensive orgy in history outside of the 1960s perhaps no decade looms larger in the collective imagination than the 1920s thanks in part to the emerging mass culture that captured the time the swinging speakeasies the harlem renaissance the first talkie in 1927 s the jazz singer over time the mythology has only grown glitzier see baz luhrmann gatsby 2013 there s truth in that portrait of the 20s but mainly to wealthier white americans the decade was punishing to farmers for the first time more people lived in cities membership surged for the ku klux klan which targeted african americans immigrants jews and catholics anyone who didn t meet its definition of a real american in 1921 one of the worst incidents of racial violence occurred the tulsa race massacre three years later the immigration act of 1924 restricted immigrants from asia and eastern europe the 1920s in short were not all they were cracked up to be we have today in the united states cheek by jowl prosperity and depression the author and civil rights activist w e b du bois wrote in 1926 it s not hard to see many of the same threads today racial injustice economic inequity convulsive technological change the 1921 campaign slogan of warren g harding a return to normalcy sounds very familiar and even appealing to those who have had it with the new normal forecasts on wall street of course vary the united nations last month raised its global economic forecast to 5 4 growth in 2021 while many analysts are predicting the pace to quicken in the months and years ahead tina fordham partner and head of global political strategy for avonhurst foresees a post lockdown period that will feel like the great gatsby only to a few for many it could be more like the grapes of wrath unless steps are taken to address inequities which accelerated during the pandemic and the gaps in the social safety net fordham concluded are we even right to connect the 1920s with the 1918 influenza to john m barry author of the defining history the great influenza it s a false association the so called spanish flu was far more virulent and deadly it killed more than 50 million worldwide and some 675 000 americans more than ten times the toll of wwi to the u s people seem to think we just leapt into the roaring twenties says barry but first we went through 1919 which is one of the most chaotic and violent years in american history then you had a serious recession in 1920 1921 the aftermath this time one would hope is quite different people also experienced the 1918 influenza differently lockdowns then never lasted more than a few weeks the societal surge that followed in the 20s most historians ascribe that to the postwar period the roaring twenties that was the lost generation says barry who is writing a book on the covid 19 pandemic there was a sense of fatalism ennui disillusionment with the world that i think was much more closely related to the war lucy moore author of anything goes a biography of the roaring twenties connects world war i with the 1918 influenza in that they both were punishing for young americans the 1920s says moore were propelled by a

weather latest summer 2021 weather forecasts released for florida some can expect scorching heat others can expect a cool rainy summer here s what the old farmers almanac and accuweather predict for fl the old farmer s almanac has released its summer forecast predictions for florida some parts of the summer are predicted to be cooler while others will be the typical florida summer heat shutterstock florida ready for two more predictions on what mother nature has in store for popular florida this summer which officially begins june 20 you may like this one accuweather and the old farmers almanac recently released their 2021 summer forecasts what should floridians expect well while it s too early to stock up on hurricane necessities the private weather company accuweather has released its 2021 summer weather forecast and said the overall impacts from tropical systems in 2021 are expected to be a bit lower than the past few years but it is not zero meteorologist paul pastelok said we do feel there could be a named storm in june but the way the pattern is setting up in june in the eastern u s pastelok explained anything that might develop may be forced away from the coast or head well down to the south towards mexico or south texas there is an elevated threat for a tropical strike stretches from the atlantic coast of florida through the carolinas but the central gulf coast will not be free from tropical systems just that the overall chance of a landfalling tropical storm or hurricane will be lower than it was in 2020 according to accuweather forecasters while not predicted to be as busy as last year the 2021 atlantic hurricane season is expected to be another above average season accuweather is predicting 16 to 20 named storms 7 to 10 hurricanes and three to five direct hits on the u s a typical season features 14 named storms seven hurricanes and three or four u s landfalls our biggest concern is the fact that water temperatures across the atlantic are already warmer than normal over a larger part of the basin said accuweather hurricane expert dan kottlowski who has been forecasting the tropics for 45 years warm water is one of the key ingredients for tropical cyclone formation and with the temperatures continually rising throughout the summer it will translate to more fuel for tropical storms and hurricanes that do develop old farmer s almanac forecast you may like the old farmer s almanac recent forecast while many are likely looking forward to hot days filled with camping park visits bike rides and barbecues the question remains will the weather cooperate while it s too early to determine what each day will bring the old farmer s almanac predicts that florida will have a thundery summer summer will be slightly cooler than normal with near normal rainfall the hottest periods will be in early and mid to late july across the nation mother nature will bring the heat to a significant portion of the united states according to the old farmer s almanac forecast temperatures are predicted to be hotter than normal in areas including the atlantic corridor the eastern great lakes region and the upper midwest south to parts of the intermountain region parts of the pacific northwest coastal california and alaska may also see warmer temperatures rainfall is also expected to be greater than normal in northeast states the eastern great lakes region and much of the west coast the rocky mountain region can also expect a wet summer the almanac s weather forecast methodology comes from a secret formula that was created by its founder robert thomas in 1792 the exact prediction process remains a secret but the periodical discloses that it uses solar science climatology and meteorology to make its forecasts the old farmer s almanac which is not to be confused with its rival forecast predictor farmers almanac is north america s oldest continuously published periodical according to its website farmers almanac has also released its summer 2021 predictions like its rival s predictions it also said that this summer will have hot thunderstorms
editor s note due to the popularity of some of eham s older articles many of which you may not have read the eham net team has decided to rerun some of the best articles that we have received since eham s inception these articles will be reprinted to add to the quality of eham s content and in a show of appreciation to the authors of these articles this article was originally published on 08 26 2008 have you been considering placing a tower on your property for your antenna s there are a good number of things to be considered before a good decision can be made on what to raise into the air and where to place it the first question would be what will be sufficient and more importantly safe as an antenna support to meet the needs for your system study the structural requirements for the antenna s going up weight wind load turning radius etc study the structural integrity of various support towers knowing the perimeters of your apparatus should always be the primary consideration the investment of acquiring knowledge and the implementations of safety standards are paramount many are intimidated by the cost involved in putting up a tower the tower placement event does not necessarily need to be one that requires a great deal of money there are means to have an economical tower as well there are ways to accomplish an economical tower installation safely again it all hinges on what would safely get the job done safety is the key word and is always the most important consideration you may not need 65g rohn my dream tower stock to install a 2 element quad for 20 meters through 10 meters then again in your particular situation that may be the required method to keep the antenna in the air safely perhaps you are a ham operator without the need for a very high tower maybe the system being thought of is not a multiple antenna array which would increase wind load and tower twist factors encountered you may find that a lighter duty tower will meet the many considered requirements you may come to the conclusion that rohn 25g will be sufficient for your needs maybe something even lighter than rohn 25g is a possibility seeing the ever increasing costs of new tower sections and hardware you may find yourself wanting to proceed with used tower be very careful to study your facts on tower and not get burned on a deal there is a light duty rohn 20g still available from older installations of primarily tv antennas the 20g rohn and the 25g rohn towers have differences that may not be known of or seen at an undereducated first observation the horizontal lengths of z bracing some call these rungs on 20g is seven per section the rung count on 25g is eight rohn refers to these as bays thus the bay count on 20g would be 6 as opposed to 7 bays on 25g the gauge of galvanized steel used to make both tower grades both in the wall thickness of the legs and the gauge of the z bracing is different as well 25g being the more substantial of the two the structural support requirements guy wires bracing free stand limits etc for the tower grades are different too these facts are not necessarily a bad thing in certain applications 20g is more than enough to be safe and secure if you are looking for something for a lighter duty requirement set up 20g may be just what you are looking for since so many see this as disposable tower the following is one hands on experience for the tower installation at my qth i wanted to offer this to new comers in the hobby or others that may be intimidated by huge dollar amounts often encountered in a tower planting there are economical and safe ways to put some metal in the air acquiring a tower there is a good chance that many homeowners in your area would like to have their old antenna support system removed from their property this can usually be forecast when you see an old beat up tv antenna with the twin lead going nowhere and blowing in the breeze just knock on the door and ask there are only a limited number of outcomes that could take place get off my property before i call the cops i am going to put something up there on the 12th of never i still use it or if you can take it down safely you can have it i have acquired 2 rohn 20g towers of about 40 feet each free for the removal efforts between the two towers i easily ended up with enough 20g to get 40 feet of tower in the air the extra sections were given to friends who wanted to use them before you climb any tower inspect it thoroughly i can t stress this point enough the base section or any other given area may be rusted and weak there is nothing like riding down a tower from any height strapped to it and nowhere to go if a section gives way and the tower comes down the brace connection may come loose as well with the potential to cause a dire situation just these two possible situations should never be considered to be rare events many people hams and non hams have been badly injured worse yet killed in these types of situations safety first show up to the job with the proper equipment gin pole ropes climbers belt tethers and other relative tools and don t show up with out your hard hat and other relative safety equipment above all bring a competent ground man when the tower is down be kind enough to cut off the legs as flush as possible go as far as to beat them flush to the concrete assuming the foundation is above grade to avoid the possibility of someone tripping over or falling onto the remaining leg remnants and being injured installation example the 3x3 square and almost 4 foot deep hole was the biggest chore a good 6 inch or so layer of drainage material was laid in for leg drainage this is a must if you do not want the legs to split from water accumulation and freezing on a pour over one yard it is highly suggested to have re bar reinforcement in the hole you may want to go ahead and ground all three legs to an eight foot copper clad ground rod before the pour too go ahead and ground that re bar as well preparation is your friend the concrete trucked in for a mere 150 dollars was 150 dollars well spent that was in the summer of 2005 i am sure the costs have gone up some since then there was a 1 1 2 yard minimum thus enough concrete for a really nice looking foundation well above grade and yes scribing your call sign in the concrete is a must do after researching the cost of purchasing bagged concrete mix at home improvement centers hauling it home and risking the breakage of my trucks suspension it takes a lot of bags to make a yard and a half and the time effort and concrete structural integrity knowledge needed to mix my own i found that you can save a few bucks by mixing the concrete by hand the difference in cost is rather insignificant when you consider the quality of the mix the quality and strength of the mix or slump is important unless you are very familiar with concrete mixing and know how to get around a 4000 mix or if you want fiber mesh etc etc leave the mixing to the professionals your hauling vehicle will be grateful as well as your back the tower is planted nearly 4 feet away from the exterior of the home the tower is also bracketed to the house at about 12 feet via home brew stand offs for the aluminum siding no electrical connection between the house and tower home brew braces made from 1 1 4 inch gas pipe and angular joints and mounting plate fittings very inexpensive and very effective bracing this installation is more than enough to support a mini hybrid quad for 6 10 15 20 meters 44 feet and a 10 element 2 meter antenna 48 feet there is also a home brew out rigger about 28 inches out from the tower at 39 feet up this is where there is a pulley rope system for the 135 foot doublet installed notice the rotator is nestled comfortably at the intersection of the last intermediate and top sections was this enough this tower has survived through quite a number of mid western usa storms with straight line winds in excess of 70 mph big winds that up root trees of 2 or more feet in diameter reek havoc on roofing shingles and blow metallic sheds blocks down the street also there are no guy wires here being at only 40 feet only the h b brackets at 12 feet no doubt if there were to be larger antennas in the air here such as a th6dx or the like or if going up any higher i would have went with a much more costly tower such as rohn 45g or the like even 25g would work for a larger antenna if properly installed and guyed even guyed i wouldn t trust the 20g with a larger antenna system due to the possibility of the tower twisting thus a catastrophe rohn 20g is exactly what it is light duty just wanted to say that even though 20g is not as sturdy as the 25g it does have very high potential in the right situation best of all if money is of consideration a person can usually acquire and install a 20g tower quite economically you have to consider the needs and requirements to meet the

throughout the covid 19 era comparisons to the 1918 influenza pandemic have often been drawn from a fiscal standpoint though world war ii bears a stronger resemblance the massive defense expenditures of the mid 1940s are equivalent to today s stimulus checks and paycheck protection program ppp loans according to the federal reserve bank of st louis today s federal debt as a percentage of gdp sits just below its post wwii peak the monetary parallels to the 1940s are also striking in order to reduce borrowing costs the federal reserve created money to purchase treasury bonds to keep interest rates down consequently the consumer price index rose by nearly 60 from 1942 1948 meaning that holders of cash lost almost 40 of their purchasing power by 1951 the situation had become untenable in march of that year the treasury and the fed issued a statement which committed to minimize monetization of the public debt since then various u s presidents leaned on fed officials to keep monetary conditions easy favoring inflation risks over unemployment risks particularly during election years but since the early 1980 s the fed s stated policy if not always its actual one has generally been to get in front of rising inflation while it s still brewing as fed chairman jerome powell has made clear in recent addresses however that four decades long approach has officially ended in an april 28 press conference powell stated his intention to let inflation run hot well above 2 while it keeps stoking the fire with low interest rates and bond purchases investors seem to have grasped the implications of the fed s rhetoric bond markets are now forecasting the highest anticipated five year inflation rate 2 6 since before the global financial crisis stock prices have risen markedly in the expectation that more dollars in circulation will translate into higher corporate profits commodity prices have likewise gone on a tear and while digital coins and non fungible tokens may bear many of the classic bubble hallmarks most of them have one thing that the u s dollar does not scarcity skeptics may decry the recent inflation concerns as the mere continuation of fearmongering that began with the fed s bond buying during the global financial crisis period what s different this time around the new reserves that the fed created aren t just sitting idly on bank balance sheets as they did in 2009 today the new dollars have gone directly into individuals and businesses bank accounts and they are getting into the economy the labor department reported a 4 2 rise in the consumer price index in april 2021 over last year because the demand for cash has risen so dramatically since the crisis era money creation has not yet generated the high level of consumer price inflation that it would have historically however monetary policy operates with a long lag so it s very difficult to forecast how much inflation will eventually show up while we may be fighting a virus rather than a war the economic collateral damage inflation remains the same today as it did two generations ago now just as then holders of cash and bonds will absorb the hits as their purchasing power erodes as the inflation risks spike investors should seriously reconsider whether bonds and cash are truly low risk after all about james adams cfa cfp and bssf wealth bssf wealth is a fee only financial

editor s note this story originally ran may 30 it was updated june 30 with additional farm stands two years ago this very weekend my husband and i were in lancaster city looking for a place to live in mere weeks we would be moving here from seattle in preparation for our new life and new town i took to the internet searching for farm markets and other ways to access seasonal produce after all lancaster was farm country right as i have shared in these pages over the past 18 months i knew very little about lancaster county other than the requisite tourist attractions what i did learn is that basic info on local agriculture was difficult to come by at least on a consumer eater level lists were fragmented outdated and read more like promotional copy i hopped from site to site with little to show for my efforts determined to understand the terroir upon which we landed i started from scratch by driving around getting lost and going straight to the source of the corn tomatoes blueberries and squash since then i have been on a personal mission to deepen my knowledge and understanding of this place so many of you call home and because food is my compass i took my quest on the road from east earl to elizabethtown bainbridge to bird in hand reinholds to ronks with many spots in between the result is what follows a guide to lancaster s extraordinary farm stands in one place i personally visited every stand on this list verifying that it was in fact open for business especially in the wake of the covid 19 pandemic because the county is so vast we organized the guide by geography with six designated sections east north northeast south west and lancaster city suburbs the hope is that it will inspire you like it did me to get out of your comfort zone and see another part of the county to take in a new to you vista to bite into a peach from peach bottom or a cucumber from kirkwood to make a new farmer friend or a friend period in this county that often feels like a state and to this newbie a country the list is far from comprehensive but that s where you come in if you don t see your favorite listed send me a note and we will update the list online and

the s p 500 can take you further than you may think in some ways investing is like participating in a race you don t necessarily need to be the fastest right out of the gate to win rather you just need to keep a steady pace over the long haul to come out ahead the s p 500 is one of the best long term investments out there and famed investor warren buffet has long touted the s p 500 as an ideal option in fact during the 2020 berkshire hathaway shareholder s meeting buffett claimed that for most people the best thing to do is to own the s p 500 index fund here s why the s p 500 is so powerful and how it could help you make a lot of money in the stock market a more resilient investment the s p 500 is comprised of 500 of the largest and most stable companies in the united states when you invest in an s p 500 index fund you re investing in all the stocks that make up the s p 500 in order to mirror the index s performance because the s p 500 contains some of the strongest companies in the country it s more likely to see positive long term growth in addition it s more resilient in the face of market crashes this isn t to say that the s p 500 is immune to market downturns however it s more likely to recover from crashes than some other types of investments since the s p 500 s inception in 1957 it has faced countless corrections downturns and crashes given enough time however it s been able to recover from every single one and since its inception it has earned an average rate of return of around 10 per year spx data by ycharts this doesn t necessarily mean the s p 500 will continue earning 10 returns year after year there will be years when you experience losses while other years you ll earn much higher than average returns over time those good years and bad years should average out to around 10 per year the market will inevitably crash sooner or later but by investing in s p 500 index funds there s a very good chance your investments will recover how much can you earn with the s p 500 although s p 500 index funds are relatively safe investments you can still potentially make a lot of money the key to getting rich with the s p 500 is to give your money as much time as possible to grow ideally you ll have started saving early in life and can continue investing consistently for several decades but if you re off to a late start it s still important to start investing now instead of putting it off let s say you re investing 300 per month in s p 500 index funds and you re earning a 10 average annual rate of return here s approximately how much you d accumulate over time depending on how many years you have left to save number of years to save total savings 5 22 000 10 57 000 20 206 000 30 592 000 40 1 593 000 given enough time it s possible to become a millionaire by investing in s p 500 index funds but even if you don t have 40 years left to save you can still make a substantial amount of money also one of the best features of this type of investment is that it s hands off in other words your s p 500 index funds will perform best when you don t touch them for as long as possible so all you need to do is invest consistently and then sit back and let your investments do the rest of the work for you warren buffett is a proponent of s p 500 index funds and it s easy to see why there are several advantages to choosing this type of investment and by investing consistently you can potentially earn more than you think
market review and update finally after a week of false starts the buy signals kicked in and the markets mustered a rally as we with markets deeply oversold on a short term basis and with signals at levels that generally precede short term rallies the rally on thursday and friday was not unexpected notably the s p 500 held support at the 50 dma and rallied back into the previous trading range on wednesday the triggered its short term buy signal which will likely provide some relative outperformance over the s p 500 it will be important for the nasdaq to hold above the 50 dma into next week the good news is that we did indeed get the rally we were expecting the not so good news is that the rally already consumed a majority of the buy signal such does not mean the market is about to correct it does suggest that upside remains limited near term however the buy signal has a bit more room to run such suggests we may see some relative performance pickup between the s p 500 via and the nasdaq via over the next week or so our more significant concern remains the weekly sell signal historically these weekly signals typically denote periods of more significant volatility swings or corrections the biggest correction risk comes when the daily and weekly signals align importantly these weekly sell signals do not always resolve into a correction however by the time you realize a correction has started it is often too late to do much about it therefore we tend to take these weekly signals at face value and adjust our risk exposures accordingly still expecting a bigger correction as discussed over the last few weeks we still expect a more extensive correction this summer currently the markets are in an exceptionally long stretch in the market without a 5 pullback so the odds are rising importantly as noted in this week s 3 minutes video below the one thing we continue to watch very closely is interest rates wall street analysts continue to ratchet up earnings at one of the fastest paces on record for earnings to meet these rather lofty expectations economic growth must sustain a very high growth rate into 2022 however interest rates including for the treasury note below peaked a couple of months ago suggesting economic growth will weaken in the months ahead if rates are sniffing out slower economic growth as stimulus fades from the system the earnings are at risk of fairly significant downward revisions in the market figures this out a repricing of assets is likely such is why we continue to suspect a 5 10 correction is a higher probability than most think inflation is likely transient we previously discussed that inflation might indeed be more transitory given the impacts creating increased prices were artificial i e stimulus semi conductor shortages and pandemic related shutdowns inflation is and remains an always transient factor in the economy as shown there is a high correlation between economic growth and inflation as such given the economy will quickly return to sub 2 growth over the next 24 months inflation pressures will also subside significantly given the economy is roughly comprised of 70 consumption sharp spikes in inflation slows consumption higher prices lead to less quantity thereby slowing economic growth such is particularly when inflation impacts things the bottom 80 of the population which live paycheck to paycheck primarily consume the most however another important factor behind inflationary pressures is an individual s own actions as noted last week by société générale s albert edwards surveys suggest that inflation fears have become investors number one concern but why look at it that way we could equally say it is investors own bullishness on the strength of this economic cycle that is driving prices sharply higher in the most cyclically exposed equity sectors and industrial commodities bloomberg s john authers discussed the same noting a reflexivity to investors belief in rising inflation in inflation as in many other areas of economic life perceptions can form reality and that is certainly true of inflation the university of michigan monthly survey of consumers expectations perennially shows shoppers foreseeing more inflation than will in fact arrive the important factor here is the direction of travel if they are more worried about inflation they will do more to guard against it which will tend to push up prices china drives inflation such is an important point as albert notes when investors pile into commodities as an investment vehicle to benefit from rising inflation they create substantial upstream cost pressures beyond the cascading effect of upstream commodity price pressures headline cpis are also quickly impacted as food and energy prices rip higher in other words investors cause inflation by their actions however this is where albert keys in on another critical driver of inflation in addition to this the observation by investors that industrial commodity prices are rising only serves to reaffirm their belief about cyclical strength and rising inflation most especially dr copper many investors see as extremely sensitive to economic conditions the circular or as george soros terms it reflexive nature of financial markets makes them extremely vulnerable to being whipsawed yet because of the current extreme momentum it would take a very heavy weight of evidence to convince this market to reverse direction we continue to highlight that commodity prices are at high risk of a major reversal because of the steep downturn in the chinese credit impulse we have highlighted this before and we are not alone julien bittel of pictet asset management posted the following chart when commodity prices do start to fall expect a major reversal in inflation sentiment furthermore expect momentum to become as self reinforcing and reflexive on the way down just as it was on the way up as we discussed previously this is what the bond market is already pricing in yields need a new narrative while investors expect surging inflation the bond market continues to price in weaker future economic growth as noted in the correlation between rates and the economic composite suggests that current expectations of sustained economic expansion and rising inflation are overly optimistic at current rates economic growth will likely very quickly return to sub 2 growth by 2022 note the economic composite is a compilation of inflation economic growth and wages currently as shown in our opening commentary yields have remained range bound between 1 5 1 6 such suggests that expectations for price pressures have moderated while the markets wonder when the fed will start to talk more about tapering the bond purchases yields are currently suggesting inflation may not be the real risk the most considerable risk is a divergence among fed policymakers which possibly leads to a policy mistake of tapering too quickly or even hiking rates the majority of the inflation and economic growth pressures are artificial stemming from the stimulus injections over the last year however with those inputs fading as year over year comparisons become more challenging the deflationary impact could be more significant than expected there is also one other point about the fed tapering the purchases as shown in the chart below rates rise during phases of qe as money rotates from bonds to stocks for the risk on trade the opposite occurs when they start to taper suggesting a decline in rates if taper talk increases earnings yields are a problem switching from economics to equities the recent spike in inflation has caused a drop in the earnings yield into negative territory let s start with earnings yield has been the cornerstone of the fed model since the early 80s the fed model states that when the earnings yield on stocks earnings divided by price is higher than the treasury yield you should invest in stocks and vice versa the problem here is two fold you receive the income from owning a treasury bond whereas there is no tangible return from an earnings yield for example if we purchase a treasury bond with a 5 yield and stock with an 8 earnings yield if the price of both assets remains stable for one year the net return on the bond is 5 while the return on the stock is 0 unlike stocks bonds have a finite value at maturity the principal gets returned to the holder along with the final interest payment however stocks have price risk no maturity and no repayment of the principal feature the risk of owning a stock is exponentially more significant than holding a risk free bond if we look at periods of exceptionally low earnings yields compared to the market we find a better correlation to corrections and outright bear markets as shown there is a reasonable correlation between low earnings yields and low forward returns historically speaking with an earnings yield of 2 66 forward returns over the next decade should somewhere between 2 and 5 but what about the negative yield negative real yields are a bigger problem an interesting note this past week from sentiment trader discussed the outcomes for markets when inflation adjusted earnings yields are negative until recently one of the main arguments for stocks was that even though they weren t yielding much at least they were earning more than treasuries even after accounting for inflation now that there has been a spike in inflation gauges the earnings yield on the s p 500 has turned negative this is not a condition that investors have had to tackle much over the past 70 years when an investor in the s p adds up her dividend check and share of earnings then subtracts the loss of purchasing power from inflation she s barely coming out even this is a record low dating back to 1970 just eclipsing the prior low from march 2000 if we ignore dividends then there have been five other times when the s p 500 s inflation adjusted earnings yield turned negative you may want to close one eye and use the other to look askance at the table because it s not pretty the issue of negative earnings yield tells you three things the market is hugely overvalued relative to the strength of underlying earnings expectations for future earnings growth are unlikely to match current expectations leading to a future repricing of risk bond yields are confirming that both economic and earnings growth has likely peaked portfolio update this past week we started trimming back on our qqq index trading position to lock in some recent gains given that markets are still bullishly biased we continue to hold our core equity positions for now however we are closely watching our weekly indicators which continue to approach the next sell signal while such doesn t mean the markets will have a deep correction as noted it typically suggests a pick up in volatility and investment risk for us we would prefer to rebalance exposures and wait for the next buying opportunity to come along let me reiterate from above the biggest problem is that technical indicators do not distinguish between a consolidation a correction or an outright bear market as such if you ignore the signals as they occur by the time you realize it s a deep correction it is too late to do much about it therefore we must treat each signal with the same respect and adjust risk accordingly the opportunity costs of doing so are minimal if we reduce risk and the market continues to rise we can quickly increase our exposures yes we sacrifice some short term performance however if we reduce risk and the market declines sharply we not only protect our capital during the decline but have the cash to deploy at lower price levels such is the biggest problem with buy and hold strategies yes you will perform in line with the market but given that you didn t sell high there is no cash available with which to buy low in the future while i agree you can not time the markets to improve your long term outcomes for us that is our primary focus

democrats believes that too many americans are still getting the short end of the stick they never get bailed out brown says in an interview with npr they never get a second chance they re just not in a position in an economy like this where wall street writes the rules where they can get ahead that anger has been magnified at a time when banks have seen their profits soar during the pandemic in part thanks to strong actions by the federal reserve to support markets and top democrats believe they are justified in pushing for change at big banks they want to push the country s largest financial institutions to be agents of social change and they have specific goals like expanding access to loans and impose fewer fees for average americans or more outreach to unbanked and underserved communities they did very well during the pandemic brown notes about the banks we ve seen stratospheric compensation levels we see stock buybacks and dividend distribution yet wages

questioning as part of an annual oversight during that hearing warren asked jamie dimon the chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase about overdraft fees the bank charged its customers during the pandemic which she estimated at nearly 1 5 billion the heated exchange ended when warren asked dimon if he would volunteer to refund that money he declined warren is unapologetic about pushing banks to do more

these stocks are in a great position to grow regardless of what happens with federal cannabis reform there was a sense of euphoria among many cannabis investors after democrats regained effective control of the u s senate as well as the white house the countdown seemed to be on until major cannabis reforms were passed at the federal level however there haven t been any truly meaningful wins at the legislative level so far that doesn t mean that cannabis companies haven t made significant progress over the last few months though some of them are arguably even more attractive than they were after election day here are three top marijuana stocks to buy right now trulieve cannabis it wasn t all that long ago that trulieve cannabis tcnnf 2 97 was essentially a one state cannabis operator granted the company absolutely dominated the medical cannabis market in that one state florida and sure trulieve had taken steps to expand into other markets however there were some valid reasons to be skeptical about the company s ability to replicate its success beyond florida that s no longer the case earlier this month trulieve announced plans to acquire harvest health recreation hrvsf in an all stock transaction valued at 2 1 billion this deal will add operations in five additional states for trulieve including the fast growing markets in arizona and nevada the acquisition is expected to close in the third quarter of 2021 assuming there are no roadblocks trulieve should soon boost its estimated total addressable market by more than 50 the combined company will also be the most profitable u s multistate operator based on adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda in the meantime trulieve continues to deliver sizzling growth all on its own the company s sales more than doubled year over year in the first quarter thanks mainly to expansion in florida trulieve also posted strong earnings growth the addition of harvest will make this winning marijuana stock even more attractive jushi holdings although there hasn t been tangible progress in recent months at the federal level in improving the outlook for the u s cannabis industry it s a different story at the state level for example virginia s legislature voted to legalize adult use recreational marijuana that should present a great opportunity for jushi holdings jushf 3 45 virginia isn t exactly in a hurry the state s adult use market won t open until 2024 however that actually could work to jushi s advantage the company already owns a medical cannabis license in northern virginia home to almost 30 of the state s population look for jushi to build up its brand in the medical cannabis market over the next couple of years that could give it a strong competitive position for the recreational market that s on the way jushi s growth prospects aren t dependent just on virginia though the company has operations in california illinois nevada and pennsylvania with acquisitions pending in massachusetts and ohio scotts miracle gro investors who might be a little skittish about buying shares of a pure play pot stock have several appealing alternatives i think that scotts miracle gro smg 4 98 ranks as one of the best you re probably at least somewhat familiar with scotts line of consumer lawn and garden products that business remains the company s biggest source of revenue generating roughly three quarters of total sales in the latest quarter however scotts main growth driver now is its hawthorne segment hawthorne is a leading supplier of hydroponics and gardening products to the cannabis industry its revenue soared 66 year over year in scotts fiscal second quarter ceo jim hagedorn said in the company s q2 conference call whether we see federal reform with this administration or not clearly the momentum at the state level is not slowing down we ll see more markets open and create more opportunities for growth i think he s right
these two pot companies with smart growth strategies are heading for a fruitful future while the world still fights the coronavirus the pandemic induced marijuana boom is taking the industry to great heights cannabis was deemed an essential item in the u s during the lockdown which spiked sales the momentum continues even this year which is helping u s cannabis companies generate more revenue and profits among them massachusetts based curaleaf holdings curlf 2 79 and florida based trulieve cannabis tcnnf 2 97 have the potential to be top contenders in the cannabis space these two are smart with their growth strategies and have established themselves well in the u s cannabis market their recent first quarter 2021 results are proof of that trulieve also grabbed a lot of attention in may after it announced its acquisition of arizona based cannabis company harvest health recreation hrvsf for a deal valued at 2 1 billion let s take a look at how 2021 is looking for these two pot companies and why i believe they have the potential to be millionaire makers curaleaf s smart growth strategies are paving its road to success smart and timely acquisitions have been a driving factor in curaleaf s outstanding revenue growth in its first quarter of 2021 ended march 31 revenue came in at 260 million up 170 year over year the company saw a surge in both retail and wholesale revenue but a 231 boost in retail revenue to 188 million was particularly impressive and can be attributed to organic growth across all its existing stores and contributions from six new stores across florida maine and pennsylvania the company had a total of 102 stores at the end of the first quarter and even recorded some retail revenue in arizona where recreational marijuana became legal in january the company s select brand a line of cannabis oil that it acquired from cura partners in february for 948 8 million was mostly responsible for a 254 jump in wholesale revenue to 72 million from the year ago period higher revenue brought in another quarter of positive earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization ebitda of 63 million a 213 year over year increase curaleaf is not profitable yet but many of the acquisitions it completed in 2020 including cannabis manufacturers and dispensaries across the nation such as curaleaf nj arrow meot remedy blue kudu and alternative therapies group are yet to show their full potential these will help bolster revenue growth and bring in profits trulieve cannabis is on its way to becoming a powerhouse trulieve cannabis grabbed a lot of attention with its decision to acquire harvest health which will give the company a stronghold over a thriving marijuana market in the northeast southeast and southwest regions this deal subject to shareholder approval in the third quarter will add key markets like arizona pennsylvania and maryland to trulieve s national footprint the company expects to generate close to 1 2 billion in revenue and 461 million in adjusted ebitda in 2021 with the help of this acquisition which is giving it access to 126 dispensaries in 11 states trulieve has already shown a rocking start to 2021 recording revenue growth of 102 year over year to 194 million in its q1 ended march 31 its grip on the medical cannabis segment in its home state of florida where it has a total of 78 dispensaries drove the growth florida currently only allows medical cannabis for q1 adjusted ebitda also came in at 91 million up 87 from the year ago period despite an increase in operating expenses to 57 million from 29 million in q1 2020 management s continued expansion plans led to a rise in operating expenses but its positive ebitda demonstrates it s been able to grow revenue while managing its costs meanwhile net profits the company s earnings after all the deductions came in at 30 million a 27 increase from the year ago period for the full year of 2021 trulieve expects to see revenue in the range of 815 million to 850 million and adjusted ebitda in the range of 355 million to 375 million keep in mind that these figures exclude the impact of the harvest acquisition make way for the two millionaire makers a company s ability to thrive in an evolving industry can be determined by the way it uses its capital resources in employing smart growth strategies while keeping the balance sheet stable both curaleaf and trulieve have managed this curaleaf ended its q1 with cash of 315 million though it also has 340 million of outstanding debt net of unamortized debt discounts these debt bond discounts are the difference between the face value of a bond and the amount paid for it by investors meanwhile trulieve ended its q1 with cash and cash equivalents of 162 million and total outstanding debt of 86 million curaleaf has a lot of debt on its hands but we can already see the growth it is deriving from its strategic acquisitions in 2020 which should help drive revenue and profits this year and beyond trulieve s acquisition of harvest which i believe to be a very smart move will also help it capture a wide chunk of the u s cannabis market bringing in more earnings these factors will allow both companies to clear off their outstanding debts state legalization is ramping up with the probability of federal legalization also rising stellar revenue growth profits smart growth strategies stable balance sheets and an expanding national footprint make a strong case for these two cannabis stocks to become millionaire makers over the long term

holiday falls on a saturday the market will close on the preceding friday if the holiday falls on a sunday the market will close on the subsequent monday stock and bond market hours for those wanting answers to other questions like what time does the market open regular stock market trading hours for the new york stock exchange nyse and nasdaq stock market are 9 30 am to 4 pm on weekdays bond markets usually trade between 8 am and 5 pm the stock markets close at 1 pm on early closure days bond markets close early at 2 pm all times eastern unless otherwise indicated many folks might wonder why the stock market offers such limited hours when there are certainly people who want to buy and sell at all times of the day one of the main reasons for this is liquidity which is how much buying and selling is going on at a given time the more liquidity in a particular security the likelier you are to get a fair price on it the less liquidity the more likely you might have to settle for a less than ideal price to finish off a transaction for the market to function effectively you need buyers and sellers says charles sizemore principal of sizemore capital management this is why the stock market has set hours that happen to correspond to the east coast workday you want the maximum number of traders buying and selling at the same time if you were at an estate auction selling your grandmother s antiques you d want a lot of bidders there it s the same rationale in the stock market and there is trading that is done outside of these regular hours on days with a regular session for instance there is pre market trading this occurs before the market and while hours vary they can extend as early as 4 am and run until the opening bell rings at 9 30 am there is also after hours trading which happens after the market closes and typically runs from 4 pm to 8 pm but just because you can trade outside of regular stock market trading hours doesn t necessarily mean you should investors should be aware that volume and liquidity tend to be lower in pre market and after hours trading temporary market stoppages the stock market rarely closes unexpectedly but so called circuit breakers do occasionally trigger temporary trading halts circuit breakers were first introduced after the black monday crash of october 1987 the dow dropped almost 23 in a single session which stands as a record to this day circuit breakers are intended to curb panic selling like calling a timeout in sports a temporary pause in trading allows market participants to catch their breath though it doesn t necessarily keep stocks from declining once trading resumes there are three levels of circuit breakers tied to how steeply the market declines a level 1 market wide circuit breaker is tripped if the s p 500 falls 7 from its previous close market wide circuit breaker is tripped if the s p 500 falls 7 from its previous close a level 2 circuit breaker comes into effect when the market plunges 13 circuit breaker comes into effect when the market plunges 13 a level 3 circuit breaker kicks in if the market tanks 20 a level 1 or level 2 breach halts trading for a minimum of 15 minutes a level 3 rout halts trading for the remainder of the trading day level 1 and level 2 circuit breakers can be triggered between 9 30 am and 3 25 pm a level 3 breach can be triggered at any time extraordinary stock market closures the market has also shut down a smattering of times throughout history following catastrophic events the attacks on the world trade center and pentagon prevented the market from opening on september 11 2001 and the exchanges remained shut until september 17 prior to that you have to go back to world war i for an example of the stock market shutting down the outbreak of hostilities in europe led the new york stock exchange to close up shop from july 31 to november 28 1914 the market went dark only two other times in its history the nyse closed for 10 days during the panic of 1873 and it took a week off trading to mourn the assassination of president abraham lincoln in 1865 additionally markets will typically close when a former president dies they most recently closed in december 2018 for the funeral of former president george h w bush data provided by the nyse and sifma
sen sherrod brown d ohio hasn t forgotten the great recession in the first half of 2007 brown recalls there were more foreclosures in his hometown than anywhere else in the country it was a period that led to the global financial crisis millions of americans lost their homes while banks and other corporate sectors were rescued by billions of dollars in bailouts more than a decade later democrats control the white house the u s senate and the u s house of representatives and brown and fellow populists like sen elizabeth warren d mass and rep maxine waters d calif are in powerful perches to oversee the big banks and brown like many of these top democrats believes that too many americans are still getting the short end of the stick they never get bailed out brown says in an interview with npr they never get a second chance they re just not in a position in an economy like this where wall street writes the rules where they can get ahead that anger has been magnified at a time when banks have seen their profits soar during the pandemic in part thanks to strong actions by the federal reserve to support markets and top democrats believe they are justified in pushing for change at big banks they want to push the country s largest financial institutions to be agents of social change and they have specific goals like expanding access to loans and impose fewer fees for average americans or more outreach to unbanked and underserved communities they did very well during the pandemic brown notes about the banks we ve seen stratospheric compensation levels we see stock buybacks and dividend distribution yet wages throughout our economy are essentially flat tom williams cq roll call inc via getty images cq roll call inc via getty images sen sherrod brown talks with reporters on capitol hill on feb 4 as chairman of the senate banking committee brown has pledged to increase scrutiny of major banks brown is the chairman of the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs which also includes warren another democrat with a reputation for being tough on wall street the massachusetts senator played a key role in the creation of the consumer financial protection bureau cfpb in the aftermath of the global financial crisis you know most people think of congress in terms of passing legislation and yeah that s part of the job she tells npr but the other part of the job is oversight that was in evidence when brown s committee this past week brought in the chief executives of the country s top six banks for questioning as part of an annual oversight during that hearing warren asked jamie dimon the chairman and ceo of jpmorgan chase about overdraft fees the bank charged its customers during the pandemic which she estimated at nearly 1 5 billion the heated exchange ended when warren asked dimon if he would volunteer to refund that money he declined warren is unapologetic about pushing banks to do more given their roles as critical institutions in society bank executives warren says have a responsibility to execute on making their banks part of the solution to our economic and racial problems across this nation tom williams cq

npr that a key part of her job as a lawmaker will be oversight but republican lawmakers disagree with that very premise they criticize executives for comments they have made about voting rights in

the s p 500 can take you further than you may think in some ways investing is like participating in a race you don t necessarily need to be the fastest right out of the gate to win rather you just need to keep a steady pace over the long haul to come out ahead the s p 500 is one of the best long term investments out there and famed investor warren buffet has long touted the s p 500 as an ideal option in fact during the 2020 berkshire hathaway shareholder s meeting buffett claimed that for most people the best thing to do is to own the s p 500 index fund here s why the s p 500 is so powerful and how it could help you make a lot of money in the stock market a more resilient investment the s p 500 is comprised of 500 of the largest and most stable companies in the united states when you invest in an s p 500 index fund you re investing in all the stocks that make up the s p 500 in order to mirror the index s performance because the s p 500 contains some of the strongest companies in the country it s more likely to see positive long term growth in addition it s more resilient in the face of market crashes this isn t to say that the s p 500 is immune to market downturns however it s more likely to recover from crashes than some other types of investments since the s p 500 s inception in 1957 it has faced countless corrections downturns and crashes given enough time however it s been able to recover from every single one and since its inception it has earned an average rate of return of around 10 per year spx data by ycharts this doesn t necessarily mean the s p 500 will continue earning 10 returns year after year there will be years when you experience losses while other years you ll earn much higher than average returns over time those good years and bad years should average out to around 10 per year the market will inevitably crash sooner or later but by investing in s p 500 index funds there s a very good chance your investments will recover how much can you earn with the s p 500 although s p 500 index funds are relatively safe investments you can still potentially make a lot of money the key to getting rich with the s p 500 is to give your money as much time as possible to grow ideally you ll have started saving early in life and can continue investing consistently for several decades but if you re off to a late start it s still important to start investing now instead of putting it off let s say you re investing 300 per month in s p 500 index funds and you re earning a 10 average annual rate of return here s approximately how much you d accumulate over time depending on how many years you have left to save number of years to save total savings 5 22 000 10 57 000 20 206 000 30 592 000 40 1 593 000 given enough time it s possible to become a millionaire by investing in s p 500 index funds but even if you don t have 40 years left to save you can still make a substantial amount of money also one of the best features of this type of investment is that it s hands off in other words your s p 500 index funds will perform best when you don t touch them for as long as possible so all you need to do is invest consistently and then sit back and let your investments do the rest of the work for you warren buffett is a proponent of s p 500 index funds and it s easy to see why there are several advantages to choosing this type of investment and by investing consistently you can potentially earn more than you think

lauren rudd memorial day is upon us once again and for many it will simply be a day off from work and a time to drag out the barbecue grill yet as i point out each year and will once again this year the day should be a somber reminder of those who sacrificed their lives to ensure our freedom unfortunately as we age the devastating impact of armed conflict has a way of fading from memory few are left who can recount the untold horrors of the holocaust a younger but graying generation pushes remembrances of the sickening sweet smell of napalm and burning flesh ever deeper into the dark recesses of their minds since the afghanistan war began in the wake of the sept 11 2001 attacks more than three quarters of a million americans have deployed to afghanistan and more than 2 300 u s troops have died the jarring impact of young soldiers with missing limbs or suffering from ptsd should act as an interminable reminder of the never ending violence that takes place across the globe in the name of peace oh and yes religion likewise the horrors played out in schools and synagogues across the country make it abundantly clear that violence knows no limits you are probably wondering how those comments relate to investing on wall street they do not except to point out that memorial day is an excellent time to reflect on the phrase once again ask not what your country can do for you but what you can do for your country that would be excellent advice for wall street unfortunately the street s supercilious attitude is only upended only by its unvarnished self indulgence moreover the financial largess that now floats freely within the temples of wall street is unlikely to ever make its way to main street which brings us to the more germane topic of today s investment climate and more specifically what are the possible choices about moving some part of your holdings away from equities too often the subject is exploited with such erroneous terms as the market is going up sell or the market is going down sell or even worse sell in may and go away deciding when and what to sell is an investor s most vexing decision given that it is memorial day weekend may i again suggest you contemplate the words penned over a century ago by catherine lee bates in america the beautiful she wrote confirm thy soul in self control one proven analytical approach is to ask yourself this question would you buy a stock you currently hold given today s market and price structure in answering that question consider whether the company has been increasing dividends for at least 10 years and has an intrinsic value using a discounted cash flow methodology that hopefully is still above the market price however you should probably make some allowance for the problems created by covid 19 if you believe you would then i would have to ask why you would consider selling it and what about the bond market unusually low interest rates have resulted in higher bond prices consider that as bond interest rates increase and over time they are likely to do so bond prices are inversely proportional to the interest paid meaning bond prices will fall as i have pointed out on numerous occasions bond owners or bond fund owners do not participate in corporate growth and are subject to the pain of inflation with no offset if mutual funds are a potential choice always consider the issue of fees and expenses according to the investment company institute the mutual fund trade group whose data can be found in any number of financial publications mutual fund fees average 1 44 on equity funds 1 02 on bond funds and 0 24 on money market funds if your funds are professionally managed you need to add in those fees note that i am exempting 401 k programs which can only use mutual funds the late john bogle who founded vanguard was given to point out that a mutual fund s expense ratio understates the total costs investors pay you need to add in transaction fees sales charges and the drag of a fund manager who holds cash in summary you will likely find that a low turnover equity portfolio is the most successful at standing up to the test of time you can write to lauren rudd at lauren rudd raymondjames com or call him at 941 706 3449 for back columns go to ruddinternational com

on main street in man west virginia a woman marched through the front door of uncle sam s loans a cavernous pawn shop packed with hunting bows fishing lures and camping supplies for the residents of this small appalachian town behind the counter hung the linchpin of uncle sam s business guns the woman flashed her credentials which revealed that she was an investigator with the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives the nation s gun industry watchdog she was here to make sure uncle sam s had cleaned up its act this was the atf s third inspection of uncle sam s in seven years the two most recent audits found that the store had transferred weapons without conducting background checks and failed to provide safety notices to handgun buyers at one point atf records show more than 600 firearms that should have been in stock could not be found a red flag for gun trafficking in both cases the violations were serious enough to warrant stripping uncle sam s of its license to sell guns according to atf records but agency officials decided to spare the shop issue an official warning to its owners and give them another chance to prove they could follow the rules as the investigator leafed through handwritten ledgers in the spring of 2014 she discovered that things had hardly improved sales records were incomplete the store failed to report required information to law enforcement and safety notices still weren t going out the inspector typed out her findings and sent them to her superiors their decision issue yet another warning months later the atf learned that uncle sam s was the backbone of a sprawling gun trafficking scheme witnesses told the agency that steven adkins a longtime shop employee who d purchased a stake in the business had enlisted a host of people including a colleague s girlfriend and his brother in law to falsify paperwork so it would appear they had purchased guns in legitimate transactions according to court records in reality the guns were used to bribe coal officials in a pay to play scheme at a local mine others were sold on the black market witnesses said one accomplice told investigators hundreds if not thousands of firearms had been trafficked through uncle sam s according to court records he recalled parking his truck around the back of the store loading up guns and delivering them to a convicted felon another accomplice said he drove guns from uncle sam s to adkins s home where adkins allegedly sold them out of his basement adkins pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting a false statement relating to purchases of more than 50 firearms from late 2008 to august 2014 he was sentenced to 10 months in prison no one else was convicted in the trafficking scheme everybody knew where to get a firearm adkins said roger d b muncy whose father founded uncle sam s in 1975 we re all human but you don t send guns out the back door the atf is facing intense scrutiny as the senate considers president joe biden s pick for the agency s first permanent director in six years the confirmation of david chipman a former atf agent who has advocated stricter gun laws is unfolding against a backdrop of public anguish over mass shootings and a renewed determination from the white house to clamp down on easy access to firearms in one of the most sweeping examinations of atf inspection records the trace and usa today found that the federal agency in charge of policing the gun industry has been largely toothless and conciliatory bending over backward to go easy on wayward dealers such as uncle sam s and sometimes allowing guns to flow into the hands of criminals gun industry lobbyists have fought for decades against tougher oversight by casting gun dealers as among the most heavily regulated businesses in the usa the trace and usa today s review found that dealers are largely immune from serious punishment and enjoy layers of protection unavailable to most other industries gun sellers fear crack down from biden s nominee for atf read more reporters spent more than a year analyzing documents from nearly 2 000 gun dealer inspections that uncovered violations from 2015 to 2017 the reports showed some dealers outright flouting the rules selling weapons to convicted felons and domestic abusers lying to investigators and fudging records to mask their unlawful conduct in many cases when the atf caught dealers breaking the law the agency issued warnings sometimes repeatedly and allowed the stores to operate for months or years others are still selling guns to this day more than half of all stores with violations transferred guns without running a background check correctly waiting for the check to finish or properly recording the results more than 200 dealers were cited for selling guns to people who indicated on background check paperwork that they were prohibited from owning them dozens made false statements in official records a violation that includes facilitating illegal straw purchases a florida gun dealer got in trouble for giving a taurus handgun to a convicted felon in the parking lot and an arkansas pawnshop was cited for selling a firearm to a customer even though he d failed the background check because of an active restraining order in ohio one store transferred guns without conducting background checks 112 times another was missing some 600 firearms a pennsylvania gun retailer racked up 45 violations and received eight warnings from the atf but the store was allowed to remain in business and it went on to sell a shotgun to a man who used it to kill four family members including his 7 year old half brother the reports were obtained through a freedom of information act lawsuit by the gun control group brady and shared with the trace and usa today reporters who conducted an independent analysis the reports detail inspections of brick and mortar gun stores and pawnbrokers including home based sellers independent mom and pops and big box retailers such as walmart and dick s sporting goods others cover gun manufacturers and importers investigate read this story at the trace the data is extensive but may not be comprehensive the agency provided brady roughly 2 000 reports from inspections that resulted in warning letters warning conferences and license revocations over the two year span from july 2015 through june 2017 however annual fact sheets published by the atf include aggregate figures showing the agency issued nearly twice as many penalties during fiscal years 2016 and 2017 a period that overlaps with the brady documents the atf repeatedly declined to explain that gap but said it is investigating a single violation is enough to shutter a gun shop if atf officials can prove that the store willfully broke federal regulations in the vast majority of the cases analyzed by the trace and usa today the atf gave violators the lightest penalty available a boilerplate warning letter reminding them that their compliance is crucial to reduce violent crime and protect the public the agency revoked a gun dealer s license in less than 3 of cases gun shop owners who violate the rules seem to understand they have little to fear one owner told an atf investigator that he was busy and didn t give a s the agency records show another said he did not like being told what to do the owner of a pawn shop in northeastern kansas became very belligerent and hostile when questioned about falsifying records shaking his finger in the investigator s face as he told her to do her job and stop messing with him the atf allowed all of those dealers to keep selling firearms the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives headquartered in washington d c is the main line of defense against firearms ending up in the black market rich clement bloomberg via getty images joseph bisbee a retired atf agent in seattle said the lack of action has fostered a culture of impunity there s really no teeth to the laws and gun dealers know that he said they can see that nobody gets prosecuted that nobody gets held accountable and that sends the signal that they can fudge things a little more and get away with it the problems extend high into the management ranks of atf the trace and usa today s review found that the managers of on the ground investigators routinely overrule recommendations to revoke licenses and order lesser punishments reporters identified 138 reports in which atf officials acknowledged that a dealer s violations were severe enough for them to lose their licenses the agency revoked 56 of those licenses just over 40 a majority were granted lesser penalties ranging from temporary license suspensions to warning letters in the reports atf officials justified backing off by citing the dealer s age recent health problems intentions to retire and in one case affluent clientele one dealer got a pass because he had been in business less than a year another because he had been in business for decades sometimes the agency was afraid that a dealer might sue in 2017 an inspector advocated pulling the license for back acre gun works after reporting the gun shop west of orlando florida had falsified records related to the transfer of an ar 15 style rifle a supervisor downgraded the penalty to a written warning noting substantial legal liabilities because the inspection had been conducted prematurely current and former atf officials say the light regulatory touch is at least partly a reflection of congressional restrictions on the agency s enforcement powers some also say the atf has increasingly adopted an industry friendly approach to lessen the risk of a backlash that could lead to budget cuts or additional limits on its authority tweet facebook

shrug off serious violations and say they re not a big deal because they don t want to upset the industry too much quote icon they hardly do any inspections and when they do carry out an inspection they shrug off serious violations and say they re not a big deal because they don t want to upset the industry too much said mark jones who held various supervisory positions at the atf before retiring in 2012 the proliferation of gun retailers means there are bad apples in communities across america ripe for targeting by criminals kris brown brady s president said the atf bends over backward to accommodate even the most egregious activity and americans every day pay the price brown said particularly black and brown communities across this country that are being flooded with guns from these dealers goal is to gain compliance not punish the coronavirus pandemic protests against police brutality and the election of biden spurred americans to snap up an estimated 22 million guns in 2020 shattering records and reviving concerns about whether the atf can adequately police such a booming industry the most important part of the job is keeping the guns out of criminal hands said john crecca a former atf inspector who worked in new york and pennsylvania before retiring in 2011 crecca recalled the case of bull s eye shooter supply a gun store in tacoma washington that was sued by the families of victims of the 2002 beltway sniper attacks in which two gunmen armed with a bushmaster rifle had shot and killed 10 people one of the beltway gunmen told authorities he had stolen the rifle from bull s eye the shop hadn t noticed the gun was missing until federal agents came calling a subsequent atf inspection found the store could not account for the sale of more than 230 other guns bull s eye settled the lawsuit for 2 million but did not admit liability for the shootings in the rare cases in which the agency decides to pull a license the process is slow often taking months or more than a year to complete while dealers continue to sell guns sometimes the atf holds off on finalizing a revocation specifically to give the dealer time to sell off its remaining inventory reports show the atf is the main line of defense against firearms leaking out of legal streams of commerce and into the black market the agency s weaknesses have prompted illinois new jersey and a handful of other states to create their own gun store inspection programs in illinois the atf held warning conferences with 1st class firearms in 2009 and 2013 after investigators discovered that the gun shop north of waukegan had failed to conduct background checks kept sloppy or incomplete records and illegally transferred weapons to out of state residents records show allowed to remain in business 1st class firearms went on to sell at least a dozen weapons to a trafficking ring suspected of smuggling hundreds of kilograms of cocaine into the u s from mexico according to court records inspectors returned in 2015 and cited 1st class firearms for 12 more violations this time agency officials determined that the store s license should be revoked according to records one supervisor railed against the owner craig bricco for displaying an intentional disregard and plain indifference to regulatory requirements bricco said in an interview that the problems at his shop were the fault of his employees who ran the store while he was working another job during the day have tips about inspections at gun stores contact us at gunstoreinspections thetrace org email us i got bamboozled bricco said there wasn t much i could do instead of revoking his license bricco said the atf allowed him to stay open for about six more months so he could sell off his stock of firearms bricco voluntarily surrendered his gun dealer s license after that period but the agency let him remain in business as an ammunition manufacturer he rebranded as 1st class ammo and transferred the shop s leftover gun inventory to himself a legal maneuver that enabled him to keep selling the firearms in private sales in much of the country private sales require no background checks in january 2016 1st class ammo shared a facebook post directing people to gunbroker com where bricco was selling four sig sauer pistols so it s a private sale one facebook user asked yes all private sales 1st class ammo responded you can see them on display in the ammo store some current and former atf officials defended the inspection program as an effective way of ensuring gun dealers

said the agency focuses its limited resources on the 1 doing it wrong in an emailed response to questions atf spokesman andre miller portrayed the penalties as tools to guide dealers into correcting violations and ensure future compliance he said the agency can revoke licenses only for willful violations and supervisors consider the totality of the inspection and its unique circumstances to ensure consistent enforcement nationwide the nature of the violations and their impact on public safety as well as atf s ability to reduce violent crime are significant considerations for the appropriate action miller said dealers inspected once every seven years a division of the justice department the atf is responsible for policing the 78 000 gun dealers manufacturers and importers in the u s it employs more than 700 investigators who perform unannounced compliance reviews digging through business records to make sure gun sellers are not providing weapons to people who shouldn t have them the goal is to inspect each license holder at least once every three years but federal data shows the agency has averaged 15 of dealers annually between fiscal years 2010 and 2019 this means dealers were visited about once every seven years of all the inspections during that decade at least a third 35 500 found dealers had broken state or federal firearms laws the agency data shows more than 81 of violators received no penalty or a written warning the atf sought revocation of only 580 violators or 1 6 in the 2020 fiscal year as the coronavirus pandemic snarled government operations

licenses revoked tweet facebook reddit share this article on reddit email email this story share share this story the most common violations cited by the atf were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers personal details omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records the most common violations cited by the atf were for gun sellers failing to acquire customers personal details omitting information required on federal forms and not keeping proper inventory and sales records according to the reports analyzed by the trace and usa today former atf officials and gun dealers said such violations are usually innocent mistakes stemming from the labyrinthine rules governing gun sales but even seemingly minor paperwork errors can indicate a dealer s involvement in more serious forms of lawbreaking or can stymie law enforcement investigations into major crimes whenever you hear people say there s plenty of laws on the books there really aren t what there are are a lot of paperwork violations where you misrepresented something on a piece of paper said scot thomasson the atf s former chief of public affairs but what each one of these paper violations represents is a crime a crime gun and the diversion of firearms to the illegal market gun dealers almost never face criminal charges when violations are discovered in an inspection former atf officials attributed the agency s permissive regulatory approach to longstanding staffing and funding shortages as well as federal laws that shield the gun industry from accountability over the past 35 years gun groups have successfully pressured congress to limit the frequency of inspections restrict atf from consolidating and computerizing records and make it more difficult for the agency to take dealers licenses away in 1986 the national rifle association successfully lobbied for the passage of the firearm owners protection act which prevents the atf from inspecting existing gun dealers more than once a year after 9 11 congress required that the atf audit each of the nation s 9 400 explosives dealers once every three years effectively forcing it to deprioritize gun dealer inspections the number of gun dealer inspections plunged falling from an average of nearly 12 000 inspections a year in the 1990s to less than 7 000 a year in the 2000s atf is a very small agency a very unpopular agency and as a result there are a lot of people trying to push them around said howard wolfe a former atf supervisor who oversaw inspections in pittsburgh pennsylvania until he retired in 2006 wolfe said the investigators under his command would need to have visited multiple gun shops every day to meet the atf s inspection goals there was no way wolfe said people went years without being inspected and that s a big problem because how do you know how somebody s doing if you don t have a chance to go out and take a look at their records atf investigators spent an average of 84 hours on each of the inspections examined by the trace and usa today one particularly taxing case in houston took 995 hours the equivalent of half a year of workdays the investigator recommended revoking the license but was rebuffed by the industry operations director who cited the length of time taken to complete the assignment in another case in kansas a pawn shop transferred an ak 47 type rifle and a glock to a woman acquiring the weapons on behalf of her boyfriend a convicted felon court records indicate in february 2016 he used those guns to shoot 17 people in a rampage across the towns of newton and hesston an atf inspector visited a pawn shop several months later and found the store had failed to obtain proper ids sold a handgun to a self identified domestic abuser and hadn t been ascertaining whether its customers were straw purchasers according to an agency report the atf downgraded the penalty to a written warning because the store had never received an inspection in its six years of business had the atf gone in there and done an inspection earlier it might have caused this shop to clean up its act it might have prevented a mass shooting said david morantz an attorney who represented one of the hesston shooting victims surviving family members in a wrongful death lawsuit against the shop the lawsuit resulted in a 2 million settlement the shop is now closed teresa ficaretta a former senior atf attorney who went into private practice helping gun industry clients comply with the law said limited resources had led the bureau to focus on inspecting dealers who sell large numbers of crime guns frequently transfer large quantities of firearms to a single customer or raise other red flags ficaretta said that was a poor substitute for regular inspections and could embolden dealers willing to break the law tweet facebook reddit share this article on reddit email email this story share share this story teresa ficaretta a former senior atf attorney if

roll the dice and see what happens the size of the atf s inspections staff has been stagnant for decades in early 2016 after a mass shooting at a holiday banquet that killed 14 people in san bernardino california the obama administration rolled out a gun violence prevention plan that included a request for nearly 12 3 million to add 120 atf investigators the republican controlled congress balked with one gop member of the house appropriations committee saying lawmakers would not support the development of unlawful limitations on the unambiguous second amendment rights of americans b todd jones a former u s attorney who served as the atf s last senate confirmed leader before resigning in 2015 said that despite the 20 plus years of regulatory handcuffs investigators work hard to balance compliance and the adversarial relationship needed to provide oversight we did our best to plug holes and stop the worst offenders said jones who is now chief disciplinary officer for the nfl it s like setting up a speed trap you re not going to stop everyone and if you get caught speeding you have to deal with it but what s the alternative no regulation at all during delays guns end up in wrong hands the atf investigators who inspect gun stores do not carry badges or guns and cannot make arrests they can recommend hitting problem gun stores with penalties known as adverse actions but the ultimate outcome of an inspection depends heavily on directors of industry operations who make the final call the trace and usa today found wide variation in the penalties handed down by field divisions for example at the louisville field division which covers kentucky west virginia and southern indiana reporters identified 12 cases in which investigators found that a dealer s violations warranted revocation nine of those recommendations were approved by the division s industry operations director in contrast the industry operations director for the seattle field division which covers washington oregon idaho alaska hawaii and guam approved only one revocation out of the seven recommended by investigators jim zammillo a former atf deputy assistant director who oversaw the inspection program from 2004 to 2010 said the justice department s inspector general and other agency watchdogs had repeatedly faulted the bureau for applying adverse actions inconsistently prompting it to initiate a series of improvements beginning in the early 2000s chief among the reforms was a new set of guidelines establishing the minimum penalties to be issued when violations were found the guidelines specified that penalties should increase for repeat offenses and any field division wishing to spare a dealer from revocation had to get approval from headquarters know someone interested in nationwide gun store inspections by the atf share this story the increased oversight led to greater standardization zammillo said but it also caused consternation among field division heads they viewed it like i m the sheriff this is my department and i m going to run it the way that i want to zammillo said john jarowski a former industry operations director in st paul minnesota offered another explanation saying downgrades to less serious punishments help temper strict investigators inspectors go in and they want the kill they want the scalp on their belt jarowski said proprietors who receive a final revocation notice have 60 days to file an appeal in federal court a costly process that often just delays the process for months or years u s attorneys represent the government in those cases on behalf of the atf many times when the u s attorney steps in he d say this dog won t hunt and they d drop it jarowski said so you have to think about spending your resources wisely in many areas of civil and criminal law defendants cannot use ignorance as an excuse for unlawful behavior when it comes to gun sellers congress has stipulated that they can lose their licenses only for violations committed willfully forcing the atf to prove that dealers knew the rules and intentionally disregarded them jack dick s pawn shop in junction city kansas received warning letters in 2013 and 2014 and attended a warning conference in 2016 when the atf returned in 2017 it uncovered four additional violations including making false statements in required records a report shows a notice to customers entering jack and dick s pawn shop in junction city kansas lets the public know they can carry firearms inside evert nelson usa today network the false statements charge stemmed from the case of a fort riley army soldier who d accidentally shot himself in the hand using a pistol from the shop according to a police report the soldier 20 was underage for handgun purchases in kansas he had had a friend fill out the paperwork atf records indicate the investigator pushed to revoke jack dick s license based on evidence that the shop had ignored obvious signs of a straw purchase including when the friend paid using the soldier s credit card the investigator was overruled by higher ups who said it wasn t clear whether the employee knew he had accepted the wrong credit card the atf decided to give jack dick s another written warning the owner of the shop declined to comment for this article in 2017 and 2020 the shop released surveillance photos and video on its facebook page of other attempted straw purchases in an effort to expose the crime when the atf does decide to revoke a dealer s license the agency s delay in putting the penalty into effect can allow guns to wind up in the wrong hands jc s guns tackle shop in huntsville alabama received its first compliance inspection in 2013 resulting in a warning conference investigators returned two years later for a second inspection that uncovered 13 violations six of them repeated according to an atf report the shop had failed to report multiple sales falsified forms and sold guns to people who d self identified as being prohibited it failed to conduct background checks on customers but did use the background check system to screen employees which is illegal the report indicates investigators also discovered that employees had facilitated multiple straw purchases selling weapons to stand ins when background checks on the actual buyers were delayed it took the atf 16 months to revoke jc s license during that time according to court records the shop sold 11 handguns to a straw purchaser buying them on behalf of her boyfriend a convicted felon officials cite dealer ignorance to justify leniency investigators do not carry badges or guns and have no arrest authority they carry an atf photo credential instead gun store owners offered the atf a litany of excuses to explain away violations the agency spared a nebraska pawn shop from revocation after the owner said he was very busy and overwhelmed a pennsylvania sporting goods store was allowed to keep selling firearms despite being cited three times in four years for failing to report multiple handgun sales during the last inspection in 2016 the owner told an atf investigator he meant to file the reports but did not get around to it felex yukhtman said he trusted the wrong people to manage his small gun manufacturing business in bradenton florida yukhtman s company gun point specializes in building custom ars in 2017 an atf supervisor upheld an inspector s recommendation to shut yukhtman down after a review of his books turned up 15 violations they included the possession of illegal machine guns later seized by agents yukhtman was also missing 250 firearms he said in an interview the supervisor criticized yukhtman for having shown a pattern of repeated violations despite the atf educating the licensee through every inspection and through every warning conference since 2008 the industry operations director overturned the recommendation and summoned yukhtman in for another warning conference yukhtman says he believes he was spared because he reached out to the atf for advice and put in place safeguards to prevent further mistakes they re not there to take your license or make your life miserable yukhtman said the less work they have to do at your store the less time they have to be there the better it is for them our subscribers make this reporting possible please consider supporting investigative journalism 1 for 6 months subscribe get news and alerts on the go download our app download android and ios to obtain a federal firearms sales license applicants have to mail in their fingerprints and a photograph along with a four page form containing basic business and biographical information the form also requires applicants to check a box to indicate whether they have a felony conviction were ever committed to a mental institution or are otherwise precluded from possessing firearms the price of a firearms license ranges from 30 for vintage gun collectors and ammunition manufacturers to as much as 3 000 to sell strictly regulated weapons such as mortars and grenades the license held by many retail gun dealers costs 200 for the first three years and 90 for every renewal applicants do not have to undergo training or pass a test the atf instead has dealers sign a document attesting to their knowledge of gun laws and regulations before opening for business still atf officials have routinely pointed to dealer ignorance to justify leniency a dealer in pounding mill virginia avoided a warning conference after expressing his apparent shock according to a report at learning of the requirement to report customers who made back to back handgun purchases the national shooting sports foundation the gun industry s trade group works with the atf to educate license holders about how to stay within the bounds of the law and prevent illegal trafficking by and large firearm retailers are law abiding and follow local state and federal authorities said mark oliva a national shooting sports foundation spokesman we re members of our community mom and pop shops committed to keeping our communities safe the foundation recruits consultants and former atf inspectors to put shops through mock inspections for 750 the organization will run a full day compliance check that produces a confidential report of shortcomings it also hosts a hotline for retail federal firearm license holders which oliva said receives hundreds of calls a year but rich marianos a former atf assistant director said the foundation is committed to keeping regulation as weak as possible in 2020 it spent 4 5 million on lobbying more than twice as much as the national rifle association which spent 2 2 million according to opensecrets org a nonpartisan research group that tracks money in politics they re like the nra marianos said never once have they said the atf needs more money help support or resources oliva disputes that characterization he provided confidential records of the group s lobbying of congress in recent years to add millions for atf s licensing system and millions more to improve criminal background checks at the department of justice postscript the legacy of uncle sam s the call that started the unraveling of the gun trafficking operation at uncle sam s in west virginia came in april 2015 the girlfriend of a former employee contacted an atf agent to say she had learned that her name had been wrongfully listed in the store s records as the purchaser of shotguns rifles and a pistol according to court records she later told an atf agent that steven adkins had paid her 75 each time she filled out a background check form for a firearm destined for another person it was a scheme adkins had been running for at least six years and he d kept it hidden from the atf even though investigators had inspected the shop over that timeframe after being indicted in late 2015 adkins told the atf that he had hatched the gun trafficking arrangement at the behest of the store s founder roger d muncy according to court records adkins claimed muncy became furious at employees for blocking gun sales and if customers indicated on the federal form that they were prohibited from purchasing firearms muncy had them fill out a new form and instructed them how to record their answers so that the sale could go through adkins estimated that 70 of the gun sales at uncle sam s were illegal the case reverberated across the small town of man where adkins and muncy were serving on the city council in 2008 the city had renamed a street in muncy s honor adkins pleaded guilty in 2016 and the atf pulled uncle sam s gun license adkins who has since been released from prison declined requests to be interviewed for this article muncy was never charged but the revocation didn t stop him from profiting from guns after losing the license to sell firearms at uncle sam s he rented the store to a state trooper who obtained his own license and continued running a gun shop at the location the arrangement lasted until july 2019 when the two parties had a falling out in his testimony muncy denied wrongdoing in the adkins case he went on to operate uncle sam s as a pawn shop until he died in december at the age of 68 his wife died four days later since then the day to day management of the store has fallen to their son roger d b muncy who hopes to get back in the gun business the day my daddy and mommy died i was calling alcohol tobacco firearms wanting to know if i was able to get a firearms license he said they said i need to file my application for this project usa today partnered with the trace a nonprofit newsroom dedicated to improving public understanding of gun violence increasing accountability and identifying solutions

the covid 19 recession has put more people out of work and faster than the downturn which followed the financial crash of 2008 yet there has been optimistic talk of a boom to follow like the roaring 1920s a century earlier gloomier prognosticators foresee a continuation of poor economic performance with a return to inflation thrown in forecasting the macro economy is difficult and the track record is poor challenged about this in the 1980s the late milton friedman explained economists make forecasts not because they know but because they are asked inflationary surge they are asked constantly about the likelihood of an inflationary surge whenever the covid 19 downturn recedes they are in two minds as usual one group expects that central banks will reassert control and tighten policy enough to keep inflation below the target level around 2 per annum in most countries others feel that governments are enjoying the absence of borrowing constraints central banks have been gobbling up government debt and will keep policy loose for longer economists make forecasts not because they know but because they are asked since the lockdowns have seen an increase in the household savings rate there should be something of a consumer boom as restrictions ease there is pent up demand for travel hospitality and for various categories of consumer goods even those whose incomes have been squeezed and who have not accumulated involuntary saving will likely be returning to work and better able to finance consumption business firms will be pushing ahead with investment projects deferred during lockdowns and barring a new wave of the virus there should be no weakness in aggregate demand if governments maintain fiscal stimulus at current high levels the result could be inflationary pressure from the spending side notably in the us where the biden package is larger than seemed likely a few months back monetary stimulus in europe will not be withdrawn early in tune with economic recovery the european central bank ecb has been making dovish noises recently upward drift in bonds there has already been a drift upwards in bond market interest rates in the us where the most recent year on year cpi inflation number came in at 4 2 markets fear that the central bank the federal reserve will raise official interest rates if inflation takes off and they would certainly do so if they thought the uptick was likely to persist but there are once off factors at play including energy prices and the fed is not alarmed in the eurozone there is no evidence yet of an inflation rebound and the figures have been stubbornly below the 2 target for a decade here in ireland there has been hardly any inflation for 10 years now an average of only about 0 5 per annum in the eurozone there has been a persistent failure to keep the inflation rate close to the 2 target and the ecb has acknowledged that failure in addition to price pressures as demand recovers there is evidence of cost increases arising from the business response to covid 19 supply chains have been disrupted internationally and operating costs have risen because of social distancing and resultant extra space requirements some employers are reporting problems in recruiting or re hiring staff many have returned to eastern europe and there could be wage inflation in sectors such as construction if shortages emerge inflation target in the eurozone there has been a persistent failure to keep the inflation rate close to the 2 target and the ecb has acknowledged that failure but nobody knows if there is a greater political tolerance for higher inflation in europe than was the case some years back for a country with heavy international debts or for over borrowed firms and households low inflation is not entirely welcome the perfect combination would be low interest cost on the debt and inflation running above the cost of borrowing delivering negative real interest rates this is the formula that eroded the huge debts following world war ii during the 1950s and 1960s and the immediate post covid 19 years could see a repetition some american economists including the clinton era treasury secretary larry summers think that this process is already under way in the us in the past the ecb has quickly tightened up whenever that prospect emerged and could do so again the outcome could be different in the eurozone ireland does not have an independent currency and both inflation and interest rates will follow the pattern arising from ecb policy for now the policy is to continue with easy monetary conditions and there will be no sudden spike in interest rates but what if inflation moves up to the 2 target in the past the ecb has quickly tightened up whenever that prospect emerged and could do so again it will all depend on attitudes in germany whose influence has prevailed up to now and where inflation tolerance has always been low the general election there is just four months away on 26 september and while there could be a change of regime according to the opinion polls all the parties remain as committed as ever to sound money
