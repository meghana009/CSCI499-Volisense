06 30 2022 san diego california skye bioscience lead drug candidate has shown superior and longer lasting lowering of intraocular pressure a risk factor associated with glaucoma in preclinical studies skye bioscience inc otcqb skye skye or the company a pharmaceutical company developing a proprietary synthetic cannabinoid derivative to treat glaucoma has received regulatory approval to begin its first in human phase 1 clinical study of sbi 100 ophthalmic emulsion sbi 100 oe from the australian human research ethics committee hrec sbi 100 oe is a patented drug representing a new class of therapeutics to potentially treat glaucoma the primary endpoints for this randomized double masked placebo controlled phase 1 study of sbi 100 oe are an assessment of safety and tolerability of the drug in healthy volunteers the secondary endpoint is an assessment of pharmacokinetics the study will also measure changes to intraocular pressure a total of 48 subjects will be administered sbi 100 oe or placebo in single ascending dose sad and multiple ascending dose mad arms preliminary top line data is expected in q4 and final data in q1 of 2023 in the study each arm will consist of three cohorts of eight subjects six receiving sbi 100 oe and two receiving placebo in the sad arm each subject will be administered a single 35ul drop to one study eye of placebo or sbi 100 oe at concentrations of 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 of active drug in cohorts one two and three respectively in the mad arm each subject will receive two drops per day over five days using the respective dose levels of the sad arm a safety review committee will monitor the study and review safety data before approving escalation to the next cohort after submitting our clinical trial protocol to hrec in march we are pleased to receive their approval and look forward to assessing sbi 100 ophthalmic emulsion for the first time in humans said tu diep chief development officer of skye decades of research have established the role of cannabinoid receptor type 1 cb1r in lowering iop however there has been no cb1r agonist therapeutic agent approved by a regulatory agency to treat glaucoma no other company has methodically created a patented molecule and proprietary formulation representing a new class of therapeutic drug to improve the inherent positive attributes of natural cannabinoids while limiting potentially negative systemic effects and with the goal of enhancing the treatment of glaucoma beyond today s approved drugs achieving these goals is skye s focus we have not only created a drug with this ambition but we have also navigated the complexities of synthetic manufacturing and conducted extensive preclinical assessments and now we are embracing the rigors of the clinical and regulatory processes to validate our drug the phase 1 study will be conducted in the clinical trial facility of cmax clinical research in adelaide australia cmax conducting the phase 1 clinical study in australia qualifies skye to receive a tax credit of up to 43 5 next steps submission of clinical trial notification to australian therapeutic goods administration this submission is prepared and will be filed now that hrec approval has been obtained site visit and training skye will train the study investigators and cmax s clinical study staff on the clinical protocol and procedures and ensure that the pharmacy understands how to appropriately handle the drug formulation clinical trial material ctm production the manufacturing process of sbi 100 oe requires very specific and specialized equipment consumables and excipients that cannot be easily substituted global supply chain constraints delayed or limited access to certain components of the manufacturing process and delayed ctm production which was originally scheduled to be completed in early june we are working with our contract manufacturer pharmaceutics international inc to finalize logistical and scheduling details we expect to complete phase 1 ctm production in july secure dea export license and deliver ctm to australia skye has secured the import license required for a controlled substance from the australian department of health we require an export license from the u s drug enforcement agency but must complete ctm production before submitting our application there can be variability in the timing of the dea s review and issue of an export license we do not expect to receive this license earlier than august after which delivery of drug product to australia will be expedited subject screening enrollment and first dosing recruitment of study participants will begin after the prior listed steps are substantially completed since subjects must be administered drug within 28 days of enrollment taking into account the listed variables skye is aiming to dose the first subject in august reporting of study data skye expects to report preliminary topline data in q4 2022 with final data to be reported in q1 2023 glaucoma is still an inadequately treated disease that has lacked pharmacological innovation for decades there is a need for new classes of therapeutics with differentiated mechanisms of action and we have strong conviction in the potential of our novel drug based on relevant independent research and our preclinical data said punit dhillon ceo and chair of skye this study will be the first time a novel cannabinoid prodrug will be topically delivered into human s eyes using a nanoemulsion formulation and marks an important step in the development of sbi 100 ophthalmic emulsion to demonstrate the safety of this approach importantly this study may also provide initial insights into this drug s effect on iop in parallel we aim to submit an investigational new drug ind application which is not dependent upon phase 1 data with the fda by year end for our planned us based phase 2 in 2023 to assess efficacy and safety in patients with glaucoma about sbi 100 ophthalmic emulsion increased intraocular pressure iop is a key risk factor in the progression of glaucoma the first observations that consuming cannabis lowered iop in humans took place in the early 1970s which led to a significant amount of research on the effects of cannabinoids in the eye independent studies demonstrated that activation of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 cb1r in ocular tissue mediates iop lowering however no cannabinoid related drug has been approved for clinical use in the eye due primarily to the shortcomings of current delivery methods of cb1r agonists to the eye in a therapeutically beneficial dose when cannabinoids are administered systemically they can lower iop but also result in undesirable psychotropic effects alternatively extracted natural cannabinoids delivered topically as an eye drop do not penetrate ocular tissue well enough to effectively lower iop due to the lipophilic or oily properties of natural cannabinoids and the aqueous or watery surface of the eye to address these challenges skye developed sbi 100 oe a proprietary synthetic cannabinoid derivative possessing a novel molecular structure and formulation that was rationally designed to enable better penetration of ocular tissue and effective topical delivery of a cb1r agonist in preclinical studies involving three different species a nanoemulsion formulation of the drug applied topically to the eye resulted in enhanced therapeutic efficacy and duration of response in lowering iop importantly these studies also demonstrated advantages compared to today s standard of care and if clinically validated in subsequent efficacy studies may provide a suitable therapeutic window to be a new class of medicine for glaucoma about skye bioscience skye bioscience is a pharmaceutical company unlocking the potential of cannabinoids through the development of its proprietary cannabinoid derivatives to treat diseases with significant unmet needs the company s lead program sbi 100 oe is focused on developing a treatment for glaucoma the world s leading cause of irreversible blindness for more information please visit www skyebioscience com contact investor

kawasaki officials say comments in a published report stating that labor issues at its plant in lincoln are causing delays in the delivery of rail cars to new york city are not true the new york daily news reported monday that metropolitan transit authority officials are unhappy with the pace of rail cars being delivered from lincoln to new york and are blaming that on labor problems and mismanagement the mta approved the purchase of 535 state of the art next generation r211 subway cars from kawasaki in 2018 in a contract valued at the time at 1 4 billion they were supposed to go into service next summer but that has been pushed back to january 2025 the company is also 17 months behind schedule on cars for the long island rail road an mta subsidiary according to the newspaper the daily news reported that jim allen head of rolling stock for the long island rail road said during an mta committee meeting monday that kawasaki would hire employees only to have them leave after a week leading to a real systemic problem siu ling ko chief mechanical officer for nyc transit was quoted as saying kawasaki loses about 45 workers every month from its rail car operation while joseph devito the mta s independent engineering consultant said the company s problems have forced mta to provide constant oversight and supervision a kawasaki official told the journal star that it meets monthly with all of its customers to provide status updates and recently hosted mta officials last week we hosted nyc transit members at our facility and we successfully completed the first car review for the r211t open gangway subway cars which is a large milestone in the progress of the project jason hellbusch corporate director of administration for kawasaki motors manufacturing corp u s a said in an emailed statement joint understanding is key to progress and during this last visit by nyc transit we provided a detailed update regarding status and progress of the project which included supply chain and manpower status but it appears something must have been lost in translation for the mta officials to come away with the impression that kawasaki has labor problems the new york daily news article does correctly highlight that a major reason for delays has been supply chain issues hellbusch said however we take exception to the comment regarding labor problems at kawasaki here in lincoln we currently have sufficient manpower for all projects in our facility and we continue to hire personnel as our production rate increases hellbusch acknowledged that kawasaki like many other companies faces challenges finding enough workers in the current labor market nebraska s 1 9 unemployment rate in may was tied for lowest in the country while lincoln s metropolitan area unemployment rate is among the 20 lowest in the country the company in july 2020 announced an expansion partially driven by the startup of the r211 contract that would require it to hire 550 new employees hellbusch said kawasaki is committed to fulfilling its contracts with mta and the agency appears committed to the company despite the quotes from officials the daily news reported that mta plans to exercise an option to buy an additional 640 subway cars from kawasaki later this year largely because the company is one of only two that it works with the universe of competent qualified car builders that are in the u s are down to two we re all very mindful of some of those consequences said mta chairman janno lieber what we re trying to do is help kawasaki get back on the straight and narrow photos a look inside lincoln s growing kawasaki plant kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki kawasaki

located about sixty miles north of pierre south dakota in brookings blackfork farms is a whiskey making venture generations in the making gordon ommen one of the partners of blackfork farms said his family first came over from northern germany in 1889 settling in southwest minnesota and have been in the area ever since four generations after coming stateside they moved across the state line to the brookings area we re new to the area he adds with a laugh the farm to glass distillery hasn t always been a distillery though the family ommen says was traditionally grain farmers and livestock producers while this hasn t changed they currently farm corn soybeans and alfalfa they also planted native corn species dakota white coteau calico and cheyenne red to create food plots for pheasants which visitors can hunt on property a few years ago maybe six or seven we thought we should take what we have the native grains and make them into whiskey ommen says they did but the use of native grains in whiskey making is a trade off the stock strength terrible bugs eat it ommen says everything is hard about it instead of the 230 bushels per acre that yellow corn 2 yields the native corn yields around 40 bushels per acre the flavor difference though makes up for it think of it like eating a chicken that has run around a farm eating seeds compared to one that was raised on factory farm he says more germ more bran and more oil create a more complex grain which then yields more flavor something the yellow 2 does not have because it was bred to maximize starch and yield once the corn is harvested for bourbon making ommen says they dry it by smoking it with apple and cherry wood they mix the legacy grains with malted barley and another heritage grain blackforest german rye which is also smoked on property the blackforest rye is an older species of dark rye with large grains to finish out their bourbon the bourbon is finished in their solera system blending older and younger whiskeys together as they have more years under their belt ommen says he is excited to be able to expand the system creating an even greater amount of depth that would come from the co mingling of different aged liquids since first producing the bourbon ommen says they ve expanded their whiskey offerings by finishing their bourbon in other casks first they made a special bourbon for the hunters that come to their property finished in toasted french oak it sold out in 10 days next ommen says they decided to switch it up again they acquired mongolian oak casks and finished their whiskey in them just as with the native grains mongolian oak makes whiskey making a bit more complicated not only is it more expensive than american or french oak but the barrels are prone to leakage requiring consistent supervision to ensure nothing goes terribly wrong regardless ommen deemed the release a success lo and behold he says people liked it there s a little more banana in the flavor that difference people really enjoyed currently only their bourbon is available but ommen says they have two other whiskeys waiting in the wings black elk rye is made using the blackforest rye and was developed from george washington s rye whiskey mash bill blackfork s third whiskey uses locally grown oats a popular crop in south dakota ommen says they ve been playing with wilder strains of oats and the results have been good even though the whiskey as well as the rye is still too young to release we re excited about it s a lighter whisky and a little grassier more a summer type of whiskey with such low yielding grains and small batches of whiskey one might question the business decision behind running a distillery but ommen says that they like to think of the distillery as sort of an over sized hobby thanks to the commercial farming portion of their business we get to work on craft whiskeys from our own grains and we re having fun with it he says we re most interested in having a really good product and experience for people who visit one of the other reasons for the distillery ommen adds is that it helps them contribute to philanthropic causes not only are they farming in a sustainable way the land on which they farm features natural waterways and other features that are landscaped and maintained to preserve and encourage biodiversity but they double down on protecting the land by giving to a variety of causes that support land and water conservation to that end 100 of the profits from blackfork farms whisky sold go to conservation causes we want to make the world a little better place by helping organizations we believe in and leaving behind some really nice whiskey

a version of this story appears in cnn s what matters newsletter to get it in your inbox sign up for free here cnn it s a travel season unlike any other anyone looking for a summer getaway is likely to find themselves caught in a chaotic web of canceled flights pricey rental cars or fully booked hotels the prospect of getting from point a to point b without an expensive headache may seem all but impossible consider this on wednesday 639 flights within into or out of the united states were canceled and 5 837 were delayed according to flight tracking data from flightaware delta air lines alone has trimmed about 100 flights a day from its schedule in july to minimize disruptions and has issued a waiver for july 4 travelers as it braces for passenger volumes not seen since before the pandemic renting a car if you can find one will likely cost you more than years past and hotel prices are climbing nationwide too so much for relaxation what s going on your summer travel woes probably aren t your fault in the sky airlines have significantly fewer employees especially pilots than they did before the pandemic and on the road a shortage of available vehicles has pushed rental car prices up double digits add in record high inflation with a remarkable demand for leisure travel and you have a recipe for trouble a lot of this turbulence can be traced back to covid 19 it starts with demand airlines and hotels are forecasting record travel this summer as americans who delayed trips during the pandemic return to vacationing demand meets short staffing though airlines received 54 billion in federal assistance during covid s peak to avoid involuntary layoffs they have fewer employees after offering buyouts and early retirement packages to trim staff and save money short staffing creates problems as a result operations can quickly fall apart when there s bad weather understaffed air traffic control centers or sick staff then there s inflation the consumer price index the government s leading inflation measure estimates that overall fares were up 37 8 in may compared to the previous year and up 21 7 compared to may of 2019 before the pandemic remember in the throes of the outbreak the federal reserve implemented emergency stimulus measures to keep financial markets from tanking the central bank slashed interest rates to near zero and began pumping tens of billions of dollars every month into the markets by buying up corporate debt in doing so the bank likely prevented a financial meltdown but keeping those easy money policies in place has also fueled inflation which is why your airline ticket costs a lot more than it used to rental cars also have a pandemic problem during the height of the pandemic the industry sold off more than a half a million cars about a third of their combined fleets just to generate cash they needed to survive the crisis following a year of deep losses rental car companies have had trouble rebuilding their fleets to meet demand resulting in exorbitantly high prices before you even fill up the tank hotels too you won t feel much relief when you reach your destination either remember the issue of pent up travel demand that s crashing into a limited number of places to stay and resulting in some eye popping prices the rate for an average hotel room is 23 higher than last year according to aaa what s the biden administration doing earlier this month transportation secretary pete buttigieg urged airline executives in a private conversation to review their flight schedules and take other steps to soften the impact of summer flight cancellations a source familiar with the call told cnn s gregory wallace the source said buttigieg asked ceos to talk through plans to prevent and respond to disruptions over the july fourth holiday weekend and beyond what are airlines saying us airlines want you to know they re trying airlines for america the group representing major us airlines told cnn in a statement thursday that it is making every effort to help ensure smooth travel this weekend u s airlines are navigating a range of challenges including weather and staffing at the carrier and federal government level and making every effort to help ensure smooth travel this weekend and year round as always we are working closely and collaboratively with the federal government to address challenges including inclement weather so adjustments to schedules can be made and carriers can communicate with travelers as early as possible the statement said the group s airline members are taking different approaches to reducing summer flight disruptions including cutting the number of flights and allowing passengers to rebook without fees for non peak periods still critics say airlines should have anticipated a lot of these issues ahead of the summer travel season how long will this last read this piece by aviation journalist john walton he writes in almost every case the problem is that too many experienced people were let go during the pandemic either laid off or given a voluntary out and that airlines airports and other key parts of the aviation system have not hired and qualified enough people to replace them that qualification point is important as airlines and airports know all too well there s a whole process involved to get someone the kind of security pass that allows them to work on an airplane or at an airport gate put differently travel is going to be difficult for a while how can you prepare if you do have summer travel plans you re not doomed the cnn travel team pulled together practical tips that will help you reach your destination if it involves flying the earlier the better taking a flight that departs early in the day helps to avoid the cascading effect of delays and cancellations bad weather is also more likely to affect later flights leave cushion time for can t miss events don t travel on the day of an important event such as a wedding plan to arrive at least one day early ask for a hotel voucher if your flight is canceled if you can t get on a flight the same day it s worth asking for meal or hotel vouchers in many cases such as weather events airlines aren t required to provide them but it s worth asking most importantly stay considerate don t take your frustration out on customer service employees they aren t making the operations decisions

the tune of 476 4 million poor performance doesn t let up june s municipal results were less damaging than april s but all in all the quarter has been challenging on many fronts noted kim olsan senior vice president at fhn financial bids wanteds volumes surged 50 to a daily figure of 1 56 billion on fund outflows ici data that increased 250 from q1 levels olsan noted to say liquidity was compromised doesn t tell the whole story but the takeaway is a yield set that is much more buyer friendly than was the case in 2021 olsan said as of wednesday the bloomberg municipal index saw losses of 1 93 and 9 25 for the first half of 2022 there is no common era comparison however the conditions of post march 2020 and through 2021 represented historic financing opportunities for issuers and less than ideal conditions for investors olsan said this year has decidedly moved to a buyer s market given the evolving outlook for the economy buyer interest in quality of rating over quantity of spread has hindered the revenue sector olsan said the revenue sector s loss for june will exceed that of general obligations by more than 50 basis points and the year to date return moves to more than 100 basis points of underperformance against gos revenue bonds with a ytd loss of 10 she notes shorter durations were more heavily favored during june as buyers take a wait and see approach during the tightening cycle olsan said a short term index will close out june with a flat return and has a modest 1 2 loss this year intermediate bonds gave up 1 3 during the month and have lost 8 5 in 2022 while long durations fared the worst losing 4 3 in june generic yields in both ranges will close out june up about 175 basis points from december s close olsan said of particular note in longer maturities is the nuance of sub 5 couponing that prevailed in the last few years she said olsan pointed to data from refinitiv mmd that show 25 year 3s have widened out 30 basis points since january and 25 year 4s are now wider by 34 basis points taxables are down 0 85 for june and 14 53 in the first half per the bloomberg index taxable muni returns are not being helped by the much lower supply olsan noted taxable muni losses compares to the bloomberg barclay s u s aggregate and treasury indices that are down 9 10 albeit with shorter duration models high yield was down 3 65 for june and 12 18 year to date per bloomberg s high yield index high yield munis are following other revenue sectors with larger losses as buyers demand wider concessions for more risk olsan said bloomberg figures

advertisement tesla workers are being warned by automated emails if they don t swipe into the office frequently enough after ceo elon musk threatened to fire anyone who failed to return to the office full time the latest shot in musk s war against working from home was leaked this week when a tesla employee posted a screenshot of an email saying they failed to badge in to the office frequently enough this is an automated notification the email read you are receiving this email because there is no record of you using your badge to enter a tesla facility on at least 16 days over the 30 day period ending on june 28 as a reminder all employees are expected to be back in the office fulltime we realize that there are various reasons why you may not have badged in including illness vacation or traveling for business the email added whatever the case please clear the reason for you absence with your manager by email the message said tesla workers are being warned by automated emails if they don t swipe into the office enough after ceo elon musk threatened to fire anyone who failed to return to the office a tesla employee posted a screenshot of an email saying they failed to badge in to the office frequently enough a spokesperson for tesla did not immediately respond to an inquiry from dailymail com on thursday evening it comes after musk ordered employees to return to the office or leave the company in a may 31 email everyone at tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week musk wrote in the email if you don t show up we will assume you have resigned the more senior you are the more visible must be your presence musk wrote that is why i lived in the factory so much so that those on the line could see me working alongside them if i had not done that tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt amid musk s crackdown on working from home the ceo has also been carrying out his vow to cut about 10 percent of salaried staff at the electric carmaker the billionaire sent an internal email warning earlier this month of the need for cuts amid a gloomy economic outlook due to inflation and the brutal war in ukraine musk himself said he had a super bad feeling about the economy earlier this week tesla told at least 195 of the 276 staffers at the san mateo california office that they were being laid off while those that remain were told they will be relocated according to techcrunch everyone at tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week musk wrote in a second email sent to staff hours after the first which was leaked and widely shared the san mateo offices were heavily involved with the tesla autopilot driver assistance system staff were informed of the decision tuesday those laid off were considered moderately low skilled low wage workers that often did jobs like determining if the company s driver assistance program correctly identified objects musk has previously hit out against remote working policies and blasted americans for trying to avoid going to work at all and compared them to staff in china who stay at the factory burning the 3am oil in april staff at tesla s gigafactory were made to sleep at work when production resumed after a three week shutdown the factory started operating as a closed loop system to avoid further shutdowns caused by china s strict zero covid policy workers were given a sleeping bag and mattress and part of the factory floor to camp out on an aerial view of the tesla fremont factory on may 12 2020 in fremont california tesla is cutting about 200 employees from its office in san mateo california as part of continued cuts by the electric car giants that will see the location close altogether meanwhile world s richest man musk is currently embroiled in a months long deal to but silicon valley social media giant twitter for roughly 44 billion food of around 63 a day was provided to each employee but they were expected to work 12 hours a day with one day off every six days before the temporary measures were imposed staff reportedly worked eight hour shifts with four days on and two days off before shanghai s lockdown on march 28 the gigafactory produced 2 000 cars a day and made half of the vehicles the company delivered worldwide last year last month musk who is currently in negotiations with twitter over buying the social media giant seemingly took aim at the company s lax remote working policies he said he asked his twitter followers if he should transform the company s silicon valley headquarters into a homeless shelters since no one shows up anyway it comes after twitter brass who offered staffers the option of working from home forever during the pandemic reopened its offices march 15 with remote work remaining an option for staffers musk has warned in recent weeks about the risks of recession but ordering a hiring freeze and staff cuts was the most direct and high profile message of its kind responding to a question on twitter from a follower about whether he has a comment to people who think coming into work is an antiquated concept musk wrote back they should pretend to work somewhere else remotely addressing a conference in mid may in miami beach he said i think we are probably in a recession and that recession will get worse almost 100 000 people were employed at tesla and its subsidiaries at the end of 2021 its annual sec filing showed carsten brzeski global head of macroeconomic research at ing said musk s bad feeling is shared by many people we re talking about stagnation and a global economy which has to go through significant structural change such as decarbonization deglobalisation and adjusting to older societies more than 700 tesla customers complain about shadow braking in model 3 and model ys more than 750 tesla owners have complained to u s safety regulators that cars operating on the automaker s partially automated driving systems have suddenly stopped on roadways for no apparent reason the national highway traffic safety administration revealed the number in a detailed information request letter to tesla that was posted friday on the agency s website the 14 page letter dated may 4 asks the automaker for all consumer and field reports it has received about false braking as well as reports of crashes injuries deaths and property damage claims it also asks whether the company s full self driving and automatic emergency braking systems were active at the time of any incident the agency began investigating phantom braking in tesla s models 3 and y last february after getting 354 complaints the probe covers an estimated 416 000 vehicles from the 2021 and 2022 model years in february the agency said it had no reports of crashes or injuries the letter gives tesla a deadline of june 20 to respond to the information request but says the company can ask for an extension a message was left early friday seeking comment from tesla advertisement but we are not talking about global recession we expect a cooling of the global economy towards the end of the year the us will cool off while china and europe are not going to rebound laying off workers however is not the best reaction we will need skilled workers more than ever in the future this could turn into firing and then hiring jamie dimon chairman and chief executive of jpmorgan chase described the challenges facing the us economy earlier this week as akin to a hurricane however although financial experts acknowledged a bad feeling many were unsure a global recession is on the cards fiona cincotta a financial markets analyst at city index in london said although the fed thinks a soft landing is possible there are some warning signs in the economy we know that growth is slowing and inflation remains persistently high and we know that the fed will need to act aggressively to bring inflation back down the question is will they be able to act as aggressively as they need to and obviously elon musk doesn t think that they re going to be able to without putting the economy into a deep recession china slowdown is an added problem other companies have cut jobs or are slowing or pausing hiring amid weakening demand last month netflix said it had laid off about 150 people mostly in the us and peloton said in february it would cut 2 800 jobs meta uber and other technology companies have slowed hiring in june 2018 musk said tesla would cut 9 per cent of its workforce as the then loss making company struggled to ramp up output of model 3 electric sedans meanwhile the world s richest man is still embroiled in a months long deal to buy silicon valley social media giant twitter for roughly 44billion his stark anti remote sentiments are expected to fly in the face of the company s more relaxed work from home rules which allow employees to work remotely forever in april after the deal was announced musk seemed to take a shot at this policy asking his followers if he should transform the company s bay area headquarters into a homeless shelter because no one shows up anyway twitter s top brass who offered staffers the option of working from home forever during the pandemic reopened its offices march 15 with remote work remaining an option for staffers it s been almost two years since we closed our offices and travel and i m excited to announce that we re ready to fully open up business travel and all our offices around the world twitter ceo parag agrawal wrote in a note to employees posted to twitter march 3 business travel is back effective immediately and office openings will start on march 15 the exec wrote twitter has not issued any in person requirements for its staffers the deal is expected to close later this year tesla was not immediately available for comment

it s taken nearly 30 years but the u s has finally passed gun legislation in the effort to combat mass shootings across the u s the bipartisan safer communities act led by senators chris murphy and john cornyn has taken shape over the last month since 19 children and two teachers were killed in a mass shooting in the last week of school at robb elementary in uvalde texas the 18 year old who carried out the shooting had bought two assault rifles for his birthday just weeks before the passage also comes days after the supreme court shot down new york s ability to restrict the flow of guns in the state also striking down similar measures in other states it started with a group of democratic and republican senators that met in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy one of them pa senator pat toomey said as the discussions progressed that gun legislation was closer than it had ever been in his time in the senate in the end the bipartisan effort offers incentives to states to pass red flag laws that would prevent some individuals from purchasing firearms expands background checks for 18 to 21 year old buyers of guns and funnels more funding into mental health and other wellness programs the bill also closes the boyfriend loophole which was a gap in federal law that banned spousal domestic abusers from purchasing firearms but not ones that never married their partners still the bill falls far short of what democrats envisioned in something being called a sweeping gun reform those include bans on extended magazines bump stocks lifting the minimum age for the purchase of assault rifles and create new regulations for storing firearms at home even with the shortcomings the bill still comfortably passed the senate 65 to 33 with all 48 democrats voting for it joined by 15 republicans in the house the bill passed 294 to 193 with 14 republicans joining every democrat when signing the bill into law on saturday june 25 president joe biden mentioned some of what wasn t included in the bill but also said it was something from columbine to sandy hook to charleston orlando las vegas parkland el paso atlanta buffalo uvalde and for the shootings that happen every day in the streets how many times have you heard that just do something for god s sake just do something he was quoted as saying by fox news god willing it s going to save a lot of lives he was quoted by the new york times

author romain huët menafn the conversation in his ukraine diaries researcher romain huët chronicles the way war has changed the daily lives of an entire population after reporting for the conversation from the field in april and may 2022 he now provides us with a first hand look at the conflict this entry is the last in the diary series 1 may 2022 kramatorsk and severodonetsk leaving kharkiv was a painful and trying experience i had built a rapport with many of the volunteers the act of leaving and the discomfort that comes with it reveals the asymmetrical relationship between the observer and the volunteers they stay whereas i am free to move on having spent only a short time in their lives after our goodbyes and our promises to keep in touch no matter what i travel to two other volunteer centres in the donbas that serve the cities of kramatorsk and severodonetsk the military situation here is much worse than in kharkiv russian forces have surrounded the city and the fighting is particularly fierce each day there are fears that the enemy will push forward enough to capture both cities in the thick of the conflict as in kharkiv the volunteer centre provides humanitarian aid to the towns and villages caught in the clashes it is also responsible for evacuating the last war weary inhabitants who are reluctantly leaving their homes and livelihood behind this week i have been helping the volunteers in their missions every day is more or less the same at 7 a m volunteers from all of kramatorsk come out to their base in the suburbs to access it one must drive along a badly damaged road practically crawling for the last 200 metres as one swerves between the various obstacles on one s path the base a huge disused sawmill is an unsettling sight to behold the factory looks like it was abandoned years ago stacks of wood and machinery litter the floor in front of the old sawmill turned volunteer base romain huët fourni par l auteur when i arrive most of the volunteers have already made their way here by minibus or in their own cars they queue up in front of a makeshift petrol station consisting of two tanks containing a few hundred litres of fuel each the volunteers repeat the routine every morning parking in front of the tanks to fill up their vehicles for the day s journey the tanks are stocked up on a provisional daily basis the rest of the fuel sits in a massive storage building which serves as a goods warehouse and loading area inside cardboard boxes are arranged haphazardly most of them filled with basic necessities supplied by european ngos there are also all sorts of sweets and juices with unusual flavours and colours inside the storage building romain huët fourni par l auteur not far off ukrainian tanks hide from sight although we can t see them we regularly hear them shoot their presence unnerves me as they make the base a potential target others don t share my concern however the volunteers don t seem to care about the reality on the frontline military positions or the situation at large fed up and saturated with the ever changing news they simply accept this new reality and get on with it they speak of the military situation only in very broad terms when missiles start raining from the sky i m embedded with vadim for the day we re going to deliver packages to severodonetsk a city that would usually be a two hours drive away it has been under siege for several weeks after that we will attempt to evacuate civilians from the surrounding villages we will be driving an old minibus donated to the centre by a polish ngo its seats have been removed to make more room vadim a slightly portly man of about forty with a cheerful face seldom speaks when he chooses to do so he never raises his voice he s not the type of guy to cause trouble he gets the job done without making a fuss in all our chats he has never gone into details about his old life perhaps because he thinks it isn t relevant to what s going on now he was introduced to me as a formidable driver the best of the best i understood this to mean that his missions would take him to all the difficult to access areas vadim driving the minibus romain huët fourni par l auteur before we return to the base vadim drops me off outside one of the rare open supermarkets to stock up on cigarettes it s not always possible to find them many cities have been hit with goods shortages and basic necessities are not exactly supplied equally some might consider cigarettes to be a completely unessential consumer product but in this time of war the volunteers i ve met have all been chain smoking to kill time or to calm their nerves in critical situations in the shop i hesitate over whether to get myself a take away coffee i usually go for an americano on the whole the coffee here doesn t exactly have the best flavour but at least it keeps you awake after restless nights filled with explosions and sirens there are a few people in front of me in the queue we decide not to wait any longer we re in a hurry getting back to the factory is an ordeal because of the terrible state of the road making constant stops and starts vadim drives slowly across the bumpy surface taking particular care with the train tracks that could damage the vehicle s shock absorbers we don t want to end up stuck on one of them the old minibus rocks from side to side under the strain of countless past repairs vadim patiently weaves his way forward on the lookout for patches of road that can support the vehicle s wheels we arrive at the factory and exit the vehicle as always we shake a few hands as we wait to fill up i light a cigarette at that very moment we are shaken by a huge blast the boom is deafening it causes us to instinctively duck down the missile has exploded just 200 metres from our position hitting the potholed road that we crossed just three minutes earlier a giant cloud of black smoke and debris billows up into the air everyone is terrified fuck that was a close one one of the volunteers says we keep our eyes on the sky in case we see another missile falling on us the bombs fall so fast that you barely have the time to watch yourself die tapping vadim s shoulder i point toward a second missile falling from the sky it lands at around the same place as the first whether due to the noise or to my stupor in the face of these death machines i am unable to tear my eyes away from the missile as it follows its trajectory from sky to ground first we see more black smoke filled with endless dirt and debris forming an enormous mushroom cloud of death that floods the sky then we hear the explosion piercing through the air we run for cover behind a pile of wooden planks all cut up and stacked together a makeshift shelter to protect from shrapnel and when you see the sharp steel shards contained in these missiles you realise that these planks can come in quite handy everything happens so quickly and suddenly that there s no point in trying to resist the panic we are overcome with a slew of conflicting feelings disbelief mixes with a keen sense of present danger we stare at the sky and then look all around for possible hiding spots fear and dread are palpable but expressed by no one they take hold of our bodies and our innermost thoughts repeating over and over that something even more horrific might happen but we must keep these feelings to ourselves a few seconds after the explosion the sign on the minibus says free evacuations romain huët fourni par l auteur photographing the destruction as it happens right after the explosion some are taking photographs of the smoke swirling up into the sky the purpose of this act is to prove to ourselves that we were actually there standing just a few dozen metres away from the impact vadim even takes a video of himself with the plumes of smoke in the background there s a strange buzz in the air we were right there and three minutes earlier we would have been goners throughout the rest of the day i hear these same words repeated expressing the danger of the situation and an awareness of our sheer luck my stomach is in knots ukraine diaries our ethnographic correspondent documents the war art in the face of the war volunteering for war in french can we turn our back on their war in french ruins carefree attitude and the trivialisation of war in french standing firm as the bombs fall in french donbas where volunteers pray to be spared by fate vadim and i don t stick around we have to head back to severodonetsk to deliver the packages and evacuate any willing residents he fills up the fuel tank and we drive away from the site of the explosion along the bumpy road a few metres from the massive factory a number of soldiers emerge from their hiding spot they are on high alert but appear at a loss once a missile explodes it is too late for the soldiers to retaliate utterly powerless all they can do is observe the sky and pray that they will be spared gifts at the checkpoints two packets of oreos and two bottles of orange juice the trip to severodonetsk lasts an hour and a half there are many checkpoints on the way which we pass through with no trouble vadim takes this road every day and he has his little habits he exchanges a few words with the soldiers some of whom are old acquaintances he doesn t come empty handed to each of them he offers two packets of oreo biscuits and two bottles of orange juice the soldiers are amused by vadim s generosity they joke around but are happy to take the gift for my part i have only been checked once in the city of severodonetsk the soldier asked me where my helmet was and i told him that it was in the boot of the vehicle vadim wasn t wearing one and i didn t really want to stand out in those sorts of situations the soldier eyed me up scornfully annoyed by the apparent carelessness of the war tourist watching his sweeping gesture simulating how my flesh would be scattered through the air i secretly harboured a few doubts about the helmet s usefulness you can just give it to me if you re not going to wear it he continued not possible the helmet and bulletproof vest were on loan from reporters without borders i had left a deposit of 2 500 so i had better hold on to it the same emptiness spreading out before us severodonetsk is just as sinister as the north eastern neighbourhoods of kharkiv the same emptiness spreads out before us streets reduced to rubble bullet riddled blocks of flats collapsed roofs and charred buildings explosions are very frequent severodonetsk romain huët fourni par l auteur the russians surround the city located just 3 km 2 miles away on our way we pass several ukrainian tanks looking to position themselves as we travel through the city vadim insists that i take some videos after all my role is to document and footage is vital in attesting to this reality he reminds me to hide my camera as we appear to approach a checkpoint but the streets are empty of people vadim has forgotten one important thing we are at the frontline where there are of course no checkpoints the video ends abruptly when the soldiers tell us to stop the minibus as i film the wreckage from a slow moving mini bus four soldiers appear out of nowhere they stand 20 metres away their guns aimed at us vadim stops the vehicle and opens the door one of the soldiers draws his weapon closer he yells at us to stay still one move and he ll shoot the air is thick with tension they surround the vehicle located a few metres away it wouldn t take much for them to shoot us down based on the precautionary principle war does not always offer a valiant death i remember that in syria not far from idlib two fighters were killed right after a significant victory over bashar al assad s forces in a festive mood they had fooled around with suvs they had taken from the regular army they collided two fighters died from the driver s seat vadim shouts that we are volunteers they ask us to slowly step out of the vehicle with our hands up without lowering their weapons and still eyeing us suspiciously they approach us after asking some questions and checking our papers they relax a little surprisingly they do not go through my phone the check shouldn t last too long we re all totally exposed and vulnerable after a few minutes they let us go ordering us not to take any photos they don t have to ask me twice once the check is complete we soon reach the volunteer centre it s a narrow building of around 70 sq m the interior is hollow because the living room wall was blown apart yesterday the chairs are still here though now facing a gaping hole that looks out on a heap of rubble the house has barely been cleared of the detritus a coffee pot sits on the floor near an electrical socket assorted cardboard boxes are strewn around it is a dodgy unsafe place to be but it is here that a dozen or so volunteers are still working away to bring aid to the citizens of severodonetsk the volunteer centre in severodonetsk as seen from the outside william nessen fourni par l auteur from the yard william nessen fourni par l auteur and from the inside william nessen author provided it is also where i happen to meet an american journalist by the name of william nessen whose story of his stay in the donbas can be read here he s been here a fortnight already and doesn t intend to leave until the russians are gone holding a packet of crisps he munches away while giving me a rapid summary of all the different lives he has led covering wars in indonesia iraq and many other locations his nonchalant carefree manner puts me at ease nothing seems to bother him not even the dull sounds of explosions that can be heard almost constantly a strange void after delivering the goods we hastily leave the volunteer centre we make our way out of severodonetsk and head toward a village under threat of siege by russians forces our mission is to evacuate any willing inhabitants sometimes evacuation is done with the help of the army but nothing has been organized today we speed along another road cracked by rocket attacks on the road romain huët fourni par l auteur it is lined by trees and fields that conceal a number of tanks all around are sparse thin columns of smoke people often ask what the front is like this is what it is an empty space fighters hiding in plain sight smoke all around sounds of explosions coming like clockwork gunshots can also be heard here and there likely missing their target it is an eerie landscape that offers nothing in the way of comfort all stands still in waiting in the minibus vadim is quiet we are on edge our bodies restless we smoke nervously speeding along the treacherous roads our senses are hyper receptive watching for dangers that might pop out of anywhere all i see is a strange void a desolate scene that gives off an intensely destructive lethal vibe we arrive at the village perched on top of a little hill a few residents are smoking in front of their homes against this grim barren backdrop vadim rolls down the window and offers his help they wave us away they re staying here even though they risk ruin and occupation they have made their choice emptying these towns of all their citizens is no mean feat vadim continues to drive up and down the virtually empty streets at a street corner a guy holds a plastic bag waving frantically he seems relieved by our presence and hurries over to us yes i want to evacuate he says his voice trembling he looks particularly shaken his features worn out by fear vadim asks for his id he has it carrying nothing more than a plastic bag and his papers the young man leaves his life behind just one person has agreed to evacuate today rational choice theory suggests that decisions should be made by weighing up potential risks to be met and the benefits to be gained following a certain action that theory does not apply here our vehicle leaves the village at breakneck speed we can t stop it s dangerous here vadim says as he focuses on the road romain huët fourni par l auteur romain huët fourni par l auteur time is of the essence silence suddenly falls in the minibus slipping in among us words seem meaningless at this point the road is a total wreck every inch of it cracked but vadim appears to be speeding up even more he positions the right wheels on the other side of a trench while the left side remains on the undamaged part of the road the vehicle flies on in this insane balancing act i hold on tight as terrified as i am helpless branches clatter against the windscreen already well worn from many previous trips of this kind i gaze out at the road as if i am the one driving i consider all the different ways we might crash imagining the windscreen shattering to pieces completely caught up in the action of our race i have forgotten about the bombs vadim continues to send the vehicle hurtling forward until he finds some solid road it s now looking more navigable as the road starts to widen the danger seems to move farther and farther away our tense bodies slacken we are a bit calmer but remain silent i regain my bearings as we drive on in silence my reflections on war turn over in my head in this disempowering reality how is it possible to feel like we have made any difference at all a cough from the passenger in the back pulls me back into reality even when the world is crumbling around you you can still find some outlet some feeling of having acted and stood up against the violence of course the quest for such meaning might send you straight to your death incredibly however throughout all my time with the volunteers not once was death mentioned it has not yet become ubiquitous only if war drags on and hopelessness settles in will it become par for the course for the time being however all their energy is being poured into the resistance which they believe will be victorious at the limit of all expressions there is silence chris marker a few minutes later we light up cigarettes and manage to start speaking again vadim says that this used to be a pleasant drive before the road was taken over by tanks the scene was one of lush vegetation verdant plains stretched on for miles and the road was shaded by beautiful trees the silence that took hold of us a few minutes earlier reflected our general sadness it is a sadness not told in words but rooted in the body in his essay the living and the dead the multimedia artist chris marker wrote at the limit of all expressions there is silence each day endlessly vadim makes these same journeys when we get to kramatorsk he stops outside a bar that is seemingly shut but which can actually be entered through a discreetly hidden door we find ourselves in a semi clandestine grocery shop selling alcohol cigarettes and a few food products vadim buys a few bottles all of a sudden i feel like having a big party where everyone gets slightly tipsy and we all congratulate each other warmly for an extra day of work instead he leaves me back at hq before heading home he asks me to send him the video that i took before the soldiers started aiming at us that utterly absurd moment really happened and here s the proof but it s not like people always believe what they see in videos real footage at least can prevent the memory from being lost and defend against skeptics who would have you doubt your own experience translated from the french by enda boorman for fast forword this article was

as part of the meeting held by the jones walker banking financial services industry team last week in washington dc jim miller and tom cronin of alliance advisors presented current trends in shareholder activism following the meeting tom walker a partner in the firm s jackson office had a chance to sit down with tom and jim to delve a little more deeply into the concerns highlighted during the meeting what follows is a recap of their conversation tell us a little bit about alliance advisors what you do there and your experience with shareholder activism particularly concerning community banks tom alliance advisors is an award winning proxy solicitation and corporate governance advisory firm that provides corporations with data backed strategies research and advice for dealing with dissident shareholder situations in addition to proxy solicitation and governance advisory services our firm also provides investor intelligence and proxy logistics services to clients i was brought in by the firm in december primarily to deal with community banks and banking industry clients as a whole i have worked for 40 years in the proxy solicitation business as a relationship manager helping clients identify activists and their cohorts and as well as the goals of activists once they are engaged in a dissident situation jim personally i have participated in over 100 proxy contests and at least twice that number of engagements with management and activists in my 10 years experience with another proxy advisory firm prior to joining the alliance team in 2019 as far as contested and contentious are concerned the alliance team in particular peter casey tom ball and i bring 50 years experience representing both issuers and activists in contested situations moreover our activism defense playbook and activist risk assessment analysis are popular tools that help a company get its house in order those tools among other things provide a road map of the do s and don ts to give the board the best chance to prevail in a contest and assess a company s relative vulnerability or risk of becoming a target of an activist at alliance we tell our clients that failing to prepare for a potential activist is preparing to fail the best time for a company to deal with an activist is before it becomes a target you have mentioned that from your perspective shareholder activism has increased recently for community banks what do you think the cause of that is jim activism in a community bank is typically led by only a handful of small investors historically the more traditional and better capitalized activists have avoided targeting community banks due to uncertainty surrounding whether an investment in and or engagement with a banking organization would constitute control the prevailing belief was that the prospect of frb examination and supervision just for seeking to catalyze change at a bank was discomforting to most activists as was the belief of the frb s case by case approach to determining questions of control and apparent lack of transparency of its control determinations however many contend that the frb contemplated rule changes set forth in 2019 introduced an important level of predictability to the control analysis that could loosen things up for activists in the banking sector they further contend that the simplified framework for analyzing control questions will introduce an element of predictability that will make activists acquisition of stocks in bank holding companies easier tom i also think that there are fewer and fewer community banks throughout the country and in this smaller group there are some banks that have not performed very well and are identified by activists as possible targets in which they can acquire a major position and then make a profit by forcing a sale of the bank or its holding company these activists also get many of their followers to join them in certain banks and assist them in the campaign there also seems to be more institutional investors that are supporting dissidents as a whole in your experience are there any risk factors that a community bank may have that will make it more likely to become a target of an activist jim yes when the bank s bylaws and certificate of incorporation lack governance provisions considered best practices especially when compared with their peer banks typically in addition to performance issues activists look for weaknesses in the company s board structure composition and shareholder rights provisions and whether the company s governance provisions align with best practices or are superior to those of its peers that is why it is important to perform a risk assessment on a regular basis one of the benefits of a risk assessment is its ability to uncover potential areas for improvement or low hanging fruit that the board can proactively address that way the company can get out in front of the dissident and will not appear reactive to dissident stimulus but rather as taking initiative more generally the risk factors include relative inferior performance including problematic m a transactions poor shareholder returns and unfavorable peer benchmark comparisons as performance concerns typically carry the most weight in a contest at least with institutional investors poor corporate governance provisions as highlighted above environmental and social issues in particular human capital management issues such as lack of board diversity which have become another concern that activists may employ to pile on a target executive compensation that is not aligned with performance or is a very high multiple of median performance that said banks that are performing well in both absolute and relative terms generally do not get targeted and if targeted do not lose proxy contests however in situations where a bank is performing worse than its peers those other risk factors become more important since they give shareholders especially those who may be undecided more ammunition to justify a vote for the activist tom with many of the community banks your main issues are the lack of buybacks lack of dividends lack of stock owned by the board and officers and lack of insider interests activists look for opportunities to push the target into a quick sale so the activists can receive a quick profit and all of these factors are critical to that analysis i also think all corporations should know who their shareholders are and have periodic contact with them to get to know them and their interests before they have to request a proxy card from them what do you think are the most effective steps a community bank can take before an activist becomes involved to address risk factors that may be present tom the main thing is to make sure the corporation is more proactive than reactive by protecting dividends providing buybacks and becoming familiar with its shareholders interests and giving them what they are looking for before they have to approach those same shareholders to solicit proxies during a contest most importantly make sure the bank is running well and has no performance problems under the hood that may not yet be known finally it is important to develop a corporate communication policy before a problem arises so that the corporation only has one voice and there are not numerous insiders who are engaging the activists and giving separate pieces of information that may be inconsistent or even conflicting jim community banks should regularly assess where they stand on absolute and relative bases no company is immune to activism anymore so it is important to identify what makes you vulnerable relative to your peers this includes evaluating not solely the bank s financial and returns but also reviewing and changing governing documents when appropriate to address board governance provisions executive composition alignment and environmental and social issues it is equally important to maintain investor dialogue particularly on strategic plans and present a clear transparent and compelling rationale for choosing that strategy the main steps to consider for prevention of an activist problem are the following i assess your vulnerabilities ii review your strategic plan iii maintain open dialogue with your investors particularly your larger ones iv establish a stockholder surveillance program to identify possible activists v assemble a response team and vi know your response plan again the optimal time to deal with an activist campaign is before the corporation becomes a target in your experience how many community bank management teams are ultimately successful when engaging an activist shareholder vs how many ultimately succumb to the demands of the activist tom probably in one third of the situations the activist wins in one third management wins and in one third there is some type of a settlement between the two obviously it largely depends on numerous variables that affect the result percentage of activist shareholder ownership management resolve etc jim i think in the past there was more saber rattling than proxy contests that went to a vote within this sector typically community banks were beset by activists with limited positions and resources however as highlighted above the activism landscape for banks is changing and expectations are that activists no longer are as reticent to target this sector as evidenced by the uptick in campaigns this year and the addition of larger and more credible activists iss and glass lewis have recently announced voting guidance with respect to corporations that lack gender or racial diversity on their boards what is the status of that guidance and how do you expect it to be applied to next year s annual meetings in which there are board contests jim while iss and glass lewis won t make the argument for the dissident they will weigh it unfavorably against a corporation when raised by the activist proxy advisors analytic frameworks and policies for contested situations are separate and distinct from those for uncontested meetings the relative importance of that issue in a proxy fight depends on whether the dissident raises it as an issue particularly if the company s performance relative to its peers is also unfavorable though it may not in itself drive the vote recommendation in the contest it will be highlighted to let shareholders decide for themselves whether the lack of diversity merits change at the board level tom i also think it will become more important to iss and glass lewis in proxy contests as time goes on and lack of diversity continues especially when new board members are added the universal proxy rule recently announced by the sec is widely expected to change proxy contests with activists dramatically how do you anticipate the rule changing proxy contests for your clients and do you think it provides the activists or the corporation with an advantage jim we agree that it will dramatically change the dynamics of a proxy fight there will be much more of a granular focus on the individual nominees as opposed to a focus on the different proxy cards of the contestants we do think it could lead to more threatened contests and settlements and as we mentioned earlier it provides an easier pathway for activists we also foresee many growing pains given the newness of the rule for example what happens when there is the rule and multiple activists tom i also think more proxy contests will be pursued since it will be easier and less costly for activists and current activists are likely to pursue more contests than they have in the past because of this i really think that initially it will be a disaster of mistakes and investor confusion among all parties involved until everyone figures how this new system works and the rule is perfected following implementation thank you both
in what is an unfortunate sign of the times springpoint senior living inc recently sued its insurers in new jersey federal court claiming they abruptly stopped covering springpoint s defense costs after doing so for nearly a decade a copy of the complaint can be found here springpoint s allegations are emblematic of a growing trend among insurers taking drastic measures to avoid coverage which is no doubt in response to the tightening economic conditions and looming recession around the globe springpoint is a senior living facility located in wall township new jersey in 2013 springpoint was sued in a class action alleging that the facility defrauded its residents through misleading statements regarding the refund of the initial fee paid by residents springpoint initially retained clark michie as its defense counsel springpoint turned to its directors and officers insurer national union and its professional liability insurer cna for coverage according to the complaint national union unconditionally agreed to cover 75 of springpoint s defense costs while reserving rights on other issues national union insisted that springpoint use national union s panel counsel morgan lewis bockius alongside clark michie in the defense of the class action and springpoint agreed cna also accepted coverage and paid the defense costs incurred by clark michie according to springpoint national union was repeatedly advised about the cna coverage and national union never raised any objection for the next seven years national union covered 75 of springpoint s defense costs incurred by morgan lewis and cna covered the defense costs incurred by clark michie springpoint alleges that out of the blue in may 2020 national union took the position that its coverage was excess over the cna policy years after the class action was commenced national union claimed confusion over the coverage available under the cna policy despite being told repeatedly about that coverage national union insisted that it just came to fully understand that concurrent coverage was available through cna the complaint alleges that in 2021 national union and cna then entered into an agreement under which cna assumed responsibility for paying 75 of morgan lewis s fees incurred defending the class action the problem according to springpoint is that now neither insurer is paying those defense costs springpoint was left with no other option and sued national union cna and an excess insurer ironshore to enforce its rights to coverage springpoint seeks declaratory relief regarding each insurer s coverage obligations damages for breach of contract and promissory equitable estoppel against national union and bad faith damages against national union springpoint s experience is not unique times are tough the stock market is down the federal reserve is hiking rates inflation is running rampant and most commentators believe we have a ways to go before things get better which could involve a full scale global recession insurance companies which historically earn the bulk of their profits by investing the premiums received are especially sensitive to these economic conditions insurers are accordingly clamping down where they can which includes heightened scrutiny of claims that come in and looking for new ways to avoid coverage for existing claims springpoint is a prime example of how policyholders can become collateral damage in the process in these times policyholders must take a proactive approach to submitting claims to insurers and carefully communicating regarding coverage policyholders should expect their insurers to look for ways to avoid or limit coverage and they should be prepared to fight back one of the best ways to preempt this is to fully understand the coverage being purchased before a loss occurs experienced coverage counsel can help maximize the available coverage before a policy is issued and can also act as a safety net when insurers fail to honor their contractual obligations after a loss arises

the delaware supreme court recently affirmed a court of chancery ruling granting a special litigation committee s motion to terminate a shareholder derivative action that had survived a motion to dismiss the split decision in el pollo loco june 28 2022 highlights whether a director can be considered independent especially as a member of a special litigation committee slc if he or she had known about and had approved or not objected to the prior motion to dismiss which had asserted that the claims at issue in the subsequent slc investigation lacked merit the majority in diep concluded that the two relevant slc members were independent because the record did not show that they had approved or participated in a substantive way in the decision to file the motion to dismiss however justice valihura s lengthy dissent disputed that conclusion and opined that the board including the two directors who later joined the slc must have approved the decision to file the motion which alleged that the same claims that those slc members were later charged with evaluating lacked merit the majority s ruling will give some comfort to companies and boards that decide to move to dismiss derivative actions but then need to appoint slcs or perhaps even demand review committees drcs but the majority opinion appears to be fact specific and does not articulate a bright line rule that a director s involvement in a motion to dismiss does not undermine his or her independence for purposes of a subsequently formed slc or drc the dissent highlights that potential tension and raises questions about the factual assumptions that seem to have undergirded the majority opinion this debate could cause companies and boards to pay further attention to issues that derivative actions pose including whether to file a motion to dismiss whether and when to create an slc or a drc and who the members of any such committee should be factual background the diep derivative action was filed in the wake of a securities class action alleging that the corporate defendant el pollo loco had made misrepresentations about its financial performance the derivative plaintiff asserted similar disclosure claims cast in the guise of breach of fiduciary duty he also alleged that company insiders and the controlling shareholder had violated delaware law by selling large amounts of company stock before the so called truth about the alleged misrepresentations was revealed to the market the company and the individual defendants moved to dismiss the case based on the plaintiff s failure to have made a pre suit demand on the company s board and the individual defendants also moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim the court of chancery stayed the count of the complaint that overlapped with the disclosure claims in the securities class action but denied the motion as to the insider trading claims the board then formed an slc to investigate the allegations at issue in the securities and derivative actions the slc consisted of three members none of whom had been named as a defendant two of the directors had joined the board after the conduct at issue but before the motions to dismiss had been filed the third had joined later the slc retained independent counsel conducted a detailed investigation and concluded that the derivative claims should not be pursued the slc moved to terminate the derivative litigation and the court of chancery granted the motion applying longstanding delaware law under zapata corp v maldonado the court held that the slc had established that its members were independent and that it had conducted a reasonable investigation the court also concluded under zapata s second step that the slc s decision to terminate the derivative litigation was reasonable the supreme court affirmed in a 4 1 decision with justice valihura dissenting the majority decision the majority s decision discusses the standards applicable to review of slc and drc decisions and examines questions of director independence where slc members had some business and social relationships with individual defendants but perhaps the most interesting part of the decision concerns the plaintiff s allegation that the two slc members who had been on the board when the motion to dismiss was filed were not independent because they had prejudged the subject matter of the subsequent slc investigation through their involvement in the prior decision to move to dismiss those claims for lack of merit the majority rejected that contention holding that the two slc members had not approved or participated in a substantive way in the decision to file the motion to dismiss noting that independence is a fact specific determination made in the context of a particular case the majority recited what it considered to be the relevant facts the board including the two slc members had received an update regarding pending litigation at a board meeting the minutes of the meeting d not mention the motion to dismiss the record is devoid of evidence that was involved in any discussion about or approved the filing of the motion to dismiss the other slc member was sure there would have been a litigation update and discussion on the subject but did not recall the details of it although did not recall anyone objecting to the motion he did not say he approved of its filing the majority concluded that these facts do not raise a material question of fact about whether prejudged the merits of the suit because they were exposed to a litigation review that included a less than in depth discussion of the motion to dismiss the dissent the dissent viewed those facts differently according to justice valihura the record shows more than just mere presence on the board when the 2016 motion was filed rather the motion to dismiss was discussed with the board and no director objected to its filing one slc member specifically stated that he did not object to its filing the logical conclusion is that the board at least tacitly approved and authorized filing the 2016 motion after that discussion the 2016 motion was obviously authorized by someone given that a corporation acts through its board of directors and given that the motion was the subject of a board discussion the record suggests that the board authorized it justice valihura also rejected as irrelevant the possibility that the two slc members might not have read the motion to dismiss given that it is completely reasonable to conclude that they authorized the filing they should have known what they were authorizing justice valihura therefore concluded that the slc had not satisfied its burden of proving its independence implications reading the majority opinion one cannot help wondering whether the slc was saved by the vagueness of the minutes of the board meeting by the lack of evidence of an actual board vote on whether to file the motion to dismiss and by the slc members lack of memory of details of the board meeting but inasmuch as independence decisions depend on the facts of a particular case another court could interpret similar events differently the dissent raises the common sense point that corporate decisions must be authorized by individuals and those individuals might include board members accordingly a court might conclude that where a litigation matter including a potential responsive motion was discussed at a board meeting and where a motion was then filed the board authorized the motion this potential tension between directors involvement in litigation decisions and the possible desire to preserve directors independence for purposes of an slc or a drc might cause corporations to give further consideration to how they handle derivative actions if as in the diep case the company moves to dismiss directors could be charged with having prejudged the merits if those directors are later needed to participate in an slc or a drc a company cannot necessarily escape this potential conflict by moving to dismiss only for lack of demand futility as el pollo loco did rather than on the merits the demand futility analysis will likely involve consideration of whether a majority of the board faced a substantial likelihood of liability a question that implicates the same underlying substantive issues involved in a motion to dismiss on the merits a corporation that wishes to create an slc or a drc after filing a motion to dismiss can avoid this potential dilemma by populating the committee with directors appointed after the underlying events occurred and after the motion to dismiss was filed as el pollo loco did with the third slc member whose independence was undisputed a corporation and board faced with a derivative suit might also choose to forgo an early motion to dismiss and instead to treat the complaint like a pre suit demand letter and to appoint a drc to investigate the allegations and make recommendations about how to proceed this approach would avoid allegations that drc members had prejudged the merits of the claims through a prior motion to dismiss although the drc members would still need to be independent under other standards such as not facing a substantial threat of liability although the vagueness of el pollo loco s board minutes and the lack of evidence about the substance of the board s discussion might have saved the slc members in the diep case it would probably be unwise to conclude that boards should strive for vague skeletal generalized minutes of board meetings many other considerations militate in favor of providing details about what boards discuss and determine for example the desire to establish and document that board members engaged in thorough informed deliberations and made reasoned business decisions board members frequently and not surprisingly are unable to recall the details of board meetings when called upon to do so in subsequent litigation often years later having a specific contemporaneous record usually can provide greater protection for board members than can generic recitations applicable to any board

don t wait until an employee or customer overdoses on opioids at your business to consider implementing a workplace naloxone program naloxone is a life saving opioid overdose treatment that is administered as a nasal spray and is commonly known by its brand name narcan in 2018 the u s surgeon general called for workplaces and businesses to stock narcan and train their employees on administering the nasal spray just as many employers already do for cpr defibrillators and epipens since then some employers have voluntarily incorporated naloxone training into their workplace safety programs this article discusses several considerations employers should assess before deciding to implement naloxone training the article does not discuss policies and procedures governing workplace administration of naloxone though venable can and does assist with developing them into workplace safety programs assessing the need for a naloxone program employers should consider the likelihood of an opioid overdose occurring in the workplace or on workplace grounds before implementing a naloxone program factors to consider include open to the public businesses and places that are open to the public such as restaurants bars hotels malls theaters stadiums stores libraries and parks may encounter clients or customers on their premises who are experiencing an overdose offering naloxone training to service industry employees may save the lives of patrons and in turn lessen business disruptions and enhance the company s reputation in the community businesses and places that are open to the public such as restaurants bars hotels malls theaters stadiums stores libraries and parks may encounter clients or customers on their premises who are experiencing an overdose offering naloxone training to service industry employees may save the lives of patrons and in turn lessen business disruptions and enhance the company s reputation in the community industry the centers for disease control and prevention cdc has publicized that industries with high rates of workplace injuries such as construction transportation and warehousing have workers who are at higher risk of opioid addiction and higher opioid overdose death rates employees in those industries are sometimes initially prescribed opioids to manage pain arising from slips trips falls and heavy workloads which leads to misuse dependence and ultimately heroin use the cdc has also publicized that rates are higher in occupations with lower availability of paid sick leave and lower job security the centers for

location the opioid crisis is severe in most parts of the country employers who decide that it isn t that bad in the areas where they operate should reevaluate their decision periodically because rates are constantly changing employers can obtain solid opioid use abuse overdose and overdose death data from the cdc s website for example the cdc even has a color coded map of prescription opioid dispensing rates by county across the united states so that employers can contemplate potential future trends the opioid crisis is severe in most parts of the country employers who decide that it isn

data from the cdc s website for example the cdc even has a color coded map of prescription opioid dispensing rates by county across the united states so that employers can contemplate potential future trends past evidence of drug use on site if there has been evidence of opioid drug use on your workplace grounds in the past such as finding drugs needles or other paraphernalia that is a factor that weighs in favor of implementing a naloxone training program naloxone access laws employers should also consider the liability and legal implications of integrating naloxone training into their workplace safety programs all 50 states and the district of columbia have some form of naloxone access law naloxone access laws vary significantly by state and cover a broad range of topics from immunity for individuals prescribing dispensing and or administering naloxone to naloxone in schools and laws applying to health insurers aspects of naloxone access laws that employers should evaluate include the level of immunity provided to laypersons who administer naloxone any training education requirements before a person can administer naloxone and whether an individual can obtain naloxone without a prescription good samaritan laws a majority of states and the district of columbia have enacted good samaritan laws that specifically protect laypersons who administer naloxone in good faith in an emergency from both civil and criminal liability other states provide only civil immunity and a few provide only criminal immunity for states like delaware and south dakota that do not have a naloxone specific good samaritan law the state s general good samaritan law would still apply to aiding someone suffering an overdose narcan related litigation tends to be brought against healthcare providers for failure to administer narcan and indeed venable s review of the caselaw did not turn up a single case against a good samaritan moreover the theoretical risk of such liability is minimal considering that side effects from naloxone are very rare and allergic reactions to naloxone are very uncommon indeed the cdc has said that even if the cause of unconsciousness is uncertain giving naloxone is not likely to cause further harm to a person and only in rare cases would naloxone cause acute opioid withdrawal symptoms overall the life saving benefits of using naloxone during an overdose far outweigh the risk of litigation training several states including maryland require individuals to receive training before administering naloxone local health departments and community based organizations usually provide the training free of charge upon request training typically covers overdose recognition safe naloxone administration procedures and potential side effects possession one of the more practical concerns for employers that want to implement naloxone training is how to obtain the narcan nasal spray in the first place in most states a person can purchase naloxone at a pharmacy over the counter without a prescription in those states where a prescription is still required doctors or pharmacists may initiate third party prescriptions for family members friends or other individuals who may have contact with at risk users employers in certain industries or that have businesses open to the public may satisfy this latter category furthermore if you choose to have employees participate in a health department sponsored training program narcan kits are usually distributed to participants conclusion employers should consider implementing a naloxone program for the safety of their employees and the public the content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances

applying these four principles can help you avoid costly mistakes in this bear market the stock market can be a scary place when it starts to decline rapidly it can have you questioning if it s even worth it to invest in stocks and yet despite the dozens of bear markets throughout history stocks have created over 47 trillion in wealth for shareholders dating back to 1926 an investor who has been a huge recipient of that wealth creation is vice chairman of berkshire hathaway charlie munger consider these four munger anecdotes to help you be a better investor during this beaten down market 1 avoid making dumb mistakes instead of trying to be smart most investors try to make money by outsmarting the market but in most cases that s a lowercase fool s errand after all some of the smartest people in the world work on wall street with seemingly unlimited resources at their disposal and have a hard time doing it charlie munger however understands that successful investing has more to do with avoiding dumb mistakes saying it is remarkable how much long term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid instead of trying to be very intelligent the stock market is one of the few places where you can be above average by simply making average level headed decisions over a long period of time you don t need to be a genius you just need to avoid mistakes especially in a bear market if you can avoid errors like selling stocks at the bottom chasing hype stocks without doing research or trying to time the market you ll set yourself up for exceptional returns over the long run 2 the quality of the business is more important than the price in 1994 munger delivered a speech at the university of southern california marshall school of business saying over the long term it s hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns if the business earns 6 on capital over 40 years and you hold it for that 40 years you re not going to make much different than a 6 return even if you originally buy it at a huge discount conversely if a business earns 18 on capital over 20 or 30 years even if you pay an expensive looking price you ll end up with one hell of a result with the market punishing richly priced stocks as of late it s easy to become overly focused on the fair value price while ignoring the quality of the underlying asset apple exemplifies this perfectly the tech giant has rarely traded at a cheap price and yet has rewarded investors handsomely over the years largely due to its impressive return on invested capital roic which has hovered around 20 for over a decade the price of stocks certainly matters but it needs to be analyzed in the context of other performance metrics like roic high roic stocks at an expensive price will likely outperform low roic stocks that are cheap remember a cheap price doesn t automatically equal a good investment oftentimes stocks trade at a discount for a reason 3 diversification is great up to a point another munger quote to glean wisdom from in this bear market is the idea of excessive diversification is madness the topic of diversification can be a confusing one most of us tend to think of it as a universally good practice and don t get me wrong it s incredibly important for successful investing but there is a danger in over diversifying as you add more stocks to your portfolio it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of them you also lower your potential upside eventually approaching the average returns of the market if your risk tolerance is such that you need to own hundreds of stocks in your portfolio to sleep at night you re probably better off foregoing individual stock picking and investing in low cost index funds instead diversifying your portfolio is still one of the pillars of long term investing but munger is warning about the cost of using over diversification as a crutch you shouldn t simply buy numerous stocks to avoid being knowledgeable on the companies you own 4 focus on the micro instead of the macro both warren buffett and charlie munger have consistently stated their lack of interest in making investment decisions around the macroeconomic environment over the years they ve made dozens of statements like this one from munger gigantic macroeconomic predictions are something i ve never made any money on and neither has warren the macro environment is incredibly difficult to predict and can change on a dime even the best economists in the world consistently get their forecasts and predictions wrong even the international monetary fund imf concluded this in a 2018 study of how well economists forecast recessions where they found experts missed their predications by a wide margin however regardless of the macroeconomic conditions great businesses will continue to execute at a high level and return profits to investors over the long run stay consistent these four mungerisms are good advice for all market environments but especially relevant right now as investors tend to make catastrophic errors during bearish periods if you can simply avoid big mistakes such as over diversification focusing solely on price or timing the market around the macroeconomy you will do incredibly well over the long run

gov gavin newsom on thursday signed into law key elements of a new 307 9 billion state budget a spending plan centered on gas refunds for 17 5 million taxpayers to soften the sting of high fuel prices and the cost of living the refunds varying from as little as 200 for individuals up to 1 050 for couples with children are the hallmark of the state s effort to return a portion of an anticipated 101 4 billion surplus back to californians the governor and lawmakers also invested heavily in k 12 public education directed billions of dollars to secure enough power to keep the lights on during heat waves and earmarked 47 billion for infrastructure projects over the next three years this budget invests in our core values at a pivotal moment safeguarding women s right to choose expanding health care access to all and supporting the most vulnerable among us while shoring up our future with funds to combat the climate crisis bolster our energy grid transform our schools and protect communities newsom said in a statement advertisement the budget covers the 2022 23 fiscal year that begins friday it s a period in which economists warn that the russian invasion of ukraine interest rates and inflation could weaken the u s economy and lead to a recession that would surely dampen the record revenues california has received in recent years largely from income taxes paid by its highest earners the spending plan that newsom and lawmakers approved features a 17 billion relief package to help families seniors low income californians and small businesses the package includes 9 5 billion in gas refunds 1 4 billion in utility payment assistance expanded tax credits 250 million for paid sick leave grants a suspension of the sales tax on diesel fuel at a cost of 439 million to the state and 75 million in drought relief grants newsom and the legislature disagreed for months over income eligibility for gas refunds and how much californians should receive a debate that delayed the timeline to begin delivering payments until october many lawmakers wanted to direct more of the surplus to infrastructure funding which ultimately included a multiyear investment of 14 8 billion in transportation 2 billion for student housing through 2025 more specific projects in their home districts and other spending priorities the governor compromised with lawmakers on the final refund plan giving up his push to offer money exclusively to drivers the legislature agreed to increase the income limits it had initially proposed while preserving its original intent to give higher payments to families who earn less money california deal reached on plan for more than 9 billion in gas refunds to california drivers gov gavin newsom and leaders of the california legislature have agreed to provide more than 9 billion in refunds to taxpayers to offset high gas prices and inflation the deal comes after months of slow negotiations at the state capitol and disagreement between democrats over how much relief to offer the plan provides refunds on a sliding scale based on three income levels single tax filers who earn up to 75 000 or joint filers who report as much 150 000 individuals with income up to 125 000 or couples up to 250 000 and single filers who make 250 000 or 500 000 for joint filers the lowest income bracket is eligible for 350 per tax filer and another 350 for those who claim at least one dependent respective payments drop to 250 for the middle income level and 200 for the highest the plan leaves out the state s top earners and those at the very bottom who don t make enough money to file taxes to help some but not all those who don t file taxes the budget boosts supplemental security income grants by about 39 a month for individuals and 100 for couples on jan 1 starting in october calworks grants for low income families will also increase by 21 lawmakers said in any year this would be a great budget said senate president pro tem toni atkins d san diego in a world where we re facing global inflation and ongoing pandemic issues this budget is as remarkable and is responsible but as the budget broadens the safety net anti poverty advocates said the state can and should do more with its surplus to help its most vulnerable residents calling for further expansion of eligibility for tax credits and food benefits the budget sets aside 1 5 billion over two years in bridge housing for individuals experiencing homelessness and serious mental illness 300 million in the upcoming year for local government encampment grants and billions toward affordable housing programs to help first time home buyers the budget provides 500 million to establish the california dream for all program to offer assistance with down payments and lower monthly mortgage costs even with these important programs there is still a lot of work to do to uplift disadvantaged communities to upset the setup and make sure prosperity is ubiquitous assemblymember isaac bryan d los angeles said last week at the first meeting of the legislature s select committee on poverty and economic inclusion the committee was established earlier this year to focus policy on the state s widening wealth gap the state is grappling with a crisis of homeless californians and the highest child poverty rates in the u s when adjusted for cost of living just as it celebrates the record state surplus these stark differences are hard to tolerate in the fifth largest economy in the world in a state with more millionaires and billionaires than anybody else bryan said jerry nickelsburg director of the ucla anderson forecast and a professor of economics said california continues to see fewer jobs in retail one of several low income service sectors hardest hit in the 2020 recession compared with before the pandemic across the income spectrum there s a disparity as to where the pain is he said the state economy is expected to continue to grow faster than the u s in the upcoming year based on strength in logistics the recovery of the leisure and hospitality sector the tech industry and an expected increase in demand for construction and infrastructure work nickelsburg said but california similar to the rest of the nation could be vulnerable if the federal reserve tightens rates again as expected if financial markets continue to take a hit there could be fewer ipos stock option exercises and the kinds of bonuses for executives that boost the income of wealthy earners and the state s income tax revenue he said nickelsburg said the state s 37 2 billion in general fund reserves should serve as a backup contingency fund in the event of a limited pullback in the financial markets state officials expect california s rainy day fund to increase to 23 3 billion by year s end california will pay down debt including 1 billion over two years toward a 17 8 billion federal loan that the state used to fill a hole left by a surge in unemployment claims during the worst of the pandemic the department of finance said the budget also estimates supplemental payments to reduce state retirement liabilities of 3 4 billion in 2022 23 several lawmakers crowed over investments in education and what they described as a 4 3 billion increase for school districts and charter schools above the cost of living adjustment under the local control funding formula proclaiming the spending plan would boost california s abysmal ranking in per pupil funding a controversial budget bill to make it easier to secure emergency electricity supplies received less praise particularly from environmentalists several lawmakers with a track record of supporting climate policies were clearly torn on the measure acknowledging that it s imperative for the state to ensure electricity runs during heat waves but lamenting that california will rely on fossil fuels and loosen its environmental protections to do so the budget also breaks a long stalemate between newsom and assembly democrats over high speed rail funding lawmakers agreed to release 4 2 billion in proposition 1a funds to the california high speed rail authority prioritizing 2 billion for the construction of the merced to bakersfield segment with a new independent office of inspector general providing oversight of the project most of the spending for new programs in the 2022 23 state budget is dedicated on a one time basis with a promise of funding for only one year a downturn could threaten the ability to fund those programs again next year economic turmoil could also jeopardize budget commitments newsom and lawmakers have pledged to support in the future such as expansions slated for 2024 of medi cal coverage to all eligible californians regardless of immigration status and of the cal grant financial aid program to make about 150 000 more california college students eligible for state support to cover tuition and living expenses we are in a time of heightened uncertainty nickelsburg said there s more political uncertainty today there s more economic uncertainty today and that means that while we are looking for california to continue to grow albeit at a slower rate than it grew last year there is more uncertainty about that forecast times staff writers mackenzie mays and melody gutierrez contributed to this report from sacramento teresa watanabe and sammy roth contributed from los

liberal think tank no matter what those with money will end up being fine he said the combined fortunes of the 16 richest crypto billionaires exceeded 135 billion in march forbes estimated as of this week the total was about 76 billion but most of the loss was suffered by a single billionaire changpeng zhao ceo of the crypto exchange binance whose 65 billion fortune shrank to 17 4 billion cameron and tyler winklevoss whose wealth stood at 4 billion apiece before the crash were each worth 3 3 billion this week according to forbes they declined to comment the smaller people get taken advantage of for retail investors like ben thompson 33 the reality is different thompson who lives in sydney lost about 45 000 half his savings in the crash he had dabbled in crypto since 2018 and planned to use the money to open a brewery a lot of people who seemed quite reputable had a lot of confidence thompson said the smaller people get taken advantage of the uneven effects of the crash are evident even within crypto companies coinbase the largest crypto exchange in the united states went public in april 2021 when interest in digital currencies was surging as part of the company s public listing ceo brian armstrong sold nearly 300 million of stock in december he reportedly bought a 133 million estate in the los angeles neighbourhood of bel air in total six of coinbase s top executives have sold shares worth more than 850 million since april 2021 according to equilar which tracks executive compensation emilie choi the chief operating officer has reaped about 235 million while surojit chatterjee the chief product officer has sold 110 million in shares coinbase s stock which peaked at about 357 in november now trades at 51 this month as coinbase grappled with falling prices and declining consumer interest in crypto it laid off 18 per cent of its staff or about 1 100 workers armstrong said the company had over hired advertisement coinbase also rescinded hundreds of job offers some of those new hires had already quit their previous jobs or were relying on coinbase to maintain their work visas michael doss a product manager accepted a job at coinbase in may after months of interviews he had cancelled his lease and made arrangements to move to britain and join the company s london operation when coinbase took back the offer i have to unwind all that doss 33 said this is what i viewed as a career making move a coinbase spokesperson declined to comment on the layoffs and the rescinded offers she said that many of the share sales were part of the direct listing process and that executives maintain large positions in the company reflecting their commitment the crypto crash started in may when an experimental coin called terrausd lost almost all its value practically overnight taking down a sister digital currency luna as well its collapse devastated some retail traders who had spent their life savings on terrausd through anchor protocol a lending program that let investors deposit the coin and receive interest as high as 19 5 per cent terrausd was launched by terraform labs a startup that raised funding from venture capital firms including galaxy digital and lightspeed venture partners some of those investors cashed in before the project collapsed galaxy digital said in a filing before the crash that sales of its luna holdings were the largest contributor

announced that it was halting withdrawals as prices dropped gemini became the first major crypto firm to announce layoffs followed by blockfi crypto com and coinbase still unlike coinbase the vast majority of these crypto companies are privately held meaning their value is less tied to day to day price swings that has provided executives at some companies a measure of protection my personal net

million seven bedroom mansion in miami with a spa and an outdoor kitchen according to zillow he said he was trying to build a studio where the artists who work with moonpay can come to produce music it s almost like a hacker house he said it was a good investment the winklevosses began stockpiling bitcoin in 2012 when its price was hovering below 10 even after the crash it remains a hugely profitable investment for them bitcoin reached a peak of nearly 70 000 in november and is now closer to 20 000 in 2014 the winklevosses founded gemini and have since raised 400 million from investors

longstanding concerns on capitol hill about certain outbound activities conducted by u s companies and investors particularly in the technology sector both in china as well as outside of china with a china nexus have given rise to significant legislative developments this year background last summer a bipartisan group of seven senators led by senators bob casey d pa and john cornyn r tx introduced a bill called the national critical capabilities defense act nccda and a house companion bill was then introduced by a similar bipartisan group of members last december at its core the nccda would create a new federal interagency screening process with mandatory notifications to a committee for certain types of transactions and other activities by us companies that pose major risks to us critical capabilities some of the concerns behind the legislation are the same ones that congress considered in recent years during the debate on the foreign investment risk review modernization act which was enacted in 2018 and represented the most sweeping overhaul of the cfius process since its creation in 1975 after an unsuccessful attempt by the senate authors to add the nccda as an amendment to the senate s version of a large china focused competitiveness bill called the us innovation and competition act usica the house sponsors and their allies were able to tuck the nccda into the house s rival bill on competition with china the america competes act before that broader package was passed this past february now senate and house negotiators are ironing out the differences between the two packages in conference negotiations with over a hundred congressional committee leaders and other members having been appointed to lead the unwieldy discussions without question the nccda is one of the most active areas of debate perhaps because of its direct relevance to the aims of usica and the competes act which include strengthening crucial us supply chains spurring innovation in areas of emerging technology bolstering economic competitiveness with china and incentivizing domestic manufacturing and production of certain high demand technologies such as semiconductors on june 13 the bicameral bipartisan sponsors of the nccda floated an updated more focused discussion draft of the provisions to stakeholders in an effort to address specific concerns that had been raised about the original bill including its broad scope imprecise definitions feasibility of implementation and impacts on industry jurisdictional scope and definitions as the nccda s name suggests the updated legislation aims to strengthen the united states national critical capabilities namely by regulating certain covered activities that involve countries of concern or entities of concern below is an explanation of some of the draft legislation s key terms covered activity the discussion draft creates a new key term covered activities to lay out the scope of the new interagency committee s jurisdiction with each activity requiring a nexus with either a country of concern or an entity of concern initially there are three specific jurisdictional buckets which include any activity by a us person a foreign entity an affiliate of a us person or an affiliate of a foreign person that builds develops produces manufactures fabricates refurbishes expands shifts services manages operates utilizes sells or relocates a national critical capability to or in a country of concern shares discloses contributes transfers or licenses to an entity of concern any design technology intellectual property or know how including through open source technology platforms or research and development that supports contributes to or enables a national critical capability by an entity of concern or in a country of concern or invests in provides capital to or consults for or gives any guidance related to enhancing the capabilities or facilitating access to financial resources for a national critical capability for an entity of concern or a country of concern the first jurisdictional bucket above is driven principally by concerns over the long term future of the us industrial base especially in the areas of technology and manufacturing and the potential for additional offshoring to china the second is driven mainly by congressional frustrations based on the view that our dual use export control system has not done enough to stop the transfer of us intellectual property and related know how to china and the third bucket is motivated by the ongoing flows of us capital into chinese companies in key technology areas the term covered activities would also create two other areas of jurisdiction for the interagency committee first since the broader bills elsewhere would provide billions of dollars of funding to incentivize the domestic manufacture of semiconductors the discussion draft also covers any activity in a country of concern by a recipient of such federal funding even those activities not directly dealing with national critical capabilities finally the updated bill covers activities undertaken in countries of concern by companies that do contract work above a yet undefined monetary threshold with any us national security agency which presumably includes all major u s defense and intelligence contractors the updated bill makes a slew of other changes and clarifications to the legislation and many though not all of them have been quietly applauded by stakeholders a series of new jurisdictional exceptions labeled ordinary business transactions has been added to the bill to carve out routine benign commercial activity similarly the draft proposes to add a de minimis threshold to avoid ensnaring smaller transactions that presumably would involve reduced risks as the debate over the nccda continues the proper scope of these exceptions is one key topic of discussion country of concern as mentioned the updated bill covers only activities in countries of concern which it defines by reference to another law the secure and trusted communications networks act of 2019 that law defined foreign adversary as any foreign government or entity engaged in a long term pattern or serious instances of conduct significantly adverse to the national security of the united states or security and safety of united states persons the updated bill adopts that definition in its entirety to define countries of concern and it also specifically categorizes china russia iran north korea cuba and venezuela as such countries entity of concern the discussion draft also targets some outbound activities involving entities of concern this term is defined as any entity influenced by or affiliated directly or indirectly with a country of concern notably the definition of affiliated has caused some confusion and concern for stakeholders due to its breadth and ambiguity under the updated nccda an entity is considered affiliated with a country of concern if it meets any of the following criteria five percent or more of voting stock or shares is owned or controlled by the country or by an entity influenced by that country it is substantially influenced by a country of concern or by an entity that is itself influenced by that country it is located in a country of concern and shares a high level employee with an entity influenced by that country high level decisions can be made by a country of concern or by an entity influenced by that country it is part of an entity headquartered in a country of concern it is domiciled in a country of concern and either receives or divulges the following types of information to an entity influenced by a country of concern us trade secrets intelligence information national security information controlled unclassified information or sensitive information it is entirely domiciled in a country of concern and influenced by a national of that country or the committee on national critical capabilities described below designates it as an entity of concern national critical capabilities another central definition in the updated bill is national critical capabilities which now includes supply chains in sectors identified pursuant to executive order but specifically including semiconductors large capacity batteries critical minerals and materials pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients technologies identified by the director of national intelligence as critical including in the fields of artificial intelligence bioeconomics and quantum science sectors identified in the white house national science and technology council s february 2022 critical and emerging technologies list and any other industries technologies and supply chains identified in the future by the committee on national critical capabilities which the nccda establishes ordinary business transactions as mentioned the discussion draft also creates a series of carve outs under the term ordinary business transactions which include the sale or license of a finished item along with associated support to the customer the sale or license of a product if the united states person generally makes such services available to all of its customers the transfer of any equipment that could not result in a foreign person using the equipment to produce critical technology and the acquisition by an american of any good or service from a non us person who has no rights to exploit any intellectual property contributed by us persons the updated bill also gives the interagency committee the ability to carve out additional ordinary business transactions in the future federal review process for covered outbound activities establishment of committee on national critical capabilities the updated bill would create the interagency committee the committee on national critical capabilities with the authority to review and if needed block covered outbound activities that fall under the definition of covered activity while the draft proposal does not specify which agency would serve as chair the committee would comprise one representative each from the departments of commerce state treasury homeland security defense justice energy health and human services agriculture and labor as well as the office of the united states trade representative and the white house office of science and technology there would also be nine other federal agencies as non voting ex officio members of the committee notification and interagency review process were the updated bill to become law any us person or foreign entity that plans to engage in a covered activity would have to give written notice to the committee at least 45 days before the activity commences once notice is received the committee would have the discretionary authority to conduct a review of the activity to screen for any unacceptable risks to national critical capabilities the committee would be required to conduct a review upon congress request it could also initiate a review on its own authority section 1005 of the draft bill contains a non exhaustive list of five factors that the committee must consider in the review process us economic national security intelligence military health and agricultural interests the history of distortive or predatory trade practices in each country in which a covered activity occurs control and beneficial ownership of each foreign person that is a party to the transaction impact on the domestic industry and resulting resiliency and whether the activity could directly or indirectly support enhance or enable the capabilities of a country of concern or entity of concern addressing risks to national critical capabilities the updated bill contemplates three main ways that the committee may address risks to national critical capabilities first if the committee determines through its review process that a covered activity poses unacceptable risk it can recommend that the president take certain actions the president would have a 15 day window after the review process concludes to announce his her intended actions which could include mitigating prohibiting or suspending the covered activity the president could also direct the attorney general to seek appropriate relief in a federal court further the president could exercise existing authorities granted under laws such as the export control reform act international emergency economic powers act or defense production act second the committee could make legislative proposals to congress to establish or expand federal programs which bolster national critical capabilities within the united states and third the committee would be authorized to negotiate enter into and enforce agreements with parties involved in covered activities in order to mitigate risks to national critical capabilities these negotiations should involve the lead agency under whose jurisdiction the covered activity falls the committee s authority to enter negotiated agreements would extend to covered activities that are pending voluntarily abandoned or completed other powers and obligations of the committee the updated bill would require the committee to prescribe implementing regulations for the new law notably the committee would be authorized to impose civil penalties of up to 250 000 for violating any provision of the statute including failure to give timely complete and truthful notice of a covered activity or an agreement negotiated by the committee the committee would be required to study and identify supply chain sensitivities for national critical capabilities as part of this analysis the committee would categorize goods materials and technology according to whether their sourcing is of least concern supply chains housed wholly within us allied countries greater concern supply chains involve countries or entities of concern but substitute production is available elsewhere or greatest concern supply chains in part or in whole involve countries or entities of concern with no available substitute production finally the committee chair would be charged with engaging with representatives from us allied countries to develop tools that address covered activities with countries or entities of concern in a coordinated multilateral and strategic fashion key takeaways and the big picture the new nccda discussion draft represents a good faith effort by key members of congress eager to assert their relevance on international trade national security and geoeconomics as a constitutionally co equal branch of government to address real and legitimate concerns by stakeholders in industry the executive branch and elsewhere nonetheless us companies and investors that currently conduct covered outbound activities should closely monitor the progress of the nccda the evolving bill s language though narrowed and clarified in key places has been read by many to still capture a large swath of activities abroad the scope of the term covered activity is particularly broad for example considering the enumerated ways in which an entity may be deemed affiliated with a country of concern many us enterprises may be unknowingly engaged in covered activities potentially creating both uncertainty and regulatory risk if the nccda is enacted in its current form businesses might need to comprehensively review all of their current and future foreign transactions and supply chains so as to minimize the risk of noncompliance lastly while the legislative outlook for the nccda as well as the broader usica and the competes act is cloudy stakeholders can be assured that the issues underlying this bipartisan bill are unlikely to go away anytime soon the us china rivalry continues to heat up and it is likely to last decades and both the covid pandemic and russia s invasion of ukraine have turned up the spotlight on supply chain problems and challenging economic inter dependencies involving foreign adversary nations as a result the regulatory processes and tools of the us government will continue to evolve and us companies

vulnerable democrat rep vicente gonzalez d tx appears to have violated a federal conflict of interest law known as the stock act of 2012 by waiting almost a year to disclose a stock trade according to business insider business insider reported that gonzalez sold between 1 000 and 15 000 in stock of freeport mcmoran on july 24 2021 but waited to report it until june 27 of this year according to his most recent filed congressional financial disclosure this gives the appearance that he violated the stock act like every lawmaker the congressman must submit a periodic transaction report with the clerk in the house of representatives within 30 to 45 days of stock transactions over 1 000 made on behalf of themselves or their spouses under the stock act freeport mcmoran is a phoenix based mining company that operates seven open pit copper mines in the united states and has other mining operations in chile peru and indonesia its website stated interestingly in recent months gonzalez has made mining an issue he s appeared to be working on as a lawmaker in april he introduced the rare act which aimed to develop a reliable domestic supply of critical minerals rare earth elements and to uncouple our supply lines and dependence on china for national security manufacturing raw materials in may months after he sold his stock and months before he filed his most recent financial disclosure he introduced legislation banning uranium imports from russia the u s has the resources and capacity to produce uranium here at home and should no longer rely on foreign dictators gonzalez stated in a press release i urge our colleagues to support this legislation stand in solidarity with ukraine and unleash american energy texans are struggling to get by but vicente gonzalez sure isn t as he pockets big checks breaks federal conflict of interest laws and tries to hide it from voters congressional leadership fund press secretary cally perkins hammered in a statement vicente is only ever looking out for himself but texans deserve a congressman that will put them first in 2012 congress quickly passed the stock act and signed it into law it received substantial bipartisan support in both chambers the legislation was introduced and promptly signed into law thanks to breitbart news senior contributor peter schweizer who in 2011 released throw them all out exposing corruption in the highest echelons of elected life schweizer s book which exposed house speaker nancy pelosi d ca and many others revealed corruption concerns among republicans and democrats on capitol hill forcing congress into adopting the stock act that implemented stricter reporting and ethics requirements additionally breitbart news exclusively reported in march 2021 that the congressman provided disclosure statements for 2017 2018 and 2019 on holdings with the bank of china which fully acknowledges itself as a wholly state owned commercial bank and has been since the mid 1990s between 100 001 and 250 000 it also revealed that he was getting interest from the bank totaling between 2 501 and 5 000 each year nonetheless not only did the money with the bank of china raise questions but the amount of interest the congressman was receiving at the time did as well gonzalez reportedly had between 250 001 and 500 000 in at least two other banks in which he received no interest in one and collected only between 201 and 1 000 in interest in the other at the time gonzalez refused to do any interview with breitbart news after multiple requests nor with his local news stations which raised many questions about the congressman from his constituents however after the reports of the congressman having money in the state owned commercial bank of china gonzalez closed his accounts news 4 san antonio reported press secretary jason johnson told news 4 san antonio that the bank of china is insured and operating under u s laws johnson also told the news 4 san antonio the congressman has closed that account jacob bliss is a reporter for breitbart news write to him at jbliss breitbart com or follow him on twitter jacobmbliss
by keita nakamura kyodo news jul 1 2022 10 47 all japan with russia s war on ukraine setting alarm bells ringing in japan about an assertive china the defense budget has become one of the key issues in the house of councillors election on july 10 polls show that the public is split on an increase in defense spending with a kyodo news survey conducted from sunday to tuesday showing 47 8 percent of voters think the budget should be expanded to 2 percent or higher of the gross domestic product as the ruling liberal democratic party has suggested while 45 8 percent want spending to stay as it is or cut but defense experts warn that the government should deepen discussions on how to go about strengthening defense capabilities needed to respond to potential threats instead of making an issue of setting a specific numerical target the ldp included in its campaign a pledge to raise the defense budget to 2 percent or more of the gdp following russia s invasion of ukraine japanese people have grown to more realistically perceive threats from china and north korea as fears grew that the war in europe could sway beijing to take a forceful approach to reunifying with taiwan and pyongyang to step up military provocation to have its political and economic demands met said nobumasa akiyama dean of school of international and public policy at hitotsubashi university prime minister fumio kishida said at a three day group of seven major developed nations summit in germany through tuesday that the g 7 must prevent any nation from drawing wrong lessons from the war in ukraine according to a japanese government official apparently with china s intensifying military activities in mind referring to repeated intrusions by chinese vessels into waters near the tokyo controlled beijing claimed senkaku islands and gas field exploration by china in a contested area in the east china sea kishida was quoted by the official as saying that unilateral changes of the status quo will never be tolerated pyongyang has repeatedly test fired ballistic missiles toward the sea of japan since the start of this year and there are signs the reclusive state is preparing for its first nuclear test since 2017 pledging to address these security challenges the kishida led ldp plans an increase in defense spending over the next five years with an eye to a hike to a level in line with the north atlantic treaty organization nations target of 2 percent or more of their gdp known for its pacifist constitution japan has long capped its annual defense budget at around 1 percent of gdp or about 5 trillion yen 37 billion the party also vows to enable japan to acquire controversial counterstrike capabilities in view of pyongyang s ballistic missile threats those policies are expected to be written in the new national security strategy which the government will update by the year end even some opposition parties argue that defense capabilities should be reinforced with kenta izumi leader of the main opposition constitutional democratic party of japan saying the defense budget may have to be increased izumi however criticized kishida for advocating a sharp defense spending hike without proposing how it should be financed akiyama said the fact that some parties support a defense buildup apparently suggests that security issues are becoming more of a political issue japan has no choice but to strengthen its deterrent against them china and north korea while pursuing dialogue he said sanae takaichi the ldp s policy chief has said the biggest issues in the election this time is foreign policy and national security takaichi has also said that expanding defense spending to as much as 2 percent of gdp makes sense since it will send a strong message to other countries of japan s resolution to defend people s lives and its territory at any cost akiyama says setting a numerical target is an understandable political tactic to maintain momentum for expanding defense outlays but it still raises questions as to why the party is talking about a specific level of budget increase without holding adequate discussions about which defense capabilities need to be strengthened and how hideki uemura a ryutsu keizai university professor said setting such a target would potentially lead the government to constantly request the maximum amount and even buy unnecessary equipment to use up the budget uemura is also critical of the ldp s plan of obtaining counterstrike capabilities which could include long range cruise missiles whether or not the use of a weapon can be called counterstrike just depends on the timing it is used so such capabilities could be used for a preemptive strike too said uemura adding the act of acquiring the capabilities itself could possibly end up only provoking chinese president xi jinping and north korean leader kim jong un almost doubling the defense budget from the current level will be a tall order for the japanese government already mired in long term debt of more than 1 000 trillion yen the ldp s takaichi has said the defense budget increase would be initially financed by new government bond issues akiyama expects that if russia s war in ukraine prolongs public interest could further shift from national security to the war s economic impact on japan given such sharp inflation and the yen s recent depreciation people would possibly become negative about raising defense costs he said related coverage focus japan s perilously low birthrate a forgotten election issue focus rising prices key focus in election but no party has silver bullet japan s ruling ldp holds highest preelection support at 28 poll
