image goldman sachs is the most prominent wall street bank to make a broad vaccine requirement credit brendan mcdermid reuters goldman sachs told employees on tuesday that it will require anyone who enters the bank s u s offices including clients to be fully vaccinated starting on sept 7 making it the most prominent wall street bank to issue such a broad requirement the announcement in a memo obtained by the new york times came a day after the food and drug administration gave full approval for the pfizer biontech vaccine a move that many large corporations had been seeking before making mandates president biden seized on the f d a s approval urging private businesses to protect their workers through vaccinations if you re a business leader a nonprofit leader a state or local leader who has been waiting for full f d a approval to require vaccinations i call on you now to do that the president said on monday require it companies have been consulting with advisers for months about whether to mandate vaccines but have been wary of employee pushback and potential litigation the quick spread of the highly contagious delta variant and prominent first moves by large corporations like walmart and the walt disney company helped to expedite those talks now the f d a approval on monday has finally given them some assurances they need to move forward goldman sachs told employees on tuesday that anyone in the united states who is not fully vaccinated by sept 7 must work from home it will also require fully vaccinated employees to undergo weekly coronavirus testing the bank which employs roughly 20 000 in the united states is reinstating mask requirements throughout office common areas as of wednesday at offices in san francisco and washington masks will be required at all times except while someone is eating or drinking other wall street banks have similar requirements citigroup said this month that it would require vaccinations for employees returning to its corporate offices in the new york area this fall and morgan stanley said in june that it would require all employees and visitors to its new york offices to be vaccinated jpmorgan chase has so far strongly encouraged but not required vaccinations for its work force the goldman sachs announcement followed several others this week on monday chevron said it was mandating vaccines for expats and employees who travel internationally as well as for the offshore work force in the gulf of mexico and for some onshore support personnel cvs health said its pharmacists have until nov 30 to be fully vaccinated while others who interact with patients and all corporate staff have until oct 31 disney cruise line said tuesday that it was requiring passengers over 12 years old to be fully vaccinated for sailings to the bahamas the f d a approval also gives industry groups grounds to encourage vaccinations from their members and lobby against legislation that may hinder those efforts the u s chamber of commerce announced this month that it would mandate vaccines for its work force once the f d a fully approved them the business roundtable an influential lobbying group said monday that it supported mandates many companies have made the decision to mandate vaccines for some or all of their employees and we applaud their decision the group led by the walmart chief executive doug mcmillon said in a statement we also encourage policymakers including at the state and local levels to support not impede companies ability to make such a decision at least three states montana texas and utah that had banned vaccine requirements by law or executive order did so specifically because the three vaccines used in the united states were being administered under emergency use authorizations not full approval some companies like norwegian cruise line in florida have resisted such prohibitions but most have largely stayed out of the fray so far over the past month there have been signs that companies are showing an increased appetite for vaccine mandates earlier this month united parcel service said that any employee returning to an office that serves a support function must be fully vaccinated or have received one shot with a second scheduled by oct 1 the policy does not apply to workers in operational roles though they are being encouraged to get vaccinated as of aug 7 the share of job postings requiring vaccinations was up 90 percent from a month earlier according to the job search company indeed those that require vaccinations though are still a small fraction of the overall listings f d a authorization could also simplify negotiations with unions whose mixed stance toward mandates has contributed to a class divide among workers on monday disney world said unions representing more than 30 000 employees had agreed to a mandate citing the f d a s full approval that would require workers to be vaccinated by oct 22 but the united food and commercial workers international a union that represents around 1 3 million workers in grocery stores pharmacies and meatpacking plants warned on monday against mandates that did not take employees concerns into consideration with more employers considering vaccine mandates after this new f d a approval u f c w continues to urge all businesses to negotiate any vaccine requirements with their frontline workers the union s president marc perrone said the union had previously cited concerns about lack of regulatory approval in its negotiations with tyson foods over the meatpacker s decision to require its entire work force to get vaccinated unions and other industry groups are grappling with continued hesitancy about the shot in a recent poll three out of 10 unvaccinated people said they would be more likely to get a fully approved f d a shot but some experts believe that this figure could be exaggerated some companies that previously cited approval status for the vaccines had no updates to share as of tuesday it s very difficult for us to come in and mandate a vaccine that isn t even federally approved yet the chief executive of delta air lines ed bastian told cnbc this month so stay tuned a spokesman for the airline told the times that the airline s plans were status quo mandating vaccines for new hires and strongly encouraging them for existing employees more regulatory action that could make vaccines easier to mandate is coming moderna s application for full approval of its vaccine was filed in june a month after pfizer s johnson johnson is expected to apply for full approval soon the f d a is also weighing whether to authorize booster shots for the fully vaccinated another twist for corporate vaccine mandates niraj chokshi and daniel e slotnik contributed reporting

for closing comments and annual outlook mike baur chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve in a press release earlier today we announced the retirement of longtime director jack reilly and the appointment of charlie mathis to our board of directors this is a well deserved thank you to jack for 20 years of service and a welcome back to the company for charlie from 2012 to 2016 charlie served as scansource s cfo and he was instrumental in crafting the strategy that resulted in our intelisys acquisition as we exit fy 21 with such momentum we are increasingly more confident of the growth and valuation creation opportunity ahead for scansource in the past we have provided quarterly financial guidance and we were always explaining to our investors that our hardware distribution business works with limited visibility without bookings or backlog however with the change in our business to a hybrid model where we have more recurring revenue each year and the growing attach rate of our services and software to our hardware sales we have decided to provide an annual outlook for the first time for fiscal year 2022 we expect our year over year net sales growth to be at least 5 5 and we expect adjusted ebitda to be at least 135 million this compares to last year of 118 million finally we are pleased to announce our 100 million share repurchase authorization that reflects the board s continued confidence in our strategic plan we will now open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from keith housum of northcoast research your line is open keith housum northcoast research analyst good afternoon guys and great job question for you on the inventory levels inventory levels were roughly equal to last year we re seeing this as kind of surprising based on the supply constraints that we re seeing on the overall market can you talk to the quality of your inventory levels and any insight you have in terms of the supply chain constraints as you look into the first quarter mike baur chairman and chief executive officer yes hey keith thanks for your question good to hear your voice i think as it relates to supply chain look i would have to say that i m really pleased with the work we ve done and what we ve had to do to navigate the environment over the past several quarters and i have to hand it to our sales and our head of our supplier services and purchasing teams for doing what i really think was an outstanding job dealing with the environment we managed inventory well over the past two three quarters and i believe that we ll be able to continue to navigate the environment moving forward keith housum northcoast research analyst now would you say that your sales were impacted by your inability to obtain any products steve jones senior executive vice president and chief financial officer not really nothing that negligible if anything keith housum northcoast research analyst got you and then you guys had issued guidance for probably second quarter of 2020 if my memory is correct would you say that you guys have increased i guess confidence in your ability to forecast but i think it was one of the issues that guys were citing as why you didn t provide guidance mike baur chairman and chief executive officer hi keith it s mike yes we certainly spent a lot of time over the last few quarters making sure we can understand what is driving our growth for the last four quarters and going forward and we really believe we ve gotten a significant advantage now having recurring revenue become a bigger part of our business and the attachment of recurring revenue services and software to hardware makes that transaction stickier than it was in the past so we believe we have more confidence and then secondly if you remember we really restructured the sales organization a year and a half two years ago and i think what john and his team have done this past year to better develop a relationship both in a transactional basis but more importantly strategic so that our customers are spending a lot more time talking to us about their planned purchases where they re going to grow what areas and this relationship that has really dramatically changed over the last year is also enabling us to do our business more efficiently back to your inventory question and so we have better knowledge of what our customers see coming than ever before and i think that s a big change and what gives me a lot more confidence it still doesn t mean just for the record that we re going to have this thing perfectly done this is our attempt at a longer term outlook we believe quarterly was just always really hard and still can be because we still will have some seasonality in our business but we believe providing this first annual outlook which by the way will update quarterly will be a way for us to show our confidence in our business keith housum northcoast research analyst got you i appreciate it i m going to jump into the queue questions mike baur chairman and chief executive officer thank keith operator thank you our next question comes from chris mcginnis of sidoti and company your line is open chris mcginnis sidoti and company analyst thanks for taking questions and nice quarter can you just touch on the market share gains you talked about is that sustainable and what s driving that is it the offering or the ability to get supply can you just dive into that a little bit more thank you john eldh senior executive vice president and chief revenue officer yes chris this is john thanks for the question yes the market share gains first of all i do think they are absolutely sustainable covid really was kind of an ignition point for digital transformation initiatives as you know all across the business and we play in many of the markets large and growing that impact people s path to digital and so yes we had some wins because we had some inventory which is great but more so than that we took share we drove big deals and we were able to execute really i think in large part too some of the things mike talked about in the reorganization of the sales organization a year and a half we re

traverse city mich ap scientists have traced the genetic makeup of lake trout a feat that should boost efforts to rebuild populations of the prized fish in the great lakes and other north american waters where they ve been hammered by invasive species overfishing and pollution officials said tuesday u s and canadian researchers completed a reference genome or digital genetic map for lake trout it will help explain characteristics that enabled the species to evolve and spread across its vast range with certain types becoming better suited to particular locations and depths the data also will provide vital information for managers of programs that stock lakes with young trout to supplement natural reproduction said marc gaden spokesman for the great lakes fishery commission lake trout are widely distributed across north america and there are huge variations in habitat use shape size body mass color gaden said we need to understand why they look the way they do why some types are more successful in some habitats than others why some types in hatcheries do better than others the team of experts with several u s and canadian universities and government agencies published their genome report aug 5 in the journal molecular ecology resources william taylor chairman of the fishery commission and a michigan state university fisheries ecologist described it as a vital missing link in our efforts to restore lake trout lake trout long dominated the great lakes as a predator fish and are common in other large north american lakes they sustained aboriginal tribes for generations and were a primary target of post settlement commercial fishing operations their numbers in the great lakes plummeted in the last century with the invasion of sea lamprey an eel like parasite that attaches to fish and sucks their bodily fluids researchers eventually developed a poison that is applied to tributary rivers where the lamprey spawn keeping them in check but habitat loss overfishing pollution and other invaders have hampered efforts to bring back the lake trout although they can live for decades it takes about seven years for them to become sexually mature and many don t survive long enough to reproduce agencies continue to stock them in all the great lakes except lake superior where the species has recovered well gaden said development of the reference genome should help managers fine tune those efforts the more you can understand what makes this organism tick the more you can do to take steps to rehabilitate it he said genomes of salmonids a family that includes lake trout are harder to compile than those of many other animals the research team said having a publicly available map of the lake trout genome removes most of the initial hurdles associated with doing conservation oriented genomic research makes it significantly easier to compare results across studies and will hopefully quicken the pace of scientific discovery said seth smith of michigan state university the study s lead author shawn sitar a fisheries research biologist with the michigan department of natural resources who wasn t involved with the study said returning lake trout to their historically influential role in the great lakes will require understanding differences between their types at the sub species level which the genome research will support we see them in different habitats functioning in ecologically different ways living differently sitar said if you want to restore a forest ecosystem you don t put in one just one tree you want to restore the integrity of what the ecosystem was originally john flesher the associated press

disclaimers on pages 45 47 chairman s statement introduction the rst half of 2021 continued to be a challenging time for the world as economies companies and individuals have had to adapt to the changes imposed on us by the global pandemic i am pleased to report that during this time psh s portfolio companies made substantial progress and we expect this positive performance to continue as economies recover vaccines are more widely distributed and we learn to live with the risk of covid 19 the investment manager believes that there may continue to be short term volatility in the markets and that there is likely to be an increase in interest rates to address rising in ation due to actions taken by the u s federal reserve the trillions of dollars of stimulus from the u s government and the unleashing of pent up global demand psh s current portfolio comprises nine companies that are well positioned for long term growth and one asymmetric macro economic hedge which will bene t psh if there is an increase in interest rates the investment manager believes that our portfolio is well structured to generate long term returns and to protect our investors from the potential risks of in ation i am also pleased to report that psh has recently made a signi cant new investment in universal music group umg the merits of this investment are set out in more detail in the investment manager s report but i would like to add that the psh board believes that umg is a high quality business which is extremely well placed to bene t from the structural changes that have taken place in the music industry and we endorse the view of the investment manager that this investment is likely to be a long term strategic holding for psh the investment manager initially intended for psh to invest in umg via pershing square tontine holdings psth in my previous letters i have discussed how the investment manager initiated a new position for psh by launching psth a special purpose acquisition company or spac psth raised 4 billion in its ipo on the new york stock exchange and psh pershing square l p and pershing square international ltd collectively the pershing square funds committed to contributing 1 billion with the option to increase their investment to 3 billion the forward purchase agreements a unique feature of psth is that the pershing square funds and not the investment manager own the spac sponsor on june 20 2021 psth announced that it entered into a de nitive agreement with vivendi s e pursuant to which psth would acquire approximately 10 of the outstanding ordinary shares of umg for approximately 4 billion as part of this transaction psh would have an investment of approximately 1 billion in umg however on july 19 2021 the board of psth determined not to proceed with the announced transaction because of issues raised by the securities and exchange commission regarding the structure of the proposed transaction the investment manager has discussed this in more detail in a letter available at www pstontine com and in these nancial statements as a result psh and the other pershing square funds and pershing affiliates were assigned the share purchase agreement on august 10 2021 the pershing square funds through a pershing affiliate acquired 128 555 017 ordinary shares of umg for 2 8 billion representing 7 1 of the company psh s share of the cash consideration was approximately 2 5 billion psh and the other pershing square funds and pershing affiliates have the right and intend to exercise the right to acquire an additional 2 9 of umg s ordinary shares at the same price per share by september 9 2021 psth will seek another company for its initial business combination and psh and the other pershing square funds will continue to hold investments in psth through the forward purchase agreements and their ownership of the spac sponsor these accounts are dated june 30 2021 at which time we believed that psh would invest in umg via psth the forward purchase agreements and psh s share of the spac sponsor comprising 332 million of level 3 assets out of psh s total market value of investments of 10 615 million or 3 1 were valued based on the structure of that transaction we have detailed the valuation mechanics utilized in respect of our psth investment as of june 30 in notes 5 and 6 of these nancial statements i note that our nav post july 19th re ects the valuation impact of the revised transaction comprised of an investment in umg and the original commitment to psth investment performance for the rst half of 2021 and year to date through august 17 2021 the company s nav per share including dividends increased by 7 3 and 5 8 i respectively and the company s share price increased by 4 7 and 2 0 ii respectively compared with the s p 500 which returned 15 2 and 19 5 over the same period iii our strategy is to generate long term capital returns so we view short term results in the context of the signi cant growth in our nav and share price over the past three years and the strong continued underlying performance of our portfolio companies all of psh s portfolio companies have positively contributed to the company s performance to date except fannie mae and freddie mac and psth which are discussed further in the investment manager s report portfolio changes in addition to the developments discussed above regarding umg psh disclosed that it exited its position in starbucks and initiated a position in domino s pizza during the rst half of 2021 and exited its position in agilent technologies after the end of the rst half the psh board was pleased to see that the investment manager continued to refresh the portfolio when market volatility created opportunities to reinvest in high quality companies at attractive prices discount to nav the board pays close attention to the discount to nav at which psh s public shares currently trade the discount as of august 17 2021 of 25 9 has not materially changed from 24 7 as of march 23 2021 when i last wrote to you iv the board holds the view that psh shares are undervalued at current levels and believes that continued positive nav performance increased awareness of psh and the associated incremental demand for psh shares should narrow the discount over time corporate governance board at our annual general meeting on april 28 2021 shareholders elected three new directors tope lawani rupert morley and tracy palandjian to join the psh board we now have seven non executive directors six of whom are independent of the investment manager the current board is the most diverse we have had since the inception of psh by any metric including race and gender diversity as chairman of the board i believe that a more diverse board will be a more effective board our diversity allows us to make better decisions for our shareholders and to provide more informed advice to our investment manager by drawing on a wider range of perspectives knowledge and experience i am grateful for the meaningful contributions made by all of our directors recent events on august 17 2021 a lawsuit was led against psth its sponsor and directors as well as the company and other affiliated entities claiming among other things that psth has been operating in the us as an illegal investment company we believe that this lawsuit is without merit but while it is unresolved it could impact the ability of psth to enter into a business combination the letter from the investment manager provides additional information about psth as well as a new proposed spac structure whereby investors receive long dated transferable warrants which will give them the right to invest in a future de spac transaction but they do not need to contribute capital at the time of the initial spac ipo this structure will need to be approved by the sec so there is no assurance that it will be implemented i look forward to reporting to you again in our 2021 annual report s anne farlow anne farlow chairman of the board august 24 2021 investment manager s report letter to shareholders to the shareholders of pershing square holdings ltd pershing square holdings generated solid performance during the rst half of 2021 and year to date as our nav total return per share increased 7 3 and 5 8 respectively compared with the s p s half year and year to date total return of 15 2 and 19 5 5 while we compare our performance with the s p 500 on a regular basis we do not expect to outperform the index during every measuring period rather we believe that over the long term psh will continue to outperform our benchmark investors who invested in pershing square l p at its inception on january 1 2004 and transferred their investment to psh at its inception on december 31 2012 have grown their equity investment at a 16 7 compounded annual return as of august 17 2021 compared with a 10 4 return had one invested in the s p 500 over the same period with the magic of compounding our 16 7 compound annual nav return translates into a cumulative total nav return since inception of 1 412 versus 471 for the s p 500 over the same period 6 our discount to nav however remains wide which has reduced shareholder returns for those who purchased shares at a smaller or no discount to nav our year to date results have been driven by the positive performance of our core portfolio holdings as their strong operating results have contributed to their stock price increases mark to market losses on pershing square tontine holdings ltd and on fannie mae and freddie mac due to an adverse ruling at the u s supreme court offset some of these gains in the portfolio update which follows this letter we discuss fannie and freddie and our other portfolio companies our stock price remains substantially undervalued as it trades at a large discount to nav particularly as nav re ects our cost basis for umg which we believe represents a meaningful discount to its eventual public trading value we believe that umg s listing should be a catalyst for shareholders to recognize additional hidden value in our company universal music group umg the most signi cant investment of the year is psh and affiliates recent acquisition of 7 1 of universal music group from vivendi umg was psth s initial business combination target but regulatory hurdles prevented the transaction from being consummated as a result the board of psth exercised its right to assign the contract to the pershing square funds we accepted the assignment committing to purchase a minimum of 5 and up to a maximum of 10 of umg by mid september an option which we intend to exercise with the help of a new co investment vehicle pershing square vii psh and affiliates have agreed to pay psth s transaction costs in connection with the umg transaction totaling approximately 25 million and assume an indemnity that psth had previously entered into with vivendi with the purchase of the initial 7 1 stake psh and affiliates have now completed the assumption of the indemnity and the transaction costs which positions psth to immediately pursue a new business combination the vivendi indemnity was designed to protect it from potential liabilities in connection with the distribution of umg shares to psth shareholders and psth s redemption tender offer since the umg share distribution will now not take place and the redemption tender offer has been withdrawn we do not believe that there is any potential liability to vivendi or to psh and affiliates in assuming this indemnity obligation i would encourage those who did not have an opportunity to attend our umg webcast on june 23 2021 to review our powerpoint presentation on the company which can be found at www pstontine com umg management is having a capital markets day on august 25th if you would like to learn more with the transformation of the music industry from the physical sale of recordings and downloads to streaming the music business has been transformed from a business in decline to a rapidly growing industry where all participants bene t from the global growth in music streaming subscribers spotify and some of the largest tech companies in the world including apple google and amazon as well as hundreds of other streaming companies a k a digital service providers or dsps are aggressively competing to grow their streaming subscriber bases their large and growing base of subscribers and the streaming royalties they generate are bene ting all participants in the music ecosystem including artists and songwriters record labels publishers and the dsps themselves the transition of software from a boxed product to a downloaded one to software in the cloud or so called software as a service saas is an apt analogy for the music s industry transformation from cds to downloads to streaming which enables you to listen to 60 million songs on your smart phone smart speaker watch or other device this new economic model for the record labels and publishers can now be best thought of as owning a royalty on the global growth of music streaming streaming is faster growing more predictable minimally capital intensive and more pro table than the physical or download recorded music business music has also become an essential complement to social media as apps like tiktok facebook snap and others who have added music to increase user engagement music is also essential to exercise apps and products like peloton while these apps in many cases have only recently begun paying royalties for music these apps will become large sources of revenues for music companies over time the music industry s transformation had been largely invisible to wall street until warner music group wmg the number three player after umg and sony began trading publicly on the nasdaq last year we believe that investors have just begun to appreciate the change in industry dynamics and as a result have not yet given proper recognition to the value of wmg or umg which is currently a subsidiary of vivendi se a french media conglomerate it is within this context that we found the opportunity to purchase a large stake in umg to be extremely attractive umg is the number one company in the industry by market share with a 32 global market share in recorded music umg has a world class management team led by sir lucian grainge who has spent his entire career in the business under vivendi s ownership and lucian s leadership umg has increased its strong market position by investing to build a global presence in 180 markets around the world as a result it is well positioned to participate in the global growth of music streaming which will be increasingly driven by demand from the emerging markets umg s management strength and long term investment strategy are re ected in its industry leading nancial performance which include accelerating double digit revenue growth up 26 in q2 2021 and its 21 compounded operating income ebita growth about twice that of wmg over the last four calendar years which accelerated in the rst half of 2021 to 34 umg will become a public company by the end of the third quarter when vivendi distributes 60 of the stock to its shareholders in a highly anticipated distribution umg will have a nearly net debt free balance sheet when it becomes a public company unlike wmg which is controlled by access industries with super voting stock umg shareholders will have one vote per share and an independent board no longer controlled by vivendi we believe that the price that we are paying for umg of about 21 times calendar year 2021 operating income ebita or less than 19 times our estimate of 2022 operating income ebita is a highly attractive price for a business of this quality and long term growth potential umg will be the largest investment in our portfolio by a substantial margin we size investments based on our estimate of the probability of our suffering a permanent loss of capital compared to the opportunity for potential gain at the price we are paying for umg we believe the risk of permanent loss is minimal and the opportunity for long term gain to be both highly probable and unusually large compared to other opportunities in other words we believe that umg has the potential to be one of our most successful long term investments pershing square tontine holdings ltd psth our largest negative contributor for the rst half and year to date is a mark to market loss of 4 7 and 6 4 of gross assets respectively due to the decline in psth s share price 7 while we do not currently own publicly traded shares in psth we are required to mark to market the psth sponsor warrants and our forward purchase agreements fpas which are considered derivatives in this case a commitment to invest a minimum of 1 billion and an option to invest an additional 2 billion in psth s initial business combination ibc the market value of spacs in general and psth in particular declined since the beginning of the year which along with psth s failure to consummate the universal music group transaction likely contributed to psth s stock price declining to a level approximating its 20 per share cash in trust on friday last week psth s share price declined to slightly below nav for the rst time nearly all pre merger spacs have traded at discounts to nav since earlier this year we believe this is due to many poor outcomes for investors in conventional spacs after they have completed their merger transactions the poor incentives of conventional spacs enormous compensation for a spac sponsor for just getting a transaction done regardless of the outcome for shareholders combined with limited sponsor skin in the game are the principal problems by comparison psth s sponsor which is wholly owned by the pershing square funds owns no founder stock is not entitled to receive compensation of any kind and has a lot of skin in the game by virtue of our forward purchase agreements we will have the largest investment of any of our shareholders in psth s target company of 1 billion or more our only additional incentive beyond our large fpa commitment is our ownership of sponsor warrants for which the pershing square funds paid 65 million their fair value at the time of psth s ipo as determined with the assistance of a nationally recognized valuation rm unlike our shareholders who have the right to receive a return of the 20 per share cash in trust if we don t get a deal done our warrants become worthless in that event if our 65 million investment at the time of the ipo had been used to purchase psth common stock instead of warrants it would have made pershing square the sixth largest shareholder of the company like other shareholders we have skin in the game and suffer opportunity cost while we seek to complete a transaction and suffer a total loss of our 65 million investment if we fail to complete a deal within psth s remaining term unlike in conventional spacs where sponsors with limited time remaining are incentivized to do any deal to get the bene t of their founder shares we would never risk our billion dollar minimum investment in a transaction to preserve the value of our sponsor warrants and in a bad deal our 20 out of the money sponsor warrants that cannot be sold hedged or transferred for three years are not likely to be worth anything in that event importantly our entire investment in psth including our ownership of the sponsor warrants is held by psh and the other two pershing square funds not the principals of our investment management company by comparison in other spacs entrepreneurs promoters or investment managers own the founder stock and committed capital comes from other peoples money the pershing square team owns 25 of psh and a large and increasing amount of the private funds so we have a very large indirect stake in psth 8 the structure of psth is not perfect as in other spacs investors commit capital upfront and suffer the opportunity cost of the loss of use of those funds until a deal is done or until the investment period comes to an end we have been seeking to launch sparc a special purpose acquisition rights company to address this concern and to remove the time pressure of the two year investment period which can impair our negotiating leverage on august 19th i wrote a letter to psth shareholders explaining that we are working to accelerate the launch of pershing square sparc holdings ltd sparc which would give existing psth shareholders and warrant holders the right to invest in sparc s future merger transaction the pershing square funds would make a large co investment in sparc on precisely the same terms and at the same time as sparc warrant holders can exercise their warrants to buy stock in sparc s initial business combination assuming sparc is approved by the sec and the sparc warrants are approved for listing on the nyse if psth has not by then entered into a merger transaction psth intends to seek shareholder approval to enable it to return the 4 billion of cash psth holds in trust to shareholders following the return of trust cash we expect sparc to issue one 20 sparc warrant for each outstanding psth common share and one 23 sparc warrant for each psth distributable warrant launching sparc will enable us to seamlessly continue working on a potential merger transaction if psth has not previously completed one on behalf of sparc rather than psth while no longer burdening our psth shareholders with the opportunity cost of capital associated with keeping their funds in a trust account in other words it puts psth investors in precisely the same position they are in today with an option to invest in our next merger transaction at sparc s rather than psth s 20 per share net asset value but without having their funds held in a trust i encourage you to read my august 19th letter which discusses sparc in greater detail here psth lawsuit last week a lawsuit was led against psth which claims that psth has been operating as an unregistered investment company because among other reasons psth has continuously held investment securities short term government securities and money market funds that own government securities as do all other spacs and also because psth s initial but not completed business combination with umg was structured as a stock purchase holding cash and government securities and seeking a business combination particularly one that failed to close do not make psth or any other spacs unregistered investment companies while we believe the lawsuit is totally without merit it may have the effect of deterring or delaying potential merger partners from transacting with psth until it is resolved unfortunately the nature of our legal system makes even spurious litigation difficult to resolve in a timely fashion since the release of the letter in light of questions we have received and inaccuracies in certain press reports i clarify a few important points below our plan to return cash to shareholders once sparc is approved does not in any way mean that we are walking away from psth and giving up on completing a deal we remain committed to nding a transaction for psth if we have not done so by the time sparc is approved we will then continue to pursue a business combination on behalf of sparc rather than psth importantly we believe that the original premise behind psth remains true we continue to believe that the largest spac in the world with the most investor aligned structure can merge with a high quality large capitalization business on attractive terms and thereby create substantial value for psth or sparc shareholders the best evidence of our ability to nd a high quality ibc candidate and enter into a transaction on attractive terms is our original proposed transaction with universal music group while the regulatory issues raised by the sec prevented us from consummating that transaction in psth the umg deal is the best empirical evidence of our ability to identify negotiate and sign a transaction with one of the best businesses in the world on attractive terms one can get a preliminary indication of the nancial merits of the umg deal by comparing psth s negotiated price per share of 18 66 at today s exchange rate including transaction costs to umg s stock price when it is fully distributed for trading beginning late next month a successful launch of sparc protects all of psth s investors its shareholders and warrant holders assuming sparc is approved sparc intends to issue two new warrants one for each of the 200 million psth shares outstanding the 20 sparc warrants and one for each of the 22 2 million distributable redeemable warrants dr warrants outstanding the 23 sparc warrants this will enable sparc to replicate the capital structure of psth with 4 billion of equity capital if all of the 20 sparc warrants are exercised at the time of a business combination before considering capital funding from the pershing square funds forward purchase agreements the planned issuance of the sparc warrants for each of the dr warrants does not appear to be widely understood by dr warrant holders to clarify the two sparc warrants would have the following terms the 20 sparc warrants issued to psth commonstock owners would entitle holdersto acquire sharesof sparc at its 20 per share nav only when sparc has entered into a de nitive agreement for its ibc achievedall necessary approvals and the transaction is ready to close issued to psth commonstock owners would entitle holdersto acquire sharesof sparc at its 20 per share nav only when sparc has entered into a de nitive agreement for its ibc achievedall necessary approvals and the transaction is ready to close the 23 sparc warrants issued to psth dr warrant holders are effectively identical to the 22 2 million dr warrants that psth currently has outstanding they will have the same 23 00 exercise price and the same ve yearterm in this case from the completion of sparc s ibc since the 23 sparc warrants only become exercisable when sparc completes its ibc they are not at risk of expiring until the end of the term that sparc has to nd a deal which would be many years from now by comparison psth s existing dr warrants lose all of their value if we do not sign a letter of intent for a deal in 11 months and close within six months thereafter since the 23 sparc warrants have a much longer term than our existing warrants and therefore have a higher probability of becoming effective in an ibc they should be substantially more valuable than our current dr warrants which have a much shorter term remaining before an ibc must be completed to extend their life will sparc be approved by the sec and will the sparc warrants be listed for trading on the nyse we cannot be certain that sparc will be approved by the sec and that the sparc warrants will be approved for trading on the nyse either under the terms we have proposed or at all the issuance of sparc warrants will require an sec approved nyse rule change and a registration statement that is deemed effective by the sec we have achieved a number of important steps toward sparc s approval including con dentially submitting sparc s draft registration statement to the sec for review and receiving a comment letter in response to our submission from the sec staff which identi ed some disclosure and other technical questions that we believe we can address we are working to amend sparc s registration statement to respond to the comments we have received from the sec staff and plan to le it publicly as promptly as practicable this document will explain sparc s attributes in greater detail we encourage you to read it carefully progress has also been made on the rule change as the nyse has already drafted a new rule that if approved by the sec would allow the sparc warrants to be listed on the exchange we believe that the investor friendly features of sparc should facilitate sparc s approval within a reasonable time frame that is in months not years we also note that not only will the rule change and sparc s approval create a much more favorable template for all spacs but it will also have a highly favorable impact on psth shareholders and warrant holders you can help get the nyse rule change approved by providing favorable public comments about the rule during its public comment period whether you are a large or small shareholder of psh or psth or another market participant your opinion matters to the sec and nyse in their consideration of the rule the stated goal of the academics who launched their lawsuit against psth is to reform the spac industry we agree that the industry but not psth needs reform we are unaware of a better and faster approach to spac industry reform than what would be achieved by the sec approving sparc expeditiously as it may also motivate other spac market participants to abandon the current spac structure and replace it with a much better acquisition vehicle for investors and sponsors we believe there are many negative aspects to the current ipo market and its approach and it therefore needs competition acquisition companies can play a highly important role in capital formation but only if properly designed to align sponsor and investor incentives without the structural attributes that have led to bad outcomes for investors market driven reforms can happen quickly when a market participant has a thoughtful and innovative idea that helps investors and garners regulatory support allowing other sponsors to copy the idea we hope that sparc sparks a spac revolution to bene t all investors and u s capital formation as always we are extremely appreciative of your support and patience particularly when certain investments do not proceed as we initially expected sincerely william

number one pizza company in the world and along with its franchisees operates more than 18 000 stores globally as 98 of the system is franchised the company generates most of its pro ts from high margin brand royalty fees and the balance from company owned stores and a supply chain business that supplies north american franchisees we have long admired domino s due to its compelling customer value proposition best in class digital infrastructure consistent track record exceptional unit economics and world class management team domino s menu in the u s has featured its core 5 99 and 7 99 everyday value platforms for more than a decade which are amongst the lowest cost meals for a family of four the company generates 75 of its sales through digital channels by far the highest in the industry ownership of the leading digital and delivery infrastructure enables domino s to consistently deliver an outstanding customer experience as well as attractive economics to drivers franchisees and shareholders all without using third party delivery providers in the u s this strong value proposition and efficiency have led to consistent same store sales growth of high single digits in the u s and mid single digits internationally the simplicity and efficiency of the company s operations drive some of the strongest store level economics in the restaurant industry making domino s an attractive business opportunity for franchisees around the world many domino s franchisees were former drivers and restaurant employees a track record which helps the company to recruit new employees in a difficult market for labor while also providing a path to entrepreneurship and wealth for its entry level employees domino s franchised new stores generate pretax cash on cash returns of over 50 despite its signi cant market share gains over the last decade domino s has a long runway for growth as it represents only 17 of global quick service restaurant pizza sales far less than the market share leader in other categories such as burgers chicken and coffee and competition remains fragmented these exceptional unit economics combined with a large market share opportunity underpin the company s historical and projected unit growth of approximately 7 annually domino s is led by a strong management team with an unwavering commitment to its goal of becoming the dominant pizza company in the world the company has a demonstrated track record for shareholder friendly capital return which helps drive long term earnings growth we believe that short term concerns regarding 2021 same store sales growth and longer term angst about third party delivery competition allowed us to purchase our stake at an attractive valuation multiple of about 26 times forward earnings a 13 discount to the company s historical average valuation of 30 times investors were myopically focused on domino s 2020 performance as a covid winner due to the consumer shift to delivery and overlooked key contributors for 2021 and beyond these included a reopening driven rebound in carryout sales group occasions and late night orders as well as continued product innovation boost week promotions and its largest ever level of advertising funds longer term we believe that domino s can compete effectively against third party delivery providers while these aggregators enjoyed explosive growth in 2020 their success did not come at domino s expense we view their offerings as more of a substitute for home cooked meals and dining out when comparing the domino s model with third party delivery we believe that the latter wins only on breadth of selection and that domino s wins on virtually every other metric including price and transparency speed and consistency of delivery times suitability of stores and products for delivery its sustainable labor model for drivers and a proven track record of pro tability for all parties involved the company s results in the rst half of 2021 showed that both delivery and carryout contributed to same store sales growth with reopened markets outperforming markets with more covid restrictions contrary to march investor expectations for a slowdown two year same store sales growth accelerated both domestically and overseas this year to 20 and 15 respectively in the latest quarter as many of the tailwinds we identi ed have begun to unfold we believe we were able to capitalize on a temporary moment of investor concern and build a stake in a great company at a fair price while the shares have appreciated signi cantly since we initiated our investment we continue to believe domino s remains an attractive investment portfolio updates chipotle cmg chipotle s track record of superb performance has continued in 2021 driven by ongoing strength in digital sales and a recovery of in store ordering digital gains achieved during the pandemic have proven resilient with digital sales growing 11 in q2 compared with the prior year highlighting the limited overlap with in person occasions the company has now recovered about 70 of its pre pandemic in restaurant sales volumes with the opportunity to drive these sales meaningfully higher once more schools and workplaces reopen after labor day near term performance is accelerating with management forecasting same store sales growth from 2019 levels in the low to mid 20 range in q3 up from 18 growth last quarter in may chipotle announced that they would increase hourly wages to a national average of 15 by the end of june and advertised a path for a new employee to earn an annual income of 100 000 in as little as three and a half years this resonated extremely well with existing and prospective employees with staffing levels now above 2019 levels following some previously pronounced labor shortages that limited sales chipotle increased menu prices by 3 5 and 4 0 to cover the wage increase and has not seen any customer resistance demonstrating the signi cant pricing power enabled by chipotle s brand strength and attractive customer value proposition during the second quarter chipotle exceeded its 2015 peak average restaurant sales of 2 5 million a signi cant milestone in the company s transformation under the current management team management is con dent in the growth strategies that will take chipotle to the next leg of its journey 3 million in average restaurant sales key levers to achieve this objective over the next several years include 1 disciplined menu innovation with smoked brisket to come following the successful launch of the quesadilla 2 data utilization from the company s 23 million member loyalty program 3 throughput improvements as employees and customers reacclimate to in person ordering and 4 the expansion of the chipotlane digital drive thru format to a higher percentage of the store base longer term management sees the opportunity to drive average unit volumes substantially above 3 million while also more than doubling the store base to 6 000 restaurants lowe s low since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic lowe s has experienced a signi cant acceleration in demand driven by consumers nesting at home

focus on the pro is bearing fruit share gains with the critical pro customer will provide a tailwind to growth that should allow lowe s to outperform market level growth going forward even as the robust demand experienced during the height of covid 19 stabilizes at a new base the medium and longer term macro environment remain very attractive for the home improvement sector and lowe s in particular this favorable context for the sector is evidenced by consumers enhanced focus and appreciation of the importance of the home higher home asset utilization rising home prices historically

the company s long term outlook implies signi cant opportunity for continued margin expansion and earnings appreciation as it executes its business transformation lowe s currently trades at

disparity to be anomalous in light of lowe s strong execution and potential for further operational optimization restaurant brands international qsr qsr s franchised business model is a high quality capital light growing annuity that generates high margin brand royalty fees from three leading brands burger king tim hortons and popeyes the company has nimbly navigated the covid 19 pandemic and continues to make progress on returning its brands to sustainable long term growth since the onset of the covid 19 pandemic the company has bolstered its safety procedures and is accelerating its digital investments by expanding its delivery footprint modernizing its drive thru experience increasing mobile ordering adoption and improving its loyalty programs as the global recovery continues to be uneven these initiatives will allow the company and its franchisees to serve customers in a safe and reliable manner each of the company s brands are at various stages in recovery with burger king and popeyes having returned to growth while tim hortons is well on its way to recovering on a two year basis same store sales grew 2 4 at burger king and 24 4 at popeyes during the last quarter meanwhile tim hortons in canada has improved to a mid single digit decline in july with each month during the second quarter showing sequential improvement tim hortons slower recovery is largely driven by strict covid 19 restrictions in canada which were only recently lifted in large provinces such as ontario in rural and suburban parts of canada where restrictions were lifted earlier tim hortons has already returned to growth given the habitual nature of tim hortons customer base the recovery in sales will be tied to mobility and reopening the company expects to return to its historical mid single digit unit growth this year and recently announced expansions for both tim hortons and popeyes in large international markets as underlying sales trends at each of its brands continue to improve and as the impact from covid 19 restrictions ease we believe restaurant brands share price will more accurately re ect our view of its improving business fundamentals hilton hlt while the hotel industry has been extremely negatively impacted by the covid 19 pandemic hilton has done an excellent job navigating industry volatility a testament to the company s high quality asset light high margin business model and superb management team from the moment the pandemic began hilton s management team took decisive actions to ensure the company not only managed through what it knew would be a challenging period but also positioned the company to generate improved margins cash ows and investment returns once the business recovers to pre covid 19 demand levels industry revpar the industry metric for same store sales at a given hotel bottomed in april 2020 and has shown sequential improvement every quarter as travel and mobility have recovered along with covid 19 vaccine rollouts and a resumption in travel in recent months there is increasing evidence that a robust recovery scenario is underway led by domestic leisure travel occasions which is currently trending above 2019 demand levels for the rst three weeks of july the most recent data the company provided revpar has already recovered to 85 of 2019 levels a signi cant improvement over prior months driven by increased hotel occupancy and a rapid recovery in rate while management anticipates a moderation in leisure demand as we exit the summer it expects the moderation in leisure travel to be offset by a more pronounced recovery in business transient travel occasions as offices reopen this fall although there remains near term uncertainty in domestic travel given the increase in covid 19 case numbers following the arrival of the delta variant in the u s we believe that the medium term outlook continues to point to a robust recovery scenario throughout the pandemic hilton took actions to reduce corporate expenses by about 20 compared to 2019 levels simultaneously the company provided resources and support to the hilton owner community which further solidi ed hilton as the preferred franchise partner thereby expanding hilton s pipeline of units around the world in the most recent quarter hilton affirmed its near to medium term outlook of mid single digit net unit growth and a resumption of its historical 6 7 net unit growth beginning in 2023 2024 higher growth than competitors and further evidence of hilton s unique business model we believe that hilton will continue to grow its market share over time given independent hotels increased interest in seeking an affiliation with global brands particularly in the wake of the pandemic while the recovery may continue to be uneven hilton has made tremendous progress which will help it become an even more pro table and stronger business going forward the howard hughes corporation hhc in 2020 david o reilly formerly hhc s cfo and

mae and freddie mac together the gses our positions in fannie mae and freddie mac suffered large mark to market declines in the second quarter due to the supreme court s decision in collins v yellen on june 23 the court which had heard oral arguments in december 2020 issued its opinion largely siding with the government against shareholders the supreme court ruled that the third amendment to the government s preferred stock purchase agreement pspas including the net worth sweep was authorized under the hera statute and that it would not intervene to second guess fhfa s exercise of its discretion the court also found unconstitutional hera s provision that the fhfa director may be removed only for cause it sent the case back to the fifth circuit for further proceedings and a potential award of damages based on whether the for cause limitation affected the administration of the third amendment we will continue to closely monitor these ongoing proceedings as well as another shareholder case in the federal district court raising contractual complaints relating to the third amendment simultaneously we and other plaintiffs are pursuing constitutional takings claims in the court of federal claims cfc due to the effective regulatory con scation of shareholders property as a result of the net worth sweep the government s motion to dismiss the takings claims was denied by the cfc this denial of dismissal is now on appeal to the court of appeals for the federal circuit while we are disappointed by the collins outcome we continue to believe the gses form the irreplaceable core of the u s housing nance system on which we as shareholders own a perpetual option under recent amendments to the pspas fannie and freddie continue to build capital becoming better capitalized and more valuable each quarter as we have explained before we do not need a favorable outcome in the courts for this to be a highly successful investment as we believe the re privatization of the two gses is their ultimate path and existing shareholders will be beneficiaries of this outcome that said a win in the courts would greatly accelerate this outcome exited position agilent technologies a our large commitment to umg required that we raise cash from the sale of one of our other investments in light of the high quality of companies in our portfolio this was a difficult decision to make ultimately we chose to sell agilent as its current share price approached our conservative estimate of intrinsic value if we did not need the capital we would not have sold the stock agilent has been a highly successful investment since our original purchase nearly two years ago compounded by our additional investment in the company in the covid market decline last year agilent s stock price has increased 2 2 times since our initial purchase as a result of the company s acceleration in revenue growth and pro tability 10 agilent has been a critical supplier of technology and

accordance with u s gaap the company presents these non gaap financial measures because they are used by the company s management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans the company also believes that the use of these non gaap measures facilitates investors assessment of its operating performance these non gaap financial measures are not defined under u s gaap and are not presented in accordance with u s gaap these non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools one of the key limitations of using these non gaap financial measures is that they do not

therefore their comparability may be limited the company compensates for these limitations by reconciling these non gaap financial measures to the nearest u s gaap performance measure all of which

by jp cortez the somber photos and videos that have come out of afghanistan lead many to wonder whether the 20 year conflict was worth the cost according to the associated press through april more than 172 000 people american and otherwise have died in the course of the war in afghanistan the estimated amount of direct afghanistan and iraq war costs that the united states has debt financed over 2 trillion the estimated principal and interest owed by 2050 up to 6 5 trillion this war as with much of government spending isn t paid by money the government has it s borrowed into existence the financial costs of debt financed spending by today s decision makers will burden future generations the pain of printing trillions of unbacked bills isn t felt immediately so the gravity of the action is subtle but the end result is unavoidable when congress granted then president george w bush the authority to use all necessary and appropriate force against those involved with the 9 11 a week after the attacks the federal government went down a course set for monetary ruin 1 in 2001 had the purchasing power of 1 54 today the dollar had an average inflation rate of 2 19 per year between 2001 and today producing a cumulative price increase of 54 15 inflation is everywhere inflation is everywhere that means that today s prices are 1 54 times higher than average prices in 2001 according to the bureau of labor statistics consumer price index a measure that notoriously understates real world inflation as a result of deploying clever hedonic adjustments geometric weighting and substitutions that tend to paint a rosier picture we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us said another way a dollar today buys no more than 65 of what it could buy in 2001 and by other measures besides the flawed cpi it buys even less the government s borrowing has accelerated rapidly to the upside since the covid lockdowns and emergency stimulus efforts that portends potentially much higher rates of inflation ahead last week bloomberg reported that food prices in july were up 31 from the same month last year according to an index compiled by the united nations food and agriculture organization substituting chicken breast for angus beef or the less expensive chicken thigh for chicken breast might be an innocuous sacrifice but what if you are now having trouble affording chicken at all inflation harms the poorest among us individuals with means can invest in assets that protect against dollar devaluation gold and silver real estate even a try at the casino known as the stock market there are many options for better healed investors but what about wage earners senior citizens on fixed income those trying to save some a little extra for the future those most harmed by the increased costs are those already struggling to afford these things dollar menus at fast food restaurants have vanished while the costs of homes food cars college tuition and medicine have soared one of sound money s most central features is that it restricts government spending to only what can be extracted from the populace through taxation a print and spend approach to monetary policy enables wasteful and fruitless government expenditures such as for example unpopular decades long wars for 20 years americans fought a war that cost thousands of lives and trillions of dollars many are left questioning whether the cost of this war was worth it there are many costs that are apparent but the sapping away of the dollar s purchasing power and the theft of wealth from all of those who hold it is among the greatest cost of all image unsplash sharon mccutcheon

improved 47 and 22 respectively as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020 which was the quarter in which our operating results were most negatively affected by the pandemic our performance principally reflects quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth of 17 and the favorable impact from our fiscal 2020 and 2021 acquisitions earlier this month we announced that flight support acquired 89 of ridge engineering inc and the bechdon company inc the purchase price of these acquisitions was paid in cash using cash on hand and we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our

is difficult to predict the pandemic s path and effect including factors like vaccination rates and new variants which can impact our key markets therefore we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal 2021 net sales and earnings guidance at this time however our ongoing conservative policies strong balance sheet and high degree of liquidity enable us to invest in new research and

estate planning and tax laws are both complex and ever changing federal and state estate and inheritance tax can consume a significant portion of your estate after your death the good news is that with an experienced attorney and proper estate planning you can find ways to lower these types of taxes and help increase your financial legacy estate taxes the basics it is essential to note that inheritance tax and estate tax are not the same though both should be considered in estate planning the main difference is that estate tax is paid out of the deceased s estate while inheritance taxes are paid out of the beneficiary s pocket there is a federal estate tax but not a federal inheritance tax depending on your estate value and in which state you reside it is possible that one both or neither could be a factor when someone dies after someone s death federal estate taxes start at 18 and top out at 40 percent for estates valued at 1 million or more over the estate tax exemption federal estate taxes only apply to individuals with estates valued at over 11 7 million the current estate tax exemption amount or 23 4 million for married couples in 2021 assets that spouses inherit are not subject to federal estate tax colorado does not have any state specific estate or inheritance taxes although other states do tax rates are different from one state to the next and apply at much lower values than the federal exemption strategies for reducing tax liability there are several strategies available that can help reduce estate and inheritance tax liability rather than simply accepting that your estate could be taxed and your beneficiaries might owe an inheritance tax in some states you can consider taking a more proactive approach using the following strategies gifting you have the option of giving away your assets while you are still alive this applies to more than tangible assets you can give away other assets such as stocks for 2021 the annual gift tax exclusion is 15 000 for individuals or 30 000 for a married couple filing a joint return to any person in a calendar year without having to file a federal gift tax return if your gift remains within these limits it does not count toward your lifetime exemption amount there is no limit to the number of people you can give gifts to within one year you could give the full amount to as many individuals as you wish charitable donations you can also reduce or bypass the estate tax by transferring part of your wealth to a charity through a trust two types of charitable trusts are available charitable lead trusts clts and charitable remainder trusts crts with a clt some of the assets in your trust will get passed on to a tax exempt charity you can decrease the value of your estate and get an extra tax break by donating to charity upon your death or after a set time period whatever is left in the trust will go to your beneficiaries alternatively you can use a crt to transfer stock or other appreciating assets to an irrevocable trust throughout your lifetime you can make money through that asset when you die your investment income will be donated to charity in the process you have the benefit of avoiding the capital gains tax and lowering your estate tax burden you will also receive a tax deduction set up a trust a trust lets you give assets to beneficiaries after your death without having to go through probate court unlike wills trusts generally avoid state probate requirements and its expenses this way your beneficiaries are not on the hook for the added cost of probate court a revocable trust allows you to move your assets in or out of your trust during your lifetime as necessary on the other hand an irrevocable trust generally moves the assets outside of your estate for the benefit of a beneficiary and therefore does not provide you the ability to move those assets in or out before your death the appreciation of such assets is therefore not included in your estate value when you die after death the property remains in the trust and is managed according to the trust document including the option of being distributed to the designated beneficiaries of the trust your estate plan if you do not already have an estate plan now is the time to draft one estate tax law is regularly changing as the exemption amounts are increased or decreased or the applicable tax is modified the current administration has proposed various significant changes to the estate tax laws begin the process by hiring an estate planning attorney and taking an inventory of

the marijuana industry is expected to expand at a minimum compound annual growth rate of 25 through 2030 and many investors are seeking to profit as states and entire countries decriminalize or legalize cannabis and or its components there are growing opportunities for entrepreneurs and existing companies this is especially true with the biden administration moving to reclassify marijuana from a schedule 1 controlled substance no accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse to schedule 3 drugs that have moderate to low potential for physical and psychological dependence as with any nascent industry there are also plenty of investment risks whether you re a first time investor or a seasoned veteran it pays to understand how this industry works this guide will get you up to speed quickly and includes our picks for the top marijuana stocks best marijuana stocks in 2024 best marijuana stocks for 2024 company description green thumb industries otc gtbif marijuana grower and retailer cresco labs otc crlbf marijuana grower and retailer innovative industrial properties nyse iipr ancillary provider growgeneration nasdaq grwg ancillary provider scotts miracle gro nyse smg ancillary provider jazz pharmaceuticals nasdaq jazz biotech company 1 green thumb industries 1 green thumb industries green thumb industries ranks as one of the largest u s multi state cannabis operators it owns more than 80 retail cannabis stores in 15 states across the u s and operates 18 manufacturing facilities green thumb also holds enough additional licenses to roughly double the number of its retail locations the company has been profitable on an annual basis since 2020 it continues to deliver revenue growth and maintains a strong balance sheet even with macroeconomic and cannabis industry headwinds green thumb should have plenty of growth potential over the long term as the u s cannabis market expands for now green thumb s shares can only be bought and sold on over the counter otc markets in the u s but if federal cannabis restrictions are lifted the stock could be listed on major u s stock exchanges this would almost certainly be a huge catalyst for green thumb definition icon over the counter otc otc is short for over the counter otc securities trade through decentralized networks instead of a major exchange 2 cresco labs 2 cresco labs cresco labs like green thumb is based in illinois it operates retail cannabis stores in nine states including six of the most populated states in the u s the company ranks as the top wholesaler of branded cannabis products in the u s it also markets the no 1 cannabis flower and concentrates portfolios along with the no 3 vapes portfolio and the no 4 edibles portfolio like green thumb cresco labs shares can currently only be traded on otc markets in the u s the stock will likely be a big winner if the biden administration moves forward with federal marijuana reforms that allow u s stock exchanges to list the shares of cannabis companies that operate in the u s 3 innovative industrial properties 3 innovative industrial properties u s cannabis companies can t easily secure capital from banks or financial institutions since marijuana remains illegal at the federal level innovative industrial properties iip helps to solve the cash shortage for growing marijuana companies it buys properties owned by u s medical cannabis operators and leases the properties back to them the sale to iip provides the cannabis operator with much needed cash and the lease agreements create a steady revenue stream for iip innovative industrial properties has grown significantly in recent years and now owns properties in 19 states the company continues to generate strong revenue and earnings growth powered by its sale leaseback business model even with some of its tenants facing financial challenges because iip is organized as a real estate investment trust reit it returns at least 90 of its taxable income to shareholders in some ways iip wouldn t be helped as much by federal cannabis reform as other companies its shares already trade on the new york stock exchange nyse if traditional banking services were available to u s cannabis operators iip could face increased competition however federal reforms would likely cause the u s cannabis market to expand which should work in iip s favor definition icon revenue revenue is a business s gross income or the amount of money it brings in from regular operations before costs are considered 4 growgeneration 4 growgeneration growgeneration is another ancillary provider and the largest specialty retail chain focused on the cannabis market it operates more than 60 stores in 18 states because the company s business doesn t violate any existing federal marijuana laws its stock can trade on the nasdaq stock exchange without any issues demand for the company s hydroponics products has fallen due to an oversupply of cannabis in the u s this has caused short term headwinds for growgeneration that are likely to continue in 2024 however the company s long term prospects remain bright and growgeneration should be in a position to significantly rebound when market conditions improve 5 scottsmiracle gro 5 scottsmiracle gro scottsmiracle gro is facing the same supply and demand market dynamics as growgeneration like growgeneration its shares can be traded on a major stock exchange in this case the nyse since scotts doesn t violate any federal marijuana laws the company s hawthorne gardening subsidiary ranks as a leading supplier of hydroponic gardening products to the cannabis industry hawthorne should have a significant growth runway over the long term despite some near term challenges although hawthorne gardening has been a primary growth driver for scotts the company still generates the majority of its total revenue from consumer lawn and garden products higher commodity prices are currently squeezing margins for the business however the company s consumer lawn and garden products provide a relatively steady counterbalance to its cannabis supply unit 6 jazz pharmaceuticals 6 jazz pharmaceuticals ireland based jazz pharmaceuticals acquired the cannabis focused biotech company gw pharmaceuticals in may 2021 gw s drug epidiolex is the first cannabis based medicine to be approved by the u s food and drug administration fda epidiolex which treats two forms of childhood epilepsy and tuberous sclerosis complex a rare disease where benign tumors grow on organs has been a big commercial success with sales of 736 4 million in 2022 jazz s pipeline also features other cannabis drugs in phase 2 testing targeting autism spectrum disorders and related issues in addition to its cannabis products jazz markets sleep disorder and cancer drugs overview marijuana stocks overview let s cover some of the basics you need to know before investing in marijuana stocks the marijuana industry is divided into three broad categories marijuana growers and retailers cultivate and package cannabis products and sell them to consumers biotechnology companies develop and market cannabis based pharmaceutical drugs ancillary marijuana businesses provide products and services to cannabis companies without touching the plant marijuana growers and retailers cultivate and package cannabis products and sell them to consumers biotechnology companies develop and market cannabis based pharmaceutical drugs ancillary marijuana businesses provide products and services to cannabis companies without touching the plant cannabis can be medical or recreational medical cannabis patients use cannabis or cannabis extracts to treat health conditions and have recommendations or cannabis prescriptions from physicians recreational cannabis users purchase marijuana or cannabis extracts purely for enjoyment and must be 18 or older and living in a jurisdiction where recreational use of the plant is legal medical cannabis patients use cannabis or cannabis extracts to treat health conditions and have recommendations or cannabis prescriptions from physicians recreational cannabis users purchase marijuana or cannabis extracts purely for enjoyment and must be 18 or older and living in a jurisdiction where recreational use of the plant is legal geography matters medical cannabis is legal in many more countries than recreational cannabis in the u s cannabis remains illegal at the federal level however a growing number of states have legalized medical and or recreational cannabis and as mentioned earlier the biden administration is taking some steps that could lead to federal decriminalization of marijuana the rapid growth of the u s cannabis market is translating into impressive growth by u s based cannabis companies while marijuana companies in canada where the plant is already fully legal nationwide are expanding more slowly canada is one of the global legal markets where supply is outpacing demand and leading to falling cannabis prices the covid 19 pandemic affected nearly every part of the global economy including the cannabis industry in many u s states cannabis dispensaries were designated as essential businesses cannabis sales boomed in some states during the first few months of the coronavirus outbreak driven in part by more time spent at home and increased anxiety marijuana growers and retailers benefited as did ancillary providers selling gardening supplies and other products to these companies however not all cannabis companies fared well in the pandemic recreational cannabis retailers in tourist destinations such as las vegas saw their customer traffic dwindle causing some dispensaries to start focusing on home delivery in the medical segment people delayed doctor visits causing new patient starts to drop biotech companies experienced logistical challenges that affected sales and research progress to a large extent the worst appears to be over for the cannabis market with respect to covid 19 but some effects are still being felt related investing topics should you buy marijuana stocks just because there s a trendy new sector with lots of press and potential growth doesn t mean you need to invest in it if you buy broad based index funds you re covered no matter which sectors of the stock market do well conservative investors who prefer lower risk are likely better off avoiding investing in marijuana stocks several of the marijuana stocks mentioned above have fallen significantly over the past 12 months this pattern underscores the risks that investors face and highlights why using margin to buy these stocks should be avoided however the factors causing poor performance especially a supply demand imbalance should be resolved over time aggressive investors with high risk tolerances though will probably find a lot to like about marijuana stocks the cannabis industry is still in its early stages the market opportunities are enormous especially as more u s states legalize cannabis investing in these stocks is a high risk but potentially high reward proposition

hardship thus the policyholder s preference to litigate its insurance claims in delaware must stand background cvr energy is a delaware entity with its principal place of business in texas cvr energy purchased d o liability coverage from xl the other insurers provided excess insurance that followed the form of the xl policy cvr energy four of its related entities and two executives were named in one of two similar putative class action lawsuits alleging that the defendants manipulated the price of stock to cvr energy s benefit the insureds gave notice of the underlying class action lawsuits to the d o insurers on march 25 2019 xl took the position that there may be coverage under the policy for cvr energy and its related corporate affiliates but that there was no coverage for the individual executives named in the lawsuits cvr energy proceeded to defend itself in the litigation and the parties scheduled mediation in one underlying action for february 17 2021 however on january 8 2021 more than 21 months after issuing its initial coverage position xl sent a letter to cvr energy noting that coverage may not be available for the lawsuit to be mediated cvr energy responded one week later explaining why there was coverage and requested that xl confirm that it will be providing coverage in the upcoming mediation by february 3 2021 xl did not respond to cvr energy s letter and instead filed suit in texas on january 27 2021 the insureds filed suit in delaware three days letter the insurers moved to dismiss or stay the delaware action arguing that the delaware action should be dismissed in favor of the first filed texas action which they contended involved the same parties and coverage dispute in response cvr energy argued that both actions were contemporaneously filed and that as such traditional forum non conveniens analysis barring the plaintiff from its chosen forum only where the defendant shows overwhelming hardship should apply in lieu of the more rigid first filed rule discussion the court agreed with the insureds it acknowledged that delaware courts may defer to a case filed first in time in another forum if that earlier action involves substantially the same parties and issues however if two cases are filed contemporaneously then the traditional forum non conveniens framework applies and a defendant must show overwhelming hardship to have a case dismissed additionally the court explained that merely using a timeline to determine if a prior action was filed first was inappropriate instead to avoid a race to the courthouse delaware courts may treat cases filed within the same general timeframe as contemporaneous furthermore declaratory judgment actions filed in anticipation of the natural plaintiff bringing its own suit are not afforded any deference to a first filed suit applying those standards to cvr energy s delaware suit the court found that the insurers engaged in a race to the courthouse because they did not deny coverage until 2021 and filed the texas action without additional notice or warning to the insureds the court also concluded that the insureds were the natural plaintiff in the insurance coverage dispute therefore the court would not defer to the nsurers choice of forum and found that the suits were contemporaneously filed accordingly the forum non conveniens framework applied which required the insurers to demonstrate overwhelming hardship based on factors such as relative ease of access to proof availability of compulsory process for witnesses whether the controversy is dependent on delaware law and other practical problems that would make trial easy expeditious and inexpensive the court did not need to perform that analysis however because the insurers ignored the balancing test completely in favor of the first filed rule and did not attempt to meet their burden to dismiss the case because the insurers did not address the relevant forum non conveniens factors in their opening brief the issue was deemed waived and the insurers could not meet their burden of proof even if they did not waive the issue the court reasoned they could not prove an overwhelming hardship by litigating in delaware because all insureds are licensed to do business in delaware and xl is a delaware corporation this case continues a trend of delaware rulings in favor of policyholders on a number of key issues common to insurance coverage disputes ranging from advancement of defense costs to allocation the cvr energy ruling is further support for the position advocated by the delaware supreme court earlier this year in dole that companies incorporated in delaware and their insured officers and directors deserve the benefits of delaware law as applied by delaware courts finally the ruling demonstrates that even if an insurer races to the courthouse to force litigation of a coverage dispute in a more favorable forum being first may not always be enough especially in delaware

here is a creep feed grinding setup employing many of the elements discussed in this article seen here are a profiled grinding wheel continuous dressing unit directly above it nozzles following the profile of the wheel and tooling the white plastic piece for capturing and pooling the coolant is grinding the material removal process of the future consider these two important ongoing trends in machining tighter tolerances better performing systems in automobiles and other end products are driving the demand for increasingly tighter feature tolerances and finer surfaces on machined parts harder materials manufacturers are increasingly using superalloys ceramics and other materials engineered for high hardness at high temperatures this results in parts that are more durable but harder to machine and to these trends in machining in general one can add an important material engineering trend that directly affects grinding improved grains and bonds in grinding wheels are delivering more effective performance together all these developments suggest there will be greater use of grinding in the future they also point to an implication even more specific than that taken together these factors suggest that we will see increasingly greater use of creep feed grinding what is creep feed grinding compared to the more common surface grinding creep feed grinding employs a heavier grinding depth combined with a slow traverse rate generally with a profiled grinding wheel to generate a given geometric form at a material removal rate mrr that is much higher than the finishing passes for which grinding is generally known the mrr is why creep feed grinding offers such promise in machining a hard high temperature alloy such as inconel or an even harder material such as a ceramic matrix composite the potential mrr of a heavier metal cutting process such as milling is limited greater use of these hard materials therefore means greater challenges for milling but developments such as grinding wheel improvements have enabled creep feed grinding s mrr in these same materials to significantly increase according to grinding wheel manufacturer saint gobain abrasives which is known by the brand norton we have already reached the point at which grinding is no longer a terminal process in the machining sequence for a part instead in a significant and growing number of cases grinding is the process i recently spoke about this shift with members of the norton engineering team during a visit to the company s higgins grinding technology center in northborough massachusetts this boston area facility where application engineering and product testing are performed on grinding wheels and other products is one of four such grinding technology centers for the company worldwide on the day i visited much of the testing i saw on cnc grinders on the facility s r d floor related to creep feed grinding team members i met with included technology manager robin bright phd senior application engineer bruce gustafson director of bonded abrasives brian rutkiewicz and high performance materials technologist philip varghese phd all creep feed experts who have been involved with a company initiative called machining to grinding aimed at helping support manufacturers making a transition from metal cutting to greater use of grinding this initiative which has focused on aerospace manufacturers as they shift to difficult to machine alloys and composites has also realized success for gear makers and now is finding applications in automotive manufacturing i asked the team members what is important to understand about creep feed grinding today their replies covered the following 10 points the first of which explores the somewhat ambiguous question of just where creep feed begins 1 creep feed grinding has no formal definition there are no creep feed police gustafson says the principal defining characteristic of creep feed grinding is a depth of cut that is high for grinding but opinions differ on precisely what depth marks the transition in his work involving aircraft engine related grinding applications he has noted that engineers in this sector frequently mark the beginning of creep feed at 0 015 inch his own opinion places the transition earlier than this he thinks a grinding depth of 0 005 inch can qualify as creep feed in either case he says the choice is arbitrary with no formal definition likely it is reasonable to think of your deep grinding application as creep feed and you may have done grinding that was arguably creep feed without realizing it 2 creep feed is both a low force and a high force process rutkiewicz characterizes the creep feed process by pointing to this seemingly contradictory depiction the force in the cut is low from one perspective and high from another while each cutting particle on the grinding wheel experiences a low force relative to other modes of grinding the force imparted to the machine and part overall is likely to be high compensating for the heavy depth of cut in creep feed is a traverse rate feed rate that is low often on the order of 5 to 20 inches per minute the low feed rate and corresponding chip load mean the cutting force upon every individual grit of the surface of the grinding wheel is also low wheel life and power efficiency both potentially benefit from this and yet a lot of grits are engaged the larger depth of cut of creep feed means a longer arc of the wheel is submerged in the part increasing force overall as a result the requirements of a grinding machine used in this process include spindle power of at least 15 to 20 horsepower per inch of grinding wheel width and a static loop stiffness of 100 000 pounds per inch for each inch of grinding wheel width 3 creep feed offers advantages over conventional grinding compared to a conventional process that makes faster lighter passes creep feed grinding offers the following benefits shorter cycle time true the feed rate is low but the increased depth of cut more than compensates for this additionally the reduced total number of passes means there is less time lost to acceleration and deceleration as the machine reverses reduced machine wear another beneficial result of the reduced frequency of machine reversals longer wheel life the reduced force per grit point 2 above means that this high mrr process is actually less demanding on the wheel finer tolerance and more complex geometric for the low feed rate and low force per grit enable superior control over the outcome of the grinding operation all these benefits come with one very large downside to creep feed grinding discussed in the next point 4 coolant is crucial the long arc of wheel engagement translates to greater heat generation in the process coolant is therefore crucial to using creep feed grinding effectively other machining processes routinely apply flood coolant by using a nozzle to point the coolant stream in roughly the direction of the cut but creep feed requires coolant application to be taken more seriously various considerations are employed to ensure as much of the coolant s heat transfer capacity is realized as possible including coolant delivery speed is matched to the speed at the wheel surface syncing coolant flow speed with the speed at which any point of the wheel is passing ensures more of the coolant meets and follows with the wheel coolant delivery nozzles are arranged in profiles that match the profile of the grinding wheel see photo in the slideshow above special coolant collection tooling is used in creep feed grinding a ramp on the exit side of the part collects coolant and enables it to pool at the wheel for still greater wheel exposure to the fluid this ramp might even be machined to match the part profile 5 down grinding is preferred for mrr similar to milling in which the two possible directions of tool rotation relative to the workpiece produce either conventional milling or climb milling the two possible directions of grinding wheel rotation produce either up grinding or down grinding dr bright says creep feed s preference is down grinding when the objective is high mrr the rotation of the wheel in down grinding causes the bottom of the wheel to move in the same direction as the feed of the part this type of grinding causes any point of the wheel any grit of the wheel to first meet the workpiece where the material engagement is greatest see diagram in the slideshow above again heat is the reason for this preference where stock removal is high to grind in the other direction is to have the grit first meet the material without cutting into it the result is that each grit is not making a chip right away dr bright says initially the grits are sliding and plowing which causes friction and excess heat into the part down grinding though it might seem more abrupt allows for a cooler grinding process as grits are forming chips when they first engage the part by contrast up grinding is preferred where the objective is either a fine surface finish or extending the life of the abrasive 6 intermittent dressing is becoming more acceptable because the material removal per pass is so great in creep feed grinding aluminum oxide wheels used in this process tend to require continuous dressing a dressing wheel applied to the grinding wheel as it is grinding keeps the wheel sharp at all times indeed continuous dress capability is potentially another machine requirement for creep feed grinding in addition to power and stiffness however newer grinding wheels with ceramic grit make it possible to avoid this need because the ceramic wheels remain sharp for a longer period of time they make it possible to use intermittent dressing meaning dressing using a separate wheel located elsewhere in the workzone apart from the grinding head dressing only when needed allows the wheel to last longer and by eliminating the need for continuous dress capability the more advanced grinding wheel makes it possible to perform creep feed grinding on a less expensive machine 7 superabrasive wheels can move beyond tool grinding a third wheel type is also likely suitable for intermittent dressing dressable metal bond superabrasive wheels using diamond or cubic boron nitride cbn grit have been used in cutting tool manufacturing for grinding composite cermet and ceramic tools based on the similarity of material properties norton engineers believe these wheels could also efficiently grind ceramic matrix composite and gamma titanium aluminide parts for aerospace another useful feature of these wheels is their porosity for grinding wheels in general that are engineered for creep feed grinding material grains are spaced widely to create microscopic porosity allowing coolant to infiltrate the wheel in a superabrasive wheel such as the norton winter paradigm product line the metal bond allows for a wheel porosity ranging to 46 percent in some cases superabrasive wheels also can be used without any dressing single layer metal bond superabrasive wheels designed for no dressing have been applied to realize creep feed grinding on cnc milling machines 8 broaching now has a low footprint rival milling is not the only competitor to creep feed grinding another is broaching specifically the broaching that is applied to realize the fir tree forms in aircraft engine disks made of superalloy a form such as this can be generated through creep feed grinding the result might be considerable floor space savings because of the long linear travel it requires the broaching machine for this operation could easily be 30 to 40 feet long creep feed grinding offers the chance to perform the same machining within a standard size machine tool 9 in aerospace the mrr can match that of milling dr varghese stresses again the view that grinding is a finishing process and the final touch applied to a machined part to realize dimensional and surface tolerances that is the historical role of grinding is a view that will become less and less inclusive of all that grinding can do as advanced workpiece materials are used more widely in the past 1 cubic inch per minute per inch of wheel width is the typical specific mrr that has been expected of grinding in superalloy grinding applications today on cnc machines using engineered wheels creep feed grinding can realize a specific mrr of 18 cubic inches per minute per inch of wheel width resulting in overall mrr equal to or better than what a milling cutter might do in that same workpiece material he says another important area of advance has been in the energy demand creep feed grinding requires from the perspective of the machine creep feed is a high force process point 2 but the sharper cutting grit in modern wheels reduces that force improved wheel porosity for conveying swarf and coolant along with improved coolant techniques also help to improve energy efficiency as a result the specific energy of creep feed grinding the energy required to remove each cubic inch of material has become comparable to milling as well 10 creep feed offers the promise to relocate heat treatment but comparing milling to grinding in terms of their machining cycles alone might miss one of the greatest benefits of creep feed a fundamental change to the sequence of the process in that traditional role of grinding as a finishing operation the part often undergoes heat treatment just ahead of this step grinding is an effective process for machining in the harder post heat treatment state though milling the part in this state would be problematic thus most of the part s machining is carried out through milling while the workpiece is still soft then comes heat treating then the part may receive a final light milling step before grinding or it may go to grinding directly this sequence milling sending the part away for heat treatment bringing the part back to the shop for the operations including grinding is second nature to manufacturers and a standard way many parts are made however creep feed grinding can undo that sequence the workpiece could be heat treated first meaning the workpiece could be brought to its final hardness first before any machining is done creep feed grinding would eliminate the interruption delay and coordination necessary to ship a partially completed part away for this off site step matching the mrr of milling may be the benchmark enabling grinding to take on a larger role in production but reordering the steps needed in production may in some cases be where creep feed grinding realizes its greatest savings

little changed at 708 000 in july just up 1 from 701 000 in june albeit above the consensus forecast for a dip to 697 000 in a note to clients economists at pantheon macroeconomics us commented sales have stabilized a bit above the level implied by the lagged mortgage applications numbers mirroring the pattern seen in the existing sales data we suspect that rising inventory is allowing previously frustrated homebuyers to find a home eventually though sales will move back into line with mortgage applications which recently have shown signs of life after falling by 28 between december and june as demand shifted back abruptly to its pre covid level they added the number of new homes for sale in july 367k was the highest since november 2008 and is up 26 compared to july last year supply now

stock markets may get another helping hand from jerome powell this week when he appears at the annual jackson hole event until recently this looked the perfect platform to lay the groundwork for a september taper announcement but some concerning economic releases and a surge in delta cases in the us may see the fed adopt a more cautious stance for now any suggestion from powell that a taper may not happen this year could give these markets another boost with it having until recently looked almost guaranteed the more cautious approach is likely to be adopted by many central banks in the coming months erlam added vaccine efforts should ensure full lockdowns are a thing of the past for many of these countries but the recovery will no doubt slow regardless as some restrictions are imposed and behaviours change it will be interesting to see whether the pfizer nyse pfe biontech vaccine getting full fda approval will significantly boost vaccine rates with some that were previously sceptical perhaps feeling more comfortable accepting it it s become such a polarized issue in many countries now it will still likely not be enough to convince some people but any gains will aid the

company weighted average net leverage middle market portfolio net leverage and middle market loan portfolio company weighted average ebitda middle market portfolio ebitda provide clarity into the underlying capital structure of psec s middle market loan portfolio investments and the likelihood that psec s overall portfolio will make interest payments and repay principal middle market portfolio net leverage reflects the net leverage of each of psec s middle market loan portfolio company debt investments weighted based on the current fair market value of such debt investments the net leverage for each middle market loan portfolio company is calculated based on psec s investment in the capital structure of such portfolio company with a maximum limit of 10 0x adjusted ebitda this calculation excludes debt subordinate to psec s position within the capital structure because psec s exposure to interest payment and principal repayment risk is limited beyond that point additionally subordinated structured notes other structured credit real estate investments investments for which ebitda is not available and equity investments for which principal repayment is not fixed are also not included in the calculation the calculation does not exceed 10 0x adjusted ebitda for any individual investment because 10 0x captures the highest level of risk to psec middle market portfolio net leverage provides psec with some guidance as to psec s exposure to the interest payment and principal repayment risk of psec s overall debt portfolio psec monitors its middle market portfolio net leverage on a quarterly basis middle market portfolio ebitda is used by psec to supplement middle market portfolio net leverage and generally indicates a portfolio company s ability to make interest payments and repay principal middle market portfolio ebitda is calculated using the ebitda of each of psec s middle market loan portfolio companies weighted based on the current fair market value of the related investments the calculation provides psec with insight into profitability and scale of the portfolio companies within our overall debt investments these calculations include addbacks that are typically negotiated and documented in the applicable investment documents including but not limited to transaction costs share based compensation management fees foreign currency translation adjustments and other nonrecurring transaction expenses together middle market portfolio net leverage and middle market portfolio ebitda assist psec in assessing the likelihood that psec will timely receive interest and principal payments however these calculations are not meant to substitute for an analysis of psec s our underlying portfolio company debt investments but to supplement such analysis primary origination strategies middle market lending we make directly originated agented loans to companies including companies which are controlled by private equity sponsors and companies that are not controlled by private equity sponsors such as companies that are controlled by the management team the founder a family or public shareholders this debt can take the form of first lien second lien unitranche or unsecured loans these loans typically have equity subordinate to our loan position we may also purchase selected equity co investments in such companies in addition to directly originated agented loans we also invest in senior and secured loans syndicated loans and high yield bonds that have been sold to a club or syndicate of buyers both in the primary and secondary markets these investments are often purchased with a long term buy and hold outlook and we often look to provide significant input to the transaction by providing anchoring orders middle market lending buyout this strategy involves purchasing senior and secured yield producing debt and controlling equity positions in operating companies across various industries we believe this strategy provides enhanced certainty of closure to sellers and the opportunity for management to continue in their current roles these investments are often structured in tax efficient partnerships enhancing returns real estate we purchase debt and controlling equity positions in tax efficient real estate investment trusts reit or reits the real estate investments of national property reit corp

how did biden s intelligence team concoct the 90 day report on coronavirus origins global times 08 13 august 25 2021 lacking solid evidence and making do with circumstantial evidence us desperately wants to frame china sources cartoon produced by xinhua shows us president joe biden turning to the intelligence community for a covid 19 virus origins story photo xinhua in may us president joe biden announced a jaw dropping decision demanding us intelligence officers to look into the origins of the coronavirus and he gave the task a deadline â 90 days the white house announced on monday that the review of this report is expected to be completed by its tuesday deadline as the report is due to come into public light in a few days the global times dug deep into how the us intelligence department attempted to solve a puzzle in three months that has baffled the world s scientists over the past year and a half even at the final stage biden s intelligence officials have little solid evidence in their hands to support the lab leak theory a hypothesis even us scientific institutions and allies find far fetched but the us teams still made do with second hand unreliable evidence to compile a report that tries to smear china as culprit for the virus origins sources close to the matter told the global times in order to churn out a report that makes china look bad the us also sought to clamp down on scientists and the who rope in its allies and coerce china s neighbors to join in its smear campaign against china according to sources the us true purpose is not about unearthing the origins of this mysterious virus instead it intends to exhaust china s diplomatic resources strengthen the us leverage on thwarting china s development and offset china s rising international influence a dead end white house press secretary jen psaki said on monday that it will take a few days to put together an unclassified version of the review for the public sources close to the matter told the global times previously that us intelligence agencies cannot produce any concrete proof or scientific evidence to support the lab leak theory the sources noted that the so called evidence which has been fabricated so far is mostly circumstantial and completely unreliable moreover the us research institutions and its allies also believe that the virus was almost certainly not created artificially and that it will be highly unlikely for them to draw definitive conclusions within 90 days which can verify the lab leak theory according to the sources an expert close to the who led origins tracing work told the global times on tuesday that there will be nothing major about the new evidence pointing to the lab leak theory and it would be similar studies as jesse bloom a researcher at the fred hutchinson cancer center in seattle has done in analyzing genetic sequences and the expert also doubted that the so called report would change the story as it may include both natural origin and lab origins as possible hypothesis with usual criticism of china cnn reported in early august that investigators both inside and outside the government have long sought genetic data from 22 000 virus samples that were being studied at the wuhan institute of virology wiv it also reported that it is unclear exactly how or when us intelligence agencies gained access to genetic data they were working on the global times found that an online open source intelligence group named drastic has been sourcing sequencing data trying to gain insights into the wiv when researchers publish sequences they typically post the raw data from which those sequences are assembled to a public database the economist reported last week that gilles demaneuf a data scientist working with drastic said he has a hunch the american intelligence community s 90 day study is using the same angle by analyzing the raw data from such a public database although the authenticity of data shared on those public platforms can be guaranteed there is still huge space yet for us intelligence officials to manipulate that data for their own purposes yang zhanqiu a virologist at wuhan university told the global times the chinese virologist also said that data about the wiv will offer a way forward only in the case if the virus indeed leaked from the lab so if the us sticks to that data it is yet more proof that the so called 90 day investigation is a presupposed farce to throw mud at the wiv and china sources also told the global times over the weekend that due to the lack of concrete evidence to frame china the us government instigated certain domestic media outlets to hype up the conspiracy that chinese wet markets are where the virus came from and pinned the theory as a back up plan for washington s china smear campaign the global times reporter noticed that bloomberg on august 17 published an article named delayed wuhan report adds crucial detail to covid origin puzzle to hype up the connection between huanan seafood market in wuhan and the coronavirus origins three days before biden launched his 90 day task michael r gordon a national security correspondent for the wall street journal wrote an article intelligence on sick staff at wuhan lab fuels debate on covid 19 origin claiming three researchers from wiv got sick with symptoms consistent with both covid 19 and common seasonal illness in november 2019 and tried to target the wiv as the virus origins suspect interestingly the same gordon also wrote an article for the new york times in 2002 when he was serving as correspondent for that newspaper and one year before the us launched war against iraq framing iraq attempting to acquire nuclear weapons later the evidence that the us presented for starting the iraq war was teased as washing powder in response to biden s upcoming release of the report wang wenbin spokesperson of china s ministry of foreign affairs said on tuesday that the us intelligence has a notorious record their so called origins tracing report isn t based on facts and evidence but only draws up a conclusion with made up evidence to frame china sources told the global times previously that us intelligence officials were also trying to find some witnesses or insiders during the initial stage of the outbreak in wuhan the city that first reported the virus in china prying into lockdown measures and restricted areas with people who work in the medical system biological research institutions or those who live in wuhan being their targets the officials were also collecting evidence to prove loopholes in china s anti epidemic work eyeing detailed information about covid 19 patients the lives of residents under lockdown the timing of diagnosis and patients movements before infection the source said despite the report not coming out yet some chinese and foreign experts said it is highly possible the biden administration would only provide an inconclusive answer as yang said the probe should be a technical issue that requires genetic analysis of the virus scientists in asia the us and europe should analyze the genetic profile of the virus that has emerged in the region and then discuss the information together to confirm the next steps of the investigation having an intelligence team to look for virus origins is ridiculous enough and it s unsurprising that biden would end up with no definitive answer but if biden seeks another investigation it will downgrade his administration s credibility and make it a laughing stock said yang if former us secretary of state mike pompeo had actual intelligence that would convince people he would have released it a foreign expert close to the who china joint team told the global times noting that biden has to address it because the republicans are aggressive pushing him to go down this path diplomatic front with little progress on the actual report itself the us also resorted to pressuring other countries the who and international scientists to turn them against china on the probe of coronavirus origins according to the source the next step for the us government is to continue pressuring the who and director general tedros adhanom ghebreyesus to make sure they would tilt toward the us yet china s refusal to participate in the us led second stage of the who virus origins tracing work and the joint statement china made with some developing countries that was sent to the who have seriously impeded the us plan to promote its virus origins investigation that targets china in desperation the us government has to seek support from the international community by perpetuating lies like china refuses to join the virus origins investigation moreover the us government will arrange the director of the white house office of science and technology policy and presidential science advisor to collude with government affiliated science advisers from the eu australia and japan to issue a statement on the second phase of the investigation to urge the chinese government to reflect on its decision of rejection expressing their disappointment regarding china and requiring the nation to shoulder responsibility and take action according to the sources moreover sources told the global times that the us is roping in china s neighbors with covid 19 vaccines access to participate in international affairs and other means for the us to access their official data information regarding early covid 19 cases and pulling them into the china smear campaign the us tends to prioritize china s neighboring countries as a major target of their coronavirus origins probe and divert international attention from european countries as well as latin america countries some european countries such as italy and spain already found traces of coronavirus earlier than when the alleged initial outbreak occurred in wuhan so did the us said yang noting that washington fears that targeting european countries or latin american countries who are geographically closer to the us may invite more suspicion upon itself facing the us political war on coronavirus origins which is designed to turn the international community against china yang xiyu a former chinese diplomat and senior research fellow at the china institute of international studies told the global times that china can also play the science card and cooperation card to cope with it china s responsibility highlighted by proposing scientific ways of finding the coronavirus origins and cooperation regarding covid 19 vaccines can also offset the us darkness selfishness and incapability web editor zhong wenxing liang jun

cryptocurrency is becoming more popular among marginalized groups who feel shunned and abused by traditional financial institutions according to a usa today harris poll conducted earlier this summer among the lgbtq community 25 own cryptocurrencies along with 23 of black americans and 17 of latino americans just 11 of the white population own cryptocurrency the study also found a significant portion of black 43 and latino 39 americans felt the banking and loan industry was unfair in how it treated them additionally more than half of black 58 latino 66 and lgbtq 59 americans surveyed say they don t feel welcome in traditional financial institutions those surveyed describe traditional institutions as not meant for people like me and believe cryptocurrency as a way to build and attain wealth harris poll ceo john gerzema supported the feeling there has been a long history of discrimination in investments gerzema told usa today and that could be why we have seen a wide demography of interest and inclusivity in crypto because it s new open and seemingly has fewer barriers to entry since cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin do not have a central body watching over their operations it sets them apart from stocks and bank accounts that are easier to track due to government and laws now some digital payment providers like square are working to educate more marginalized groups about finance and cryptocurrency although it s becoming more popular and can change the futures of some cryptocurrency does come with its issues for starters the value can swing wildly in april bitcoin hit a high of 63 729 for one coin however today that value is now 50 000 and in june fell below 30 000 also users can be victimized because there s no central body and cryptocurrency providers can tailor the situation to their advantage more than 600 users of the cryptocurrency exchange binance in a dozen countries hope to use international arbitration to get their money back after the site crashed on may 19 as a result traders were unable to move their funds as the price of cryptocurrency fell significantly binance only allows arbitration through the hong kong international arbitration center to get a hearing they must first pay 65 000 and binance s terms of service states people can only arbitrate individually

problems with global shipping are causing issues for industry bosses yesterday warned customers may face a shortage of certain foods and a smaller range of presents a retail boss has warned current food shortages are some of the worst he has ever seen while others blamed the shortfall of 90 000 lorry drivers on post brexit migration and the pandemic steve murrells co operative group chief executive told the times the shortages were at a worse level than at any time i have seen and revealed the company had reduced several ranges on offer in stores as a result of post brexit migration rules and coronavirus instead the company is now retraining members of staff to drive lorries to help deal with the loss of drivers in the industry with around 14 000 european drivers leaving the uk last year and only 600 returning the impact of supply chain shortages is already being felt on the ground with mcdonald s running out of milkshakes and bottled drinks this week while nando s and kfc have reported a shortage of chicken retail bosses yesterday warned the industry faces a shortfall of 90 000 lorry drivers as a perfect storm of covid and brexit strangles supply chains and threatens a shortage of popular gifts and staple foods steve murrells co operative group chief executive told the times the shortages were at a worse level than at any time i have seen as other retail bosses warn of a huge shortfall picture empty shelves in co op in july retail bosses yesterday warned the industry faces a shortfall of 90 000 lorry drivers as a perfect storm of covid and brexit strangles supply chains picture stock britons are now being warned to buy christmas presents early as issues with shipping from asia means shoppers may soon be offered a smaller range of products with demand for best selling items like playstation 5s and barbies threatening to outstrip supply meanwhile a dearth of workers in the uk means meat processors are already six weeks behind with their preparations which typically start in july raising the spectre of labour intensive items like pigs in blankets not being ready in time some producers are responding by cutting the number of animals they rear for the festive period with the supply of turkeys set to be 20percent lower than last year according to the british poultry association it is believed the shortage is partially as a result of many butchers leaving the uk or turning to driving lorries due to a surge in the popularity of online shopping as the crisis worsens the boss of the british retail consortium has called for the government to act to help solve the shortage of drivers helen dickinson chief executive of the brc said the uk faces a shortfall of 90 000 hgv drivers and it is consumers who will ultimately suffer for this so far disruption has been minimal thanks to the incredible work by retailers and their suppliers retailers are increasing pay rates offering bonuses and introducing new driver training schemes as well as directly supporting their suppliers in the movement of goods but government will need to play its part we are calling on the government to rapidly increase the number of hgv driving tests taking place provide temporary visas for eu drivers and to make changes on how hgv driver training can be funded co op s chief executive stevel murrells pictured revealed the company is now retraining members of staff to drive lorries to help deal with the loss of drivers in the industry the impact of supply chain shortages is already being felt on the ground with mcdonald s running out of milkshakes and bottled drinks this week picture stock there have also been some issues with the availability of potatoes according to catering firm lynx purchasing which said this had been driven by floods in producing countries such as germany and the netherlands a lack of lorry drivers and food processors is being partly blamed on the new brexit visa regime introduced on january 1 which penalises lower skilled migrants in favour of those with qualifications but global factors are relevant too bosses say including chinese port closures and a lack of shipping containers us vice president kamala harris yesterday urged americans to buy christmas toys early due to a shortage there nick allen chief executive of the british meat processors association said a labour shortage meant the industry was already well behind on getting ready for christmas he told mailonline you d normally start to prepare pigs in blankets and gammons at the beginning of july and they d go into the freezer and come out at christmas time but we re six weeks behind and not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel the shelves aren t going to be empty but it s hard to see how there won t be shortages of these things and the choice will get less britain has so far been unable to shake its dependency on eu workers who have been leaving due to the pandemic mr allen explained while the supply of new workers is being held back by stricter visa rules introduced on january 1 covid is one of the reasons why people are going home and not going back again but it fundamentally down to our post brexit immigration policy he said i try to avoid blaming brexit our politicians gave us an immigration policy and it was their choice with a million job vacancies in the country its night on impossible to fulfil all our needs the most common complaint among uk retailers and food producers is the shortage of lorry drivers which the road haulage association currently puts at 100 000 thousands of prospective drivers are waiting for their hgv tests due to a backlog caused by lockdown while many existing ones have left the uk after brexit or to be back with their families during covid dixons carphone is attempting to fill 180 driver vacancies by offering applicants a 1 500 signing on bonus and a 1 500 retention bonus while salaries have been boosted by at least 9 the sunday times reported meanwhile amazon is reportedly offering 1 000 joining bonuses to new employees to work in warehouses in coventry darlington dartford redditch and swansea the supply of turkeys set to be 20percent lower than last year according to predictions from the british poultry association importers are also suffering a financial hit with dramatically rising transport costs caused by a global lack of shipping containers and a slowdown in freight movements resulting from port closures chinese authorities recently shut ningbo zhoushan port which is one of the world s largest container terminals due to a covid outbreak gary grant founder and executive chairman of toy chain the entertainer said the cost of shipping a container from asia had increased from 1 700 to more than 13 000 8 000 over the past year the cost of containers as well as a shortage of them is proving very difficult across many industries not just ours he told mailonline what is unique to us is that christmas is a fixed date so we are under extreme pressure at the moment to move as much stock as we can but are significantly behind with the shipment of products there s not a shortage of toys but what will happen as when we get nearer to christmas the suppliers will not have to back up stock that we ve previously relied upon so the range of stock we have may be narrower mr grant said the products most likely to be impacted were the ones already selling well including paw patrol barbie and rainbocorns shoppers need to buy early i m a retailer so sceptics would say that i m going to tell people to do that he said i m not encouraging people to go and panic buy but there is going to be shortage of certain goods so the way to get around that is to buy early mcdonald s became the latest restaurant chain in the uk to be hit by supply shortages yesterday with no milkshakes or bottled drinks available in any of its outlets global shipping demands on maintaining a steady flow of containers from asia to the west including the return of empty ones this is currently being disrupted by the slow processing of shipments in europe and the us as well as port closures in china alex veitch general manager of public policy at logistics uk said shippers around the world have been affected by a number of factors most notably the impact of covid 19 which has led to port closures the subsequent displacement of containers rising costs and difficulties securing capacity many shippers have shifted their goods to air or rail freight where possible but shipping dominates the global freight market and we call on shipping lines to do all they can to improve the situation for their customers mcdonald s became the latest restaurant chain in the uk to be hit by supply shortages yesterday with no milkshakes or bottled drinks available in any of its outlets the fast food giant which has 1 250 restaurants has stopped serving the drinks this week but said staff are working hard to return these items to the

flaws in the acquisition process found in nasa s human landing system blue origin was originally in competition with spacex and a third firm called dynetics for what was expected to be two nasa contracts after congress trimmed the space agency s budget nasa announced in april 2021 that spacex s human landing system hls would be the sole contractor spacex s 2 91 billion contract was

traverse city mich ap scientists have traced the genetic makeup of lake trout a feat that should boost efforts to rebuild populations of the prized fish in the great lakes and other north american waters where they ve been hammered by invasive species overfishing and pollution officials said tuesday u s and canadian researchers completed a reference genome or digital genetic map for lake trout it will help explain characteristics that enabled the species to evolve and spread across its vast range with certain types becoming better suited to particular locations and depths the data also will provide vital information for managers of programs that stock lakes with young trout to supplement natural reproduction said marc gaden spokesman for the great lakes fishery commission lake trout are widely distributed across north america and there are huge variations in habitat use shape size body mass color gaden said we need to understand why they look the way they do why some types are more successful in some habitats than others why some types in hatcheries do better than others the team of experts with several u s and canadian universities and government agencies published their genome report aug 5 in the journal molecular ecology resources william taylor chairman of the fishery commission and a michigan state university fisheries ecologist described it as a vital missing link in our efforts to restore lake trout lake trout long dominated the great lakes as a predator fish and are common in other large north american lakes they sustained aboriginal tribes for generations and were a primary target of post settlement commercial fishing operations their numbers in the great lakes plummeted in the last century with the invasion of sea lamprey an eel like parasite that attaches to fish and sucks their bodily fluids researchers eventually developed a poison that is applied to tributary rivers where the lamprey spawn keeping them in check but habitat loss overfishing pollution and other invaders have hampered efforts to bring back the lake trout although they can live for decades it takes about seven years for them to become sexually mature and many don t survive long enough to reproduce agencies continue to stock them in all the great lakes except lake superior where the species has recovered well gaden said development of the reference genome should help managers fine tune those efforts the more you can understand what makes this organism tick the more you can do to take steps to rehabilitate it he said genomes of salmonids a family that includes lake trout are harder to compile than those of many other animals the research team said having a publicly available map of the lake trout genome removes most of the initial hurdles associated with doing conservation oriented genomic research makes it significantly easier to compare results across studies and will hopefully quicken the pace of scientific discovery said seth smith of michigan state university the study s lead author shawn sitar a fisheries research biologist with the michigan department of natural resources who wasn t involved with the study said returning lake trout to their historically influential role in the great lakes will require understanding differences between their types at the sub species level which the genome research will support we see them in different habitats functioning in ecologically different ways living differently sitar said if you want to restore a forest ecosystem you don t put in one just one tree you want to restore the integrity of what the ecosystem was originally john flesher the associated press
see also immigration is this the breaking point it would only take one speech plan b jared taylor for congress watch the latest video at bitchute com american renaissance editor jared taylor our next speaker is a naturalized u s citizen and therefore unfortunately ineligible to run for the presidency he is however one of the very rare recent citizens that fits the original 1790 criteria for naturalization namely a free white person of good character i m giving him the benefit of the doubt about character of course i am speaking of peter brimelow the presiding genius of vdare com before he started vdare com peter brimelow had a brilliant career as a financial journalist but brilliance will not save you if you start speaking the truth of course national review s loss has been very much our gain because mr brimelow has built his site up into an indispensable voice of sanity an indispensable voice of sanity that of course the southern poverty law center calls a hate group well the plc is wrong and i can prove it the brimelow family was at home and a country music song came on over the radio one of their little girls piped up and said what s this song about momma and momma explained that the singer was sad because she loves a man who doesn t love her well then the little girl said daddy will love her daddy loves everyone hate group indeed well today mr brimelow will speak to us about the trump tsunami and the future of the historic american nation please welcome peter brimelow vdare com editor peter brimelow thank you jared and congratulations on this triumph here as jared said i have children more or less the same age as james edwards 5 3 and 1 and i worry what s going to happen to them after i m gone when i spoke here last year i made a bold and radical assertion that nobody believed and it turned out to be wrong i predicted that jared taylor would run for congress in his home 10th district of virginia against the useless rubio endorsing rino barbara comstock do you realize jared that she returned trump s 3 000 campaign contribution as late as march you could tell that the evil party was scared the spy that the splc had here and whoever it is may be sitting next to you ladies and gentlemen had various nasty things to say about my talk but the spy was afraid to mention the impending threat of a taylor tsunami well jared didn t run one of his reasons was legitimate sort of getting on the ballot in virginia turns out to be a real bureaucratic hassle it is a case study of how the managerial state represses dissent and he actually owes me an article on that i ll be waiting for it to come through as soon as he s gotten through with this conference but the main reason was that jared was entirely focused on getting out this year s edition of the color of crime i assume the color of crime is available somewhere in the back it s a great work on who actually commits crime in america and it s well worth buying so you can see the urgency i mean the color of crime might change and all this work would be wasted now it really infuriates me when people don t do what i say and as revenge on jared i am going to reveal one of his most shameful family secrets as you know he is very proud of his confederate ancestors well i have to tell you that on his mother s side he is directly descended from general george b mcclellan that s an in joke for those of you who haven t been bitten by the civil war bug by the way james as you know patrick cleburne was a british immigrant he d served in the british army well i did make another assertion that turned out a bit better to put this in context the amren conference was in mid april of last year 2015 it wasn t completely clear that the congressional republicans were going to cave in on their campaign promise to reverse obama s executive amnesty but it was fairly clear and that was very bad because it meant that there would be no longer any conceivable chance of stopping the left s drive to elect a new people somewhere in the decade after 2040 federal immigration policy will reduce american whites that is to say the people before the 1965 immigration act who were known as americans into a minority and america won t survive without them which is why i am worried about the future of my children my talk last year was called immigration is this the breaking point and most of it was devoted to what i called plan b what the historic american nation that is the american nation as it had evolved by 1965 should do if the breaking point broke the wrong way if they find that they have lost control of their polity their nation state and there a lot of things such as subdividing the existing states to reflect actual ethnic realities that i think will have to be done eventually and i was speaking obviously before donald trump announced his run for president on june 16 2015 incredibly still not a year ago at vdare com we had just posted an article by one of our writers matthew richer predicting that trump would run and that he would run on the immigration issue i edited this article we posted it but i can t say that i really believed it i ve been writing about immigration for nearly a quarter of a century my cover story on immigration in national review which eventually grew into my immigration book alien nation came out in 1992 we ve seen a lot of false dawns so i m going to take the liberty of reading out what i said last april to give you the argument that laid behind my assertion to quote me does anyone remember jeb bush he was the inevitable nominee this time last year i went on so i still think it s possible that in this presidential election cycle someone walker rick santorum will decide to drop the bomb on the immigration issue in that case the sense that this is the breaking point on immigration could be optimistic i don t want to rule this out well this is why i m rich and famous in fact it didn t even take a speech it just took a soundbite a few sentences in trump s declaration announcement is anyone here from washington state right well you know that the reports right now that there are so called earthquake swarms gathering around mount st helens in washington state and that another eruption may be imminent that gets everybody s attention because of the huge mess that the 1980 eruption caused well there have been earthquake swarms around the immigration issue in the u s dating back more than 20 years jared and i and others have been saying for more than 20 years that the american political order is built on an increasingly stressed seismic fault the political elite left and right just went on building now they have trump they deserve him the moral of this story by the way is listen to the alt right or the dissident right as john derbyshire calls it trump didn t say much in that soundbite he hasn t said that much actually about immigration at all he doesn t have to he often fails to bring the issue up in speeches and debates in wisconsin for example senator ted cruz who really came a long way on this issue during the campaign actually gave better technical answers on immigration than trump in the debate he talked about the labor market impact of immigration and he talked about the possible substitution of mechanization for cheap labor but we can t judge trump like a normal politician i guess that s obvious how many of you have been to a trump rally i d say at least a quarter of the audience well as you know it s a phenomenon he doesn t give written speeches he just gets up and talks extemporizes sometimes he forgets his lines sometimes he gets excited the crowd gets excited and he decides that he s gone far enough and he stops gets on his plane and goes home sometimes he just gets flat out bored for example when he is asked for the 35th time how he feels about david duke they have to ask him about his feelings because no one has ever proved a connection between him and david duke and above all he simply will not prepare for debates specifically from vdare com s point of view that means that he often fails to point out the immigration dimension of the various questions he s asked about such as the minimum wage the answer tighten up the labor market with an immigration moratorium i do think that this lack of preparation could be a problem for him in the general election but what do i know what does anyone know about the trump phenomenon what trump does do in compensation though is that he will periodically put down a hard formal marker on issues he really wants to claim so on august 15 of last year he issued a policy statement on immigration prepared with senator jeff sessions that was simply stunning i have been in this business for 25 years and i was amazed he wants to end birthright citizenship he wants to pause legal immigration he wants to tighten the labor markets he wants to have e verify the whole thing jared and i actually did a podcast about it here s what ann coulter and i have enormous respect for ann don t be deceived by her bimbo stereotyping said about trump s immigration statement it s the greatest political document since the magna carta and i don t care if donald trump wants to perform abortions in the white house after his policy paper i would say that that was qualified support from ann she is pro life of course for reasons that bear analysis you still don t often see the immigration issue mentioned in main stream media analysis of trump s triumph the blogger mickey kaus who is a very fine fellow has even started what he calls the omerta olympics listing the msm thumbsuckers that don t mention immigration but trump knows that immigration is an issue and that it s an issue that is working for him because he hears his crowds spontaneously chanting build the wall it s a regular feature at trump rallies recently i ve seen the role of the immigration issue resurfacing even in the msm for example this week in vanity fair the writer t a frank published an article which i recommend to you headlined the one issue that could destroy hillary clinton he used fivethirtyeight s interactive swing o matic feature which allows you to make various assumptions about electorate and he concluded fundamentally then a small percentage of white voters hating clinton s stance on immigration could outweigh a large percentage of hispanic voters liking it emphasis added that s because in spite of all the hype there are many more white a k a american voters about 6 or 7 times more then there are hispanic voters of course we like this article particularly because at vdare com we did essentially the same calculations using the same feature back in december people should listen to the alt right so what now i m going to ask four questions firstly can trump win secondly can he be trusted if he wins thirdly if he can be trusted can he actually do anything and fourthly what happens if he loses first can trump win well as i said when i appeared on james edwards political cesspool back in september in this crazy system of course trump can win the big gop problem and i mean here not the party of paul ryan but what we at vdare com sometimes call the gap the generic american party the default mode political expression of white americans of the historic american nation is 1 low white share and 2 low white turnout it s not absence of minority outreach white turnout actually fell in the last two presidential elections it fell overall the gop generally get somewhere between 50 and 60 percent of the white vote in 2010 and 2014 congressional elections it got about 60 percent but there are enormous sectional variations for example mitt romney actually lost the white vote in iowa he lost the white vote in iowa extraordinary so what the gop basically needs to do is to southernize the white vote it needs to have everyone in the country voting like southern whites vote for example as you all know there are a lot of lamentations about how california is unwinnable for the gop right now well the demographics of california are really no different than the demographics in texas it s just that in texas the whites vote almost 70 percent for the gop they vote together and that s not high by southern standards the gop or the gap needs the white vote to tip like residential neighborhoods once the minorities reach a certain point whites leave and that s actually happening at the state and local level the gop is very strong on the state and local level it controls a historically high share of state governments not that it s done anything to deserve it it s just happening spontaneously now the democrats can rile up their base very easily by screaming about white racism and that s what all these msm campaigns about black lives matter and ferguson and trayvon martin are about riling up the minority base but the gop has not been able to figure out a way to rile up its base really since 1988 since george bush won against dukakis when it used the pledge of allegiance issue willie horton and so on however i think that this year that hillary is going to solve the gop gap s problem because quite unnoticed by the msm which doesn t report this sort of thing she s moved very far to the left on immigration i ll come back to this now of course the big news last week is that the gap between trump and clinton has been closing very dramatically rasmussen and fox are actually showing him ahead but these polls interestingly enough show that he is still is not in the historically high range of the white share he actually seems to be doing better than romney did among minorities which is a reason why some people don t believe the poll what this says to me is that if trump does start to move the white vote into these historic high levels even 60 percent or so we re looking at a landslide but anyway for the republican party as mrs thatcher used to say there is no alternative gop gap can never out pander the democrats and go after the minority vote so they have no alternative also i think it s important to note that even if trump loses he s already shown that immigration and the whole concept of america first works electorally there are some elections where losing candidates blaze trails for the future the obvious examples goldwater in 64 mcgovern in 72 they transformed their parties and showed their parties new ways to move forward generally speaking with campaign consultants you can talk to them all you want and you can show them all sorts of numbers but you can t get through to them until they actually see an election that s worked and trump of course in these primaries has shown that the immigration issue does work well the second question can he be trusted if he wins and the answer is absolutely not you can t trust any of these characters it s entirely possible that he could be another schwarzenegger that he could be content to reign rather than to rule we don t really know what he s going to do when he gets into the white house but we did know what jeb bush was going to do and we did know what marco rubio was going to do even if he had the grace to lie about it in the campaign you know i wrote an article saying that trump was a wrecking ball because i was very struck by a comment in the national review comment thread in those days nr used to allow comments they were 100 hostile to national review s line so they had to shut them down the writer said after 30 years of duplicity by the media and cultural elite and the corrupt governing class we ve seized upon quite consciously a wrecking ball that s what trump is a wrecking ball on the bright side i think we can take some comfort in trump s personality he doesn t seem particularly drawn to the quiet life and forcing the beltway establishment to face the immigration issue that s a pretty good way to not have a quiet life and he does like building things i think we can count on the wall so the third question if he can be trusted can he actually do anything now here i want to offer a word of comfort to the left people get very apocalyptic at the idea of trump in the white house but the fact is that the american presidency is inherantly a very weak office it s much less powerful than the prime minister in a parliamentary system like britain or canada who by definition controls the legislature and certainly can count on his own party trump s own party will be utterly shell shocked if he wins and quite possibly hostile unless there is a landslide and as i said i think that is possible so donald trump could be like king kong in the old movies the curtain goes up he s on the stage he s got this metal frame that goes up to his waist to hold him down and he s roaring a lot but he can t move you can picture that can t you particularly the roaring but you know king kong got free even without congress there s a lot that trump could do famously the presidency is a bully pulpit supposing trump started showing up at the funerals of the victims of illegal aliens like obama and his officials have to publicize the blacklivesmatter scam he could take a lot of legitimate executive actions the center for immigration studies has listed 79 different executive actions that would tighten up enforcement and then you would get attrition through enforcement what romney called self deportation the illegal stock would slowly start to diminish at vdare com we are very fond of what we call strategic deportation that is to say you arrest and deport extremely visible illegal aliens and they are not in the shadows and send them a message so next time there is a big illegal alien demonstration round them up and ship them out send a message and i think that would start an avalanche you know the last time there was an illegal alien crisis president eisenhower solved it in just a few months after he came into office with operation wetback but he actually only deported a couple hundred thousand people over 1 million people just up and left and that s what would happen now and then there is legislation unlike richard spencer where s richard spencer in the audience and many people under 30 i take reagan very seriously and i think that reagan pointed the way for trump on what to do he focused on only a small number of things star wars tax cuts defense build up that sort of thing so i would say that trump should also focus on a small number of things my favorite is things that would reduce the political impact of immigration and that would allow us to do more things in the future my favorite is abolishing birthright citizenship it removes right away the incentive for people to immigrate illegally because their children won t be citizens and it removes the democrats incentive to encourage illegal immigration the great prize of course is an immigration moratorium a cut off of all legal immigration but i would also be interested in an official english amendment because i think that it s immensely popular and it sends a very important symbolic message there s a report this week of some poor milwaukee custard shop owner who s been hassled because he ordered his staff to talk to his customers in english and he was immediately threatened with federal legislation he s allegedly violated some federal labor code or something and he had to back down well imagine if the federal labor code worked in the other way and said that you can t insist on having people who speak spanish which is common now in large parts of the country which in effect discriminates in favor of immigrants against native born americans that s what the quebecois did they made it illegal for employers to specify that they wanted to hire bilingual people and it worked for them they got control of quebec now the fourth question what if he loses ann coulter gave a very affecting interview on bbc a day or so ago she said that if trump doesn t win it s over we re going to be homesick for the rest of our lives because america s gone i think that if hillary wins there s a very real danger that she will launch merkel type immigration surge there have been several immigration surges through executive action right now obama has encouraged central americans to come in he s encouraging right now a lot of cubans he s essentially dismantled border control in his last two years but i m talking about a large legislated surge the executive editor at national review reihan salam is a very interesting figure and i m going to get him into trouble here because i think that he is one of these conservativism inc operatives who actually gets the message about immigration but doesn t want to say so out loud very much there s a lot of these people out there salam for example has written very discreetly about the need to abolish birthright citizenship he wrote an article just recently called trump s immigration disaster he blamed everything on trump of course and that s why they allowed him to publish it i guess but if you read it closely he was actually saying that democrats have moved very far to the left on immigration as a culmination of a process that has been going on for many years long before trump and now they ve completely gone overboard they are against enforcement of all types hillary has made it very clear that if anyone can get into this country they can stay and of course they want to expand immigration in various ways so salam said this if hillary is our next president an outcome that is all but ordained if trump is the nominee we ll see about that it is a safe bet that her first big legislative push will be on immigration she will characterize her victory over trump as a repudiation of the restrictionist cause and a mandate for immigration legislation more permissive than the comprehensive immigration reform bill backed by president obama unlike obama and george w bush who felt obligated to make their pathways to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants seem onerous clinton has made it clear that she intends to make her pathway to citizenship as cheap and easy as possible he goes on so far conservatives haven t given much thought to hillary clinton s immigration agenda to the extent that her views have been addressed at all they ve been treated as little more than campaign bluster that is a mistake donald trump s success has made it far more likely that she will be our next president and we need to start thinking very hard about what that means now by conservative of course salam means national review type cuckservatives who are actually doing their best to get hillary elected right now and have all of these awful things happen to america so i think salam is subtly undercutting the national review editors they re just too stupid to notice nevertheless the fact is that in this election trump is capable of using hillary s extremism against her mitt romney jeb bush they just couldn t do it what we are looking at here is the climax of a mortal struggle between what we call at vdare com america and anti america between the historic american nation on the one hand the nation that emerged at the time of the 1965 immigration act basically white and the so called emerging america which is basically minority and very heavily post 1965 immigration act stock with a veneer of various types of renegade whites hillary wants to deliver the death blow in that struggle as i was packing to trek out here from connecticut i found a may 19th article in new york magazine by jonathan chait a real nogoodnik chait was basically twisting national review editor rich lowry s tail because lowry had been whining about how donald trump had hijacked the tea party movement and lowry said the animating concern of the tea party movement was limited government and constitutionalism chait said that this was totally untrue there s actually deep polling data on what the tea party people thought about things and chait said the tea party was an ethno nationalist revolt against obama rooted in fear of social change conservative leaders by which he meant cuckservative leaders in other words the conservativism inc people pretended this revolt was a demand for their agenda but the dissatisfaction of the base implies that the conservative agenda was never the thing that motivated it trump hasn t hijacked the tea party he s un hijacked it now i particularly like this because i said the same thing in 2009 also looking at deep polling data i wrote a piece about the contemporary attacks on the tea party over race and i said yes it is about race quite right too of course these tea party people were not racist in the sense that they were hostile toward other races they weren t even proposing anything that had anything to do with other races or even immigration but what was telling was the deep polling you could see these were overwhelmingly white people and they were very concerned about the way america was going i may have said this before but you should listen to the alternative right so chait and i agree the difference is that i just think the american white ethno nationalist revolt is a good thing i think american whites have rights as trump said in his foreign policy speech the nation state remains the true foundation for happiness and harmony i just think the historic american nation deserves a state that foreign policy speech by the way was reportedly written by one of trump s jewish aides he is completely surrounded by jews this attempt to make him appear anti semitic is weird well i said a year ago it will only take one speech my prediction this year it will only take one election and then mount america will really blow thank you very much peter brimelow is the editor of vdare com his best selling book alien nation common sense about america s immigration disaster is now available in kindle format

compensation from the links on this page btw prices are accurate and items in stock at the time of posting you may not be aware of this but it was equal masturbation day on august 22 the event which was launched by sexual wellness brand womanizer in 2020 is centred on the masturbation gap between female identifying folks and male identifying people but more than that it offers a chance to look at masturbation the way we view it and the unhelpful ideas that tend to get in the way of pleasure according to a survey completed by womanizer which looked at the habits of 1 000 aussies found that while the gap in masturbation rates is smaller one per cent lower women still engage in solo sex 64 per cent less than men while there s certainly nothing wrong with having no interest in solo sex just like there s nothing wrong with enjoying it the purpose of highlighting these gaps is significant in that it closely relates to the feelings of shame that many women grow up feeling regarding sex and pleasure the survey found that things are slowly progressing for women while rates of masturbation slightly dropped in men year on year the average rate of masturbation for aussie men in 2021 was 144 compared to 155 in 2020 johanna rief head of sexual empowerment at womanizer speculated that this could be a knock on effect from covid restrictions with less alone time but there s no real evidence to suggest precisely why it s happened the topic of solo sex has always had loads of stigma and misinformation surrounding it so i thought it would be useful to dig into the biggest problem areas and how to avoid them getting in the way read more sexhacker the biggest bedroom problems facing aussies what are some of the biggest barriers to self pleasure georgia grace sexologist and sexual wellness expert for womanizer explained that while this is a deeply personal thing there are a handful of themes that tend to pop up particularly for women it could be limited education low sexual self confidence sexual shame not knowing how or what to do not so great past sexual experiences she explained on the other side of things men and people with penises masturbate with sex toys at a much lower rate than women and people with vulvas data from lovehoney suggests in a statement on this lovehoney shared that only one third of males 35 have masturbated using a sex toy compared to nearly three quarters 72 of females however interestingly they are open to toy use with nearly half 48 having used a sex toy during partnered sex sure male identifying folks may be masturbating at a generally higher rate but if they re limiting the means by which they access pleasure that certainly counts as a solo sex barrier too no read more can you masturbate too often while in a relationship there are issues with how we frame masturbation period lucy wark gm at normal sexual education and wellness brand explained to me over the phone that looking at younger generations specifically normal s data also indicated there was a gender gap in masturbation that s slowly closing among millennials the number or the percentage of female identifying people who masturbate either daily or a few times a week is about 22 and the percentage among male identifying people is over 50 she explained that when considering these figures it s important to ask questions like have you ever tried it then how frequently do you do it and also how do you feel about it but beyond that wark shared that when looking at these stats it s important to examine the different ways we talk about masturbation according to gender too a lot of which is unhelpful or downright harmful for lots of male identifying people there s a lot of jokey conversation about masturbation but there s almost no empowering or vulnerable or educational conversation about masturbation she said alternatively she highlighted that with female identifying people can be much more of a spectrum from people who are actually sort of starting to talk and be pleasure activists and talk about this in a really empowering way through to people who sort of are still dealing with a lot of internalised or even like real self directed shame about masturbation as well okay so what are some tips for boosting our enjoyment of solo sex georgia grace shared here that it s really worth spending some time figuring out what s going to work for you as there s no one size fits all approach here i invite my clients to think about what they can do to create the context for a good time is it locking the door putting on a playlist having a shower or doing it in the shower setting a timer getting your toys ready and charged i ask my clients to think about really great past sexual experiences and reflect on what it was about the context that made it so good and how can they recreate this she said abbie chatfield who recently released a vibrator the abbie with sex toy brand vush also shared her top solo sex tips with me many of which echo grace s suggestions my biggest tip for turning yourself on and probably reaching a bigger orgasm is seducing yourself she told me over email have a nice bath put on some candles touch yourself slowly and seduce yourself the way you d want to be seduced by a partner and when it comes to feeling sexy she highlighted that the best thing you can do is wear something you re comfortable in i m more trackies pulled down t shirt on lying on the back but lingerie pyjamas nothing at all whatever works for you just wear something that you feel good in her other key suggestion use lube especially if you re introducing a sex toy lube is criminally underrated in a solo sesh she shared it should be your best friend to help explore your body stimulation isn t just for the clitoris g spot or p spot move the abbie vibrator over different parts of your body and see what works for you in addition to that grace highlighted the power of surrounding yourself with sex positive people and information look to podcasts books and shows that will encourage you then do your best to take the pressure off there s no right or wrong here your only requirement is to allow yourself to have a good time whatever that means maybe you start by listening and dancing to sensual music reading an erotic novel giving yourself a sensual massage or a sensual shower she shared explore daily moments of pleasure you don t need to go in all at once start with what feels really comfortable and exciting to you and as always if you re feeling overwhelmed unsure or stuck you can always seek out the support of a sex educator or sexologist who can chat you through your concerns

in this week s article we examine the case of village of bedford park v expedia inc nos 16 3932 16 3944 7th cir 2017 in which thirteen illinois municipalities the municipalities assert that the online travel agencies otas have withheld money owed to them under their hotel tax ordinances the otas operate their online travel websites under the merchant model customers pay an ota directly to reserve rooms at hotels the ota has contracted with the participating hotels set a room rental rate the ota charges the customer a price that includes that rate the estimated tax owed to the municipality and additional charges for the ota s services after the customer s stay the hotel invoices the ota for the room rate and taxes and remits the taxes collected to the municipality the municipalities argue that they have been shorted tax revenue over the years because the otas do not remit taxes on the full price that customers pay to illustrate assume a 5 percent tax if a customer books a room directly with a hotel for 100 a night the hotel collects 5 for taxes and remits that to the municipality but if a customer books a room through an ota for 100 and the hotel s room rate is only 60 the ota pays the hotel 63 and the hotel remits 3 to the municipality the municipalities seek to collect the additional 2 from the otas but none of the municipal ordinances place a duty on the otas to collect or remit the taxes so the municipalities have no recourse against the otas the otas are entitled to summary judgment against all of the municipalities terror targets update las vegas killer s brain

accommodation technology companies triometric and snapshot the study spoke to chain hotels independent properties and management companies travel law cases of the week in the village of bedford case the court noted that the facts of this case are not highly disputed but their legal significance is at issue is how the otas in this case expedia priceline travelocity and orbitz function and the thirteen tax ordinances ota practices the otas enter into contracts with hotels under which the hotels agree to make rooms available for the otas which then market those rooms and allow customers to reserve them through their websites the otas do not pre pay for rooms and re rent them to customers and they do not bear any loss if the rooms are not reserved and the hotels can cease offering rooms through the otas at any time method of payment when a customer reserves a room through an ota he pays the ota directly the ota serves as the merchant of record on the customer s credit card the otas present the price in two line items first a charge for the room and second a charge for taxes and fees the charge for the room includes the room rate as set by the hotel plus additional charges set by the otas the customer never sees the hotel s room rate but must agree to the otas terms and conditions which state that the price charged includes the cost of the hotel plus consideration for the ota s services the taxes and fees charge includes the estimated taxes the hotel will owe on the rental plus additional fees set by the ota if the customer incurs additional charges during the stay he pays those to the hotel directly after the customer checks out the hotel invoices the ota or charges a virtual credit card provided by the ota for the room rate plus applicable taxes otas do not sell hotel rooms although representatives from the otas and statements made to the securities and exchange commission indicate that the otas sell hotel rooms to customers the otas assert that this a merely industry jargon contracts between hotels and the otas confirm that the otas do not actually buy and never acquire the right to enter or grant possession of hotel rooms instead the otas take reservation requests from customers and transmit those to the hotels the contracts require the hotels to honor those requests but the customer does not obtain the right to occupy the rooms until he checks in at the hotel otas provide additional services the otas do provide additional services to customers between payment and check in at the hotel in fact a customer will likely only deal with the ota prior to checking in because otas handle reservation modifications cancellations and refunds the otas generally enforce a hotel s cancellation policy but sometimes set their own policies and charge their own cancellation fees the otas also often provide customer service support but some contracts specify that the otas will refer hotel specific questions to the hotels municipal ordinances though each of the thirteen ordinances has unique aspects all fall into one of the three general categories those that place the duty to collect and remit the tax on owners operators and managers of hotel or hotel rooms those that apply to all persons engaged in the business of renting hotel rooms and those that incorporate elements of both owners operators managers seven municipalities have ordinances that impose a tax on the use and privilege of renting leasing or letting hotel and motel rooms while the hotel guest bears responsibility for the tax the ordinances generally place the duty of collecting the tax from the renter and paying it to the municipality on the owner operator or manager of hotels engaged in renting rooms three of the municipalities impose a tax on persons engaged in the business of renting leasing or letting rooms in a hotel in two of the municipalities the tax rate is a percentage of gross rental receipts from renting leasing or letting rooms in a hotel the third municipality s ordinance requires the tax to be stated separately as an additional charge on individual billings but does not specify what amount the tax rate applies to hybrids the last three municipalities have ordinances encompassing elements of both types of taxes for example des plaines taxes all persons engaged in the business of renting leasing or letting rooms in a hotel or motel but the tax ordinance places a duty on operators of hotels or motels to keep records and on owners of hotels to file monthly tax returns reflecting the tax received the ordinance also requires the owner to pay the taxes due at the time of filing warrenville s ordinance is similar in relevant respects burr ridge taxes the use and privilege of engaging in the business of renting leasing or letting of room s in a motel or hotel but the ordinance places the duty to pay the tax on he owner manager or operator of each hotel or motel conclusion the court analyzed each of the three types of municipal ordinances regarding the category owners operators and managers the court noted that otas do not perform the function of running a hotel they perform one set of functions that a hotel does making room reservations processing financial transactions and handling customer service with respect to those transactions but that the otas engage in one hotel function does not transform them into operators of hotels most of the ordinances list those with the duty to collect a tax as owners operators and managers of hotels the otas have no duty to collect or remit hotel occupancy taxes regarding the category of entities engaged in the business of renting hotel rooms the court noted that none of the ordinances define engaged in the business of renting or engaged in renting renting implies ownership and granting possession of property here hotel rooms as discussed the otas do not own hotels or hotel rooms and they cannot independently grant consumers access to hotel rooms and regarding hybrids the court noted that the last three ordinances are slightly more complicated but the otas are not required to pay taxes to the municipalities under any of them the author thomas a

generation and finally for the fourth quarter fy 21 our return on invested capital increased to 14 9 the highest quarterly roic in over five years i would now like to turn the call back over to mike for closing comments and annual outlook mike baur chairman and chief executive officer thanks steve in a press release earlier today we announced the retirement of longtime director jack reilly and the appointment of charlie mathis to our board of directors this is a well deserved thank you to jack for 20 years of service and a welcome back to the company for charlie from 2012 to 2016 charlie served as scansource s cfo and he was instrumental in crafting the strategy that resulted in our intelisys acquisition as we exit fy 21 with such momentum we are increasingly more confident of the growth and valuation creation opportunity ahead for scansource in the past we have provided quarterly financial guidance and we were always explaining to our investors that our hardware distribution business works with limited visibility without bookings or backlog however with the change in our business to a hybrid model where we have more recurring revenue each year and the growing attach rate of our services and software to our hardware sales we have decided to provide an annual outlook for the first time for fiscal year 2022 we expect our year over year net sales growth to be at least 5 5 and we expect adjusted ebitda to be at least 135 million this compares to last year of 118 million finally we are pleased to announce our 100 million share repurchase authorization that reflects the board s continued confidence in our strategic plan we will now open it up for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from keith housum of northcoast research your line is open keith housum northcoast research analyst good afternoon guys and great job question for you on the inventory levels inventory levels were roughly equal to last year we re seeing this as kind of surprising based on the supply constraints that we re seeing on the overall market can you talk to the quality of your inventory levels and any insight you have in terms of the supply chain constraints as you look into the first quarter mike baur chairman and chief executive officer yes hey keith thanks for your question good to hear your voice i think as it relates to supply chain look i would have to say that i m really pleased with the work we ve done and what we ve had to do to navigate the environment over the past several quarters and i have to hand it to our sales and our head of our supplier services and purchasing teams for doing what i really think was an outstanding job dealing with the environment we managed inventory well over the past two three quarters and i believe that we ll be able to continue to navigate the environment moving forward keith housum northcoast research analyst now would you say that your sales were impacted by your inability to obtain any products steve jones senior executive vice president and chief financial officer not really nothing that negligible if anything keith housum northcoast research analyst got you and then you guys had issued guidance for probably second quarter of 2020 if my memory is correct would you say that you guys have increased i guess confidence in your ability to forecast but i think it was one of the issues that guys were citing as why you didn t provide guidance mike baur chairman and chief executive officer hi keith it s mike yes we certainly spent a lot of time over the last few quarters making sure we can understand what is driving our growth for the last four quarters and going forward and we really believe we ve gotten a significant advantage now having recurring revenue become a bigger part of our business and the attachment of recurring revenue services and software to hardware makes that transaction stickier than it was in the past so we believe we have more confidence and then secondly if you remember we really restructured the sales organization a year and a half two years ago and i think what john and his team have done this past year to better develop a relationship both in a transactional basis but more importantly strategic so that our customers are spending a lot more time talking to us about their planned purchases where they re going to grow what areas and this relationship that has really dramatically changed over the last year is also enabling us to do our business more efficiently back to your inventory question and so we have better knowledge of what our customers see coming than ever before and i think that s a big change and what gives me a lot more confidence it still doesn t mean just for the record that we re going to have this thing perfectly done this is our attempt at a longer term outlook we believe quarterly was just always really hard and still can be because we still will have some seasonality in our business but we believe providing this first annual outlook which by the way will update quarterly will be a way for us to show our confidence in our business keith housum northcoast research analyst got you i appreciate it i m going to jump into the queue questions mike baur chairman and chief executive officer thank keith operator thank you our next question comes from chris mcginnis of sidoti and company your line is open chris mcginnis sidoti and company analyst thanks for taking questions and nice quarter can you just touch on the market share gains you talked about is that sustainable and what s driving that is it the offering or the ability to get supply can you just dive into that a little bit more thank you john eldh senior executive vice president and chief revenue officer yes chris this is john thanks for the question yes the market share gains first of all i do think they are absolutely sustainable covid really was kind of an ignition point for digital transformation initiatives as you know all across the business and we play in many of the markets large and growing that impact people s path to digital and so yes we had some wins because we had some inventory which is great but more so than that we took share we drove big deals and we were able to execute really i think in large part too some of the things mike talked about in the reorganization of the sales organization a year and a half we re really driving tighter better and more aligned relationships with both our sales partners and our suppliers and building deep meaningful relationships that are driving to joint success so we re pretty excited and we feel good about 22 chris mcginnis sidoti and company analyst if i m was last quarter maybe two quarters ago you talked about pos portal having some issues in the market has that come back and can you give a level of growth that you re seeing from that business mike baur chairman and chief executive officer yes we you heard me talk in my prepared remarks about the reopening of main street and we are we continue to be excited by that business obviously in the early days of covid we were impacted greatly because main street shut down but as it began to reopen we saw our our revenues our attach rate with services and our volumes increase and actually now we re back to pre covid levels and so we re very excited about that business and if you remember that business is a business that drives higher margins for us due to services that we wrap around the hardware and so we re excited that main street is open and we are definitely back in business there chris mcginnis sidoti and company analyst and then just last question just on the new share authorization you just do you expect to be active on that relatively soon or is there opportunities maybe for m a when you look at the strength of the balance sheet and the cash flow thank you steve jones senior executive vice president and chief financial officer yes hi chris this is steve jones thanks for the question so i would say that our first priority is always going to be to look for those long term value creation opportunities and that would be around growth both organic and in our m a opportunities so that would be our top priority chris mcginnis sidoti and company analyst okay great thanks for taking my questions and good luck in q1 steve jones senior executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks mike baur chairman and chief executive officer thanks operator thank you i m showing no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to mike bauer for any closing

photo credit alamy stock photo one of the covid 19 pandemic s most undeniable economic effects has been the red hot real estate market in cities across the country homes are getting snapped up in just days on the market with multiple offers sales above asking price and many seller friendly conditions one of the key factors at play on the demand side is that the millennial generation the largest by population are mostly in their late 20s and 30s which is a period when many people begin to buy homes for the first time this trend has been accompanied by factors that have given more people the means to buy since the pandemic began including low mortgage rates strong government stimulus to households increased savings during the pandemic and excellent stock market returns over the last year together these conditions have allowed many households to accumulate the financial resources needed for a down payment and mortgage unfortunately for these would be buyers the inventory of homes for sale has remained at or near all time lows throughout most of the last year many would be sellers have opted to stay in their current homes rather than enter a competitive market meanwhile disruptions to global supply chains have created some lags in the construction of new housing stock and raised prices for building supplies like lumber this combination of high demand and low supply has pushed prices higher throughout the pandemic prices had already been on a steady upward trajectory since the 2008 recession but the trends that hit the market since the beginning of 2020 represent an even more significant jump according to data from the u s department of housing and urban development the median sales price of a u s home went from a post recession low of 208 000 in january 2009 to 329 000 in january 2020 an average increase of 11 000 per year by january 2021 the median sales price was 347 500 which represented an 18 500 increase over the year prior however the median 350 000 sale price does not buy the same size or quality home in every location the hot market overall means that many homebuyers are looking for good value and with prices inflated in markets nationwide good value can be hard to find however the covid 19 pandemic has made it easier for many professionals to work remotely and many more have come to value affordable and plentiful living space over proximity to work and amenities found in high demand urban locations according to data from the national association of home builders 21 of homebuyers would now prefer a larger home and 30 would prefer to live in an outlying suburb post covid as homebuyers search for good deals on real estate most of the states where their dollar will go furthest are found in southern and midwestern states with low cost of living at the top of the list according to data from redfin is arkansas where a 350 000 home would be 3 349 square feet based on median price per square foot with indiana 3 167 and oklahoma 3 049 also topping the 3 000 square foot threshold in contrast the states with the worst ratios are highly competitive expensive housing markets including hawaii 644 california 798 new york 922 and massachusetts 1 052 similar trends hold for many of the cities where 350 000 will buy the most space the majority of leading locations are rust belt cities in the midwest and other locations with lower cost of living and where there is already a good supply of housing or where housing is fairly easy to build to find the locations where homebuyers can get the most for their money researchers at inspection

pedersen said that regrettably there has been an escalation in fighting in many parts of syria including in deraa governorate he stressed the need to work towards a nationwide ceasefire pointing to the intensification in russian mediation efforts in recent days he also noted that the issues facing syrians are far from solely being in the hands of the syrians stressing that a constructive international diplomacy is plainly needed mr pedersen also said last month s adoption by the security council of resolution 2585 was important he urged council members who came together for that

agency helped refugees get documents including indigenous people from brazil and venezuela unfpa for its part provided birth support kits to help 1 400 midwives in the state of amazonas children and lastly we keep talking about the impact of covid just one more startling fact from our colleagues from across the street at unicef where they warned today that the first day of school has been indefinitely postponed for some 140 million first time students around the world due to the pandemic for some 8 million of these students the wait for their first day of in person learning has been over a year and counting as they live in places where schools have been closed throughout the pandemic unicef says the associated consequences of school closures learning loss mental distress missed vaccinations heightened risk of dropping out child labour and child marriage will be felt by many children especially the youngest learners in critical development stages the agency is urging governments to reopen schools for in person learning as soon as possible and to provide a comprehensive recovery response for students which includes support for teachers and remedial learning to help students catch up on lost time questions and answers yes sir question there is breaking news coming from north africa algeria cut ties with morocco and the algerian foreign minister says his country is cutting diplomatic relations with morocco from today any comment on that spokesman okay that s the first i ve heard of it let me look into it and i will send you all something in writing michelle nichols of reuters question thank you stéphane dujarric of the un spokesman thank you question a question on afghanistan just wanted to ask you a little bit more about the national staff the 3 000 national staff working for the un you just said that the secretary general said in his video that the un is working to find external solutions where they are needed can you elaborate on that a little bit for us spokesman well i mean i think we ve always been very clear in our expression of concern for national staff especially those who are at particular risk and for a number of reasons and we re always looking for the best solution for them and some of that may include external solutions but i as i ve said yesterday we really want to we re going to be a little circumspect in what we say from here given the extremely volatile security situation question but is it safe to assume that external solutions means relocating them outside the country spokesman listen i will leave at it at that for now question and among those 3 000 national staff does the un have any idea how many of those would like to leave if they had the opportunity spokesman i think we re i m not going to share a number with you but we are obviously talking very directly to all our staff mr hanna question is the un dealing directly with regard to its afghan nationals that it wants to move out or is it mo operating through a third party particularly in the light of taliban now announcing that no afghans are going to be allowed to leave spokesman well i mean we re speaking to them directly to our national staff but i think as we ve said here unlike countries the un is not in a position to grant visas so any relocation involves discussions with member states and that is happening margaret besheer question steph spokesman maggie question hi can you hear me spokesman yes ma am question okay first of all have you sent out the sg s statement to the g7 meeting i don t think i ve seen it are we going to receive it spokesman no we have not sent out a statement to the g7 because the meeting was a closed meeting there is however a my understanding is there s a g7 communiqué or statement on afghanistan that is being distributed will be distributed shortly question okay thanks and secondly on unisfa in abyei there s a report out of sudan that the un has agreed to remove about 3 500 ethiopian troops from the mission which is basically the entire mission in the next three months so can you confirm that and who will replace them has there been any offer spokesman look there is a we ve seen the media reports there is an ongoing strategic review of the mission which was requested to us by unisfa that planning is ongoing and we are currently very actively engaged with member states on the issue that was raised in the media reports it will be shared in a letter with the security council question so is it correct then sorry can i just follow up is it correct spokesman yep question that mr lacroix and atul khare and there was someone else in the meeting are those details correct from the un participation in this meeting oh and it was parfait onanga anyanga was the third spokesman yeah i mean i in terms of participants i do think that was correct abdelhamid and then we ll come back to the room question yes thank you stéphane i just want to ask if you are aware of killing palestinian child of 16 year old in the refugee camp of balata his name is imad el hashash and he was shot in the head by israeli occupation forces are you aware of that spokesman i mean we re very much monitoring closely the events that have been taking place in the west bank and i think the violence and the casualties we ve seen are very concerning and very alarming question there is a un report that talks about palestinian children 11 of them killed since the clashes in gaza in the last eight 67 in gaza is this report observed by the special coordinator tor wennesland spokesman i didn t hear the what is this report question a un report about children killed in since may the number is 78 67 in gaza 11 in the west bank i could spokesman let me question send you a link spokesman i haven t seen the report what i can tell you is that we have often and repeatedly expressed our position that children must never be targeted and never be put in harm s way michelle question thanks steph another question on afghanistan you just mentioned the difficulties the un is having getting aid in we ve talked about the airport and control of the airport and what s going to happen after the us leave the secretary general told us last week that the un didn t have the capability to run the airport at the moment how have those discussions with the taliban progressed over the past few days is there a role for the un is the un is the us and the taliban pushing the un to take more of a role spokesman i have i m not aware of any change in that position what is essential is that we have a working and safe airport to bring aid in to bring people in if we need to bring more people in to relocate people if we need to relocate and the airport needs to be at a certain level of standards for airlines charters or whatever to come in for insurance companies to feel safe to have their planes come in so i it is we cannot underscore enough the critical need to have a functioning airport in kabul for to serve the humanitarian situation among others question so when the secretary general said that the un didn t have the capability to do that did to run the airport i does he mean at the moment like can you send in people to do that spokesman look at this point the situation hasn t changed especially given the security situation yes sir question hi given that the american food and drug administration yesterday gave a full approval to the pfizer and biontech vaccine some us entities are making it mandatory for their employees to be vaccinated for example the city of new york with the teachers spokesman yeah question i think you saw that is that on the table for un staff as well spokesman well as you may recall because i have no doubt during your three weeks off you re watching the briefing every day no matter what beach you were on that we are there will be before the high level summit there is a deadline for a certain category of un staff to be vaccinated yes grigory question thank you mr dujarric there are reports from in panjshir from the supporters of commander massoud that there is an exacerbating of humanitarian situation there are refugees so given that do you have any updates on of this humanitarian situation thank you spokesman no but i will we ve been asking and i will ask again see if we have any information in that area okay unless i hear anyone opening up their mics correspondent here here here here spokesman ah yes sir question hi stéphane it s james yeah thanks so much if you don t mind can i just do a few more questions on afghanistan i ll ask them all together and you can answer a bit so you can answer you mentioned at the outset that the sg did a video message to afghan staff is that something that we can watch on the untv or can we get a copy of the text and spokesman we will yes the short answer is yes we re going to post it as i speak and we will send you the video link as well question and on the issue of whether or not your staff in afghanistan are in danger of course we can understand how an afghan who was a translator working with us forces they re in danger of reprisals by the taliban but an afghan who you know moved paper in a unicef or unfpa office have there been any credible threats against individuals like that spokesman look i m not going to talk about whatever specific threats there would be i would just ask you to stop and think about the depth and breadth of the un s work over the last 20 years to just choose a time frame in afghanistan in terms of looking at production of illicit drugs human rights violations sanctions and all the regular and very public reporting the un has done on a lot of very sensitive issues question i mean that s a great point and i note it so if it s important to protect these individuals who ve done that important work you keep on saying that the un cannot issue visas but am i right in thinking that the un can issue laissez faire passports spokesman the laissez pa it s not laissez faire it s laissez passer laissez faire is something a little different not to go into diplomatic intricacies but laissez passer does not bypass a need for a visa i have a laissez passer and i still need a visa when i travel to most places around the world correspondent understood and thank you and yes your french is better than mine for sure spokesman yeah but you re the native english speaker james okay thank you all and have a good day
traverse city mich ap scientists have traced the genetic makeup of lake trout a feat that should boost efforts to rebuild populations of the prized fish in the great lakes and other north american waters where they ve been hammered by invasive species overfishing and pollution officials said tuesday u s and canadian researchers completed a reference genome or digital genetic map for lake trout it will help explain characteristics that enabled the species to evolve and spread across its vast range with certain types becoming better suited to particular locations and depths the data also will provide vital information for managers of programs that stock lakes with young trout to supplement natural reproduction said marc gaden spokesman for the great lakes fishery commission a u s canadian agency that funded the research lake trout are widely distributed across north america and there are huge variations in habitat use shape size body mass color gaden said we need to understand why they look the way they do why some types are more successful in some habitats than others why some types in hatcheries do better than others the team of experts with several u s and canadian universities and government agencies published their genome report aug 5 in the journal molecular ecology resources william taylor chairman of the fishery commission and a michigan state university fisheries ecologist described it as a vital missing link in our efforts to restore lake trout lake trout long dominated the great lakes as a predator fish and are common in other large north american lakes they sustained aboriginal tribes for generations and were a primary target of post settlement commercial fishing operations their numbers in the great lakes plummeted in the last century with the invasion of sea lamprey an eel like parasite that attaches to fish and sucks their bodily fluids researchers eventually developed a poison that is applied to tributary rivers where the lamprey spawn keeping them in check but habitat loss overfishing pollution and other invaders have hampered efforts to bring back the lake trout although they can live for decades it takes about seven years for them to become sexually mature and many don t survive long enough to reproduce agencies continue to stock them in all the great lakes except lake superior where the species has recovered well gaden said development of the reference genome should help managers fine tune those efforts the more you can understand what makes this organism tick the more you can do to take steps to rehabilitate it he said genomes of salmonids a family that includes lake trout are harder to compile than those of many other animals the research team said having a publicly available map of the lake trout genome removes most of the initial hurdles associated with doing conservation oriented genomic research makes it significantly easier to compare results across studies and will hopefully quicken the pace of scientific discovery said seth smith of michigan state university the study s lead author shawn sitar a fisheries research biologist with the michigan department of natural resources who wasn t involved with the study said returning lake trout to their historically influential role in the great lakes will require understanding differences between their types at the sub species level which the genome research will support we see them in different habitats functioning in ecologically different ways living differently sitar said if you want to restore a forest ecosystem you don t put in one just one tree you want to restore the integrity of what the ecosystem was originally copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

net income operating income and net sales in the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal 2021 were adversely affected by the covid 19 global pandemic the pandemic as discussed below those impacts are declining over time improvement in commercial aerospace market conditions has been evidenced by four consecutive quarters of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at the flight support group net sales increased 22 to 471 7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 up from 386 4 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 operating income increased 47 to 100 8

quarter of fiscal 2020 ebitda was 347 9 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 as compared to 353 7 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 see our reconciliation of net income attributable to heico to ebitda at the end of this press release consolidated results laurans a mendelson heico s chairman and ceo commented on the company s third quarter results stating we are very pleased to report much improved quarterly operating results within both flight support and electronic technologies consolidated operating income and net sales in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 improved 47 and 22 respectively as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020 which was the quarter in which our operating results were most negatively affected by the pandemic our performance principally reflects quarterly consolidated organic net sales growth of 17 and the favorable impact from our fiscal 2020 and 2021 acquisitions earlier this month we announced that flight support acquired 89 of ridge engineering inc and the bechdon company inc the purchase price of these acquisitions was paid in cash using cash on hand and we expect these acquisitions to be accretive to our earnings per share within the first twelve months following closing our total debt to shareholders equity ratio improved to 17 4 as of july 31 2021 as compared to 36 8 as of october 31 2020 our net debt total debt less cash and cash equivalents of 117 1 million as of july 31 2021 to shareholders equity ratio improved to a very low 5 3 as of july 31 2021 down from 16 6 as of october 31 2020 which provides the company with substantial acquisition capital in the balance of our 1 5 billion revolving credit facility and other available capital our net debt to ebitda ratio improved to 25x as of july 31 2021 down from 71x as of october 31 2020 during fiscal 2021 we successfully completed four acquisitions and have no significant debt maturities until fiscal 2024 we plan to utilize our financial strength and flexibility to aggressively pursue high quality acquisitions of various sizes to accelerate growth and maximize shareholder returns cash flow provided by operating activities was very strong increasing 33 to 124 0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 up from 93 1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 cash flow provided by operating activities remained strong increasing 12 to 334 1 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2021 up from 299 0 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2020 looking ahead to the remainder of fiscal 2021 and to fiscal 2022 we remain cautiously optimistic that the ongoing worldwide rollout of covid 19 vaccines will positively influence commercial air travel and will benefit the markets we serve but as we ve all learned it is difficult to predict the pandemic s path and effect including factors like vaccination rates and new variants which can impact our key markets therefore we feel it would not be responsible to provide fiscal 2021 net sales and earnings guidance at this time however our ongoing conservative policies strong balance sheet and high degree of liquidity enable us to invest in new research and development execute on our successful acquisition program and position heico for market share gains as the industry recovers flight support group eric a mendelson heico s co president and president of heico s flight support group commented on the flight support group s third quarter results stating we are very pleased to report quarterly increases of 250 and 33 in operating income and net sales respectively as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2020 these substantial increases principally reflect increased demand for the majority of our commercial aerospace products and services resulting from some recovery in global commercial air travel as compared to the prior year this marks the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential growth in net sales and operating income at the flight support group the flight support group s net sales increased 33 to 237 1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 up from 178 2 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the net sales increase is principally from organic growth of 32 the organic growth is mainly attributable to increased demand for our commercial aerospace products across all of our product lines the flight support group s operating income increased 250 to 42 1 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 up from 12 0 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 the operating income increase principally reflects the previously mentioned net sales growth and an improved gross profit margin principally from the previously mentioned increased demand for our commercial aerospace products additionally we had a decrease in bad debt expense due to certain commercial aviation customers filing for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as a result of the pandemic s financial impact the flight
