happy wednesday on this date in 1969 neil armstrong and buzz aldrin became the first people to walk on the moon and here we felt brave taking a stroll in 90 degree heat today is also national hot dog day so cheers to all who are celebrating as long as you don t use ketchup here s what s happening on the fiscal front senate advances scaled back chips bill the senate on tuesday evening voted 64 34 to advance legislation to provide billions of dollars in assistance to the u s semiconductor industry after 16 republican senators voted in support of the measure senator chuck schumer democrat of new york and the majority leader restored to the legislation a host of critical research and development measures that had previously been sidelined the new york times reports in an unusual exercise mr schumer had said he would add the provisions only if the bill drew 60 votes indicating that it could survive a filibuster and move to passage in the senate thirty three republican senators and sen bernie sanders i vt voted no tuesday s bipartisan vote outs the senate on track to pass a broader package that would reportedly pour some 250 billion into the semiconductor industry and other technological research and development that package is actually a scaled back version of earlier legislation meant to improve u s competitiveness with china that stalled out as the house and senate approved rival measures the latest package is expected to pass the senate by next week speaker nancy pelosi d ca said wednesday that she s optimistic the house will be able to vote on the bill as early as next week in a letter to colleagues she called the legislation a major victory for american families and the american economy and a bold bipartisan package that will lower costs for families here at home while reigniting american competitiveness on the world stage the package contains 52 7 billion in subsidies and tax credits for u s chip makers including 39 billion to build expand or modernize domestic manufacturing facilities and related research and development and 11 billion for commerce department r d programs a 25 tax credit reportedly estimated to be worth about 24 billion for investments in semiconductor manufacturing 1 5 billion for 5g mobile broadband deployment guardrails that prohibit companies from using funds from the program for stock buybacks or dividend payments or for building semiconductor facilities on china or other countries that present a national security concern some gop objections republican senator rick scott r fl criticized the bill to reuters saying taxpayers should get a return on their investment rather than providing grants to industry that don t require repayment the taxpayer doesn t get anything here scott told reuters and sen ron johnson r wi reportedly called the semiconductor provisions in the bill corporate welfare in a similar vein billionaire investor john arnold tweeted just baffled how a 50 billion corporate welfare bill just passed with 64 senate votes without a peep about paying for it house passes 400 billion minibus funding bill the house on wednesday voted 220 207 to pass a legislative package containing six funding bills for the 2023 fiscal year the package includes the appropriations bills covering transportation housing and urban development agriculture rural development food and drug administration energy and water development financial services and general government interior and environment and military construction and veterans affairs the package is worth more than 400 billion according to the hill and includes substantial increases in spending on an annual basis for key democratic priorities at the departments of the interior transportation energy and housing and urban development as well as at the veterans administration if the house version holds federal employees will receive an average pay increase of 4 6 next year rep rosa delauro d ct chair of the house appropriations committee celebrated the successful vote saying that the legislation would address some of our nation s biggest challenges by combatting climate change bolstering mental health services supporting our veterans and building safer communities with less crime and violence and more security hurdles ahead the house needs to pass six more funding bills but political disputes over difficult issues such as immigration policy and total defense spending mean that is unclear if lawmakers will be able to meet their goal of passing all 12 funding bills for 2023 before leaving for their august recess meanwhile the senate is far behind in the process with little progress to show on its 12 funding bills in addition the senate has yet to announce a topline number for the 2023 bill making it harder for the house to determine its spending proposals while senate democrats are expected to release more details on their 2023 spending plans before the recess some lawmakers have expressed doubts about the upper chambers ability to complete the process before the fiscal year ends on september 30 sen roy blunt of missouri the senior republican on the senate appropriations subcommittee on labor health and human services and education said he thinks the final spending package could take months to finish blunt told the hill that he s focused on what the bill like in december i think that s pretty much what everybody s thinking chart of the day our failure to invest the apparent failure of president biden s build back better plan is a reminder that public investment has been on a downward trend for years as this graph from the financial times demonstrates in the us net government investment after accounting for depreciation of the existing public capital stock fell by almost two thirds in the decade to 2014 when it dropped to 0 5 per cent of gdp says the ft s martin sandbu while government investment has rebounded modestly from time to time it remains well below the roughly 2 of gdp recorded in 1970 why have we lived for so long off past investments and failed to make enough new ones sandbu asks i think our failure to invest is profoundly political raising the investment to gdp ratio whether through boosts to private or public investment or both means that a smaller ratio of gdp is left over for consumption even if this prepares a better future it can feel like a measlier existence today and that is something a generation of politicians across the rich world have been afraid to inflict on their voters opinion of the day a message for manchin kimberly clausing a professor of tax law and policy at ucla school of law addresses one of the more baffling aspects of sen joe manchin s rejection of democrats proposed tax hikes writing at bloomberg clausing says that while inflation is running unacceptably high tax hikes wouldn t make it worse i must set the record straight higher taxes do not stoke inflation on the contrary they can help get prices under control even economists who oppose higher taxes recognize this simple fact inflation results from a mismatch when demand for goods and services exceeds supply prices increase raising taxes has the opposite effect reducing disposable income and hence demand similarly committee for a responsible federal budget has noted that more deficit reduction would help fight inflation and that olicies to close tax loopholes reduce tax breaks improve compliance and raise revenue will help mitigate inflationary pressures clausing runs through some possible concerns about scenarios in which tax increases could fuel inflation but she concludes that none stand up to scrutiny all told senator manchin now is an excellent time to raise taxes she concludes read the full piece at bloomberg news views and analysis

totaled 602 000 a decrease of 720 000 from the 1 322 000 in non interest income reported for the quarter ended june 30 2021 the decrease is primarily attributed to a loss of 869 000 recorded on the fair value of junior subordinated debentures for the quarter ended june 30 2022 compared to a gain of 377 000 recorded for the quarter ended june 30 2021 additionally the decrease in noninterest

from an investment in a limited partnership for the quarter ended june 30 2022 noninterest income increased 808 000 from the 206 000 loss reported for the quarter ended march 31 2022 this was

decrease between the quarters ended june 30 2022 and 2021 resulted in part due to decreases of 116 000 in salaries and employee benefits and was partially offset by an increase of 64 000 in regulatory

increases of 11 3 million in now and money market accounts 6 3 million in time deposits and 6 2 million in savings accounts offset by decreases of 3 7 million in noninterest bearing deposits in total now money market and savings accounts increased 2 7 to 661 2 million at june 30 2022 compared to 643 8 million at december 31 2021 noninterest bearing deposits decreased 0 8 to 473 0 million at june

other comprehensive loss totaled 13 7 million compared to 1 2 million at december 31 2021 the increase in the loss was primarily the result of net unrealized losses on investment securities of 14 6 million and was partially offset by a 1 8 million gain on junior subordinated debentures trups caused by a change in market credit spreads during the six months ended june 30 2022 the change in unrealized loss on the investment portfolio is attributed to changes in interest rates and not credit quality the company does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell any securities that have an unrealized loss the board of directors of united security bancshares declared a cash dividend on common stock of 0 11 per share on june 28 2022 the

523 000 for the six months ended june 30 2021 the reduced provision recorded during the year is attributed to lower net charge offs on the student loan portfolio decreases in nonperforming assets and change in portfolio mix partially offset by a qualitative adjustment for economic uncertainty resulting in an increase in required reserves the qualitative adjustment is attributed to higher inflation anticipated magnitude of interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 and the increasing likelihood of a recession for the six months ended june 30 2021 the provision recorded was attributed to growth of the loan portfolio agricultural loan downgrades and net charge offs recognized in the student loan portfolio the company s allowance for loan loss totaled 1 05 of the loan portfolio at june 30 2022 compared to 1 07 at december 31 2021 the decrease in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross loans is primarily the result of a change in loan mix resulting from purchases of residential mortgage loans during the first quarter the reserve required on the residential mortgage loan segment is lower than reserves required for other loan segments due to lower historical loss rates management considers the allowance for credit losses at june 30 2022 to be adequate non performing assets comprised of nonaccrual loans troubled debt restructures tdrs other real estate owned

restoring and upgrading an old vehicle with modern parts is known as restomod but there is no rule about how much you have to change or a precise classification for them leaving a vast margin of gray between a fully modernized vehicle and a numbers matching one this 1968 camaro is in that gray area while some might say it s just a camaro rs with different wheels on it and an ss front bumper others might point out that the interior is stock but there is more about this white with a black top car than you might think it still sits on an original suspension system with leaf springs and a 12 bolt rear end but the new tires might say a different story the seller cdclovi bought the car in january this year and it was already modified meanwhile the ignition cylinder broke and he had it replaced after the vehicle reached about 18k miles almost 29 000 km they put it up for sale but the total mileage is unknown not that it matters since the numbers shown on the odometer are most probably made after the rebuild inside the cabin the black and white theme continued on the upholstery a white tremec branded shift knob adorned the hurst shifter on the center console in front of it the typical four rectangular gauges were not original but dakota digital the same company also provided the dials in front of the driver a stereo that is not working is placed on the center stack despite the numerous upgrades the windows are cranked leaving the impression of a stock vehicle but the most significant modification of the vehicle was performed under the skin an lq4 gen iii ls 6 0 liter v8 fills the engine bay and it s paired with a six speed tremec manual gearbox it sends all the power to the rear wheels via a 12 bolt differential another good news is that the disc brakes are new and signed by wilwood on the other hand the rear axle fitted with leaf springs might not be everybody s cup of tea some of those who watched and commented on the ad considered this a light restomod in contrast others complained about the skinny tires well if 235 45 zr17 at the front and the 255 45 zr18 at the back are slim i ll let you decide and tell me in the comment section below as expected a bidding war happened in the last half hour of the auction and the price jumped from 45 000 to 63 000 usd some other restomodded camaros sold for way more than that but if you are planning to use the car for the pleasure of driving a classic without the hustle of old car habits then the approach for this black and white camaro is right and as the buyer said looking forward to rolling down hwy 1 after all there is a long way between nevada and texas where the car will be driven not stored as a garage queen

single family homes under construction in the wildflower community in saratoga springs are pictured on tuesday july 19 2022 looking at the national map of where in the u s homes are being built the fastest almost the entire state of utah sticks out as a glaring hot spot using census bureau data axios recently compiled a county by county national map of where housing units are growing the fastest across the u s while some geographically smaller counties in texas boast some of the highest percentages utah is high on the national list too but with a high concentration of rapidly growing counties statewide what s happening in utah the story here especially over the last year is certainly one of a housing boom in fact in 2021 utah saw a record breaking home building year one that is starting to make a dent in the state s stubborn yearslong housing shortage that was driving up home prices even before the covid 19 pandemic sent the market haywire that s according to a new report released monday written by james wood an ivory boyer senior fellow at the university of utah s kem c gardner policy institute and commissioned by the salt lake board of realtors in 2021 utah s number of new housing units permitted far exceeded that of new households for example marriages divorces students going to college or net in migration 40 144 housing units compared to 26 689 new households according to the report so what s utah s housing shortage now after the record home building year of 2021 utah s statewide cumulative housing shortage now stands at 31 000 compared to about 56 000 in 2017 the housing shortage should not be interpreted as 31 000 homeless households but rather as an indicator of a tight and unhealthy housing market characterized by very low vacancy rates and a growing share of households doubling up wood wrote in the report according to a news release from the salt lake board of realtors nevertheless a housing shortage persists at a much lower level what s driving utah s housing boom utah which has consistently ranked as one of the fastest growing states in the nation has experienced rapid population growth for years and is especially known for its young population the state especially recently has also seen an uptick in in migration as out of state movers discover it as relatively affordable compared to other states like california while also offering an impressive array of outdoor recreation opportunities for skiers hikers mountain bikers and more so as more and more young utahns seek to start their own families or buy their own homes that along with an increase in out of state movers is driving housing demand and home builders have been responding in earnest what kind of homes are being built utah s housing boom has been mostly driven by single family home building single family homes made up 17 528 units or 44 of the share of all permits issued in 2021 wood wrote in the report next came apartments builders were issued 14 143 permits in 2021 making up 35 of all permits issued that s the highest number of apartment permits issued in a single year in utah s history wood wrote condos and townhomes came in third place with 7 895 permits issued a 20 share what cities are building homes the fastest one of utah s southernmost counties is seeing the fastest percentage growth in housing units of all types according to census data washington county home to booming st george near popular zion national park saw a 4 7 boost to its housing inventory from july 2020 to july 2021 single family homes under construction in the lakeview estates community in lehi are pictured on tuesday july 19 2022 kristin murphy deseret news now let s zoom out and look north to the wasatch front tooele county is also among utah s fastest growing counties population wise and housing wise tooele county known for its rural neighborhoods and vast boundaries stretching all the way across utah s west desert including across the salt flats saw a 4 increase to its housing stock from july 2020 to july 2021 according to census data however utah county is really where it s at when it comes to single family home building according to wood s report utah county utah s second most populated county and home to brigham young university as well as the state s tech corridor known as silicon slopes saw a 3 9 boost to its overall housing inventory in 2021 according to census data almost one third of all single family home permits issued statewide were issued in utah county totaling 5 512 units wood wrote three cities in utah county eagle mountain saratoga springs and lehi accounted for 60 of all of the permits issued in the county according to the salt lake board of realtors report utah county outpaced washington county in single family home building but washington county wasn t far behind it ranked no 2 among counties with the most single family home permits in 2021 according to wood salt lake county utah s most populated county fell behind both utah and washington counties into third place with 2 235 single family permits issued how much is a home in utah interestingly as home building continues to explode across utah the median price of existing homes far exceeded the median price of new homes in 2021 according to the salt lake board of realtors report that s even though new home prices have historically been higher than existing homes in salt lake county the median price of a new home has typically been 18 higher than that of an existing home since 2005 but in the second quarter of 2022 salt lake county s median price of an existing home 603 000 was 25 higher than the median price of a new home 482 300 why the switch location location location wood wrote in the report many new home developments are on the periphery hence considerable distance from employment centers thus the price gap is partly an indicator of the premium the homebuyer is willing to absorb or pay for an existing home closer to employment centers thus avoiding long commutes from far flung new subdivisions

the delaware supreme court held yesterday that a stockholder seeking to inspect corporate books and records may use reliable hearsay to establish the propriety of the purpose of the inspection demand the decision in nvidia corp v city of westland police and fire retirement system july 19 2022 does not appear to break new ground on this issue inasmuch as the court concluded that it appeared to have allowed the use of sufficiently reliable hearsay in a 26 year old decision which neither party here asked the court to revisit or overrule however the nvidia decision could focus new attention on the admissibility of hearsay in the books and records context in light of the court s express observations about the lack of a direct attack on its prior ruling and in light of a concurring opinion arguing that a stockholder should not be allowed to use hearsay evidence to establish a proper purpose for an inspection demand but that out of court statements to support that purpose are not hearsay at all the decision might also encourage stockholders to avoid these issues by providing direct testimony concerning their claimed purposes instead of relying on hearsay evidence factual background the nvidia case involved demands to inspect corporate books and records under section 220 of the delaware general corporation law the stockholders seeking inspection alleged that the company had made false or misleading statements about the demand for its products and that the ceo and cfo had sold stock at allegedly inflated prices before the so called truth was revealed to the market and the stock price fell the stock drop also led to securities litigation in which the securities plaintiffs pled based on a former company employee s allegations that the ceo and other executives had had specific knowledge of the threats to the company s financial performance the company opposed the stockholders inspection demands contending that the demands did not satisfy the statute s form and manner requirements the stockholders had not shown a proper purpose for their demands the stockholders had not established a credible basis to infer wrongdoing and the inspection requests were overbroad the court of chancery overruled the objections and ordered production of certain documents the delaware supreme court affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part justice traynor concurred in the decision and wrote separately to address the hearsay issue the majority decision much of the court s decision recites and applies some now familiar principles that arise in many books and records cases the court rejected the argument that the inspection demands alleged overbreadth violated 220 s form and manner requirements determination of the appropriateness of the scope of a stockholder s requests or any change to the stockholder s requests has no bearing on whether the plaintiff has satisfied the statute s form and manner requirements the court also rejected the contention that the court of chancery must deny an overbroad inspection demand rather he court of chancery has discretion to look at an overbroad demand and either identify the records that should be produced or to decide that it will not pick through the debris of an impermissibly overbroad demand in either case the supreme court will review the chancellor s or vice chancellor s ruling only for abuse of discretion but perhaps the most interesting part of the court s decision concerns nvidia s argument that the stockholders had improperly relied on hearsay evidence their inspection demands and interrogatories to establish the propriety of their purpose in seeking books and records to investigate whether corporate wrongdoing including insider trading had occurred under well established law a stockholder relying on that purpose must show by a preponderance of the evidence a credible basis from which the court of chancery can infer there is possible that would warrant further investigation the court began by observing that the delaware uniform rules of evidence apply to all actions in delaware courts without any exception for 220 proceedings the court also noted the parties agreement that the inspection demands and interrogatories that the stockholders had used to establish the purpose for their inspection demands constituted hearsay out of court statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted the existence of an exception to the hearsay rule in 220 cases for purposes of establishing a credible basis to infer wrongdoing thus turned on a line of cases stretching back to the court s 1996 decision in thomas betts corp v leviton manufacturing co the court concluded that it appears to us that thomas betts created an exception in the 220 context that allows the use of sufficiently reliable hearsay in books and records actions the court noted that nvidia does not argue that thomas betts was wrongly decided and does not ask us to revisit that decision the court also stated that it was not inclined to reconsider thomas betts when neither party has asked us to do so particularly without proper briefing and arguments on those points accordingly the court held that hearsay is admissible in a section 220 proceeding when that hearsay is sufficiently reliable however the court reversed and remanded the court of chancery s ruling on the propriety of the stockholders purpose because the stockholders had deprived nvidia of the right to attack the reliability of their hearsay evidence the inspection demands and interrogatories the stockholders had refus to cooperate with the company regarding the identification of trial witnesses or affiants and had effectively prevented nvidia from taking depositions if stockholders are going to introduce sufficiently reliable hearsay to establish a proper purpose they must communicate honestly and early with companies regarding their intent so as to allow companies to decide whether to depose the stockholders or to identify their own witnesses for trial the concurrence justice traynor harbor serious misgivings about the majority s statement grounded in our thomas betts opinion that hearsay is admissible in a section 220 proceeding when that hearsay is sufficiently reliable instead he would hold that hearsay evidence is inadmissible to show a stockholder s purpose for an inspection of books and records under section 220 however justice traynor distinguished between evidence of the stockholder s stated purpose here the belief that wrongdoing had occurred and evidence of the basis for that stated purpose the fact to be proved is not the suspected wrongdoing but rather the reasonableness of the suspicion seen in this light the out of court statements typically offered to satisfy the credible basis prong are not offered to prove their truth thus they are not hearsay accordingly a rule prohibiting hearsay evidence to show the stockholder s purpose would not limit a stockholder s ability to use out of court statements to prove that there is a credible basis for her suspicion of wrongdoing in this case for example the allegations of the former employee cited in the securities litigation implications the nvidia decision raises a number of issues and strategic choices for books and records litigants first stockholders litigating 220 demands might wish to testify directly about their purposes for seeking corporate documents instead of submitting hearsay evidence to establish those purposes doing so would avoid the issues that arose in the nvidia case second stockholders should heed the court s warnings about being upfront about their plans regarding witnesses so that companies can choose whether to depose the stockholders during discovery or call the stockholders as witnesses at trial third some litigants probably defendants might see a reason to seek reconsideration and overruling of thomas betts which underlay the court s decision that sufficiently reliable hearsay is admissible in 220 proceedings the court was careful to stress that no one had sought review of the 26 year old ruling and that reconsideration was not advisable without a fully briefed request fourth especially if thomas betts were to be overruled justice traynor s distinction between what is and is not hearsay the stockholder s stated purpose vs the bases for the stockholder s belief that wrongdoing might have occurred could become particularly important under justice traynor s analysis a ruling rejecting the use of hearsay in 220 proceedings would not prevent a stockholder from relying on unsworn out of court statements to establish a credible basis for suspicion of wrongdoing

all eyes will be fixed on the european central bank s ecb meeting in frankfurt today to see whether council members dare push up interest rates higher than the markets are expecting some ecb members are said to be arguing for a 50 basis point rise rather than the 0 25 hike which has been flagged until recently the more hawkish members say now is the time to move sharply to choke off inflationary pressures and contain demand tough call european central bank boss christine lagarde is faced with a tricky decision on a eurozone interest rate rise on the other hand some members fear that higher borrowing costs will tip the eurozone into recession particularly if russia stops gas supplies coming into europe this winter even though nord stream 1 is due back on stream soon but the decision to go big to choke off inflation is still wide open and looks set for fierce debate it s the first interest rate hike since 2011 and a tricky one for ecb president christine lagarde to balance she also has to ensure that too big a hike doesn t hurt some of the most indebted of the eurozone countries such as italy and will be announcing a new bond buying scheme to curtail their borrowings her decision is made more complicated by ecb forecasts that lower energy costs the easing of supply chains and the return to more normal monetary policy will lead to a decline in inflation without too hasty action on rates its latest predictions are for eurozone annual inflation at 6 8 per cent in 2022 falling to 3 5 per cent in 2023 and 2 1 per cent in 2024 andrew bailey the bank of england governor has a similar dilemma he warned in his annual city speech this week that while the prospect of a 50 basis point rise in interest rates will be discussed at next month s monetary policy committee meeting the amount was not set in stone as he says there is a trade off between jacking up rates too much in an attempt to dampen inflation now at 9 4 per cent and depressing demand too much resulting in low growth and higher wage demands even may s growth figures which showed a small rise should be treated with caution he says central bankers on both sides of the channel should have acted sooner to choke off inflation and cut back on quantitative easing but with signs that some raw material prices are falling it may not be the time to go over the top with too hefty a rate rise softy softly is perhaps more appropriate treasury hotline as i suspected the main reason for softbank s decision to put the float of arm on ice is not because of the uk s so called political turmoil but more to do with the difficulties of organising such an ambitious dual listing on the new york and london stock exchanges listing on both simultaneously has never been done before one problem has been the sheer amount of background paperwork required to jump the regulatory and accountancy hurdles required by the us watchdog the securities and exchange commission and the uk s financial conduct authority according to one banker it s been a nightmare putting together the prospectuses with too much duplication and overlap another factor which has fed into the decision to take a break is the sorry state of the global ipo market which has all but seized up because of the fragility of the financial markets even though investors are awash with money yet that doesn t mean the dual listing is dead far from it indeed softbank s masayoshi son has been persuaded of the benefits of going for a double hit because of the depth of liquidity provided by having such a big pool of investors drawn from the big apple and london and to have arm in the ftse 100 as well as the s p 500 it s astonishing that this should be so difficult particularly as the countries share a common language but there is something that could be done to help speed up the process the uk s treasury and the us treasury have the powers to make it easier for the regulators to nod through certain deals whoever makes it to no 11 in september needs to bring back its former chief investment guru lord grimstone and get on the hotline to the us treasury nuclear reaction some good news on the energy front planning has been finally approved for the 20billion sizewell c nuclear reactor it will provide electricity for 6m homes and generate thousands of jobs now all it needs is investors

by jeanne sahadi cnn business there really was no place for 401 k investors to hide in the first half of this year even though their portfolios took a hit they didn t run for the hills the nasdaq was down 30 while the s p 500 and russell 2000 indices were down more than 20 apiece the bond market typically considered a safe haven during volatile times did better but that s not saying much for example the s p us aggregate bond index a proxy for investment grade debt was down roughly 9 despite these widespread losses 401 k investors held steady according to preliminary data from two major 401 k providers at vanguard trading among participants in defined contribution plans was muted with just 4 3 making any changes to how their money was allocated and the majority who did chose to move money into stocks as prices declined at t rowe price most 401 k plan participants made no change to their investments or salary deferral rates but if markets don t improve in the second half of the year and many analysts think stocks have further to fall before calling a bottom even some steely retirement investors may start to get cold feet if that happens to you here s how to calm your nerves forget timing the market you may be tempted to sell equities and move the proceeds into cash or a money market fund you ll tell yourself you will move the money back into stocks when things improve but that will just lock in your losses if you re a long term investor which includes even those in their 60s and early 70s because they may be in retirement for 20 or more years don t expect to outwit the current downward trends when it comes to success in investing it s not about timing the market it s about time in the market said taylor wilson a certified financial planner and president of greenstone wealth management in forest city iowa say you d invested 10 000 at the start of 1981 in the s p 500 that money would have grown to nearly 1 1 million by march 31 2021 according to fidelity management research had you missed just the five best trading days during those 40 years it would only have grown to roughly 676 000 and if you d sat out the best 30 days your 10 000 would only have grown to 177 000 rethink your contributions if you can convince yourself not to sell at a loss you still may be tempted to stop making your regular contributions for awhile thinking you re just throwing good money after bad this is a hard one for many people because the knee jerk reaction is to stop contributing until the market recovers said cfp sefa mawuli of pavlov financial planning in arlington virginia but the key to 401 k success is consistent and ongoing contributions continuing to contribute during down markets allows investors to buy assets at cheaper prices which may help your account recover faster after a market downturn if you can swing it financially wilson even recommends boosting your contributions if you haven t already maxed out besides the value of buying more at a discount he said taking a positive action step can offset the anxiety that can come from watching your nest egg temporarily shrink reassess your allocation against your current plans life happens plans change and so may your time horizon to retirement so check to see that your current allocation to stocks and bonds matches your risk tolerance and your ideal retirement date do this even if you re in a target date fund wilson said target date funds are geared toward people retiring around a given year e g 2035 or 2040 the fund s allocation will grow more conservative as that target date nears but if you re someone who started saving late and who may need to take on more risk to meet your retirement goals he noted your current target date fund may not be offering you that if you really can t stand it boost your comfort cash mark struthers a cfp at sona wealth advisors in minneapolis works with 401 k participants at organizations that hire his firm to provide financial wellness advice so he s heard from people across the spectrum who express concerns that they can t afford to lose what they have even many educated investors wanted out during the downturn early in the pandemic he said while struthers will counsel them not to panic and explain that downturns are the price investors pay for the big returns they get during bull markets he knows fear can get the better of people you can t just say don t sell because you ll lose some people and they ll be worse off so instead he will try to get them to do those things that can assuage their short term concerns but do the least long term damage to their nest egg for instance someone may be afraid to take enough risk in their 401 k investments especially in a falling market because they re afraid of losing more and having less of a financial resource if they ever get laid off so he reminds them of their existing rainy day assets like their emergency fund and disability insurance he then may suggest they continue to take enough risk to generate the growth they need in their 401 k for retirement but redirect a portion of their new contributions into a cash equivalent or low risk investment or he may suggest they redirect the money to a roth ira since those contributions can be accessed without tax or penalty if need be but it s also keeping the money in a retirement account in the event the person doesn t need it for emergencies just knowing they have that comfort cash there helps them from panicking struthers said the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights

unwavering commitment to the health and safety of our people said mr biswas overview newcrest achieved gold production guidance for fy22 with copper production 3 lower than fy22 guidance predominantly driven by lower mill throughput at red chris and telfer full year aisc was 2 higher than fy22 guidance due to lower copper production and a lower realised copper price timing of cadia copper sales and

on aisc and capital expenditure and the associated mitigation strategies underway gold production was 31 higher than the prior period5 driven by higher mill throughput and gold head grade at both

quarter of 896 oz2 was 10 lower than the prior period driven by higher gold and copper sales volumes and lower site operating costs on a dollar per ounce basis with higher production there was also an additional benefit of a weakening australian dollar against the us dollar on australian dollar denominated operating costs these benefits were partly offset by a lower realised copper price compared to the prior period injury rates were higher than the prior period at cadia telfer and red chris the safe hands intervention program continues to focus on reducing the risk of hand injuries across

restated following an internal review of injury classifications at cadia gold production of 187koz was 25 higher than the prior period driven by higher mill throughput with lower planned and unplanned maintenance during the period in addition gold head grade increased in the quarter with a higher proportion of high grade stockpile fed to the mill as well as higher grade ore feed from panel cave 2 during the quarter cadia s aisc of negative 315 oz reflects the benefit of higher gold and copper sales volumes partly offset by a lower realised copper price cadia continues to manage the impacts of cost inflation assisted by its fixed price electricity contract which was extended in mid 2021 to the end of fy24 protecting cadia from the recent increases in spot and contract electricity prices the power purchase agreement with the rye park wind farm is also expected to commence in 2024 which will help cadia manage longer term energy price risks copper concentrate shipments were disrupted by the

what if the beer industry and the cattle industry could come together to save the world we may not be far off from that getty images by now whether you re into it or not you re aware of scientists claims about rising global temperatures and the ultimate ramifications we could see in the not too distant future major cities could be under water as soon as 2050 ya know if the world is still around by that point while those are dire claims there still are scientists working diligently exploring potential strategies to stop that from happening some drastic measures have been mentioned like matrix ing the whole world by blocking out the sun unrealistic yes some much less drastic and a lot more realistic measures have also been proposed you may or may not have noticed that a number of breweries have taken steps to decrease their carbon footprint in recent years based on recent studies beer can actually be helpful in combatting climate change with a little help from their friends cows getty images how many of those cows do you think are farting right now cow farts the cattle industry is responsible for about 40 of the world s annual methane output thanks to the 1 4 billion cattle that are a bunch of gassius clays ripping farts and probably hot smelly burps farts will forever be funny cut the cheese tushy cough toot pass gas break wind bottom burp vladimir pootin air biscuit baking brownies step on a duck under thunder you get the idea scientists have figured out a way to combat the amount of gas that cattle produce via selective breeding and changes to their diet it appears that one key ingredient in the brewing process of brewing beer could make a big difference if added to their feed getty images how can beer help with cow farts according to a study published in frontiers in animal science the leftover yeast used to make beer has shown a potential when it comes to suppressing the microbes responsible for methane production in cattle after adding the leftover yeast to the cattle s feed it reduced the methane amount by some 25 this amount of reduction is comparable to the much more expensive and synthetic antibiotic called monensin that some beef producers use for the same purpose you can read a more in depth breakdown of the science but the gist is that the yeast used to make beer is particularly effective due to the properties it develops after interacting with hops more specifically the humolones and lupolones that are both biologically active molecules that inhibit certain bacteria and other microbes look i think it s safe to say it s not some dr strange level magical fix to everything currently messing with the climate but it has potential and sounds promising science says these are the dirtiest things in your home

south bend indiana 20th july 2022 chainwire simba chain is announcing a new partnership for the global healthcare and life sciences industry with equideum health the web3 and blockchain powered health company formerly known as consensys health the collaboration aims to significantly enhance global healthcare by building a decentralized marketplace dubbed the equideum exchange for empowering individuals to monetize health and health relevant data about them integrating simba chain s cutting edge blockchain solution simba blocks with equideum health s elevated compute tm platform will greatly accelerate both cross blockchain interoperability and the incorporation of healthcare and life sciences supply chain data into the new web3 data economy enabled by the equideum exchange the development of the equideum exchange is expected to conclude by q1 2023 in collaboration with equideum health s current partners nokia nokia bell labs microsoft intel and consensys users of the equideum exchange including pharmaceutical and medtech companies and public and global health authorities will be able to procure data and privacy preserving analytic compute results for clinical population health health economics patient centered outcomes research and machine learning purposes these users will be able to access a growing array of high integrity longitudinal data resources unavailable today accompanied by the fine grained verifiable and enforceable consent and economic participation of the individual data subjects the integration of simba blocks enables equideum health to achieve cross blockchain protocol interoperability across its health data applications seamlessly and with significant cost savings all user data provided remains completely decentralized and anonymous unless a user explicitly consents to be identified while users also have the option to set certain conditions for the use of their data such as time limits or purposes which are ensured through smart contracts and equideum health s enterprise facing consumer centric data policy verification and enforcement tools the health data platform is part of equideum health s advancement of the health 3 0 paradigm also referred to as ownership health which is an extension of the read write own concept of web3 the vision sees health and health relevant personal data used to deliver precision healthcare tailored to the data subject and also controlled and monetizable directly by that data subject this allows individuals to profit economically from transactions involving data about them while curating much higher quality data with verifiable provenance for scientific and global health purposes we are proud to be part of a big advancement of the global healthcare system powered by blockchain technology the use of simba blocks in the equideum exchange s development will provide a secure and trusted environment to build interoperable cross blockchain solutions for longitudinal

the case at hand is that of mario draghi and italy it s another one of those classic cases in which a country s lack of discipline and fragmented leadership have led to a combination of 1 excessive debts and 2 a lot of internal conflict italy is also in 3 a big external conflict relating to the ukrainian russia war together these forces make italy vulnerable to a debt financial crisis and de facto anarchy in my template for a cycle of internal orders and disorders set out in chapter 5 of my book italy classically is in stage 4 of the cycle this case isn t just interesting in how it will affect italy europe and beyond it exemplifies how such cases generally transpire it gives you and me the opportunity to watch an iconic case in action it is also in my opinion a canary in the coal mine case meaning that what happens in this case will exemplify how the cause effect relationships work at this stage in the cycle which will be broadly indicative of what might happen in other cases

colleagues q2 2022 hedge fund letters conferences and more mario draghi s leadership enter mario draghi will the italians choose a smart bipartisan leadership that will require people with different perspectives to not get exactly what they want or b dysfunctional fighting for exactly what they want in this case 18 months ago mario draghi became prime minister because dire circumstances and dysfunctionality of the political system made it clear that supporting a capable non partisan leader was smarter than the dysfunctional fighting that was going on draghi accepted this job on the condition that he would have non partisan support this was both a noble and a practical decision it was noble because only a hero or a lunatic would accept that job and draghi is no lunatic it was practical because he and the whole effort would fail without non partisan support it is now the case in most democratic countries especially the united states the choice is between a becoming more unified in supporting a smart bipartisan leader which would require people with different perspectives to not get exactly what they want but will give them more compromised outcomes in which the system remains intact and works better or b dysfunctional fighting for exactly what they want which will give them ineffective decision making and a greater risk of some kind of civil war over the 18 months that draghi was in his job the world changed most notably central banks created a lot of money and debt the war in ukraine came inflation accelerated and the ecb s free money policy proved inconsistent with its mandate to control inflation so it s preparing to start to raise interest rates in a tiny way at the same time everyone knows that raising interest rates will hurt italy s and other big debtors abilities to service their debts leading them to raise their interest rates further which could cause a debt and currency crisis this dynamic is always the case and is the present case for many other countries so how italy s case transpires will be instructive and representative for considering how other cases will go if you re interested in reviewing this classic dynamic it is covered in my book principles for navigating big debt crises which you can have for free here or in book form here in my opinion we are clearly in phase 3 of the classic big debt cycle when the central bank faces the choice between a allowing money and credit to tighten and interest rates to rise which is depressing especially for those most over indebted and b printing money to help the most indebted service their debts and keeping real interest rates artificially low which devalues their money heightens inflation and increases debt which makes the problem worse down the road most everyone in europe is now operating on a version of this second path which will require a lot of cooperation especially from the italians they refer to it as the transmission protection or the anti fragmentation mechanism draghi is especially capable and well positioned to deal with this and most people agree that draghi has done an excellent job e g he has the highest approval rating in the g7 at 47 the shift away from the unity behind the leader toward more internal fighting despite these good reasons to support draghi last week the second largest political party in italy the five star party pulled out of the coalition supporting him and draghi sensibly said that he will resign without the unity of support resigning makes sense even though it will make matters worse for italy over the short term that s because history and logic make clear that being a leader of a country in which the people are hell bent on fighting with each other and tearing down bipartisan efforts is pointless it s like trying to fight the tide one might as well stand aside and let what will happen happen including having the terrible outcomes under someone else s leadership one way or another there must come about a greater appreciation for a smart strong leader who tries to help most of the people rather than a leader of one faction in a battle with others history and logic make clear that in a democracy in which there are both 1 weak fundamentals that are leading to painful circumstances and 2 fragmentation in political decision making one is destined to be a failed leader that is because at such times the only leadership that will work is smart enough and strong enough leadership that can make the needed changes to deal with the fundamental problems well this week two votes of confidence are scheduled one in the senate and the other in the chamber of deputies of course it would be best if he gets strong expressions of confidence and the non partisan coalition holds because draghi is capable and widely respected by both international investors and most factions within italy i personally believe that he is exactly what italy needs now because the alternative picture of what it will get without him is a bleak one we will see however even if the vote of confidence is given and draghi stays it appears that with this level of indebtedness political fragmentation the need for monetary policy tightening and the likelihood of painful structural reforms being required to create a deal for protections to be put in place against italian interest rates rising a lot against less indebted countries interest rates it seems unlikely that this will go well for long especially given the longevity of the average italian leader being what it is but it s worth the try the classic biggest risk to democracy comes when there are bad conditions and great fragmentations about what to do about them that often leads to some form of anarchy and civil wars that inevitably lead to the rise of autocratic leadership that takes control of things to make the trains run on time italians should know this very well can mario draghi s capable non partisan leadership prevent this an objective observer would bet against it because it s very rare that a country that is so challenged and fragmented chooses to follow the capable leader without continuing to fight with each other and the leader this is an iconic case pay attention to the others while this case involving mario draghi italy and europe is particularly interesting and precarious because italy is so overly indebted politically fragmented and the central bank needs to raise interest rates because they are extremely low relative to inflation which will be very painful italy is just one of a number of countries in this position history has given us many lessons about how these situations play out the next interesting challenge of this sort to watch is brazil s now most leaders in democracies can t lead as i said earlier trying to lead when people are hell bent on fighting with each other is like trying to prevent the tide one might as well stand aside and let the terrible consequences come i think that is now true in most countries what is needed in times of difficulty and fragmentation is strong leadership that fixes things history and logic show that that typically only happens after a fight when the winner who through some mix of suppression of the opposition and giving benefits to supporters to make them happy gains broad based support and has capabilities and powers to do the best things for most people in the country it would of course be so much better if democracies could produce the strong leaders who fix things without having the destructive fighting but it seems illogical to expect that still it s something worth striving for article by ray dalio via linkedin

by chris isidore cnn business lockdowns caused by the covid surge in china caused sales and profits to fall at tesla compared to the first three months of the year the first time since the pandemic surfaced in early 2020 that the company did not report a record profit tesla reported adjusted income of 2 6 billion in the second quarter down from the 3 7 billion in the first quarter but 1 billion more than it earned a year earlier revenue of 16 9 billion in the quarter fell 10 from the first quarter but was up 42 from a year ago earnings were better than forecast by analysts surveyed by refinitiv while revenue was slightly below expectations it also disclosed it had sold 75 of its bitcoin holdings which it said added 936 million in cash to its balance sheet cfo zachary kirkhorn said the company made a profit on the value of those sales despite the sharp drop in the value of bitcoin in recent months but the company s overall profit took a 106 million hit from the lower value of its remaining bitcoin holdings ceo elon musk said the bitcoin sale was due to the the need to have additional cash on hand to deal with the lockdown of the shanghai plant so it was important for us to maximize our cash position given the uncertainty of the covid lockdowns in china he told investors during a conference call wednesday we are certainly open to increasing our bitcoin holdings in future so this should not be taken as some verdict on bitcoin tesla has not sold any of its dogecoin holdings he added tesla disclosed a 1 5 billion investment in bitcoin in february 2021 the crypto currency has lost about 50 of its value so far this year despite the attention that tesla s cryptocurrency holdings have received musk said it is not core to the company s mission to move the world towards sustainable energy he called the company s cryptocurrency holdings a sideshow to the sideshow musk has gotten more attention recently from his effort to buy twitter and his recent legal battle to get out of a deal that he agreed to in april during wednesday s call he was asked whether he anticipated changing his role at tesla or the amount of time he spends focused on the company over the next three to four years i m committed to the long term he said i ll work at tesla as long as i can usefully advance the cause of sustainability and autonomy the company s factory in shanghai had to halt production for most of the quarter due to mandatory lockdowns in the city to combat a surge in covid cases lockdowns across china also brought sales in the country the largest market for car sales to a near halt and disrupted the flow of parts from suppliers whose plants were shut down by covid measures tesla did open a factory in texas early in the quarter and another in germany in late march but the ramp up plans for those locations were affected by supply chain problems prompting musk to say during a late may interview that the two plants could only achieve a puny output of cars that made them gigantic money furnaces right now there s a giant roaring sound which is the sound of money on fire in wednesday s earning report the company s view on the output of those two plants was far more positive the german plant reached an important milestone of over 1 000 cars produced in a single week while achieving positive gross margin during the quarter the company said previously tesla had said that june was the highest vehicle production month in tesla s history in comments to investors wednesday musk described the quarter as a kind of supply chain hell but in spite of all these challenges it was one of the strongest quarters in our history he said tesla has the potential for a record breaking second half of the year although he cautioned that bullish forecast was obviously subject to force majeure things outside of our control the past years have been quite a few force majeures musk added tesla has a target to grow global sales by 50 or more annually for the foreseeable future and at the start of this year musk said tesla expected to be comfortably above that target in 2022 the company built and sold just under 1 million cars last year so a 50 increase would represent roughly 1 5 million cars but ended the second quarter having built and sold about 560 000 cars tesla would need to increase production in the second half by more than 75 to reach that 50 growth target for this year still even with the second quarter production and sales problems cfo kirkhorn said tesla is still pushing to reach that target an effort that has become more difficult but it remains possible with strong execution he said shares of tesla were slightly higher in after hours trading immediately following the report the stock is down 30 for the year the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

the biden administration is warning states to prepare for a limited supply of novavax s covid 19 vaccine to be made available after federal health authorities cleared the shots for use on tuesday states will likely be unable to begin requesting their first shipments until next week a limited number of doses of novavax covid 19 vaccine will be distributed and not all providers are expected to carry novavax covid 19 vaccine says a planning document published this week by the centers for disease control and prevention states will not be able to begin ordering from the biden administration s supply of novavax s vaccine until the week of july 25 the document tentatively estimates that could mean the first shots of novavax s vaccine will not arrive in doctors offices and pharmacies until august a timeline previously floated by health authorities spokespeople for the department of health and human services did not respond to multiple requests for comment why is there a delay in rolling out the vaccines the federal approach to rolling out novavax s vaccine marks a departure from the high profile campaigns to quickly deploy previous brands like pfizer biontech or moderna those shots saw shipments begin within days after they were first authorized at least part of the delay in supplying novavax s doses appears to be the result of quality testing still ongoing to clear the company s shots which is only now wrapping up novavax said in a statement that the food and drug administration had recently signed off on the quality of its first vaccine lot clearing it for release novavax expects to ship doses to the u s government designated distribution center in the coming days the company said how much of the vaccine will be available and who will be able to get it approximately three million doses of novavax s vaccine will be made available for health departments to request in total the biden administration has urged states to direct doses from their one time allocation to providers with expected demand among unvaccinated patients around 1 in 10 american adults have yet to get at least one covid 19 vaccine dose according to the cdc s figures or at least 26 million adults around 16 of those unvaccinated adults told a cdc survey that they probably or definitely will get vaccinated if a protein based vaccine like novavax was available the document also says states should try to plan for redistributing the shots in ways that minimizes wastage of the limited stocks of novavax s vaccine which come in 10 dose vials that must be used within 6 hours after opening but like with other shots the cdc also emphasizes that doctors should not miss any opportunities to vaccinate every eligible person who requests a shot even if it ends up wasting several other doses in the vial we are working feverishly to get a lower format of presentations that we can submit to the regulators and get approval in due course novavax s filip dubovsky said at a meeting of the cdc s advisers on tuesday where will i be able to get it it s unclear how those initial batches of novavax s vaccine will be divided up by the biden administration between states and other federal vaccination channels like drug stores or health centers for example the cdc says its federal retail pharmacy program had administered more than 250 million doses in the covid 19 vaccination campaign through early july but a spokesperson for at least one of the program s participants cvs said their drug stores have no immediate plans to offer the novavax vaccine at our retail locations the moderna and pfizer covid 19 vaccines remain readily available for patients said cvs spokesperson matt blanchette what was the reason for the previous delays this timeline is the latest delay for novavax s vaccine reaching unvaccinated adults now more than six weeks after the company s shots won the near unanimous backing of the fda s outside vaccine advisers on june 7 the fda did not grant emergency authorization for the company s shots until july 13 documents published by the fda this week reveal that during that time talks with the regulator yielded changes to how novavax described the risk of allergic reactions and a rare heart inflammation side effect known as myocarditis or pericarditis the company went from calling them important potential risks to important identified risks linked to their vaccine the documents also say that novavax told the regulator during the late stage of its review that it had made tweaks to how its vaccine was being manufactured testing later showed that those changes did not appear to impact the purity or quality of the shots in a statement after the shots were authorized the fda s dr peter marks said the agency s comprehensive analysis and evaluation had concluded that novavax s vaccine meets the fda s high standards for safety and effectiveness for emergency use authorization the american public can trust that this vaccine like all vaccines that are used in the united states has undergone the fda s rigorous and comprehensive scientific and regulatory review said marks 2022 cbs interactive inc all rights reserved

second quarter of 2021 the quarter over quarter growth in net interest income was primarily due to the expansion of the net interest margin from 2 90 in the first quarter of 2022 to 3 16 for the

the same period last year the increase in interest income from the first quarter of 2022 to the second quarter was primarily the result of a 27 basis point expansion in earning asset yield in comparison to the second quarter of 2021 interest income in the most recent quarter grew based on a combination of 1 6 billion of growth in average earnings assets and expanding earning asset yields of 9 basis points year over year earning asset growth resulted from both the acquisition of suncrest bank suncrest on january 7 2022 in addition to core loan and deposit growth over the last year interest expense increased 62 000 or 4 92 from the prior quarter due to a 1 basis point increase in cost of funds although average interest bearing deposits grew by approximately 616 2 million interest expense decreased 318 000 or 19 39 compared to the second quarter of 2021 the year over year decrease in interest expense resulted from lower cost of funds which declined to 4 basis points

the first quarter of 2022 and 3 06 for the second quarter of 2021 higher interest rates and a change in the mix of our earning assets resulted in the higher net interest margin the 26 basis point increase in our net interest margin compared to the first quarter of 2022 was primarily due to a 27 basis point increase in our earning asset yield the increase in the earning asset yield was due to a 23 basis point increase in security yields for the recent quarter and a quarter over quarter change in the composition of average earning assets with investments growing from 36 19 to 39 23 of earnings assets while funds held at the federal reserve declined from 10 4 to 5 1 throughout the first half of 2022 we deployed some of the excess liquidity on the balance sheet at the end of 2021 into additional investment securities by purchasing approximately 1 5 billion in securities the increase in earning asset yield was also impacted by loan growth which grew on average over the first quarter of 2022 by 134 million and an increase in loan yields from 4 27 to 4 31 interest and fee income from paycheck protection program ppp loans was approximately 1 4 million in the second quarter

quarter of 2022 to 4 20 in the most recent quarter the 10 basis point increase in net interest margin compared to the second quarter of 2021 was primarily the result of a 9 basis point increase in earning asset yield the increase in earning asset yield was impacted by a change in asset mix and higher yields on investment securities excess liquidity held at the federal reserve was invested into higher yielding investments which increased to 39 23 of earning assets on average for the second quarter of 2022 from 28 18 for the second quarter of 2021 the increase associated with investments was partially offset by loan balances declining to 55 49 of earning assets on average for the second quarter of 2022 compared to 59 22 for the second quarter of 2021 as well as a 15 basis point decline in loan yields total cost of funds of 0 04 for the second quarter of 2022 increased from 0 03 for the first quarter of 2022 and decreased from 0 05 for the year ago quarter the 1 basis point increase in

managing director and chief executive officer sandeep biswas said the june quarter delivered another round of excellent drilling results across our key sites continuing our strong track record of exploration success at brucejack drilling continued to deliver outstanding results in all of our target zones supporting our views of significant resource growth opportunities beyond the valley of the kings deposit drilling at red chris continues to define the extent and continuity of higher grade mineralisation at east ridge and pleasingly the system continues to remain open further to the east havieron continues to deliver promising results with recent intercepts extending the high grade zone in the south east crescent as well as expanding the higher grade footprint in the eastern and northern breccia indicating significant potential for further resource growth overall fy22 has been a tremendous year for exploration success and we are well placed to progress our extensive drilling programs in the new year to create additional value for our shareholders said mr biswas brucejack british columbia canada 2 the brucejack property hosts the valley of the kings vok high grade gold deposit the vok is characterised by multiple occurrences of higher grade mineralisation over selected intervals hosted within broader zones of stockwork and vein arrays growth activities are focused on both resource expansion within the existing mine area as well as brownfields exploration activities within 4km of the mine area both programs continued to deliver very strong results for the period

1 sampling techniques and data criteria commentary sampling techniques core samples are obtained from core drilling hq and nq diameter diamond core was drilled on a 3 4 5m or 6m run core was cut using an automatic core cutter and half core sampled at 2m intervals cover sequences were not sampled drilling techniques core drilling was advanced with hq3 hq nq3 and nq diameter coring configuration core from inclined drill holes are oriented on 3 4 5m or 6m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100 with isolated zones of lower recovery logging geological logging recorded qualitative descriptions of lithology alteration mineralisation veining and structure for all core drilled 30 482m in 32 holes all holes intersected mineralisation except for 5 dedicated geotechnical holes including orientation of key geological features geotechnical measurements were recorded including rock quality designation rqd fracture frequency solid core recovery and qualitative rock strength measurements magnetic susceptibility measurements were recorded every metre all geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the red chris mine digital data logging was captured validated and stored in an acquire database all drill cores were photographed prior to cutting and or sampling the core sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled core was cut and sampled at the red chris mine core processing facility half core samples were collected in plastic bags together with pre numbered sample tags and grouped in wood crates for dispatch to the laboratory sample weights typically varied from 5 to 10kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation drill core samples were freighted by road to the laboratory sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso 9001 certified and iso 17025 accredited bureau veritas commodities canada ltd laboratory vancouver bureau veritas samples were dried at 650c and crushed to 95 passing 4 75 mm and the split to obtain up to 1kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm2 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 95 passing 106µm duplicate samples were collected from crush and pulp samples at a rate of 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at bureau veritas all samples were assayed for 59 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method ma250 gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with icp es finish method fa350 carbon and sulphur were determined by leco method tc000 and mercury using aqua regia digestion followed by icp es ms determination method aq200 sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in the acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in the acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data due to the limited extent of the drilling program to date extended quality control programs are yet to be undertaken whereby pulped samples will be submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled sample tags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the acquire database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by re logging of drill core intervals and assessment of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person qualified person no adjustments are made to assay data and no twinned holes have been completed drilling intersects mineralisation at various angles there are no currently known

table 1 section 1 sampling techniques and data criteria commentary sampling techniques core samples are obtained from core drilling in proterozoic basement lithologies pq hq and nq diameter core was drilled on a 6m run core was cut using an automated core cutter and half core sampled at 1m intervals with breaks for major geological changes sampling intervals range from 0 2 1 0m cover sequences were not sampled drilling techniques permian paterson formation cover sequence was drilled using mud rotary drilling depths of cover typically observed to approximately 420m vertically below surface steel casing was emplaced to secure the pre collar core drilling was advanced from the base of the cover sequence with pq3 hq3 and nq2 diameter coring configuration core from inclined drill holes is oriented on 3m and 6m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100 with isolated zones of lower recovery cover sequence drilling by the mud rotary drilling did not yield recoverable samples logging geological logging recorded qualitative descriptions of lithology alteration mineralisation veining and structure for all core drilled 10 217 m for 21 drill holes all intersecting mineralisation including orientation of key geological features geotechnical measurements were recorded including rock quality designation rqd fracture frequency solid core recovery and qualitative rock strength measurements magnetic susceptibility measurements were recorded every metre the bulk density of selected drill core intervals was determined at site on whole core samples all geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the havieron site digital data logging was captured on diamond drill core intervals only and all data validated and stored in an acquire database all drill cores were photographed prior to cutting and or sampling the core the logging is of sufficient quality to support mineral resource estimates sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled core was cut and sampled at the havieron core processing facility half core samples of between 0 2 and 2 0 m were collected in pre numbered calico bags and grouped in plastic bags for dispatch to the laboratory sample weights typically varied from 0 5 to 8kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation drill core samples were freighted by air and road to the laboratory sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso17025 accredited intertek laboratory perth intertek samples were dried at 105oc and crushed to 95 passing 4 75mm and the split to obtain up to 3kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm5 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 95 passing 106µm routine grind size analysis is conducted duplicate samples were collected from crush and pulp samples at a rate of 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at intertek all samples were assayed for 48 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method 4a ms907 which is considered to provide a total assay for copper gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with aas finish method fa50n aa which is considered to provide a total assay for gold sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in the acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data extended quality control programs including pulp samples submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs have been completed analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled calico bags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the acquire database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by re logging of diamond drill core intervals and assessment of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person qualified person no adjustments are made to assay data and no twinned holes have been completed there are no currently known drilling sampling recovery or other factors that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data location of data points drill collar locations were surveyed using a differential gps with gnss with a stated accuracy of 0 5m for all drill holes reported drill rig alignment was attained using an electronic azimuth aligner downhole survey was collected at 6 12m intervals in the cover sequence and every 6 to 30m in diamond drill core segments of the drill hole using single shot axis mining champ gyro the single shot surveys have been validated using continuous survey to surface axis mining champ along with a selection of drill holes re surveyed by an external survey contactor using a devigyro tool confirming sufficient accuracy for downhole spatial recording a lidar survey was completed over the project area in nov 2019 which was used to prepare a dem topographic model for the project with a spatial accuracy of 0 1m vertical and 0 3m horizontal the topography is generally low relief to flat elevation within the dune corridors in ranges between 250 265m australian height datum ahd steepening to the southeast all collar coordinates are provided in the geocentric datum of australian gda20 zone 51 all relative depth information is reported in ahd 5000m data spacing and distribution within the south east crescent and breccia zone drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 100m to 50 by 50m within the resource extents outside the initial resource boundary drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 200m in lateral extent within the breccia zone over an area of 2km2 the data spacing is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity significant assay intercepts remain open further drilling is required to determine the extent of currently defined mineralisation no sample compositing is applied to samples drilling intersects mineralisation at various angles orientation of data in relation to geological structure drill holes exploring the extents of the havieron mineral system intersect moderately dipping carbonate and siliclastic sedimentary facies mineralised breccia and sub vertical intrusive lithologies geological modelling has been interpreted from historic and newcrest drill holes variable brecciation alteration and sulphide mineralisation is observed with a footprint with dimensions of 650m x 350m trending in a north west orientation and over 1000m in vertical extent below cover the subvertical southeast high grade arcuate crescent sulphide zone has an average thickness of 20m and has been defined over a strike length of up to 550m and extended to over 700m in vertical extent below cover drilling direction is oriented to intersect the steeply dipping high grade sulphide mineralisation zones at an intersection angle of greater than 40 degrees the drilled length of reported intersections is typically greater than true width of mineralisation sample security the security of samples is controlled by tracking samples from drill rig to database drill core was delivered from the drill rig to the havieron core yard every shift on completion of geological and geotechnical logging core processing was completed by newcrest personnel at the havieron facility high resolution core photography and cutting of drill core was undertaken at the havieron core processing facilities samples were freighted in sealed bags by air and road to the laboratory and in the custody of newcrest representatives sample numbers are generated directly from the database all samples are collected in pre numbered calico bags verification of sample numbers and identification is conducted by the laboratory on receipt of samples and sample receipt advise issued to newcrest details of all sample movement are recorded in a database table dates hole id sample ranges and the analytical suite requested are recorded with the dispatch of samples to analytical services any discrepancies logged at the receipt of samples into the analytical services are validated audits or reviews internal reviews of core handling sample preparation and assays laboratories were conducted on a regular basis by both project personnel and owner representatives in the competent person s opinion the sample preparation security and analytical procedures are consistent with current industry standards and are entirely appropriate and acceptable for the styles of mineralisation identified and will be appropriate for use in the reporting of exploration results and mineral resource estimates there are no identified drilling sampling or recovery factors that materially impact the adequacy and reliability of the results of the drilling programme in

dna special rupee breaches 80 mark here s what its fall means for the economy what message does the weakening of the rupee against the dollar give for the country s economy here s mathematics of rupee simplified for the first time in history the indian rupee has crossed 80 against the us dollar in simple and easy words 1 is equal to rs 80 02 in today s date today questions are being raised continuously about what message does the weakening of the rupee against the dollar give for the country s economy here are some questions that would come to your mind why does the rupee fall what does depreciation of rupee mean is a weak rupee weakening india on the economic front as well is this historic fall in the rupee going to cause a big explosion of inflation while these subjects are very complex here s an explanation of the mathematics of rupee simplified what does it mean when the rupee weakens purchasing power is reduced think of it like this earlier rs 70 was equal to 1 now for that 1 you need to pay rs 80 when you go to buy any goods or any service in the market then its entire transaction is done in indian currency but when india as a country trades in the international market the same transaction takes place in foreign exchange right now our country does most of the trade in the international market i e transactions in dollars which is the currency of america for example all the crude oil that india buys from the international market its full payment is done in dollars only now suppose india s 70 rupees is equal to one dollar and the price of crude oil per barrel in the international market is 10 dollars then india will have to pay 700 rupees for one barrel of crude oil but if this rupee weakens further against the dollar and its price goes beyond rs 80 then india will have to pay rs 800 for this one barrel of crude oil that is the prices of crude oil did not change but due to the weakening of the rupee india s expenditure on import of crude oil increased in a nutshell a weakening of the rupee against the dollar means that india s import bill will be expensive as india spends more on imports than before it will also increase the domestic prices of those goods and services which come from other countries just like how the price of petrol and diesel has increased or the mobile phones and vehicles that are imported have become expensive this process is also called currency depreciation that is when the value of any other currency decreases in relation to the dollar it is called falling breaking and weakening of that currency why is the indian rupee falling there are many reasons for this the first reason is inflation the things that india imports or the things we buy from other countries their prices have increased in the international market of all these crude oil is the most important due to the ongoing war between ukraine and russia crude oil prices have been volatile and are continuing to rise due to which the import bill of india has increased now when a country spends more money on imports i e if it spends more money on buying goods from other countries and exports are less in comparison then it increases the current account deficit suppose india bought goods worth rs 100 from other countries and sold only rs 60 worth of goods in the international market so this difference of rs 40 will be our current account deficit that is india will suffer continuously due to this imbalance of imports and exports it is estimated that this year the current account deficit of india can be 105 billion dollar i e rs 8 40 000 crore another main reason for the weakening of the rupee is the loss of confidence of foreign investors in this year alone foreign investors have withdrawn 30 billion i e rs 2 40 000 crore foreign investment from the stock markets of india this has weakened the rupee apart from this there are other reasons for the weakening of the rupee for example global supply chains are affected because of covid 19 how worrying is this fall in the rupee the rupee has weakened at almost the same pace between 2008 and 2022 in the year 2008 it was rs 43 against 1 in 2014 it touched the level of rs 64 against the dollar now it has gone beyond rs 80 the rupee has depreciated 25 percent against the dollar between 2014 and 2022 advantages and disadvantages of weakening of the rupee first the disadvantages this will increase india s expenditure on imports things coming from abroad such as expensive phones electrical items and vehicles will become costlier holidays abroad will become expensive studying abroad will cost more taking loans from abroad will also become expensive however there are also some advantages to the fall of the rupee for example the indian government and indian companies that export their goods to other countries will get more money than before think of it like that when the value was rs 70 against 1 earlier an export of 10 dollars item would get a trader rs 700 but now the trader will get rs 800 for the same item that is the price of the item did not increase but due to the weakening of the rupee that trader got this advantage on exports people of indian origin who live abroad and send foreign currency from there to india will now benefit more however this does not mean that the rupee s fall is not worrying this is worrying and this is the reason that the central bank i e the reserve bank of india has been involved in the rescue operation of rupee rbi has started selling dollars from foreign exchange reserves to keep the value of rupee stable rbi has so far sold 32 billion i e about rs 2 50 000 crore from its foreign reserves and now there is a foreign exchange of 580 billion i e rs 46 40 000 crore left in the foreign exchange reserves of india there is a question in the mind of many people that how can the rupee be saved by selling dollars from foreign reserves so there is a process for that too in fact when rbi sells dollars from its foreign exchange reserves it gets rupees in return and this increases the demand for rupees in the international market and when the demand for a currency increases the breakdown or weakening of that currency stops therefore there are reports that in the coming time rbi may sell more dollars from foreign exchange reserves to strengthen the rupee and increase its demand however this is a temporary solution some economists also believe that rbi should not interfere much in the fall of rupee read how powerful is your indian passport check countries where you don t need prior visa

blazer ev make chevrolet segment suv the battle for electric vehicle supremacy is on and tesla is far from the only player these days the 2022 ford mustang mach e is selling faster than the blue oval can build it even outpacing the gas powered mustang but the mach e no longer has the market to itself with new options arriving from around the automotive industry general motors is finally jumping into the affordable ev segment with the 2024 chevrolet blazer ev which will arrive summer 2023 with a wide range of trim levels including a sporty ss trim to take on the mach e gt the blazer ev looks like it will have what it takes to steal sales from chevy s detroit rival how do the blazer ev and mach e stack up on paper let s find out exterior design electric icons ford took a lot of flak when it attached the mustang name to an electric crossover but many of the mach e s styling elements look like they belong on a two door sports car the headlights are sleek and aggressive while the three piece taillights are styled to look just like the conventional mustang some mach e trim levels look better than others depending on their wheels but we particularly love the performance gt model and the special ice white edition as for the blazer ev it looks similar to the current gas powered model which has already been likened to a camaro suv but adds some futuristic cues like a full length led light bar that also conveys the state of charge and muscular front fender extractor vents rs and ss trims receive choreographed lighting sequences which activate when the driver approaches with the key the lower 1lt and 2lt trims ride on aerodynamic 19 inch wheels the rs gets sport 21 inch wheels and the ss maxes out with monster 22 inch wheels close interior design tale of the tech the mach e has perhaps the best interior we ve seen from ford in a long time not counting lincoln it impresses with a massive 15 5 inch vertically oriented touchscreen in the center with a short 10 inch screen in front of the driver to display speed and other basic information the cabin layout feels very open with lots of storage space and an airy glass roof that unfortunately doesn t open or have a shade all of the materials feel befitting of the price and wouldn t feel out of place in a luxury car whereas ford kept things more simple chevy went bold on the interior a giant 17 7 inch touchscreen comes standard on all trims paired with an 11 inch touchscreen and available head up display unlike the mach e the optional blazer s panoramic roof comes with a closable shade and it can be opened for some additional air we like the premium feeling mach e interior but the blazer offers more wow factor with available red seats and orange accents on the ss model close range performance ss vs gt ford is currently sold out of 2022 mach e stock so some configurations are not currently available to order when all trims are accounted for ford offers the mach e with two different battery packs 68 kwh usable and 88 kwh usable each available with rear drive or all wheel drive the least powerful model with the standard range pack and rwd produces 266 horsepower and 317 lb ft of torque while the gt delivers 480 hp and 600 lb ft of torque 634 lb ft in the gt performance edition ford says the gt can hit 60 mph in 3 8 seconds 3 5 in performance guise as for the range the mach e varies from 211 miles on the low end to 305 miles on the california route 1 we don t have full specs for the blazer yet including any battery sizes but we have some rough range estimates the base 1lt goes 247 miles on a charge while the rs tops out a 320 miles we only have performance metrics for the ss which produces 557 hp and 648 lb ft of torque from dual electric motors chevy says the wow wide open watts mode will enable a sub four second 0 60 sprint likely splitting the difference between the two gt models gm s hands free super cruise technology will be available which we prefer to ford s blue cruise close pricing verdict a tight race once again ford doesn t currently have all mach e trims in stock but pricing starts at 43 895 for the base select trim stepping up to the premium costs 48 775 while the longest range ca route 1 is 52 450 as for the high performance gt it costs 61 995 plus 6 000 for the performance edition the base blazer ev 1lt and 2lt will not undercut the mach e on pricing at 44 995 and 47 595 respectively but they will deliver better range and likely more interior volume the rs nearly matches the california route 1 on price at 51 995 in terms of raw acceleration the ss is best matched against the gt but it s a bit more expensive starting at 65 995 clearly ford and gm are about to have another one of their epic battles only this time the camaro or a real mustang aren t participating

california is facing a massive shortage of 50 000 teachers going into the 2022 23 school year after more than a decade of budget cuts and the promotion of charter schools educators are experiencing sharply declining pay and conditions leading thousands to quit the profession or move elsewhere for more affordable living conditions in the 2020 21 school year the total number of full time equivalent teachers in the state was 274 759 of this amount 46 434 teachers were either uncertified or certified in a subject other than what they were teaching children with special needs are the top victims of this deficit in the 2020 21 school year 28 985 teachers were authorized to teach those with disabilities but the majority required exemptions to teach only 43 5 percent had preliminary and clear credentials which require a minimum of 5 years experience basic skills requirements and training in teaching only 52 1 percent of teachers for students with either hearing or visual impairments were fully credentialed one of the largest school districts in the state oakland unified had nearly one third of its classes taught by teachers without full certification california has filled the gap with limited permits such as provisional internship short term staff variable term waivers and substitute permits these give schools exemptions to state credentialing requirements substitute teachers are also in short supply and the state has turned to hiring more unqualified teachers in sacramento where teachers struck in march against low wages and understaffing roughly a quarter of students had no permanent teacher the lack of substitute teachers meant that on any given day nearly 3 000 students across the district did not even have an adult for their class and had to sit with other classes without teachers in their school s cafeteria or auditorium the covid 19 pandemic has been particularly painful for teachers the democratic party controlled state legislature governor gavin newsom and state superintendent of public instruction tony thurmond with the cheer leading of the teachers unions recklessly pushed a return to in person instruction in the middle of the pandemic forced into crowded in person classes without proper personal protective equipment or adequate ventilation staff as well as students contracted covid 19 with many dying or developing long covid over 9 million californians have officially been infected with covid 19 representing 11 percent of all cases in the united states and 9 130 have died roughly 9 percent of nationwide deaths among children 1 467 721 youth up to the age of 17 have officially been infected in the state and 72 have died the drop in living standards the stress of the risks of in person education during the pandemic and long hours the average teacher in the us works a 50 hour workweek combined to cause a significant uptick in early retirements moves out of state and abandonment of the teaching profession one out of 10 school districts in california have yearly turnover rates of 25 percent or more nationwide college graduates are turning away from teaching careers due to the atrocious conditions educators face even before the pandemic training programs were experiencing dramatic declines in enrollment between 2011 and 2019 the last year with completed nationwide data the number of bachelor degrees in education dropped over 21 percent the trend accelerated during the pandemic with the american association of colleges for teacher education reporting that one in five institutions saw an enrollment decline of 11 percent or more in both 2020 and 2021 the california department of education has launched the california center for teaching careers to recruit more teachers but the shortage is caused by deliberate policies of the newsom administration rather than improve the school system the state seeks to dilute its educational standards any influx of new teachers will be inexperienced and hired by schools in the deepest state of crisis with the largest vacancies many will quickly burn out and quit for school districts subs and new hires are a financial bonus both groups earn less and receive less benefits than experienced full time instructors the downward spiral accelerated with the great recession of december 2007 to june 2009 this crisis was triggered by the federal reserve turning a blind eye to the risky speculation of financial institutions leading to the debacle of subprime mortgages and a collapse of stock prices the recession led to budget cuts across the united states with layoffs of teachers and cuts to school programs california s legislative analyst s office investigated the impact of the great recession versus previous recessions twice as many jobs were lost compared to the 1990 91 downturn and four times as many compared to the 2001 recession the recovery also took two and three years longer compared to those previous crises respectively the national council on teacher quality surveyed 41 school districts nationwide they concluded that in the four years following the market crash salary increases were one third to one half of pre recession levels of the districts studied 80 percent had a pay freeze or cut in at least one of those years southern california s long beach teachers averaged 1 8 percent yearly salary increases between 2008 12 as inflation grew 2 75 percent yearly for the same period california school districts have not recovered deferring maintenance laying off staff and closing schools now dozens of state districts are facing financial ruin and a state takeover which will only lead to more cuts teacher pay over the last two years has sharply declined with an 11 8 percent rate of inflation for this period the leading teachers unions the national education association nea and the american federation of teachers aft have refused any strike action against budget cuts school closures and layoffs the only benefactors of the recession were the wall street firms that were given 787 billion by the obama administration the administration bragged about funds for school construction and preschool programs health care subsidies and a middle class tax cut the final stimulus package reduced all of that and added a 70 billion tax break for upper income families as for the criminals who brought on the crash goldman sachs bank of america citibank jpmorgan chase and morgan stanley dished out 90 billion in executive compensation and bonuses in order to defend their living standards massively expand public education and fight to end the

commentary china s second quarter gdp grew only 0 4 percent on a year over year basis but contracted 2 6 percent compared to the first quarter for years i have been reluctant to comment on the fake figures but now the releases seem more down to the earth although the numbers are broadly in line with the proxy composite pmi which floated around 50 in the second quarter the overall gdp change was still inconsistent with some key numbers such as industrial profits and retail sales which declined quite a bit moreover unemployment especially among the youth was severe the consensus of the analytic circle attributed the second quarter to lockdown under covid no doubt this was important but short lasting even excluding this and the massive lockdown in 2020 q1 the growth of real economic activity has still been on a downtrend the slope was getting more negative after the watershed in 2018 before that it had taken six years to edge down from 8 percent to 7 percent after that it took four years to plunge from 7 percent to a current trend level of 4 percent or slightly below clearly the massive deleveraging explained such cliff falling the accompanying chart shows the china property developers leading us dollar bond index compiled by cric and the official real gdp year over year growth rate they have moved in tandem with each other true any two time series could correlate without much reasoning nevertheless real estate banking and debt sectors are well known as key amplifiers that magnify economic cycles ups or downs this leads to the suspicion that the so called economic miracle was not anything special but a huge bubble to repay now china property bond index and real gdp growth courtesy of law ka chung like any other emerging market debt crisis it is always due to over leveraging as a background fundamental then triggered by interest rate rise and or exchange rate depreciation this time is no different and of no exception the starting time of the crisis also lends support to this 2016 18 was when the western economies had fully recovered from the financial tsunami and european debt crisis while the u s interest rate was hiked by more than 2 percent and western stock markets generally broke their record highs western rise eastern decline despite the deep v crash due to covid in early 2020 the just mentioned back to the west was ongoing in the successive six quarters although it is probably the end of the boom cycle of the west the swing back to the east will not necessarily happen and is unlikely as the china deleveraging is not yet done this was pretty like the early 2000s when the western down cycle began yet japan did not benefit from it even after a decade of slow deleveraging and it is not yet done it turns out that an extra full cycle from 2003 to 2008 was needed for japan to bottom out comparatively china s bubble was much larger than japan s at their corresponding peaks whereas china s deleveraging might not be faster than japan s so for china to be the first to bottom out is wishful thinking
americans need to reach deeper into their wallets at the grocery checkout but there s no indication the shelves will be barren according to farmer survey data that tracks production food prices were up more than 10 percent year over year in june with flour jumping almost 20 percent farmers have been hit with a conflation of adversities including doubling prices of diesel and fertilizers as well as herbicide shortages this prompted concerns over a possible food crisis especially if farmers were to get a bad crop this year so far it seems those fears may not materialize while some parts of the country have been affected by droughts overall the harvest is still looking to be fairly good this year according to the july grain report by the department of agriculture usda pdf the united states is a major grain exporter especially wheat corn and soy as such it would take a particularly extreme calamity to push the country into food shortage even though the conditions were particularly difficult this year it appears farmers have been able to push through farmers expect to get over 48 million metric tons of wheat and more than 368 million metric tons of corn this year that s about 1 percent down from the 5 year average for wheat but 1 percent up for corn in fact grain prices have started to decline a bit in recent weeks though that may have more to do with expectations of an economic downturn which could tighten demand meanwhile meat eggs and milk production have been holding up as well though farmers are expected to collect about 3 percent fewer eggs this year likely due to the avian flu outbreak that forced them to kill about 2 million laying hens earlier this year price wise however milk is up 13 5 percent eggs some 33 percent and chicken meat about 18 percent pork and beef are only up 4 and 10 percent respectively from a year ago but measured against 2019 both hiked by over 25 percent the hikes are partly due to higher input prices such as those of animal feed and partly due to strong demand both at home and abroad propped up by massive government spending during the covid 19 pandemic the ukraine war has disrupted grain exports from the country particularly wheat that also pushed global grain prices up ukraine is stuck with about 20 million tons of grain slated for export ukrainian media reported by comparison the world consumes about 770 million tons of wheat a year and keeps a stock of about 270 million tons according to the usda report

the monetary policy committee of the central bank of nigeria has raised concerns over the nation s debt sustainability in light of current global uncertainties according to the committee the federal government s increasing debt profile is worrying noting that there is a need for the government to urgently diversify its revenue base the mpc disclosed this in a document titled central bank of nigeria communiqué no 143 of the monetary policy committee meeting held on monday 18th and tuesday 19th july 2022 it was posted on the cbn s website on wednesday it stated the committee noted the federal government s increasing debt profile and expressed concerns over debt sustainability given that global uncertainties remain elevated the mpc thus reiterated its call to the federal government to urgently diversify its revenue sources through various initiatives such as the development of a viable tax framework for the extractive and mineral export industries to strengthen its fiscal buffers according to the debt management office nigeria s total public debt stock rose to n41 60tn in the first quarter of 2022 nigeria reportedly spent 86 per cent of its revenue on servicing debt in 2021 recently the international monetary fund projected that the federal government might spend more revenue on payment of debt interests in 2022 it said this in its nigeria staff report for the 2021 article iv consultation report it stated although interest payments were only two per cent of gdp in 2020 about 89 per cent of federal government revenues were absorbed by interest payments reflecting poor domestic revenue mobilisation capacity the fg interest to revenue ratio is expected to slightly decline to around 86 per cent in 2021 and rise steadily to reach 139 per cent by 2026 high interest to revenue ratio puts fiscal space at risk and makes financing of current and capital spending highly dependent on debt financing according to the washington based lender higher debt service to government revenues through higher interest rates and or increased borrowing pose risks for fiscal sustainability in the nation recently the deputy president of the lagos chamber of commerce and industry dr gabriel idahosa said essentially our debt service is almost equal to our revenue
menafn getnews the us inflation rate has been on the rise in recent months and this is causing concern among investors the consumer price index cpi has increased to its highest level since 1981 the reason for this increase is not yet clear but several factors are likely contributing to it some economists are predicting that the rate will continue to grow in the coming months which could lead to serious problems for the economy the current inflation rate in the united states according to the federal reserve an acceptable inflation rate is around 2 percent or a bit below however the june 2022 inflation has hit a new peak of 9 1 percent this exceeded the 8 8 percent expectations and caused fear in the markets the constant increase brings trouble for most americans as the prices of necessities have surged the fed is now dealing with a balancing act of raising rates to bring down inflation without triggering a u s recession why is the inflation rate rising the inflation rate in the united states has been steadily increasing in the past two years the exact reasons for this are not clear but there are several possible explanations let us look at some of them 1 the ukraine war the consequences of the russian ukraine war are enormous and range from escalating commodity prices to the fear of world war 3 for instance ukraine is a big supplier of wheat and russia is a huge supplier of gas these commodities have gone up in price since they are harder to get because of the conflict 2 increase in money supply the u s government started waves of supportive financial measures to support the economy during the pandemic this included flooding trillions of dollars into the system and causing more money chasing the same number of goods therefore the increase in monetary demand causes firms to put up prices 3 job market the u s is seeing a high volume of job openings and people quitting when worker demand is high employers have to offer higher wages to attract and retain employees this eventually leads to higher prices for goods and services and that s inflation how is it affecting investors and their portfolios investors are closely watching the inflation rate as it can have a major impact on their portfolios here are some of the ways it can affect them 1 it can lead to higher interest rates if inflationary pressures continue to build the federal reserve may respond by raising interest rates this would have a direct impact on borrowing costs and it could also lead to a sell off in the stock market higher interest rates would also make it more difficult for companies to borrow money and expand their businesses 2 it can erode the value of investments inflation can also lead to the erosion of the value of investments as it effectively reduces the purchasing power of money this means that investors would need to spend more money to buy the same number of shares or assets over time this can have a significant impact on portfolio values 3 it can lead to market volatility a volatile market is the direct result of inflation when investors are worried about inflation they tend to sell their investments and move into cash or other safe haven assets this can lead to sharp swings in the markets and it can make it difficult to predict where prices will go next conclusion inflation is a major concern for investors as it can have a significant impact on their portfolios while there are some ways to protect against inflation it is still a risk that should be carefully monitored for most investors the best course of action is to diversify their portfolios across different asset classes to mitigate the effects of inflation

share in the same quarter of 2021 earnings per share for the trailing 12 months were 2 08 per share down from 2 28 per share for the prior twelve month period although earnings were impacted by the absence of income from ppp the bank performed according to expectations during 2nd quarter excluding ppp income for the 2nd quarter of 2021 eps would have been 0 38 per share demonstrating the strength in core earnings for the most recent quarter said lindsey trautman chief financial officer during the quarter the company also made a provision for loan losses of 113 thousand the second quarter of 2022 represents the first time in two years that earnings are not materially impacted by ppp loans or merger related adjustments and more closely represent core bank earnings going forward

during 2nd quarter the company experienced a decrease in deposits primarily related to tax payments made in april after ramping up in march commented joan reukauf chief operating officer portfolio loans were down 4 5 million during the 2nd quarter of 2022 compared to 1st quarter of 2022 commented julia beattie president during 1st quarter the bank experienced strong competition for long term fixed rate loans which materialized into continued downward pressure during the 2nd quarter this competition has eased with the rising rate environment but impacted 2nd quarter loan growth overall added beattie the last four remaining ppp loans were forgiven during 2nd quarter classified assets were flat from the prior quarter in both other real estate owned and classified loans total loans past due or on non accrual increased slightly as a percentage of total loans from the prior quarter to 0 22 versus 0 21 as of q1 2022 during the 2nd quarter the allowance for loan and lease losses alll was updated based on changes in loans and updated economic expectations which were factored into the bank s analysis as of june 30 2022 the alll was 1 06 of portfolio loans and the unallocated reserve stood at 791 thousand or 16 6 of the allowance second quarter 2022 non interest income totaled 3 2 million an increase of 306 thousand from the 2nd quarter of 2021 during q2 2022 steelhead finance factoring revenue increased 397 thousand a 25 0 increase over the same quarter of 2021 conversely mortgage income decreased 192 thousand or 27 5 from the 2nd quarter of 2021 due to an increase in interest rates and a softening housing market non interest expense totaled 6 1 million in the 2nd quarter up 111 thousand from the same period in 2021 notably personnel expense was the largest driver for the increase in non interest expense up 526 thousand versus the same quarter prior year a 15 5 increase primarily due to increasing wage pressure in the company s markets advertising expenses were down 279 thousand in the 2nd quarter of 2022 versus the same period in 2021 as the bank expensed 250 thousand in donations toward housing relief support for survivors of the 2020 alameda fire during 2nd quarter 2021 as of june 30 2022 the tier 1 capital ratio for pbco financial corporation was 9 58 with total shareholder equity of 66 4 million during the quarter the company was able to augment capital through earnings while assets also decreased with the decrease in deposits during the quarter as of june 30 2022 the bank s tier 1 capital ratio was 12 71 up from 11 25 as of march 31 2022 the company also had unrealized losses on its investment portfolio net of taxes of 19 3 million which is attributed to changes in market value in the current rising rate environment the net unrealized losses in the investment portfolio resulted in the decline in book value per share and tangible book value per share from prior periods losses in the investment portfolio would only be recognized if the company needed additional liquidity for operations commented lindsey trautman given the company s strong liquidity position and access to alternative sources of liquidity the probability of recognizing any losses in the investment portfolio remains very low added trautman overall 2nd quarter of 2022 demonstrated the company s solid core earnings and strengthened capital position which will allow us to weather the uncertain economic future commented julia beattie the 25 0 million sub debt issuance completed in first quarter has allowed the company to continue implementing its strategic plan while providing a cushion should a downturn occur added beattie based on experience gained in the great recession we know that banks who looked to the future and planned for economic uncertainty were able to work with clients and manage through challenges as they arose while protecting the safety and soundness of the company concluded beattie about pbco

omaha neb ap â csx on wednesday delivered slightly better profit in the second quarter even though volume was flat and the railroad still struggled to handle all the goods companies wanted to ship because it is having a hard time hiring the jacksonville florida based railroad said its profits grew 5 to 1 18 billion or 54 cents per share that s up from 1 17 billion or 52 cents per share a year ago without a one time gain on a real estate sale the railroad earned 50 cents per share ceo jim foote said csx hasn t been able to keep up with all the demand for shipments because it needs more employees but hiring is difficult and attrition has been high he said prospective employees are being more selective now about jobs based on quality of life factors and the 24 7 nature of railroad jobs may seem less appealing even though the jobs pay well â our ability to to hire and retain new workers which is vital to improving our service and growing the business remains challenged â foote said â we are not alone in facing this problem the labor market is tight but the results topped wall street expectations the average estimate of eight analysts surveyed by zacks investment research was for earnings of 47 cents per share the freight railroadâ s revenue jumped 28 to 3 82 billion in the period as csx increased shipping rates and charged customers more fuel surcharges in response to soaring diesel prices that topped the 3 64 billion that six analysts surveyed by zacks predicted foote said he still expects double digit growth in revenue and operating income this year because demand remains strong and the economy does not appear to be faltering even in the face of high inflation and rising interest rates csx and the other major freight railroads have been struggling to handle all the shipments companies hired them to deliver this year and those shipment delays have forced companies in a variety of industries to slow production or turn to shipping by truck if possible while they are waiting for trains railroads are trying to address the problems but they have had a hard time hiring all the additional workers they need amid nationwide worker shortages rail customers and regulators say the railroads cut their workforces too deeply as they overhauled their operations and eliminated nearly one third of the jobs across the industry railroads counter that they had enough workers to handle all the freight before the pandemic but they are still slowly recovering from the job cuts they made when many businesses shut down in 2020 csx said it now has about 6 667 of the 7 000 train crewmembers it needs and it continues to hire aggressively the railroad is also trying to reduce the number of new employees who quit after they complete training foote said he expects csx will hit its hiring target by the end of the third quarter but customer groups say railroad service continues to be lacking and the improvements are likely to be slow because it takes so long to train new railroad workers â we continue to see the same kind of problems â said jeff sloan with the american chemistry council trade group â i donâ t think even the railroads are predicting a turnaround in the near future â edward jones analyst jeff windau said csx appears focused on hiring and the company is making some progress but he said the improvements are likely to come slowly because of all the hiring challenges the railroads are also in the midst of difficult contract talks with their 12 major unions the talks deadlocked after more than two years and president joe biden appointed a special board of arbitrators last week to intervene in the talks and delay a possible strike at least until september while it tries to help resolve the dispute csx is one of the nationâ s largest railroads and it operates more than 20 000 miles 32 000 kilometers of track in 26 eastern states and two canadian provinces after acquiring pam am railways in the northeastern united states earlier this year _____ elements of this story were generated by automated insights using data from zacks investment research access a zacks stock report on unp at copyright 2022 the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed without permission

yesterday to a solid rally on wall street hopes are growing that the worst has now been seen and the last bottom might have been the bottom the jury s still out on that one the good news is we are seeing some positive quarterly trading updates heading into the august reporting season while a leading rally for technology yesterday was always a given after a strong session for the nasdaq the 3 8 gain included a 23 0 chart topping pop for megaport mp1 after the company silenced the critics with its update and the bold saw reason to jump back into near death bnpl with zip co zip rising 12 7 the materials sector has been weighed down recently not just by reversing commodity prices but also fears of inflationary impacts on mining costs no more evident than in reports from the biggies bhp group bhp and rio tinto rio but with several miners reporting quarterly numbers yesterday materials posted a solid 2 5 gain the exotics were back in favour again until the next day when they may not be with paladin energy pdn up 10 5 and liontown resources ltr up 10 4 while a risk on theme was indicated by a 1 8 rally for consumer discretionary against only 0 4 for staples real estate jumped 2 2 despite another incremental rise in bond yields brokers have recently been climbing over themselves to issue sector reports suggesting reit selling on rising rates has been overdone among the other defensives telcos and utilities rose 1 6 and healthcare 0 8 it didn t take much to get onto the top five losers board yesterday a case in point is kelsian group kls which came in fourth with only 0 5 but the stock has lost 9 in a week which likely reflects its london bus operation as they re all whining over there as usual as if 40 degrees was hot the banks gained 1 4 with westpac wbc announcing a pre emptive further hike in its mortgage rates on a day in which the rba governor actually sounded a little less hawkish lowe did say that the board had more work to do and suggested maybe we ve gone past the point of full employment which implies an inflation issue is brewing in wages but he also said we don t need to return inflation to target immediately and it needs to be done in a way in which the economy continues to grow and unemployment remains low on tuesday the deputy governor had suggested the much discussed neutral rate was 3 but yesterday lowe pegged it at 2 5 either way markets have locked in a 50 point hike next month unless next week s june quarter cpi result is a lot worse than already assumed note uk printed 9 4 last night stranger things while only 12 of s p500 companies have reported to date for a net 68 beat rate the theme so far has been more of not as bad as feared rather than specifically good a case in point is netflix which reported after the bell on tuesday and last night rallied 7 because it only lost one million subscribers in the quarter instead of two tesla reported after the bell this morning and while margins did come in lower than forecast chinese gigafactory lockdown it was still an earnings beat the stock was up over 3 initially until someone pointed out elon had sold 75 of his bitcoin holding in the quarter which brought in a cool us 950m so currently the stock is only slightly positive it will be money he might need if as feared he ends up with a us 5 10bn legal bill following his ridiculous twitter foray if so he will have to sell tesla shares the netflix result nevertheless heartened the tech heads such that everything ephemeral that has been beaten into submission this year saw solid gains last night it was a sunny day in the cloud the nasdaq was also boosted by the semiconductor sector which rallied on news the long awaited chips act had passed its first step through congress with bipartisan support the act provides subsidies and incentives for chip manufacturing capacity to be built in the us so to match similar policies in china and europe the us currently supplies only 2 of the chips purchased by us companies the r d and design is done state side but some 90 of us chips are manufactured in taiwan and you thought it was the taiwanese people the us was worried about were china to invade so last night was all about the nasdaq with the dow bungling along the flatline all session both the nasdaq and s p500 have now risen above their 50 day moving averages suggesting but not guaranteeing that the downtrend has now been broken in us economic news existing home sales fell by an annual rate of 5 4 in june which was the worst result since march 2020 providing further evidence the us housing market has rolled over the hope now is that rents the largest and stickiest component of cpi can also roll over all eyes are on the ecb tonight from whom the first rate hike in eleven years is expected it might be 25 points

soybeans on june 30 usda estimated soybean plantings on 88 3 million acres as mentioned above a second survey result from three states will be released on aug 12 if it turns out to be different from usda s june 30 estimate with soybean acres now less than expected dow jones survey expects usda to lower its soybean crop estimate for 2022 from 4 640 bb to 4 515 bb and its estimate of new crop u s ending stocks from 280 mb to 214 mb possibly the lowest in seven years this early in the season usda probably won t stray from its current yield estimate of 51 5 bushels per acre the one bearish risk in this otherwise bullish scenario is that soybean shipments are not keeping pace with usda s export estimate of 2 170 bb in 2021 22 and there is a risk that old crop ending stocks could end higher than the 205 mb usda estimates in june with july soybeans trading over 1 per bushel above the august contract and not showing any deliveries as of thursday july 7 it is difficult to believe old crop soybean stocks could turn out higher than expected but if you recall we could have made the same argument last year in june usda estimated south american soybean crops at 126 0 mmt or 4 63 bb in brazil and at 43 4 mmt or 1 59 bb in argentina those estimates are not apt to show much change this month for the new crop season dow jones survey expects usda to lightly reduce its estimate of world soybean stocks from 100 46 mmt to 99 2 mmt or 3 65 bb in terms of local marketing years usda estimates brazil will have 83 mb of soybeans on hand at the end of 2021 22 similar to the previous year s tight ending surplus wheat usda s june 30 grain stocks report informed us that the 2021 22 season ended with 660 mb of ending u s wheat supplies the lowest in eight years it was not surprising that russia s attack on ukraine did not result in a lot of wheat export business for the u s as europe was geographically poised to benefit however it was surprising demand for u s wheat only totaled 1 926 bb in 2021 22 the lowest in 12 years if dow jones survey is correct tuesday s new estimates from nass will show all wheat production at 1 744 bb in 2022 up 98 mb from last year winter wheat production is expected to be 89 mb lower in 2022 23 at 1 188 bb while other spring wheat production is expected to be up 108 mb at 449 mb as with corn and soybeans the planting estimate for spring wheat may be adjusted on aug 12 already near its lowest level in 50 years slightly larger wheat production in 2022 23 and another year of slow demand are expected to keep ending u s wheat stocks at 644 mb says the analysts in dow jones survey the lowest in nine years if true usda s international estimates are apt to get plenty of attention especially on the production and export estimates for both russia and ukraine there is room for usda s crop estimate for russia to be increased from the current 81 0 mmt or 2 98 bb based on private estimates russia s export estimate may also be increased based on reports of smuggling ukrainian wheat maybe that is what russia referred to as safe passage for ukrainian grain when it made the proposal in late may for world ending wheat stocks dow jones survey expects usda to slightly increase its estimate from 266 85 mmt to 267 80 mmt or 9 84 bb the lowest in six years if all goes as planned there probably won t be much price response to tuesday s new usda estimates but there is plenty of volatility these days with lots of attention on weather and outside market concerns join us at 12 30 p m cdt tuesday july 12 as dtn s webinar explains usda s new estimates and what they mean for crop prices in the year ahead we ll talk about which estimates are reasonable which are not and will also compare usda s views with the market s own clues for those

menafn asia times the outbreak of the covid 19 pandemic and the emergence of geopolitical conflicts along with international economic competition have all put stress on the global financial sector and hong kong s financial system is facing complex external risks among these are the weaponization of swift in the context of the russia ukraine conflict the threat of de listing of chinese stocks from american exchanges and the global impact of rising interest rates hong kong s financial risks are part of china s overall financial risk the financial security of hong kong is closely related to the overall financial security national security and sovereignty of china we recommend several measures to buttress hong kong s financial security against possible economic and political shocks a key measure is the spinoff of hong kong and shanghai bank s asian business into a new entity regulated by hong kong rather than uk authorities risk factors hong kong is both a special administrative region integrated into the overall development of the country and an international city connected to the world china s most effective gateway to the country and the world hong kong s financial security is the foundation of its prosperity and stability connecting chinese and foreign capital through finance and trade some risk factors require special attention first economic security is a precondition for financial security the financial security of hong kong depends on the overall stability of hong kong s economic system and the orderly operation of various industries hong kong is a small and fully open economy the financial services industry is the backbone of hong kong s economy accounting for more than 23 of the local gdp according to the hong kong monetary authority hkma the banking sector has total assets of hk 26 trillion and the asset management sector has total assets of hk 29 trillion which are 9 5 times and 10 times hong kong s gdp respectively hong kong as an international financial center has a massive financial system with a high degree of international capital participation hong kong is an important node for the integration of chinese and foreign capital connecting domestic and overseas markets this also means that the economic security of hong kong is particularly vulnerable to the external political and economic environment for example hsbc a british bank controls half of the retail banking market in hong kong and is the largest currency issuer in hong kong with about 60 of the total hong kong currency in circulation hsbc manages the hong kong sar government s revenue and expenditure from the treasury and the exchange fund the salaries of hong kong s public servants teachers and health care workers are also paid from hsbc accounts hsbc s special role gives it systemic importance for hong kong s economic and financial security at the moment hong kong is facing a complex changing and challenging external environment protectionism and unilateralism are on the rise and western countries are trying to contain china s development ultra easy monetary policies have increased volatility in economies and financial markets the risk is that the global debt cycle will lead to higher unemployment and lower consumer spending and investment with financial consequences that would endanger hong kong s financial security currency security and free capital flows are key to hong kong s financial security hong kong is the world s largest renminbi offshore center and its foreign exchange reserves exceed us 440 billion more than twice its monetary base that provides solid backing for hong kong s currency peg to the us dollar the hong kong dollar exchange rate has been strong since the beginning of 2020 and the inflow of funds into the hong kong dollar since then reached us 50 billion a safe open and liquid monetary system can provide a stable and reliable business environment and investment conditions for people at home and abroad however as central banks raise interest rates in response to rising inflation the us dollar shock will inevitably also affect the monetary security of hong kong in the short term the fed s raising of interest rates will weaken the hong kong dollar against the us unit interest rates in the hong kong market will rise because the pegged exchange rate requires hong kong to follow us monetary policy capital outflows will lead to rising pressure on the hong kong financial and real estate markets in the medium to long term the vulnerability of the financial market is exacerbated by uncertainties such as the russia ukraine conflict and the sino us dispute in an extreme case of a deteriorating geopolitical situation and a blockage of the international market hong kong s monetary security will face the challenge of frozen foreign exchange reserves and the possible demise of the pegged exchange rate system in a serious currency crisis characterized by massive flight of international capital and panic selling of hong kong dollar assets by international investors hong kong s financial security would be compromised in such a conflict hsbc as a central bank like issuer of currency would become the main source of systemic risk as its governance and its regulatory supervision come from outside hong kong maintaining an open and globalized payment clearing system is vital for financial security at present hong kong operates a globalized payment and settlement network with hsbc at its core that is also the node for china s enormous capital market and for large amounts of capital to enter the us dollar payment and clearing system hong kong s role is to connect domestic and foreign capital markets but in the event of heightened geopolitical tensions with the possible application of secondary sanctions in the dollar centered monetary system hong kong s payment and settlement system could be at risk just look at russia which in the present russia ukraine conflict is unable to continue to use the system for foreign exchange settlement with other countries the volume of trade with countries around the world has dropped significantly which in turn has severely slowed down russia s economic growth in the future the us may rely on the dominant position of the us dollar in the international financial system to continue to assert jurisdiction at a distance to restrict other countries access to the global payment and settlement system by freezing foreign exchange restricting international investment and financing and cutting off access to the us dollar markets in various ways in this situation a global financial institution like hsbc presumably would have more network resources to mitigate the risk however with its business focus in the asia pacific region including china it would be difficult for hsbc to effectively circumvent sanctions in addition hsbc is currently the only us dollar clearing bank in hong kong in the event of a major geopolitical event followed by the passive or active closure of clearing operations hong kong s key role in linking domestic and foreign capital would be lost overnight how to reduce risk hong kong should optimize the regulatory regime for the large number of foreign related financial institutions as an institutional safeguard for maintaining financial security hong kong has a feature rich financial ecosystem more than 70 of the world s top 100 banks are present in hong kong as well as more than 70 of the world s top 100 asset management firms hsbc is a potentially significant risk to hong kong s financial regulation because its management and regulatory base in the uk make it subject to the long arm of the us the regulatory influence that the hong kong government can exert over hsbc is relatively limited at present during the 2020 pandemic when the uk financial services authority forced hsbc to cancel its dividends for the year to maintain liquidity in the uk hsbc had to comply without any regard to the position or attitude of the hong kong government or the interests of small and medium investors this dividend cancellation caused an uproar at the time with thousands of small investors demonstrating in front of hsbc s hong kong headquarters in early 2022 hsbc again canceled its quarterly dividends this separation of control and regulation from business operations is unparalleled in the world the ideal solution would be for hsbc to spin off its asian business and list it in hong kong as an independent legal entity to avoid the conflicts mentioned above it could better adapt to the regulatory and legal environment in hong kong and embrace new development opportunities more actively going forward hong kong and the mainland could better coordinate financial supervision and regulation they should introduce a round the clock cross market monitoring system and develop contingency plans to counteract the impact of international market turbulence we believe that the new sar government is fully aware of the seriousness and urgency of the financial security issues we mentioned and will make appropriate plans for hong kong s long term stability with the right safeguards hong kong can leverage its advantage of free convertibility of offshore rmb and its role as the world s largest offshore rmb product center and capital pool and open a new chapter in its development

leaders on wall street are beginning to complain on their corporate earnings calls about the strong u s dollar being a drag on profits especially regarding foreign markets the u s dollar has made gains against many of the major global currencies over the last few months and is hitting its highest level since 2020 as the federal reserve announced further interest rate hikes the dollar is now up 11 percent versus the euro with the exchange rate between the two currencies hitting parity for the first time in two decades it is also up 13 percent against the british pound 20 percent against the japanese yen and 6 percent against the chinese renminbi the hike in the fed s policy rates are partially responsible for the rising value of the dollar while currency traders are seeking safety in u s currency and assets at a time of geopolitical instability the strong dollar has benefitted many people using the currency like american tourists shopping in europe and those importing foreign goods however this does tend to weigh on u s corporate earnings especially at firms that have a strong business presence overseas as an 8 10 percent increase in the value of the dollar could lead to a 1 percent drop in profit margins according to credit suisse group ag a strong dollar also makes american manufactured goods more expensive overseas forcing foreign buyers to pay more in local currency to purchase those same items and lessening the value of foreign revenue for american companies when it is converted into u s currency the revenue earnings of foreign companies in america on the other hand grow stronger once the higher value greenbacks are converted to a local currency on july 20 johnson johnson slashed its full year profit estimates after reporting that a stronger dollar might cut

earnings call there is an incremental unfavorable currency impact of 1 5 billion on reported sales and an unfavorable 0 20 impact for the estimated reported adjusted earnings per share versus the projection utilized in april s guidance 3 year high analysts at bloomberg have noticed that references to foreign exchange in earnings calls have hit a three year high in the second and third quarters

year due to the currency shift for the first time in 20 years the euro and the u s dollar are now at parity and the euro is our largest international currency hasbro said in its corporate earnings note if we look at the back half of our year we expect this to have an additional negative impact to cp revenue of 30 million to 40 million versus our expectations as we enter the year given hedges we have in place we expect less of an impact to operating profit the rising price of u s made goods has lead to a decline in demand and making american manufacturers less competitive as foreign importers look to alternative sources of goods the strong dollar is an issue for companies because it makes u s products less attractive to foreign buyers said jonathan golub chief u s equity strategist at credit suisse securities to bloomberg and when you translate those earnings back to dollars you get lower numbers caught off guard several american companies are now considering cuts in order to stay competitive and preserve their corporate margins most u s firms protect their earnings from volatility in global monetary markets by purchasing items like currency swap forward contracts to exchange currency at a fixed rate but the rapid rise in the dollar has put many of them off guard companies more dependent on overseas sales have taken a massive hit to their bottom lines the largest u s tech firms are the most vulnerable to a change in conversion rate as they do much of their business overseas generating 60 percent of their revenue and a third of their sales in foreign markets while the rising dollar has caused pain to the stock price of many american firms market watchers are beginning to warn about its impact on corporate debt as well other american firms according to credit suisse actually stand to benefit from dollar appreciation like those with domestic sales and foreign currency costs who are now outperforming their suffering rivals in the meantime many foreign companies doing business in the united states are benefitting from the strong dollar as their products are now cheaper to import into the country
according to a report by data platform magnitt the total funding secured by startups in the middle east and north africa mena amounted to approximately us 864 million in the first quarter of 2022 startups in the uae accounted for 27 3 of all deals closed across mena and 34 4 of all funding raised across the region in 2022 to date the us 256 million raised by ksa based startups in the first quarter of 2022 marks the highest the kingdom has ever raised in a single quarter to date with startup funding in mena being at an all time high an increasing number of founders will need to consider which jurisdiction to use when incorporating an investor friendly holding company this article looks to provide insight into some of the key features of the cayman islands and the british virgin islands bvi as the offshore jurisdictions most commonly used by mena based startups investor familiarity familiarity with the domicile and legal form of the investment vehicle is a critical element in ensuring a startup s marketability with potential investors estimated to house more than two thirds of non us domiciled investment funds the cayman islands is the largest and most popular offshore domicile for the establishment of investment vehicles by some margin the structuring of the investment vehicle tends to be investor driven and in many cases institutional investors will insist on a cayman islands or bvi vehicle being used given their familiarity with the same apart from investor familiarity both jurisdictions are also recognised as centres of excellence for cross border financing structures m a and capital market transactions and provide a neutral platform to pool and access capital which is recognised by regulators and banks trusted legal system as british overseas territories the cayman islands and the bvi have english based legal systems established and independent judiciaries and a final court of appeal in the form of the uk privy council in london which offers investors both the comfort of a legal system with which they are generally familiar and the legal security of an established body of law understood and accepted by both creditors and investors it is this strong legal and judicial system and the related ease of operation flexible corporate regimes and tax neutrality that makes these two offshore jurisdictions such a compelling offering for international investors flexibility and certainty of structures one of the main reasons why the cayman islands and the bvi are ideal jurisdictions for startup companies is the flexibility to determine the commercial features of the organisational structure the company s memorandum and articles of association can be easily amended to set out the commercially agreed governance provisions multiple classes of shares can be created with different voting dividend and distribution rights and companies have the option to create additional classes of shares for later funding rounds there is no minimum capital requirement that needs to be invested at the time of incorporation the company can be incorporated with a single shareholder and director which can be the same individual or corporate entity in addition there is no requirement for a director or shareholder of a holding company to reside in the cayman islands or bvi the company can carry out its business and can be operated from anywhere in the world with minimal financial reporting requirements the ultimate goal of most startups is to be successful and provide its investors with a return on their investment having a vehicle which is suitable for ipo or acquisition by a larger company will be an important consideration from a corporate structuring perspective cayman islands and bvi companies are listed on all of the major international stock exchanges including the new york hong kong and london stock exchanges the flexibility and certainty of structures associated with cayman islands and bvi companies provide early stage startups with a platform to negotiate terms with investors and efficiently raise capital tax neutrality international investors will often be from a different jurisdiction than the operating target business and will usually want neutrality in electing the jurisdiction for their investment including equal legal and tax treatments there is no income tax or corporation tax attaching to companies established in the cayman islands or bvi for investors this means resources can be pooled to invest without returns on that investment being subject to an additional layer of taxation beyond that imposed by the investor s home jurisdiction and the jurisdictions where trading profits are made these favourable tax regimes provide a tax efficient platform for startups to retain or reinvest profits in the business confidentiality neither the register of directors nor the register of shareholders is required to be publicly filed in the cayman islands or bvi ensuring a high degree of confidentiality for founders and investors founders will need to provide standard know your customer documentation for directors and certain investors of the holding company the company s corporate services provider is required to collect beneficial ownership information on investors and such information may be made available where requested by certain domestic and international governmental authorities speed and ease of incorporation the cayman islands and the bvi are competitively priced and a company can be incorporated very quickly often within 24 hours of receipt of instructions the simplicity of establishing companies in either of these jurisdictions continue to play a role in influencing the decision of founders in using these jurisdictions conclusion the cayman islands and the bvi s competitive strength in the startup space lies in their respective ability to provide effective cost efficient and tax neutral platforms for international capital flows in an environment of legal political and economic stability both jurisdictions are renowned for their investor friendly regulations while maintaining proportionate regulation and supervision which are all key reasons why mena based startups continue to incorporate in the cayman islands and the bvi

david whitehouse explores the global implications of new voluntary guidelines developed by insurer ping an and other chinese companies fund managers have given a guarded welcome to china s first voluntary framework for corporate esg disclosure which came into effect at the start of june chinese insurer ping an and other domestic companies helped develop the guidelines published by the china enterprise reform and development society ping an says that common international esg rating standards are difficult to match with operating conditions in china and that the move guidance is based on relevant chinese laws regulations and standards most chinese companies do not have established processes for gathering esg information and lack people trained in doing so but esg disclosure has slowly become widespread according to jp morgan 86 of the companies traded on the csi 300 a china stock index produced esg reports in 2020 versus 49 in 2010 and a group of third party esg rating providers have emerged including wind and syntao green finance in the first three quarters of 2021 the number of esg public funds jumped with 48 new products launched close to the total of the previous five years ping an says its rating system can provide esg scores for 3 900 a share companies every quarter which it uses in its investment process the exercise is public relations more than anything else says jerry wu a fund manager at polar capital in london he sees it as a positive step once the spin is stripped out ping an is more internationally minded than most insurers in china and about 20 of companies listed in mainland china mostly the larger ones have some form of voluntary barebones disclosure requirements he says these cover areas such as emissions and waste water management more mandatory disclosure requirements for listed securities wu suspects will not be far away according to a report by invesco in january local esg data firms struggle with a lack of comparable historical data for chinese companies the key point wu argues is to achieve global standardisation and avoid international silos finance is a global industry and standardisation is needed to allow capital to flow freely china is working with europe on such an approach standardised international data would then allow esg assessments to take local factors into account which will make the job easier for fund managers wu adds wu points to sf holdings logistics services one of china s logistics service providers as an example of what can be achieved the company provides delivery warehousing and cold chain transportation wu recalls that it historically scored poorly in terms of external esg rankings but when polar capital did its own research it found that the company had performed well in reducing its carbon emissions according to sustainalytics the company has an esg risk rating of 19 1 on a scale of 0 to 100 which puts it in the low risk category part of the difficulty wu suggests is cultural in that disclosure in china is not a routine task polar capital encouraged the company to disclose and engage more with msci which led to its ratings being improved if more chinese companies are willing to do that perceptions of the country s esg profile will be much better wu says retail investor protection solutions of course do not lie in china alone there are more than 200 chinese companies listed on major us stock exchanges the us does not require listed companies to publish esg reports this creates a potential lack of transparency especially as institutional investors hold more than 70 of us listed chinese equity hong kong s stock exchange has required listed companies to publish esg reports since 2016 lee gao a buy side analyst at harding loevner in new york sees the new mainland china initiative as a transitional step before disclosures become mandatory in the next couple of years harding loevner holds shares in ping an gao argues that a lot of progress has been made over the past decade in chinese corporate disclosure requirements most shareholders in china are still retail investors so the regulator actively tries to defend them he says for example in the requirement that meetings between managements and groups of institutional investors must be disclosed in esg terms the chinese framework is now broadly similar to that in japan where disclosures are also voluntary he says that leaves both countries lagging behind singapore where corporate esg disclosures are mandatory gao is confident that international standardisation can be achieved by and large chinese people care about the same things as those in the rest of the world african oil pipeline nikesh patel head of client solutions at van lanschot kempen in london sees the move as a step forward it will be easier to assess refine and improve the disclosure framework once it actually exists rather than endlessly debating how to make it perfect at the outset he says esg standards in the west have in the past and perhaps even now been merely window dressing or routes to greenwashing patel says it is hard to imagine the chinese framework becoming accepted if there was a lack of implicit government support or encouragement patel argues that the current voluntary nature of the requirements is not a cause for concern voluntary standards are an excellent way to demonstrate that such standards are not insurmountable or costly burdens which can then help to dismiss the most common objection to any standards at all china has set targets of reaching peak carbon by 2030 and becoming carbon neutral by 2060 but companies have a long way to go before convincing some investors that the stated aims are realistic china said in 2021 that it would no longer fund new coal projects overseas but that excludes any commitments on oil and gas projects together with totalenergies the china national offshore oil corporation cnooc is one of the main investors in the east african crude oil pipeline which is planned to connect lake albert in uganda with tanga port in tanzania many international banks and insurers including hsbc barclays bnp paribas credit suisse and munich re have said they won t take part ping an investor harding loevner is still willing to consider new investments in fossil fuels juliana hansveden an emerging markets fund manager at ninety one in london says the firm does not invest in fossil fuel companies as the externalities are too great there is no investment case to discuss esg reporting in china is still at a low level which means there is greater potential for progress than elsewhere and there may be a case for investing into that improvement she says a sustainability approach that turns capital away from china will not succeed and investor engagement hansveden argues is the only viable option there is no way to net zero without china lazy temptation according to a 2021 white paper from the world economic forum wef and pwc china companies in china need to progress from a focus on short term revenue to a broader esg strategy that addresses the concerns of different stakeholders companies trying to improve esg reporting face a shortage of qualified professionals and a lack of internal expertise the wef says that means short term costs such as hiring scarce esg skills and setting up internal reporting systems the wef argues that the costs are worth it with long term benefits in improved risk management new esg related opportunities enhanced brand values lower costs of capital esg index inclusion and stronger ability to attract talent the report says that chinese public pension and sovereign wealth funds which rank among the world s largest have the potential to create major stimulus for domestic esg assets the growth of china s middle class will mean more retail interest in esg investing in the long term it adds the virtuous circle sounds attractive but the case remains to be proved the ping an move wu says is system positive but there is a lot of greenwashing in the process there is a danger in china as elsewhere of easy screening gimmicks wu says he sees a risk that more data will make the funds industry lazy and tempted to put an esg label on a fund supported by the new disclosures i worry that it will also happen in china hansveden at ninety one agrees that relying on company disclosures or third party esg ratings is inadequate investors will need their own framework and process for generating esg assessments she says there s no substitute for one on one conversations between fund managers and their companies she adds there needs to be a proprietary framework an active manager should not sit and wait until disclosure is good enough 2022 funds europe
