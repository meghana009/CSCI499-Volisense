ukraines ammunition stockpiles crucial artillery rampages stockpiles of ammunition are becoming increasingly important in the war in ukraine as artillery units burn through tens of thousands of shells a day testing both sides ability to replenish dwindling reserves experts say the russian and ukrainian armies have entered a war of attrition where access to ammunition from rifle bullets to howitzer shells to ballistic missiles is as important as manpower and weapon systems and where avoidance is imperative that this runs out of ammo before the enemy does the issue of supplies and supplies is the big issue right now said a senior european officer who wished to remain anonymous the extremely high consumption of ammunition of all calibers is the hallmark of a high intensity conflict the official told the afp news agency according to rusi a british defense studies organization russia currently fires around 20 000 152mm shells used in soviet era howitzers and ukraine 6 000 per day domestically while russia can count on several ammunition production plants on its territory and the supply lines are stable ukraine only has its existing stocks and supplies from western factories with the conflict centered on eastern ukraine russia s supply routes are shorter than those of ukrainians whose stocks are in the west of the country or even outside of the country the europe officer said a complication another advantage for the invading army is that russian ammunition is produced for russian made weapons while ukraine has to juggle a hodgepodge of weapons ranging from old soviet equipment to the most modern western equipment all requiring different types of ammunition the delivery of modern heavy weapons is more of a complication than a help for ukraine said alexander khramchikhin deputy director of the moscow based institute for political and military analysis rusi suggested that ukraine s partners should streamline the support they provide to a small number of platforms ukraine s goal of reclaiming lost territory cannot be achieved by piecemeal delivery of a large number of different equipment fleets each with its own training maintenance and logistics needs it said a big unknown is each side s ability to produce ammunition at the required rate and quantity about which afp could not obtain precise data moscow appears to be using its guided munitions ballistic missiles and supersonic missiles with great caution according to some analysts although it has not run out of these types of weapons as some predicted a few weeks ago the capacity of the russian defense industry to produce artillery shells needed to replenish stockpiles is significant rusi said on the side of ukraine s allies the united states could help kiev s army increase its daily artillery firing capacity to 10 000 shells a day but only if it ramps up production back home in america and even then only for a few months it said philippe gros a former french military intelligence officer and now with the frs strategy research institute stocks are running low unlike russia where president vladimir putin has fully mobilized arms factories western countries are not officially warring parties in ukraine and cannot put their economies on a war footing necessary for mass production of weapons in the west stocks are running out and factories are not producing large volumes said vassily kashin of moscow s hse university it would be a mistake to think that nato has unlimited reserves to help ukraine even considering the united states he said russia s war industry is bigger than europe s while ukraine s eastern european allies are rapidly running out of the leftover soviet era weapons they sent to ukraine western economies are groaning under the effects of the war the french defense ministry said this week that the delivery of 18 caesar type 155mm guns amputated its entire inventory of caesars by a quarter according to the manufacturer nexter the production time for each of the cannons is 18 months nato deputy secretary general mircea geoana acknowledged this week that there are active concerns about how long the flow of arms and ammunition can be sustained but there are efforts to increase the capacity and creativity of manufacturers he told afp in an interview at the same time according to khramchikhin russian factories have been in operation day and night since the fighting began meanwhile attacking and destroying enemy holdings can be a worthwhile use of firepower in the absence of major production and both moscow and kyiv regularly claim such hits janes a british defense intelligence agency said ukraine was capable of destroying such high value targets

the sec is heeding a government watchdog s calls to beef up its oversight of finra but it s doing so behind closed doors the wall street regulator which is finra s only supervisory agency generally agreed with recommendations from the government accountability office last december to improve its formal scrutiny of finra which oversees brokers according to a report from the gao last month the sec is tightening its finra reviews focus on performance measures deficiencies and corrective actions the sec according to the report is also pledging to improve communication between the agencies about the examinations the gao conducts triennial reviews of the sec s oversight of finra as required by dodd frank the 2010 law that sought to restore stability to wall street following the financial crisis and mortgage meltdown finra drew criticism that it was too close to the securities industry and didn t do enough to root out schemers like bernie madoff it has also come under scrutiny for its arbitration forum while finra is supervised by the sec it s generally a self regulator it generated 1 3 billion in operating revenue in 2021 the sec allowed the gao s prior reports on its oversight of finra under dodd frank in 2012 2015 and 2018 to be fully public but with its current report the sec determined that some of this information was confidential supervisory information the sec ordered the gao to omit certain details from the public version of the report that it issued in december five months after the restricted edition that s shielded from public review last january financial planning submitted a request to the sec and the gao for the restricted version under the freedom of information act the gao declined the request a couple of weeks later in its denial the gao said the report was designated as containing controlled unclassified information by the gao defined that information as related to facts obtained from various agencies or private firms in such a way that increases the visibility of particularly sensitive information or reveals internal control weaknesses or methodology in a july 6 letter to fp the sec also classified the report as restricted and containing confidential supervisory information wall street s regulator added that making the study public could reasonably be expected to disclose techniques guidelines and criteria used in connection with the staff s review of records and thereby undermine the enforcement of the federal securities laws representatives for the sec didn t respond to requests for comment asked about the gao s recommendations finra spokesman ray pellecchia said in an email that finra has taken a number of significant steps to strengthen investor protection and adapt to changing markets and industry practices since the events of the meme stock selloff in early 2021 pellecchia added that finra has been implementing a new rule that improves our ability to monitor the liquidity risk of members with the largest customer and counterparty exposures the body has also sought comments on member firm practices involving complex products options and short sales the sec placed modernizing the u s financial regulatory system on its high risk list in 2009 and five other key focus areas for the watchdog also have direct implications to sec operations according to the incremental update on the gao s recommendations what s publicly known is that the sec conducted 69 examinations of finra between fiscal years 2018 and 2020 the public version of the gao report in december faulted the sec for a dearth of outcome oriented data and useful information for decision making among other areas discussed in the review to some regulatory experts the secrecy about the report s details doesn t seem right as is always the case when you empower a government agency to classify information or to designate information confidential that can be used more broadly than necessary to obfuscate and prevent the public from accessing information that the public or the industry should have a right to review and understand and make judgments about said michael canning the former director of policy and government affairs for the north american securities administrators association and founder of consulting firm the lxr group the watchdog s june 17 update cited the latest status on the priority adjustments to the sec s exams of finra first performance metrics with enhanced tracking of the outcomes of the exams would provide greater assurance that finra is carrying out its regulatory responsibilities and that sec is meeting its mission including protecting investors and maintaining efficient markets it said second bulked up procedures to monitor deficiencies and corrective actions would provide sec with reasonable assurance that it is gaining key information about the state of risk in its oversight of finra and the extent to which identified risks have been appropriately mitigated it said third it said specific identification of the most important findings of the exams and coordination among the two regulators about them would help the sec gain reasonable assurance that it has correctly and consistently identified and communicated its most important findings internally and to finra the report didn t provide an expected timeline for the sec to carry out the recommendations the watchdog follows up with government agencies which include the sec at minimum on a yearly basis sometimes more frequently to check on the progress said michael clements the gao s director of financial markets and community investment he added that the sec had some actions underway they need to simply finish those actions to satisfy the recommendations
on wednesday the five year breakeven inflation rate fell to 2 48 percent if that doesn t mean anything to you which is completely forgivable if you aren t a professional economy watcher try this the wholesale price of gasoline has fallen about 80 cents a gallon since its peak a month ago only a little of this plunge has been passed on to consumers so far but over the weeks ahead we re likely to see a broad decline in prices at the pump incidentally what are the odds that falling gas prices will get even a small fraction of the media coverage devoted to rising prices what these numbers and a growing accumulation of other data from rents to shipping costs suggest is that the risk of stagflation is receding that s good news but i m worried that policymakers especially at the federal reserve may be slow to adapt to the new information they were clearly too complacent in the face of rising inflation as was i but now they may be clinging too long to a hard money stance and creating a gratuitous recession let s talk about what the fed is afraid of obviously we ve had serious inflation problems over the past year and a half much probably most of this inflation reflected presumably temporary disruptions of supply ranging from supply chain problems to russia s invasion of ukraine but part of the inflation surge also surely reflected an overheated domestic economy even those of us who are usually monetary doves agreed that the fed needed to hike interest rates to cool the economy down which it has the fed s rate hikes plus the anticipation of more hikes to come have caused the interest rates that matter for the real economy notably mortgage rates to soar which will reduce overall spending

democratic u s senate hopeful lucas kunce has a relatively straightforward contention on why he d be the best candidate in november the jefferson city native wants someone who s experienced economic hardship to provide a voice to missouri most missourians grow up paycheck to paycheck or one disaster from bankruptcy kunce said during an episode of the politically speaking podcast i remember being at the grocery store with my mom and watching her write a check and just begging the cashier not to cash it till the end of the month so that we could make it since entering the senate contest in 2021 kunce has stressed his humble origins he s also showcased his military service as a marine and an economic message that can be described as populist even though the state has taken a decidedly republican turn over the past few election cycles kunce has often outraised gop contenders for the senate during some fundraising quarters in addition to a slew of lightly funded candidates kunce is squaring off against two major competitors on aug 2 trudy busch valentine and spencer toder kunce who has an undergraduate degree from yale and a law degree from the university of missouri columbia said he brings a different perspective to the table than the other democratic contenders when we went bankrupt we didn t make it because the institutions were there for us kunce said we didn t make it because the rich folks on the other side of town were there for us we made it because the people in that neighborhood without any more money than we had passed the plate down at church they brought more tuna casserole and lasagna by the house than we could ever ever eat and those are the people that have power in this country people who know how to take care of each other instead of folks who are in power and use that power for their funders to strip communities like the one i grew up in for parts punishing congress members for stock trading one of the proposals kunce is pushing is sending members of congress and their immediate family members to prison if they re found to have made stock trades that s part of a policy push among republicans and democrats who ve expressed outrage over high profile instances of members of congress trading stocks raising insider trading suspicions in some cases especially during the covid 19 pandemic if you re going to be a member of congress there should be some amount of sacrifice there kunce said if you can t get by on the salary then that s too bad scrapping filibuster to protect abortion rights like other democratic senate hopefuls kunce is supportive of getting rid of the filibuster in order to pass federal legislation making abortion legal in every state i have seen what it s like to live in a big brother government kunce said i went to iraq i went to afghanistan women had no rights there and it s an absolute tragedy you know they told us that we were fighting for freedom overseas when they deployed us and then i come home and it s like oh my god the fight for freedom is right here when he unsuccessfully ran for a jefferson city based state house seat in 2006 kunce was against abortion rights he said his time overseas helped change his view on the issue and you know as i got older i saw people go through very very difficult pregnancies that they should never have to go through again kunce said and and for me this has just become one of those fundamental rights that every person should have access to some opponents of abolishing the senate filibuster to expand abortion rights such as arizona sen kyrsten sinema have contended that the move will empower republicans to pass a nationwide abortion ban if they ever capture the majority kunce doesn t find that argument compelling if anybody s worried about what mitch mcconnell would do that guy s got to be laughing every single day that we don t get rid of the filibuster because he would do the exact same thing kunce said wants stronger action on guns while he said he would have voted for a legislative package that increased funding for red flag laws and mental health programs kunce said congress needs to go further when it comes to restricting firearms he doesn t buy the argument that gun control is unpopular in outstate missouri which has typically voted for candidates who oppose curbs on firearms when i go around missouri gun owners non gun owners republicans democrats independents they all want the same thing and that s to keep these weapons out of the hands of criminals teenagers and terrorists kunce said and you know real expanded background checks which this doesn t have and real red flag protections which this doesn t have pointing to his experience in the military kunce said he supports raising the age limit to purchase a gun from 18 to 21 there is a world in which if you got the right amount of training and the right amount of observation then i could go lower with that kunce said it s not like i m not gonna be draconian about this but we need things that keep the weapons out of people who are going to be unsafe follow jason rosenbaum on twitter jrosenbaum follow sarah kellogg on twitter sarahkkelogg

businesses since july is national ice cream month we checked with the international dairy foods association and learned that the average american eats roughly 20 pounds 4 gallons of ice cream each year and that ice cream companies most family owned churned out more than 1 3 billion gallons of ice cream last year contributing more than 13 billion to the u s economy so next time you reach for a scoop know that you re doing your part maybe we can all make an extra effort on national ice cream day on july 17 pop culture artisan pops the fun and fresh flavor combinations catch my eye when i first see pop culture artisan pops at the kualoa ranch store korean pear lemongrass strawberry guava creamsicle tropic butterfly with mango liliko i vanilla honey and butterfly pea flower and if i m feeling nostalgic for small kid time the cookie monster mixes in oreos then at the sunday kailua farmers market i try the whatamelon it s probably the prettiest pop with its faux watermelon rind made from matcha and cream but it s also perfect for these hot days managing to taste like fresh watermelon all this from a local boy who started his career in accounting justin udom quit after five years and moved back home from california to study culinary arts at kapi olani community college he worked at local restaurants before launching his own business in 2020 pop culture builds on good memories of making ice cream at home in kuli ou ou valley i thought ice pops and ice cream bars haven t been reinvented in quite some time udom explains so after a lot of trial and error here we are the lineup reflects a strong emphasis on local ingredients usually eight flavors are in rotation three seasonal think kinako miso caramel kabocha cranberry and london fog and five forever flavors 65 total to date his latest is coffee cacao nib swirl which udom says is made with a 100 kaua i coffee cream base swirled with a rich coconut milk fudgesicle base using organic fair trade cacao powder and finished with local cacao nibs nondairy options include hibiscus passion punch and vegan blackberry yuzu lemonade with local meyer lemon blackberry and yuzu possibly the most refreshing flavor we ve tried and a surprise for skeptics who fear that healthier might mean less tasty now you can find pop culture artisan pops at farmers markets and storefronts across o ahu including feast in mānoa hawaiian chip co in kalihi and kalapawai in kailua at 4 25 a pop these treats will easily be on repeat for summer and beyond 4 25 popcultureap com popcultureap sage creamery we discovered sage creamery at the kailua thursday night farmers market impressed with the fresh fruit folded into small batches of ice cream produced by this native hawaiian owned small business then a friend made a

swooning over two new flavors mango cheesecake with chunks of luscious mango and graham crackers and orange dreamsicle a creamy orange calamansi sherbet and salted blue vanilla ice cream that tastes as good as it looks our other happy discovery is that sage creamery can be found at stores near us as well as farmers markets its mobile truck or a new scoop shop planned for ho opili near ewa beach

to hit the factory for mid afternoon dessert runs coordinated by a savvy co worker back in the 90s turns out he d discovered that the company did low key retail sales when he dated someone in the restaurant business even then the small factory started in 1981 had the air of a speakeasy pre pandemic we could walk in and select cups and pints of gelato from a freezer near the door some of our favorites included the black sesame chocolate and coffee gelato flavors and whatever fruit was in season for the sorbetto selections recent visits revealed these new discoveries an ume guava sorbetto local mango gelato made from your choice of common or fairchild mangoes and mango and mochi gelato our fave black sesame gelato is still there as is classic spumoni and no sugar added vanilla when in person visits disappeared during the pandemic along with most of its restaurant sales la gelateria kickstarted its online ordering happily the prices are still reasonable for restaurant quality treats and the place still has the slightly illicit vibe we pull up under the mango tree out front knock and a masked worker emerges to get our name then we wait under an umbrella until she returns with our pints the online ordering system lets us narrow our search to what s in stock a vast improvement over an earlier iteration that allowed us to view every flavor only to learn that many weren t

friends of socialist cuba like good news about that country now bad news has its use grief and hardship currently are such that clearly the us economic blockade of cuba must end at once the harsh details appearing below testify to potential destabilization in cuba danger to cuba s socialist project and the nefarious role of the blockade a major mobilization against the blockade is due the need for action is obvious the blockade a 60 year old relic of history places few heavy demands on the us public no governmental funding is required the treasury department issues fines and presidents make ritualistic declarations people dodge travel restrictions it s a slow motion affair distracted pro cuba activists may lose track of harassment details here they get a refresher course for motivation toward action it emphasizes blockade effects on people s lives cuba s vulnerability is the result mainly of us policies directed at denying money and supplies to cuba to bring about hunger desperation and overthrow of government the words are those of a state department memorandum of april 6 1960 the flow of money to cuba international loans and export income has long been feeble international banks financial institutions and corporations handling dollars on cuba s behalf risk big us treasury department fines us legislation blocks cuba from importing the products of multi national companies with branches in the united states even food and medical supplies for almost 30 years third country ships docking in cuba have been prohibited from entering a us port for the following six months since 2019 the us government has sanctioned venezuelan ships carrying oil to cuba the us government harasses cuba s tourism industry the source of most of cuba s foreign currency restrictions variably regulated operate against us citizens travel to the island why they would spend money there to discourage potential investors us legislation enables the heirs of properties nationalized in cuba to take legal action in us courts against investors who make use of such properties cuba s commerce with the united states has been nil for 60 years except for heavily regulated cuban agricultural exports the northern neighbor used to be and still could be cuba s most convenient trading partner the us blockade constitutes the main impediment to cuba s industrial production and overall economic development soviet bloc nations formerly provided relief since then strictures placed on imports have caused shortages of raw materials replacement parts consumer goods new tools and machines and reagents for drug and vaccine manufacture the blockade recently has complicated lives already beleaguered by the covid 19 pandemic and an 11 percent economic recession resulting from the pandemic an associated press report of june 22 highlights a lack of new housing and impediments to repairing houses in 2019 44 000 homes were built in 2000 32 000 homes and in 2021 18 000 building materials are in short supply hurricanes and the pandemic aggravated the situation elderly cubans experienced isolation and lack of supplies during the pandemic for two years they ve experienced weakened cultural and support services and reduced housing options fuel shortages in late 2021 led to fewer bus runs in havana wait times were even longer pharmacies in 2020 had available only 35 percent of their normal stock in recent times infant death rates in cuba matched the favorable rates of well resourced countries and were lower than u s rates astoundingly cuba s infant mortality rate in 2021 was 7 6 infant deaths per 1000 births up from 4 9 in 2000 and 5 0 in 2019 cuba s 2021 rate of mothers dying from pregnancy and childbirth difficulties was 176 6 out of 100 000 mothers giving birth up from 40 0 mothers in 2000 and 37 4 in 2019 the increases stem from covid 19 infection mortality added to deaths in non covid times experts say the deaths of children and mothers can reflect social factors mothers low educational levels reduced access to healthcare and other services and poor nutrition therefore the u s blockade which does affect social well being may have taken a toll in this area too cuba s food supply is unstable what with reduced food production inefficient distribution marketing based on income levels and quality variations at an annual cost of 2 billion cuba s government still must import 60 70 percent of the food consumed in cuba production levels remain low despite reforms introduced after 2008 among them land distribution allowances for farmers permanent use of land marketing reforms governmental assistance to individual farmers and agricultural cooperatives new distribution systems local decision making on assistance and policies and ecologically sustainable methods the us economic blockade is not responsible for soil deficiencies officials inaction drought conditions overgrowth of invasive plants and the appeal of urban life for rural youth blockade effects do show up in farmers reduced access to credit and lack of funds for fertilizer seeds breeding stock spare parts new equipment and fuel inflation holds sway in cuba now prices rising for two years are up now by 70 percent and more access to essential goods is impaired frustration at high prices and shortages helped trigger island wide protests on july 11 2021 and has contributed to record emigration the us blockade set the stage for inflation after losing its commercial partnership with the soviet bloc which disappeared in 1991 cuba was in trouble the blockade blocked access to international loans and interfered with income derived from exports the latter effect stemming from export restrictions consequently funds have been short for importing essential products and for developing the economy cuba desperately needed foreign currency and therefore brought tourists to the island to spend money that would end up with the government from 1993 on their money was captured via a new currency called the cuban convertible peso cuc tourists surrendered their own currencies in exchange for the cucs excerpted crisis in cuba requires end of us blockade now courtesy

solana the dubbed ethereum killer is about to face one of its biggest challenges yet only this time the opposing force is not from the cryptocurrency market solana labs figures itself in a class action lawsuit à la ripple xrp a group of people filed a class action lawsuit against solana labs before the california federal court recently according to the case solano labs and the people within the ecosystem made illegal revenue by promoting their own token which is not registered under the us securities and exchange commission according to a forbes report the lawsuit could create a lasting impact on the future of the whole cryptocurrency industry many expect this will not be good news because cryptocurrency has always criticized government institutions and other financial experts for the longest time many believe that if the case results in sol token being considered a security it could reverberate towards the whole market according to the report we can expect that its outcome could further endanger the view of regulatory agencies towards crypto which has been viewed negatively by many for the longest time moreover it is also expected to open up a floodgate of changes that could be felt in many cryptocurrency exchanges such as binance coinbase kraken and more that are listing similarly natured cryptocurrencies if the ruling on the case goes against the favor of sol the likelihood of the token being delisted on many exchanges is high the same assumption can hold water for other cryptocurrency tokens in the market today the report from forbes harkened back to the dark past of ripple and its native token the xrp where they also faced a regulatory challenge before the sec for selling 1 3 billion tokens to the public the same argument against sol today was the same stance taken against xrp that they were selling unregistered securities what does the lawsuit against solana sol say the lawsuit against solana was filed by mark young roche freedman llp and schneider wallace cottrell konecky they said they were representing investors who were allegedly lied to drive up sol token sales from march 24 2020 to the present according to the plaintiffs sol earned a lot of profit from the sale without telling retail investors that they were buying unregistered securities the defendants stated in the lawsuit include solana labs a for profit organization backing the solana ecosystem and its chief executive officer anatoly yakovenko included as well are organizations related to solana such as the solana foundation crypto venture capital firm multicoin capital along with its chief executive office kyle samani and a trading platform by the name of falconx the lawsuit against solana claims that they were violating the federal and state securities law by not putting the token on registration as a security another point stressed in the lawsuit is that solana caused its investors enormous losses which must be charged to the plaintiff as one of their liabilities to their investors however beyond the forbes report and the lawsuit it has to be noted that the cryptocurrency market and the top tech stocks globally have been on a tumultuous season in the investment area for the past few weeks several problems have caused the bloodbath that many crypto tokens are experiencing today including sol moreover above many crypto tokens in the space sol created huge profits for most of its investors last year as many may remember sol was one of the fastest growing tokens in the space which even recorded an all time high of around 260 in november 2021 it also attracted investment from one of the richest men in crypto sam bankman fried sol performed well in recent years despite the outages it experienced over the last few months but over and above the mentioned considerations for solana according to young the project was a highly centralized cryptocurrency moreover young alleged that there were a lot of insiders within the solana ecosystem who stood to benefit significantly at the expense of the investors who were unaware of the real picture related article solana outage now solved after durable nonce bug hits blockchain here s what happened 2024 techtimes com all rights reserved do not reproduce without permission

santa fe state investments are being buffeted by turbulent financial markets as new mexico voters consider whether to divert more money each year toward early childhood education programs a report thursday from the legislature s budget and accountability office shows that the state s four major public pension and permanent funds shrank by about 825 million during the first three months of the year amid a federal interest rate hike the russian invasion of ukraine and a wave of covid 19 infections the losses are a tiny share of the funds 66 3 billion valuation that grew by 40 over the past five years a 19 billion surge a statewide referendum in november will decide whether to increase annual distributions slightly from the state s nearly 26 billion land grant permanent fund that fund is sustained by investment returns along with oil extraction and other natural resource development on state trust lands currently 5 of the fund balance each year goes mainly toward public schools and universities the referendum would increase the rate to 6 25 to provide about an additional 200 million to public education the increased withdrawals would go toward public school funding for at risk students and early childhood education programs advocates for the increase want to expand programs such as pre k child care assistance and voluntary home visits to new parents critics worry the changes undermine the growth and sustainability of trust the referendum would amend to the state s constitution and also requires authorization from congress
new york july 8 ani with the war in ukraine dragging on countries already under pressure from the knock off effect of the covid 19 pandemic risk seeing the same economic crisis as sri lanka the un said on thursday as it advised the international community to introduce radical financial measures to help countries saddled with debt we re witnessing a tragic series of events that are unfolding in sri lanka right now that should be a warning to anyone who thinks that you know it is up to countries themselves to figure out how to deal with this crisis said achim steiner administrator of the un development programme undp in reference to the south asian nation s debt default last month the first in its history that default essentially means the country is no longer able to pay or not only service its debt but actually to import fundamental parts of what keeps an economy alive whether it is petrol or it is diesel whether it is fuel whether it is medicines un news quoted steiner as saying the warning came as new data from the un food and agriculture organization fao indicated that the number of people affected by hunger globally rose to 828 million in 2021 an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of coronavirus in a report released on thursday the un development programme undp warned that soaring inflation rates have seen an increase in the number of poor people in developing countries by 71 million in the three months since march 2022 as interest rates rise in response to soaring inflation there is a risk of triggering further recession induced poverty that will exacerbate the crisis even more accelerating and deepening poverty worldwide developing countries grappling with depleted fiscal reserves and high levels of sovereign debt as well as rising interest rates on global financial markets face challenges that cannot be solved without urgent attention by the global community analysis of 159 developing countries globally indicate that price spikes in key commodities is already having immediate and devastating impacts on the poorest households with clear hotspots in the balkans countries in the caspian sea region and sub saharan africa in particular the sahel region according to the undp estimates this report zooms in on the insights provided by the two briefs of the un secretary general global crisis response group on the ripple effects of the war in ukraine unprecedented price surges mean that for many people across the world the food that they could afford yesterday is no longer attainable today says undp administrator achim steiner this cost of living crisis is tipping millions of people into poverty and even starvation at breathtaking speed and with that the threat of increased social unrest grows by the day policymakers responding to the cost of living crisis particularly in poorer nations face difficult choices the challenge is how to balance meaningful short term relief to poor and vulnerable households at a moment when most developing countries are struggling with shrinking fiscal space and ballooning debt we are witnessing an alarming growing divergence in the global economy as entire developing countries face the threat of being left behind as they struggle to contend with the continuing covid 19 pandemic crushing debt levels and now an accelerating food and energy crisis says steiner yet new international efforts can take the wind out of this vicious economic cycle saving lives and livelihoods that includes decisive debt relief measures keeping international supply chains open and coordinated action to ensure that some of the world s most marginalized communities can access affordable food and energy countries have tried to dilute the worst impacts of the current crisis using trade restrictions tax rebates blanket energy subsidies and targeted cash transfers the report finds that targeted cash transfers are more equitable and cost effective than blanket subsidies while blanket energy subsidies may help in the short term in the longer term they drive inequality further exacerbate the climate crisis and do not soften the immediate blow of the cost of living increase as much as targeted cash transfers do says report author george gray molina undp head of strategic policy engagement they offer some relief as an immediate band aid but risk causing worse injury over time the report shows that energy subsidies disproportionately benefit wealthier people with more than half of the benefits of a universal energy subsidy favoring the richest 20 of the population by contrast cash transfers mostly go to the poorest 40 of the population cash in the hands of the people who are reeling from the astronomical price increases to food and fuel will have a widespread impact in positive ways molina says our modeling shows that even very modest cash transfers can have dramatic and stabilizing effects for the poorest and most vulnerable in this crisis and we know from covid 19 responses that developing countries must be supported by the global community to have the fiscal space to fund these schemes ani

employers advertised fewer jobs in may amid signs that the economy is weakening and there are already signs that retailers have pulled back on hiring a weakening of the broader job market which has remained strong through the pandemic recovery could signal that inflation is cooling off investors will get a clearer picture friday when the more detailed june jobs report is released advertisement

management at horizon investments as we look to tomorrow and think about how markets should be reading the report seeing a deceleration in the pace of job growth is a positive in a sense investors are trying to determine whether a recession is on the horizon as the fed aggressively raises interest rates to temper pervasive inflation businesses are getting squeezed by higher costs because of supply chain problems and have raised prices on a variety of items including food and clothing consumers have been pulling back on spending as inflation puts a tighter squeeze on budgets russia s invasion of ukraine in february sent energy prices surging resulting in record gasoline prices in the u s pain at the pump has only worsened the broader effect of inflation though there are signs that gasoline prices have begun to recede the key concern is that the fed s interest rate hikes could go too far in slowing economic growth and actually bring on a recession after last month s meeting the fed raised its rate by three quarters of a point to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 the biggest single increase in nearly three decades and signaled that further large hikes probably would be needed the recession

federal reserve governor christopher waller said he supports raising interest rates by 75 basis points this month for a second straight meeting and probably a 50 basis point hike at the following gathering in september dismissing concerns that the u s economy is starting to slump we need to move to a much more restrictive setting and do that as quickly as possible waller said thursday in a webcast hosted by the national association for business economics regarding the idea that higher borrowing costs risk pushing the u s economy into recession waller stressed the need to tame red hot inflation inflation is a tax on economic activity he said fears of a recession are overblown we need to move to a much more restrictive setting and do that as quickly as possible waller said thursday bloomberg news waller had previously said the central bank is all in on the inflation fight and has backed another 75 basis point interest rate increase when the federal open market committee meets july 26 27 that would match the move it made last month which was the biggest increase since 1994 on thursday he said he still sees a good shot that the economy will have a soft landing meaning the fed s interest rate hikes will bring down inflation without sparking a recession minutes from the june fomc meeting released on wednesday showed central bankers prepared if necessary to combat the hottest inflation in 40 years by tightening policy even further than anticipated in their latest forecasts those projections which were updated last month see the fed s benchmark lending rate peaking in a range of 3 75 to 4 next year from a current of 1 5 to 1 75 inflation according to the fed s preferred measure rose 6 3 in the 12 months through may more than three times the fed s 2 target a separate gauge of consumer prices is expected to show a 8 8 year over year increase in june according to economists surveyed by bloomberg news the labor department report will be released on july 13 higher interest rates have slowed interest sensitive sectors of the u s economy such as home sales and punished stock prices with the s p 500 index down about 18 this year but the economy still shows plenty of signs of growth economists estimate that nonfarm payrolls for june for example will rise by 265 000 the monthly employment report is published on friday such a number in that range would historically be regarded as phenomenal waller said this is a pretty spectacular labor market in separate remarks on thursday st louis fed president james bullard repeated a warning that inflation expectations could become unhinged without credible action by the central bank without such action that could lead to a new regime of high inflation and volatile real economic performance bullard said in slides prepared for a presentation in little rock arkansas

the u s dollar has been surging so much that it s nearly equal in value to the euro for the first time in 20 years that trend threatens to hurt american companies because their goods become more expensive for foreign buyers if u s exports were to weaken as a result so too would the already slowing u s economy yet there s a positive side for americans too a stronger buck provides modest relief from runaway inflation because the vast array of goods that are imported to the u s including cars computers toys and medical equipment become less expensive a strengthened dollar also delivers bargains to american tourists sightseeing in europe advertisement the u s dollar index which measures the value of american money against six major foreign currencies has jumped nearly 12 this year to a two decade high the euro is now worth slightly less than 1 02 the dollar is climbing mainly because the federal reserve is raising interest rates more aggressively than central banks in other countries are in its effort to cool the hottest u s inflation in four decades the fed s rate increases cause yields on u s treasurys to rise which attracts investors seeking richer yields than they can get elsewhere in the world this increased demand for dollar denominated securities in turn boosts the dollar s value also contributing to the currency s appeal rubeela farooqi of high frequency economics said is that despite concern about a potential recession in the united states the u s economy is on firmer footing compared to europe advertisement not since july 15 2002 has the euro been valued at less than 1 on that day the euro blew past parity with the dollar as huge u s trade deficits and accounting scandals on wall street pulled down the u s currency this year the euro has sagged largely because of growing fears that the 19 countries that use the currency will sink into recession the war in ukraine has magnified oil and gas prices and hurt european consumers and businesses in particular russia s recent reduction in natural gas supplies has sent prices skyrocketing and raised fears of a total cutoff that could force governments to ration energy to industry to spare homes schools and hospitals european leaders have denounced moscow s move as an effort to punish europe for backing ukraine and embracing western sanctions in response to russia s invasion advertisement economists at berenberg bank have calculated that at current rates of consumption the added gas bill would be 220 billion euros 224 billion over 12 months or a whopping 1 5 of annual economic output this war is a body blow to europe robin brooks chief economist at the institute of international finance banking trade group tweeted this week it undercuts germany s growth model that s based on cheap russian energy europe is facing a seismic shift and euro needs to fall to reflect that a european slowdown could eventually give the european central bank less leeway to raise rates and moderate economic growth to address its own inflation problem the ecb has announced that it will raise its key interest rate by a quarter of a point when it meets later this month and possibly by up to half a point in september a weaker euro feeds inflationary pressures by making imports to europe more expensive advertisement analysts at unicredit said global recession fears were a prime driver in foreign exchange markets amid the general view that the fed might ultimately have more opportunity than many other central banks to raise rates the analysts also noted the dollar s role as a globally recognized haven as another factor that s boosting demand for the buck the dollar s rise is complicating an already uncertain outlook for the united states the world s biggest economy the stronger greenback makes foreign goods less expensive for americans and eases inflationary pressures but not by much mark zandi chief economist at moody s analytics calculates that a 10 rise in the dollar over the last year against the currencies of its trading partners reduced inflation by about 0 4 percentage point though zandi calls that a meaningful effect he said consumer prices have soared 8 6 over the last year the biggest year over year gain since 1981 advertisement and a sturdier currency takes a toll on u s companies that do business overseas for one thing it erodes the profits of multinational companies that rely on overseas sales the stronger dollar makes their foreign revenue worth less when they convert it to dollars and bring it home to the united states microsoft for example last month downgraded the outlook for its april to june earnings due to unfavorable foreign exchange rate movement worse a stronger dollar makes u s made products more expensive in overseas markets while giving foreign products a price edge in the united states the stronger dollar zandi said weighs on growth as it results in reduced exports more imports and thus a wider trade deficit advertisement indeed a growing trade gap subtracted 3 2 percentage points from u s economic growth in the january to march period that was the main reason why the nation s gross domestic product the broadest gauge of economic output shrank at a 1 6 annual rate in the first quarter economists say the risk of recession is already rising in the united states as the fed raises borrowing costs and consumers deplete the savings they built up during the pandemic the strength of the dollar said eswar prasad an economist at cornell university and the brookings institution will certainly do no favors for u s exporters

new york july 8 ani with the war in ukraine dragging on countries already under pressure from the knock off effect of the covid 19 pandemic risk seeing the same economic crisis as sri lanka the un said on thursday as it advised the international community to introduce radical financial measures to help countries saddled with debt we re witnessing a tragic series of events that are unfolding in sri lanka right now that should be a warning to anyone who thinks that you know it is up to countries themselves to figure out how to deal with this crisis said achim steiner administrator of the un development programme undp in reference to the south asian nation s debt default last month the first in its history that default essentially means the country is no longer able to pay or not only service its debt but actually to import fundamental parts of what keeps an economy alive whether it is petrol or it is diesel whether it is fuel whether it is medicines un news quoted steiner as saying the warning came as new data from the un food and agriculture organization fao indicated that the number of people affected by hunger globally rose to 828 million in 2021 an increase of about 46 million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of coronavirus in a report released on thursday the un development programme undp warned that soaring inflation rates have seen an increase in the number of poor people in developing countries by 71 million in the three months since march 2022 as interest rates rise in response to soaring inflation there is a risk of triggering further recession induced poverty that will exacerbate the crisis even more accelerating and deepening poverty worldwide developing countries grappling with depleted fiscal reserves and high levels of sovereign debt as well as rising interest rates on global financial markets face challenges that cannot be solved without urgent attention by the global community analysis of 159 developing countries globally indicate that price spikes in key commodities is already having immediate and devastating impacts on the poorest households with clear hotspots in the balkans countries in the caspian sea region and sub saharan africa in particular the sahel region according to the undp estimates this report zooms in on the insights provided by the two briefs of the un secretary general global crisis response group on the ripple effects of the war in ukraine unprecedented price surges mean that for many people across the world the food that they could afford yesterday is no longer attainable today says undp administrator achim steiner this cost of living crisis is tipping millions of people into poverty and even starvation at breathtaking speed and with that the threat of increased social unrest grows by the day policymakers responding to the cost of living crisis particularly in poorer nations face difficult choices the challenge is how to balance meaningful short term relief to poor and vulnerable households at a moment when most developing countries are struggling with shrinking fiscal space and ballooning debt we are witnessing an alarming growing divergence in the global economy as entire developing countries face the threat of being left behind as they struggle to contend with the continuing covid 19 pandemic crushing debt levels and now an accelerating food and energy crisis says steiner yet new international efforts can take the wind out of this vicious economic cycle saving lives and livelihoods that includes decisive debt relief measures keeping international supply chains open and coordinated action to ensure that some of the world s most marginalized communities can access affordable food and energy countries have tried to dilute the worst impacts of the current crisis using trade restrictions tax rebates blanket energy subsidies and targeted cash transfers the report finds that targeted cash transfers are more equitable and cost effective than blanket subsidies while blanket energy subsidies may help in the short term in the longer term they drive inequality further exacerbate the climate crisis and do not soften the immediate blow of the cost of living increase as much as targeted cash transfers do says report author george gray molina undp head of strategic policy engagement they offer some relief as an immediate band aid but risk causing worse injury over time the report shows that energy subsidies disproportionately benefit wealthier people with more than half of the benefits of a universal energy subsidy favoring the richest 20 of the population by contrast cash transfers mostly go to the poorest 40 of the population cash in the hands of the people who are reeling from the astronomical price increases to food and fuel will have a widespread impact in positive ways molina says our modeling shows that even very modest cash transfers can have dramatic and stabilizing effects for the poorest and most vulnerable in this crisis and we know from covid 19 responses that developing countries must be supported by the global community to have the fiscal space to fund these schemes ani

text size shannon demicoli battisson loves overhearing locals who stop to talk about her home on evening walks in her new suburb they ask why does it face such a funny angle why are there weeds in the driveway why is the roof upside down says battisson the newest national president of the australian institute of architects the answers to this pop quiz are at the end of this article australia has about 13 000 architects yet fewer than 6 per cent of homes are designed by them few architects are involved in high volume housing projects and they are largely absent from new suburbs and affordable housing battisson is determined to change this and make her profession more relevant i want to smash the image that architecture is only for the elite she leads by example by living and building affordable and sustainable homes for ordinary people in the suburbs of canberra shannon battison the new national president of the institute of architects has plenty to say credit zachary griffith advertisement there will always be a place for incredibly bespoke whimsical you know magical architectural houses she says but there is equally a place for architects in the affordable housing market it s really easy to forget that those buildings that we re building now should stand for 50 odd years before they need renovating if we don t get them right then we re setting up multiple generations to live in really bad quality as the climate is showing us it is too high a cost not to get it right before we build as she puts it those people who most need well designed homes to manage rocketing energy bills and keep the climate at bay are least likely to get them when we meet for lunch on a windy cold monday in canberra she is elated and tired after two weeks of speeches marking the start of her two year presidency at the ceremony she was garlanded with a silver chain of office designed in 1964 by the opera house s architect jorn utzon pressure much three days before lunch battisson and her practice the mill architecture design had been awarded 2022 s highest award for sustainable architecture from the act chapter of the australian institute of architects it was for her home the house with old roots built in denman prospect a greenfield suburb in canberra s molonglo valley currently being developed advertisement there are not many trees growing there yet her home in this new suburb got its name and some history from the transplantation of a much loved magnolia tree from the battisson family s first home built by her husband s grandparents the jury said her new home showed sustainable architecture didn t have to be costly and could be beautifully integrated in a comfy family home shannon battisson s home in denman prospect credit anne stroud only 41 and the second youngest national president ever it was battisson s third big architecture award including the act president s medal in 2017 and the shared prize of emerging architect in 2018 to be honest this interview with battisson didn t only take place over lunch at the japanese restaurant raku in canberra it started months before over coffee and continued in phone calls the last before she flew out to the united states in june for a month of conferences vacation and to visit her favourite place palm springs it is the home of mid century modernism with houses by a quincy jones albert frey herbert w burns many with an upside down butterfly roof like battisson s she was born in sydney s inner west to awesome humans her maltese mother julie demicoli and australian dad the late rob anderson were strong unionists who also advocated for refugees women and the environment they taught her to have strong opinions and to be prepared to fight for she has a lot to say and already she has come out swinging on advertisement house sizes too big too close to others poorly insulated and too reliant on air conditioning heating it is unbelievable that up to 40 people die in canberra every year because their homes are too cold she says the environment it is time for architects to lead on environmental issues she says residential buildings represent 12 per cent of carbon emissions and 24 per cent of electricity use improving existing housing battisson is calling on the government to provide incentives for owners of existing housing stock often described as tents with windows to better insulate their homes harry seidler s bowden house in canberra has a butterfly roof credit national archives of australia the palm springs of australia australians love to kind of rag on canberra but actually we have an incredible percentage of unforgettable mid century architecture this includes bowden house by harry seidler roy grounds academy of science dome and homes by robin boyd over lunch she gives great chat she doesn t like the smell of fish a challenge for her growing up in a family of fish loving maltese migrants that makes raku which does a roaring trade in sushi and sashimi a curious choice for lunch as we arrive hulking bits of octopus sizzle on the grill but battisson likes raku s service and its beef she was also touched when its chefs made her a special fish dish to see if they could fix her aversion given these restrictions i suggest she pick she chooses the eggplant miso soup to start followed by the 150 day grain fed scotch fillet with three sauces rice some asparagus and spicy corn advertisement i muck up the order but the miso minus the eggplant which i failed to request is warming she picks at the scotch fillet saying she is a grazer who eats small amounts rather than a wolfer downer like me bad luck for her the fillet is delicious the asparagus at raku in canberra credit zachary griffith the local red wine a sangiovese from collector is so good that it sends me googling to buy some later the corn is perfectly charred and a bit sticky enough to have awkward moments where kernels get stuck in my teeth if she notices she is too polite to say anything that could be the legacy of her time working as a customer service officer at qantas during her two year gap period and later in university holidays her late dad was a qantas baggage handler she handled people advertisement
university park pa penn state alumnus jake poliskin has built an impressive career in the high stakes arena of venture capital and tech investment as billionaire mark cuban s east coast adviser and only remote employee poliskin screened early stage companies for potential capital investment and managed special projects such as ai driven event recognition for the dallas mavericks more recently he s collaborated with lukas walton of the walton family microsoft founder bill gates netflix ceo ted sarandos and carlyle founder david rubenstein it would be an impressive resume for anyone but poliskin is just getting started he hasn t yet turned 30 now as the 2015 alumnus of the college of the liberal arts takes stock of his early success he s exploring how targeted philanthropic investment can remove barriers to educational opportunity poliskin has stepped forward with a gift commitment of 100 000 to create the jake poliskin scholarship in the smeal college of business the permanent endowment will award scholarships annually to smeal undergraduates with demonstrated financial need the support advances efforts to ensure that the penn state experience remains accessible and affordable to students regardless of economic background penn state s alumni have a well earned reputation for generosity but rarely do we encounter someone so young and so recently graduated reaching out to make a gift of this magnitude said o richard bundy iii vice president for development and alumni relations jake s gift is a powerful endorsement of the value of the penn state experience and it will provide a lifeline of financial support to smeal students for generations to come poliskin who majored in economics traces his entrepreneurial spirit to his close knit family his grandfather eugene was a jeweler on the philadelphia jewelers row district and his father harold managed a series of successful startups poliskin s mother vicki spent the latter half of her career as an administrator at a local senior center and his sister kara lord now works as a social media manager for tommy john poliskin said that his family s combination of ingenuity and care for others grounded in their jewish heritage are the same interlocking priorities that today guide his decisions in the arena of venture capital what surprised poliskin however was that even his solidly middle class family in devon pennsylvania struggled to cover the costs associated with his education when i got to university park i was kind of naïve about the price of tuition and housing and over time i realized firsthand what it means to be impacted daily by financial stress said poliskin it eats away at you and you worry doubly about how it s impacting your family i knew that by making this gift i could ease the burden on future penn staters so that they can seize every opportunity to find their niche in the world poliskin credits his success in large part to the transformative influence of the community at penn state i didn t start my college career as a laser focused high achiever but my best friend and roommate at penn state billy hunt showed me how diligence and hard work can put you on track to achieve your goals in making this gift my hope is to build a foundation of financial resources so that every penn stater can make the best use of their ideas and talents and that s because we all deserve a shared prosperity today poliskin serves as head of investments for david adelman s family office darco capital one of the largest owners of student affiliated housing in the united states there he directs adelman s private investments which have gravitated toward climate technology poliskin s priorities have included companies that are pursuing electrification of freight ships advances in nuclear fusion mobile carbon capture for long haul semi trucks and cell cultivated meat products the coordinated efforts aim to reduce climate impact and drive down prices on goods and services for everyday consumers beyond his role at darco capital poliskin also maintains working relationships with mark cuban and david rubenstein as poliskin works to enhance opportunities for the next generation of penn state students he is cognizant of how crucial mentorship can be to educational and career outcomes mark cuban had such a profound impact on my life his curiosity is just so infectious and i learned so much from his example the same is true of david and hallee adelman who put their trust in me and supported me through the good and the bad everyone should be so lucky to have mentors like these and by helping to build a stronger better resourced penn state that s my ultimate goal poliskin s recent philanthropic commitment builds on his volunteer history at penn state during 2017 s startup week he enhanced the slate of events by delivering presentations speaking on an expert panel and coaching a pitch team poliskin said he hoped his endowment would strengthen the university and prompt others to consider making a gift

new york where we laid out our plans to accelerate profitable growth over the next five years the team is off to a strong start in executing the strategic initiatives that will deliver those plans and you can see that clearly in the results we reported today revenue in the second quarter grew 20 on a constant currency basis and 15 on a reported basis to 1 5 billion reflecting strong consumer demand across our business and around the world we also increased profitability expanding adjusted ebit margin 90 basis points to a record 9 9 for the second quarter which drove adjusted ebit growth of 27 and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 26 combined with our strong brands our relentless focus on our strategic priorities being brand led dtc first and diversifying the portfolio has delivered strong results even with continued macro economic uncertainty and persistent inflationary pressures the momentum we are driving today reinforces my conviction in the potential of our strategy and the execution abilities of our team leaving us firmly on track to deliver on our long term commitments there are several notable dynamics that underscore our performance this quarter for which my and harmit s comments will reference revenue constant currency comparisons to 2021 unless we indicate otherwise let me start with our first priority being brand led the levi s brand is stronger than it has ever been and the demand is stronger than it has been in my career here at ls co levi s is the number one jeans brand in the world and has strengthened its standing over the past year driving most share growth amongst world s top jeans brands with brand awareness remaining well above the competition across most markets we ve been moving with agility to capitalize on global casualization trends fueling strong growth for levi s while also driving strong underlying category growth that continues to outpace apparel this performance was supported by our focused efforts to leverage our leadership position with a strong pipeline of innovation this past quarter we dug into our archives releasing the levi s fresh collection which was inspired by our product collection from the 1970s featuring a range of sustainably dyed pieces for men and women including 501 jeans sweats accessories and more at premium price points the innovative collection saw particular success with women s and tops in addition to younger consumers with whom we are gaining share and seeing record engagement on our industry leading tiktok overall the levi s brand grew 20 with our top five markets collectively growing at an even faster rate levi s bottoms revenue was up double digits across both men s and women s versus last year and pre pandemic q2 2019 levels and nearly all levi s fits across genders contributed to growth globally led by strength in looser fits the 501 family of products also continued to show a strong growth up 40 across men s and women s highlighting the momentum of the most iconic fit in our line turning to our second strategic priority dtc first our direct to consumer business continues to thrive allowing us to deepen our connection with consumers while showcasing the fullest expression of our brands this quarter total dtc net revenue increased 22 with growth driven by our company operated stores strength in our global brick and mortar business was driven by both mainline and outlet stores across geographic segments as a result of increased foot traffic and store expansion as well as higher unit volumes and aurs during the quarter we also benefited from a return of tourist traffic in many of our downtown locations propelling growth on our flagship stores in key cities including san francisco new york paris and london our latest generation of new stores continued to perform against our expectations reflecting the market potential that we have yet to unlock the success of these newer stores reinforces our conviction of reaching more than 1 500 company operated stores by 2027 our e commerce business remains healthy with revenue continuing to far exceed pre pandemic levels we did see a moderation in online traffic as consumers return to shopping in our stores in large numbers e commerce remains an important driver of our growth algorithm and we are committed to tripling its size over the next five years after successfully growing e commerce into nearly a 0 5 billion business over the last decade to achieve this ambitious goal we are building the capabilities and the organizational structure to both scale e commerce and accelerate our broader digital transformation as part of that we are establishing a new chief digital officer role that will report to me the role will bring together our data ai engineering and digital product management efforts under one leader who will spearhead our digital efforts for both e commerce and our digital go to market we see tremendous potential in e commerce and with the leadership to drive its success we will move more quickly to realize it we also continue to leverage our data capabilities to deepen our direct personalized relationships with our consumers through our levi s app and loyalty programs the app continued to see strong engagement with monthly active users up double digits it also expanded into india and is now available in 10 countries total with plans to further rollout to eight more countries across europe this year these initiatives helped expand our loyalty member base by over 50 year over year with gains in key member productivity metrics including average order value and while our direct to consumer business continues to generate consistently strong growth our global wholesale business also continues its strong performance in q2 growing 18 with improved profitability in terms of diversifying our portfolio our third priority we are focused on significant market opportunities in underpenetrated high gross margin parts of our business that can drive strong growth even in these times of macro uncertainty the opportunities here are tremendous with untapped potential across women s tops international and our other brands dockers and beyond yoga this quarter we made progress across each of these areas of focus following 11 consecutive quarters of pre pandemic double digit revenue growth our total women s business grew 23 the fifth consecutive quarter of double digit growth since exiting the most challenging parts with the pandemic while women s saw broad based growth across geographic segments growth was especially strong in the americans where the levi s women s business was up 30 and in our top 10 wholesale accounts globally levi s women s were up 50 one of the biggest long term opportunities we have ahead of us is to extend into true head to toe expressions of our brands and we re making solid progress for the total company tops were up 23 with strength broad based globally across categories we saw particularly strong growth in the americas up 26 with traction in polos in the u s which were up more than 10 fold on levi com overall women saw continued strength in wovens and dresses in addition to double digit growth in non graphic tees our non denim bottoms business also performed well up nearly 20 for levi s men s with continued success with our xx chino and more our international business was up 19 with all geographies delivering strong double digit revenue growth our top markets in europe france germany and the uk were collectively up strong double digits excluding china and hong kong where lockdowns have persisted growth in asia was over 40 with every market contributing to that growth our other brands also performed well in the quarter dockers continue to build momentum delivering 27 growth in q2 as it be internal plans on both the top and bottom line this was supported by strong international and dtc growth as well as some notable wins with women s reflecting the progress we ve made in refreshing the brand dockers women s launched on amazon in the us this quarter and at zalando and el corte ingles in europe while it s early days so far the product is performing well beyond yoga also made solid progress in the quarter with success in dresses pop colors and prints and it s mommy me collection most of which sold out in the first week on june 25th the brand also opened its first pop up store at the grove in los angeles and the initial response from consumers has been terrific beyond yoga remains on track to open its first permanent store in q4 of 2022 across the board this was a strong quarter marked by consistent execution of our strategic priorities i want to recognize the hard work and dedication of our teams across the organization we delivered solid results in a uniquely challenging operating environment i ll now turn it over to harmit to cover the financial results in more detail harmit harmit singh thank you chip and good afternoon everyone at our investor day in june we laid out a clear long term strategy designed to deliver faster growth stronger margins and increased cash returns to our shareholders on our path to drive annual shareholder returns of 10 to 12 over the next five years our plan which calls for annual revenue growth of 6 to 8 adjusted ebit margin expansion to 15 and our commitment to return 55 to 65 of our free cash flow to our shareholders over that time frame is bold yet achievable in our second quarter our team delivered on each of the three drivers of our long term tsr algorithm accelerated sales growth margin expansion and cash return we generated strong growth total net revenue grew 20 to 1 5 billion driven by 21 revenue growth in the us and strong performance across our diverse global portfolio supply chain related issues limited further revenue opportunity by approximately 2 primarily in the us where strong demand continues to outpace supply adjusted ebit grew even faster up 27 reported and 37 in constant currency as adjusted ebit margin expanded 90 basis points to a record second quarter level of 9 9 the strong ebit growth was the principal factor driving adjusted diluted eps up 26 to 0 29 we achieved these strong results even as we invested in our brand and navigated the impact of rising inflation continued covid related challenges geopolitical turmoil and foreign exchange headwinds we also returned 80 million of capital to our shareholders through a combination of higher dividends and the repurchase of 2 million shares given the continued strong performance of our diversified business we are also reaffirming our financial outlook for the year second quarter net revenue growth of 20 was primarily driven by higher volume as well as an increase in aurs demonstrating again the strength of our brand and our leadership in the denim category as we price to offset inflation direct to consumer channel net revenue increased 22 driven by increased traffic store expansion and continued gains in aurs which were up high single digits as chip referenced with consumer shopping behavior shifting from online to in person shopping our e commerce business was down 2 in quarter two yet remains over 60 higher versus 2019 with its operating margin on a fully allocated basis in the mid single digit and growth through all digital channels was up 8 year over year remaining elevated versus 2019 levels and comprising approximately 20 of total second quarter net revenue adjusted gross margin was maintained in reported dollars as a second quarter record of 58 2 primarily due to improved structure element including mix shifts to higher gross margin dtc international women s as well as a sustainable improvement within wholesale combined with price increases these factors offset higher product costs including 80 basis points of higher air freight cost to support delivery of seasonal merchandise as well as 30 basis points negative impact due to declines of high gross margin in markets china and russia moving to sg a adjusted sg a expenses in the quarter was 711 million or 48 3 of net revenue leveraging 90 basis points despite a p being higher by 10 basis points our gross margin coupled with our disciplined sg a management and operating leverage generated an adjusted ebit margin expansion of 90 basis points to 9 9 while adjusted ebit dollars were up 37 in constant currency even as we continue to strategically invest in our long term growth initiative as a result of russia s invasion of ukraine we suspended the majority of our commercial activity in russia including the closure of the majority of our stores and the suspension of shipments to our wholesale and licensing customer given the high level of uncertainty surrounding our business in russia we fully instated the related long term assets including store assets and goodwill the total charges related to russia ukraine crisis recorded during the quarter were 60 million impacting diluted earnings per share by 0 15 our effective tax rate was approximately 36 which is higher due to a 16 percentage point tax rate increase resulting from non tax deductible charges related to the russia ukraine crisis adjusted net income of 117 million was up from 93 million in quarter two of 21 due to the increase in adjusted ebit and lower interest expense partially offset by higher taxes as just referenced i ll now take you through key highlights by segment recall the regional segments include our levi s brand levi s signature and denizen while the other brand segment includes dockers and beyond yoga in the america revenues grew 17 driven primarily by higher unit volume as well as higher aurs across channel overall momentum in our largest market the us continued delivering growth of 16 canada saw a strong growth up double digit and our overall latam business was up 18 fueled by growth in peru chile and brazil our company operated stores posted another strong quarter up 20 driven by increased traffic and price increases while wholesale grew 19 with particular strength in the us europe continued to see strong momentum and revenue was up 3 reported and 15 constant despite the impact of the russia ukraine crisis dtc was up 38 reflecting higher traffic as consumers return to shopping in store as a reminder approximately one third of company operated stores were closed last year in the region most countries saw growth including large markets such as france germany italy spain and the uk asia accelerated and revenue was up 16 reported and 21 constant despite covid related restrictions negatively impacting markets like china and hong kong wholesale was up 41 while dtc growth of 7 was led by both mainline and outlet stores while growth was broad based large markets like anz india and japan were particularly strong thailand also transitioned from a license to a directly operated business in april contributing to results overall revenue growth in asia has tripled operating profits and delivered an operating margin of 8 6 other brands net revenue was up 61 driven by growth in dockers and the addition of beyond yoga overall operating profits were also up 66 turning to balance sheet and cash flows inventories increased 29 from the prior year consistent with our internal plan and our strategy to more effectively meet demand by investing selectively in core product which can be sold across multiple future seasons a third of the increase includes the planned acceleration or receipt for our upcoming seasons to mitigate longer lead time and the acquisition of beyond yoga and the transition of thailand business from a license to a directly operated business also contributed 3 percentage points of the year to year increase in inventory roughly 20 of the total inventory is comprised of product in transit we are comfortable with the overall level composition and quality of inventory on hand cash and liquidity remains strong with end of the quarter net debt of 306 million and overall liquidity of 1 5 billion our leverage ratio remained at a multi decade low of 1 1 times adjusted free cash flow which we now define as cash flow from operating activities less property plant and equipment was 13 million down from 148 million in the second quarter of the prior year primarily due to higher spending on inventory in the second quarter we returned approximately 80 million to shareholders the company paid a dividend of 0 10 per share 64 higher than one year ago and in the quarter we repurchase shares of approximately 40 million going forward the company declared a dividend of 0 12 per share a 20 increase from last quarter and as i mentioned in june at investor day the board of directors also authorized a new 750 million share repurchase program moving onto our guidance for fiscal 22 against a backdrop of continued macroeconomic volatility we are focused on controlling the controllable and delivering results with strong execution and discipline as we have done in the past we continue to see strong demand for our products across geographies and categories and our teams remain focused on executing on our strategic priority to capitalize on these opportunities through the balance of the year the underlying trends we are seeing in our business supports our continued expectation for 11 to 13 annual reported net revenue growth to 6 4 billion to 6 5 billion this is allowing us to offset 100 basis points to 150 basis points of incremental headwind from currency and lockdown restrictions in china from when we last shared guidance with you in april this represents 13 to 15 net revenue growth on a constant currency basis well above our expectations coming into the year looking at our reported net revenue outlook by region we now expect americas to be up low teens asia mid teens and europe flat to slightly down in constant currency asia excluding fx would be up approximately 20 and europe excluding fx and russia would be up low double digits our full year expectation for adjusted gross margin expansion of 20 basis points to 40 basis points ebit margin expansion of 20 basis points to 30 basis points and capex of 270 million has not changed we are planning for a tax rate of approximately 20 for the full year up from our prior outlook of mid to high teens we are also maintaining our expectations for adjusted diluted eps of 1 50 to 1 56 as the quarter two be and underlying strength in our business are helping offset incremental headwind from when we last guided in april including 0 02 from foreign exchange 0 02 from the higher tax rate and 0 04 impact from more protected lockdowns in china with respect to our expectations in the second half i ll share some color on sg a expenses and the tax rate we currently expect q3 to show some deleverage given lower relative investment in the prior year and as we continue to invest in new stores and a p q4 will be around prior year as a percentage of revenue we also expect the tax rate in the mid 20s in the third quarter due to the continued anticipated impact of covid related restrictions in china finally as we upgrade to our new on the cloud erp system in early quarter two of next year in the us post successful implementations in both mexico and canada we will be building mostly core products in q3 and q4 to protect shipments to our customer this upgraded erp will be instrumental in increasing speed and agility but providing us real time visibility to inventory across our network and setting us up well to accelerate our direct to consumer business in summary we continue to see momentum across the business we ve been able to build on our phenomenal 21 to deliver a very strong performance in the first half of 22 we are on track to deliver a solid 22 while making progress across our strategic priorities setting us up well to deliver on our longer term financial targets i will close with three key messages first the broad diversity of our business across geographies channels and product categories provides us with the control and optionality to successfully navigate the challenges of the external environment this positions us to deliver in both good and tough times second the strength of our brand strong execution by our teams and disciplined cost management have allowed us to expand and sustain gross and ebit margin expansion third we have made great progress on our commitment to return cash to our shareholders increasing our dividend by 20 from last quarter completing our 200 million share repurchase program in the quarter and announcing a 750 million repurchase authorization at our analyst day year to date we have returned close to 200 million to our shareholders a 400 increase over last year these three factors have allowed us to deliver a strong first half in 22 and reaffirms full year guidance despite all the headwinds in the marketplace with that i ll now go ahead and open the call for q a question and answer session operator thank you the floor in open for questions our first question comes from the line of matthew boss from j p morgan your line is open matthew boss thanks and congrats on another nice quarter chip bergh thanks matt matthew boss so chip on the continued momentum and strength of the brand could you maybe speak to drivers behind the acceleration notably that you re seeing in the americas maybe what s driving the combination of both aur and unit growth and just how do you see levi s positioned to take share in this dynamic backdrop as now we move forward chip bergh well i would say first thing i ll answer the second half of your question first which is i think where levi s brand is incredibly well positioned in this very dynamic environment to continue to accelerate and grow share and the strength of this quarter gives me a lot of confidence in saying that i d say there are a number of key drivers to our success if you want to focus specifically on the us obviously the continuation of casualization is a dynamic that s playing out globally that helped us a lot but the us jeans market just got the data for the last 12 months ending may us jeans were up 19 and that was faster than total apparel so in us the market leader we are clearly the ones driving that we got some recent consumer research more consumers are now wearing jeans more often in professional settings i would say maybe even at your bank the ceo is probably just happy that people are coming into work and wearing a pair of jeans is perfectly acceptable today and that s very different than a pre pandemic world more than half of the people that were surveyed in this survey and this was done globally so that they can now wear jeans to work now it s a huge change from pre pandemic so the trend towards casualization is definitely helping a new denim cycle that we ve talked about for probably over a year straight loose baggy or fits but when i look at our business probably the strongest testimony to the strength of our brand is just what s happening on the 501s that is our most iconic item is up 40 again this quarter across men s and women s real solid growth and the brand fundamentally has never been stronger and that is probably best seen in the split of unit growth and aur growth i mean our aurs on a global basis so i don t have the numbers off the top of my head for us but on a global basis our aurs were up 8 and unit growth grew double digit 11 and so we successfully passed through pricing that has contributed to us being able to hold our gross margin at levels equal to year ago despite all the headwinds that harmit talked about in prepared remarks the impact of no russia and less sales in china both high gross margin businesses impact of airfreight we ve offset all of those things plus higher cost of goods that help gross margin which speaks to just the power of the levi s brand and then finally we re just continuing to connect with consumers in a really relevant and authentic way and that s what we do really really well and that s what s put this brand in such a strong position over the last several years so we can t control inflation we can t control what s going to happen in interest rates or whatever the fed is going to do or anything else but we can focus on the things that are within our control and we re going to continue to do a great job executing against those things connecting with consumers and building the brand matthew boss congrats again on the momentum chip bergh thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from kimberly greenberger of morgan stanley your line is open kimberly greenberger okay great thank you so much if i could ask a two part question i wanted harmit you mentioned the erp implementation happening in the us in the second quarter of next year could you just talk about how we ll see that manifest in inventory growth as you sort of proactively built some inventory just to make sure that you can deliver on time through that entire period of that implementation when does inventory rise when do we see it normalize on a quarter by quarter basis just any color you could offer there and then chip we heard that there was just a slight softening in retail sales among some of the us retailers here over the last month or so i don t know if you have an order book or if you have any sort of a forward view in terms of customer orders here in the us and the behavior that you might be seeing among those customers on their future order commitments if you have anything to share on that we would certainly be interested to hear thank you so much harmit singh sure i ll take the erp question the us is going to be a third implementation of the upgrade we ve done mexico we ve done canada both have gone really well us is the largest market a couple of other retailers have done the us and we are bringing to the a new one with the cloud sap system clear benefit the way we are thinking of inventory and as you know kimberly us is largely a core market where we carry the product through multiple seasons our expectation is between quarter three and quarter four we probably build about approximately 100 million in inventory that then waters down in quarter one quarter two of next year we re looking to implement this in early q2 of 2023 so that s how we re thinking about it and working through it i mean there is a dedicated team staff for a major implementation and our commercial teams are directly involved obviously the discussion with key customers itâ s a takes two to tango and so collaboratively we feel we can get this done and do it in a way that we can actually predict consumer demand and ensure that we satisfy the fill rates et cetera over to you chip chip bergh kimberly i ll try to keep this pretty brief our wholesale results in the quarter were very very strong as we talked about in the prepared remarks and on our core red tab business levi s renta focused here on the us specifically we really have not seen any softening or have heard really any concern about levi s red tab from our customers so the one soft spot in our business in the second quarter was on signature and done is in our to value brands not surprisingly those businesses were down mid single digits you know and as you know those businesses represent real real small part of our total revenue some kind of low single digits of our total revenue but those two brands which were up in the first quarter were down mid single digits in the second quarter so there s some evidence that value consumer the low income consumer is really starting to feel the squeeze which is going to be a surprise based on the results from walmart and target but levi s red tab at target is still doing really well and we feel really really good about our position right now in wholesale so we haven t seen any signs of cracks and i think again that speaks to the strength of the leviâ s brand kimberly greenberger great color thank you so much chip bergh thanks kim operator our next question comes from omar saad of evercore isi your line is open thanks omar saad thanks good evening it s great to hear so many different pieces of the businesses performing well it s also great to hear you guys are allocating more resources and talent to build out the digital organization but maybe to push in a little bit deeper on the digital performance in the quarter guys i think it was plus 3 overall maybe you could also dive in a little bit e com versus digital wholesale and then given the importance of digital and dtc to the elevated longer term growth algorithm you guys laid out not that long ago maybe talk about the e com performance and where you think it should go and where you think it can be and i m also wondering is there any supply chain and inventory hindrances holding that channel back thanks harmit singh yeah omar digital overall was up e commerce as i mentioned was down it was also down because you re lapping some real strong numbers as well as the consumers head back to the stores as a bit of the online shopping shifting to the stores and we saw that in the form of higher traffic in terms of the puts and takes if you think about the world americas generally strong on digital europe slightly weaker there are some retailers like zalando that have reported weaker sales and asia is still strong to the question about what we d like to do and where we d like to go we are in the early stages of really accelerating the business with the announcement that chip made on getting a chief digital officer you have somebody in the company beside folks in the commercial side of the business waking up every morning trying to drive and grow this business as we said in the investor day that we would our goal is to triple the size of the business from 7 to about 15 triple the size of the business which will also help ebit margin we think there is a huge opportunity we just rolled out the app in the 10 country at least 20 countries where this app needs to be we still get a small percentage of people buying through the app so the opportunity in that is immense and out loyalty program is just getting started we have 19 million consumers around the world a brand that leviâ s definitely has trend beyond yoga continues to grow e commerce dockers e commerce growth is accelerating so the real work is to get levi com to where we like it to be omar saad got it it sounds like with loyalty accelerating a key to accelerating the e com will be translating that loyalty to transactions harmit singh correct omar saad thanks for the color good luck harmit singh thanks omar operator our next question comes from laurent vasilescu of exane bnp paribas your line is open laurent vasilescu good afternoon and thank you very much for taking my question harmit i think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that china and fx is it incremental 100 basis point to 150 basis point headwind for the full year just curious on china specifically just curious to know how it performed in 2q and what is your expectation for the year as we think about that 100 basis point to 150 basis points and then if i can squeeze in the second question harmit i think you alluded to 4q revenues in the transcript that s still not populating correctly but just how do we think about 3q 4q revenues for the back half harmit singh yeah sure so china laurent as we mentioned at investor day itâ s a small piece of our business we started the year at about 3 we think we end the year at about 2 of our business on china we have a wonderful team on the ground and they re working through all the puts and takes china was down i believe close to 50 in quarter two largely because of stores were in a lockdown and we don t have a large e commerce we re just trying to build that and so we could offset the stores being closed the 100 basis point and 150 basis points of headwind that i talked about largely in the second half especially driven by foreign exchange and china being the two pieces of it fx being the euro and pound as you think about q3 and q4 i think q3 is mid to high single digit growth relative to 21 and q4 in the mid single digit i mean i think the good comparison is to relate both the q3 q4 h2 to 2019 and you will relative to 2019 we are doing in the low double digit and i can definitely give some more color on the inventory the questions on that later on laurent vasilescu very helpful thank you very much harmit harmit singh thank you operator thank you our next question comes from paul lejuez of citi your line is open tracy kogan hey thanks it s tracy kogan filling in for paul i was wondering if you guys can talk about store traffic and conversion in each of your regions and how that compare to 2019 and also then specifically in china since the lockdowns have abated what store traffic or how has the store traffic built since the lockdowns ended thank you harmit singh yeah tracy the store traffic is growing relative to a year ago generally across the board it s very difficult to go country by country because different countries have different elements of geopolitical covid uncertainty but traffic we saw build and that s why chip in prepared remarks talked about the growth we re seeing in our brick and mortar stores especially in key cities we see tourist traffic beginning to improve the chinese tourists is absent but iâ d sat that we re beginning to see tourist traffic improve and having said all that traffic relative to â 19 is still below 19 level right so traffic hasn t gone back to 19 level conversion rates and higher units per transaction because now we have a lot more to offer from head to toe perspective it helps offset the traffic decline relative to 19 especially in the us and we are opening doors we should have 70 odd doors on a net basis open this year us is also opening doors and we talked in the investor day of how we think we can open on a net basis about 80 new doors 23 onwards i mean structurally the economics are a little different in brick and mortar obviously we ve negotiated rent reductions lower rents in new doors et cetera because we re one of the few retailers that are continuing to open doors i think structurally the economics are slightly better and help offset some of the traffic decline tracy kogan thank you harmit singh thank you tracy operator thank you our next question comes from will gartner of wells fargo your line is open again will gartner your line is open aida orphan why don t we move to the next caller and come back to will operator absolutely our next question comes from jim duffy of stifel your line is open jim duffy thank you good afternoon chip bergh hey jim jim duffy nice work in the quarter i want to ask there has been a lot of volatility in the commodities market though the recent correction has been sharp when do you lock in cost for the first half of fiscal 23 and does the correction we ve seen in the commodities landscape have you rethinking the rate of price increases that you had talked about for the back half of the year at all harmit singh yeah jim so broadly speaking we lock in our open to buy twice a year so the first half of 23 is largely locked in unfortunately at higher commodity price point the good news as you ve seen the quarter in futures and they indicate futures beginning december cotton is trading it was below 0 90 yesterday it was over 0 90 i haven t seen when the market moves up so i was looking at it earlier and the average cotton price is between 0 80 and 0 90 so it s trending back hopefully so it definitely help us in the second half of next year to your question about pricing we have taken pricing thoughtfully earlier on i have taken some pricing in h2 and we ve been very thoughtful about 23 obviously it s important for us to offset cost increases and doing it surgically is critical but we re very thoughtful the other piece is despite the pricing that we ve taken we still our products still provide great value to the consumer and i think that s evidenced by the fact that our revenue growth is well balanced between unit volumes and aurs not every percentage increase in aurs is driven by pricing mix is also making a difference jim duffy great and just one more if i may are you feeling any more or less confident in the promotional environment as you look to the back to school season and holiday season harmit singh yeah no the brands good news that chip said the brand is very strong strongest as it s been and dockers and beyond yoga strong brands too from that perspective we did in quarter two i mean our gross margin did include about 100 basis points of incentive units you like to sell every unit at full price but we did sell incentive units regard a similar cadence built into the second half as we think about back to school we think our product offers and our marketing offers will drive our consumers to our product and we ll be thoughtful about promotional levels we re not going to be uncompetitive but we ll be thoughtful as we think about back to school and the holiday season which would be upon us this prime day also around the corner so we ve been very thoughtful of that but overall given the strength of the brand the fact that we are looking at promotion levels with ai and machine learning and other tools i think we ll be okay jim duffy thank you very much harmit singh thank you operator our next question comes from brooke roach of goldman sachs your line is open brooke roach good afternoon and thank you so much for taking our question can you talk to the trends that you re seeing in your business in europe especially in the context of the choppy macro environment what are you seeing there now that gives you confidence to raise your underlying ex fx and ex russia guide for the region for the year thank you harmit singh hi brooke the brand is strong one could argue pre pandemic the brand was strongest in europe and the execution was probably the best they continue to leverage both the strength of the brand as well as execution and driving strong performance couple of things one in europe we have wholesale retailers do commit they have a pre book process pre booked in the second half is in the high single digits which is good news so that gives us some confidence as well as great execution i think that balances the consumer sentiment and other stocks that we d be seeing with the fact the economies are opening tourism is in with a big bang in europe i think other things that give us a little bit of confidence besides the strength of brand execution and the wonderful team there brooke roach great thanks so much i ll pass it on chip bergh thanks brooke operator thank you our next question comes from robert drbul of guggenheim securities your line is open robert drbul hey guys just i have two questions the first one can you talk a little bit about just the wholesale channel inventory levels that are out in the market just sort of where you think your brands are and where sort of the category is generally and then chip you re usually pretty good with some of the trends i was wondering if long jean shorts appear to be trending and i m just curious if you re seeing that within your business harmit singh okay your second question gets smiles across the room bob i could tell you that to your first question the way we look at so we don t look at trade inventory as a subject of discussion between our sales team and commercial teams and our wholesale customers wherever we have line of sight we look at trade inventory relative to 19 or 21 depending on where we can and measured in months and so far bob i can speak to the us we ve seen trade inventory largely in line with 19 levels talking about 19 i just wanted to make a point for everybody here if you look at inventory growth in quarter two we talked about i talked about 29 over 21 but 21 is a very difficult comparison because of the supply chain issues the way we look at it is okay how do what is inventory levels relative to 19 and inventory to 19 is up 24 if we take in the early receipts our lead times have increased and we re trying to ensure that we don t dissatisfy our consumers that s about 10 is that of that 24 early receipts and then beyond yoga and the talent acquisition another 3 percentage points so if you back that out inventory growth of 11 is broadly in line with our expectation of growth rate in the second half relative to 19 chip the question about long shorts point chip bergh bob if that s what you re wearing that is clearly what the trend must be robert drbul no not tonight but i was thinking about it harmit singh okay chip bergh thank you bob harmit singh next question please operator thank you our next question comes from dana telsey at the telsey group please go ahead dana telsey good afternoon and nice to see the progress two things as you re thinking about the supply chain it looks like the supply chain costs were higher in the second quarter than in the first quarter how are you planning for the balance of the year going into the back half of the fiscal year and then the wholesale strength is impressive unpacking the wholesale strength looking at price door growth units how does it differ by region and what is your outlook thank you harmit singh dana hi to your question on supply chain costs i mean i think if you think about costs in quarter two air freight was higher were 80 basis points higher it is a combination of two things one very low air freight in quarter two of last year and this year we were getting our product just the seasonal product to make sure that we were able to satisfy demand our expectation on air freight is that it begins to taper down supply chain issues are getting better that we re not going to be out of the wood this year hopefully next year it s getting better the other costs are commodity costs commodity costs in the second half are higher than the first half as the cotton was and we re offsetting that with higher aur driven by pricing and mix to your question about wholesale trends it is difficult to again go around the world again i think the fact that the brand s strong red tab is really strong the trends tailwinds that chip talked about casualization and as people get back to the office is a more casual environment i think definitely helps us and i talked about pre book in europe which is a good indicator so i think that s how we look at it chip bergh dana the only other thing i would add on the wholesale thing is us wholesale we talked about this before dana we put a lot of work into just remapping re building our footprint kind of over so our focus on premiumizing our wholesale footprint has paid off in big ways and the target expansion has paid off in big ways getting incremental floor space in key customers like kohl s and macy s over the last two years or so it s also played an important role so we re seeing that play out and put that together with the strength of the brand and the brand shows up better in their stores we re going to sell more of levi s and that s where our focus has been dana telsey thank you harmit singh thank you dana operator at this time i d like to turn the floor back over to the company for any closing remarks chip bergh all right i want to thank everyone for dialing in and wish you all a happy and healthy summer and look forward to talking with you at the end of our third quarter thank you all very much operator thank you this concludes today s conference call please disconnect your lines at this time

cnn britain s conservatives just did what america s republicans never dared to do they toppled a wrecking ball right wing populist leader who reeled from one self created scandal to another and who was accused of flagrantly breaking the law abusing power and building his political career on an edifice of lies after weeks of clinging desperately to office boris johnson finally resigned as the ruling conservative party s leader thursday after a rebellion by his own lawmakers the party will elect a new leader who according to the customs of britain s parliamentary system will become prime minister america s republican party however never turned on donald trump in the same way despite his far more ruinous offenses against democracy than johnson s it s not that republicans didn t have the chance the ex president was impeached twice but most gop senators chose not to vote to convict him of high crimes and misdemeanors last year a step that could have barred him from future federal office the contrasting fates of johnson and trump come down to personal factors electoral politics and the idiosyncrasies in the political systems of two nations johnson was long seen as a vote winning machine he was the talismanic figure who won a referendum in 2016 that led to britain s exit from the european union then in a general election in late 2019 he delivered an extraordinary victory for the conservatives capturing post industrial working class heartlands in england and wales that had long been the left wing labour party s power base but johnson was the author of his own demise his appeal ruptured over revelations that he had attended parties in 10 downing street after ordering his country into covid 19 lockdowns that s why the conservatives who have a long record of mutinying against leaders seen as an electoral liability finally pounced a similar fate befell the party s most successful modern leader margaret thatcher in 1990 and her successor john major went on to win a general election government by chaos johnson s orchestration of the brexit shocker after a campaign lambasting the european establishment and inciting a working class revolt was in retrospect seen as an early warning sign of trump s even more stunning victory when he won the presidency on a similar tide of populism a few months later trump and johnson have long been seen as two peas in a pod and not just because of their strong sense of victimhood and refusal to take responsibility for their transgressions on the way out of office both have turbulent romantic histories both rose to power on the force of untamed personalities and have distant acquaintances with the truth both often appeared to prioritize their own goals and craving to satisfy massive political egos over the national interest and both tried to cling to office trump after losing an election and johnson as his party deserted him long after it was obvious they were on the way out still personal comparisons between johnson and the other golden haired rule breaker on this side of the atlantic have generally been overblown even if both weaponized resentment against elites to win power despite his extraordinary success in winning over blue collar voters much as trump did with rust belt blue collar democrats alexander boris de pfeffel johnson is hardly anti establishment exceedingly well read and a talented writer johnson came through britain s pipeline to power from exclusive private school eton and balliol college at oxford university it s unlikely johnson would have survived a lifetime of scrapes were it not for the class deference embedded in british public life and the sense of entitlement his upbringing instilled in him trump in contrast has never moved in high society or felt comfortable in the club the way johnson has the key to his bond with voters who felt themselves left out of the american dream was that he understood what it was to be spurned by elites in his case by manhattan old money that saw him as vulgar but both trump and the man he once called britain trump have shown how a country s political system can melt down when their creed of government by chaos gains uncontrollable momentum no one could credibly argue that britain facing high inflation the aftermath of the covid 19 pandemic and rising industrial unrest has been governed in any sense of the term in recent weeks johnson s personal dramas overwhelmed everything and he s shown personal contempt for the rule of law that same sense of a nation spinning out of control was felt in the us during trump s chaotic leadership during the pandemic in summer 2020 and as he tried to steal power in late 2020 and early 2021 and triggered the us capitol insurrection trump s power over the gop is the key the reason why trump survived and johnson didn t lies in the extraordinary power of the ex president over rank and file republican voters and the fact that a presidential candidate s first job is to lock in support from primary voters johnson lost much of his party while trump has not managed to dictate the midterm election primary season as closely as he would like the ex president is yet to experience a similar revolt most gop lawmakers understand they must effectively support enable and shield trump if they want a future political career because of his magnetic hold over the republican base even now as scary details emerge from a house select committee s investigation into trump s coup attempt in 2021 the ex president remains the favorite for the 2024 republican nomination in republican politics at least trump is still an electoral asset british tory mps however already worried about johnson s splintered reputation among a general election audience feared they would lose their seats if they kept him in power johnson tried to insist on thursday he had a mandate from the british people and condemned the herd of conservative lawmakers who finally ended his career but his complaint didn t hold up because prime ministers are accountable to parliament and are not directly elected by voters in the way that presidents are every four years an early warning sign for trump despite the ex president s enduring strength in his party it s not impossible that johnson s demise is yet again an early warning system for trump johnson only survived this long because his party saw him as its best chance of winning power but when his secret sauce with voters dried up he was vulnerable there are many republican voters who will never desert the ex president but trump s biggest challenge going forward may lie in the possibility that even some republicans who voted for him in the past come to believe that another america first style candidate with more discipline and less personal drama may be more likely to beat the democrats in 2024 this possible scenario is one reason why the political stock of ron desantis has been rising fast though it s unclear whether the florida governor would risk taking on trump in a primary watching the downfall of a truth challenged populist rule breaker with whom he has long identified cannot have been a pleasant experience for the former president as we have seen at westminster when the herd moves it moves and my friends in politics no one is remotely indispensable johnson said on thursday as he announced his resignation as conservative leader if he is to win back the white house in 2024 trump will have to resist a similar political force

after more than four months of russia s aggression against ukraine open source data confirms that the russian armed forces lost at a minimum over 830 tanks and 1 650 different types of armored vehicles destroyed damaged abandoned or captured as well as dozens of combat aircraft and helicopters and many other pieces of military equipment oryxspioenkop com accessed july 6 this data also does not count damaged but survived weapons systems that russian troops were able to haul back to their bases those systems will need a full overhaul before returning to the battlefield another issue russia faces in ukraine is a looming deficit in artillery munitions which will become almost inevitable by the end of 2022 indeed the russian reliance on mass artillery shelling raises questions about the amount of ammunition russia still has in storage or that will need to be replaced all these difficulties will take several years to solve even under favorable economic circumstances on the eve of its re invasion of ukraine launched by president vladimir putin on february 24 2022 the russian armed forces possessed an estimated 3 300 battle tanks 1 900 2 000 of which were modernized or produced in 2011 2021 and no fewer than 16 000 armored vehicles of different types a quarter of which were modernized or produced over that same decade the military balance 2022 before 2011 russia relied mostly on tanks and armored vehicles built in the soviet era and had not invested much into rearmament prior to february 24 the total number of modernized and newly manufactured tanks and armored vehicles stood at 650 mil ru 2017 no more than 160 170 improved t 72b3 b3m tanks entered service annually during 2011 2020 whereas in 2021 the military procured only 34 of these modernized versions of the t 72 tass january 20 2022 in turn 45 50 upgraded t 80bvm tanks were added every year between 2017 and 2021 rostec august 3 2021 annual production of the relatively advanced t 90m tanks was insignificant during this period about ten units and plans to upgrade t 90a tanks built mostly in the first two decades after the breakup of the soviet union to the t 90m version were delayed vedomosti february 13 2020 consequently even a conservative estimate of russian main battle tank losses implies that moscow will need at least four years to replace all of them however there is another often underappreciated problem tank engines the envisioned operational life of the v 84 and v 92 diesel engines used in t 72 tanks and the gtd 1000 gtd 1250 gas turbine engines used in t 80s is usually no more than 1 000 hours before they need a full overhaul this means that most of the russian tanks deployed in ukraine today will need replacement engines by the end of 2022 however for more than a decade tank engine manufacturing in russia has been heavily dependent on imported industrial equipment vpk news july 16 2013 the current western embargo thus makes the prospects for this domestic production highly uncertain the same kinds of issues affect the production and repair of russian armored vehicles by february 24 2022 russia wielded around 900 1 000 combat aircraft and about 400 attack helicopters these numbers included 130 su 30m2 sm 97 su 35 and 124 su 34 fixed wing aircraft as well as 130 ka 52 more than 100 mi 28 and over 60 mi 35 rotorcraft all of which were produced during the 2010s the military balance 2022 based on these figures russia s average annual manufacturing capabilities at this time were apparently limited to 30 35 combat jets and 25 30 combat helicopters for 2021 2027 moscow had planned to purchase 150 new aircraft of all types including 76 su 57 fifth generation fighter jets and at least 20 additional su 34s vedomosti august 11 2021 serial manufacturing of the su 57 s engines will start no earlier than in 2025 however and today russia s most modern jets use engines designed for the previous generation of combat aircraft tass august 9 2021 therefore russia needs to decide between following its original plan or in light of battlefield losses and despite the western embargo trying to revise that plan upward in order to more quickly replace all of its lost and damaged aircraft and helicopters russia could also try to extend its combat air capabilities by using yak 130 training jets as light land attack assets the total number of these planes is above 100 and the russian leadership has investigated the option of sending them into battle since 2019 izvestia april 20 2021 nevertheless at least through the mid 2020s russia s airpower capabilities will be lower than they were before the start of the full scale aggression against ukraine the ukrainian government estimates that the attacking russian forces are firing upward of 60 000 artillery shells per day relying mainly on 122 and 152 millimeter rounds the washington post june 24 2022 the number of these shells russia has in storage is unknown as is its actual manufacturing capacity when it comes to artillery munitions that said open source reporting reveals that russia faced a deficit in artillery shells for the first time in summer 2002 following its cumulative 56 month long campaign in chechnya in december 1994 august 1996 and august 1999 july 2002 nezavisimaya gazeta july 5 2002 that shortfall appeared regardless of a much lower level of artillery use in the north caucasus armeiskiy sbornik no 1 2015 and despite russia s readiness to draw on the large soviet era artillery storage depots packed with ammunition that had exceeded its usable life vpk news november 28 2011 since then russia has tried to restart artillery shell production lines and in 2014 it also began repairing old munitions and repaired at least 570 000 rounds of different types annually mil ru 2017 as a result by early 2022 there may have been at least four million repaired rounds in storage however russia has already likely fired more rounds in ukraine than it repaired over all of the previous seven years and even assuming that the manufacture of new artillery rounds presumably exceeded the number of those repaired that ratio must be several times higher for moscow to be able to avoid worries that its stocks may soon be empty taken together all this means that the kremlin is quickly approaching a point at which it will have to choose between either de escalating its war or else further escalating the conflict with help from other states before russia becomes too weak

located in the american southwest on the continental divide in grants new mexico the bandera volcano lies dormant adjacent to the geological wonder of a subterranean ice cave as it stands today the volcano is a prime example of a cinder cone a collection of loose pyroclastic fragments such as volcanic clinkers volcanic ash or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent advertisement bandera erupted approximately 10 000 years ago very recently geologically speaking spewing lava that created a 23 mile long river the flowing lava formed an air pocket or lava tube which as the lava cooled the tube partially collapsed into a sinkhole and an open faced cave over the past 3 400 years the cave has trapped rainwater through the porous and naturally insulating structure of the lava rock typically lava flows are fractured from the cooling process however in a freak of nature event the bandera ice cave was born because cooler air sinks and warmer air rises natural convection and thanks to the caves unique shape cold air is trapped inside which maintains an average temperature of around 30 31 fahrenheit or 0 5 celsius the lava walls and floor perfectly insulate the cave from the warmer weather outside over the past three millennia the ice has grown to be about 20 feet thick and is tinged with a blue green hue thanks to trapped arctic algae being reflected by the sun whilst thin layers of ice are constantly forming due to rainwater that seeps into the cave and freezes advertisement in addition to the natural beauty of the volcano and ice cave the site has seen human activity for at least the past 1200 years late anasazi and early pueblo people occupied the cave leaving behind a plethora of stone tools pottery shards and many completely intact pottery vessels several anasazi ruins have also been discovered near the volcano around the base of the lava flow whose inhabitants stacked lava rocks to form walls that insulated their shelters the bandara site has been managed by the ice cave family since the early 19th century who first purchased the land in 1915 and used the ice from the cave to cool the beer in a local saloon another site on the volcano is the forest of douglas fir and ponderosa pine trees that grow gnarled and twisted out of the lava tubes some of the oldest trees in the country live here with the oldest being around 700 years old header image credit kerrick james alamy stock photo
trapped in self inflicted folly nigeria is on course to incur n4 trillion or more on petrol subsidy in 2022 the contradiction defies rationality here is a leading producer of crude oil stubbornly bankrupting itself importing and subsidising refined petroleum products the resultant fiscal hole is engendering poverty and social backlash persistently it rightly instigates domestic stakeholders and the international community to recommend outright removal of petrol subsidies to save the economy from collapse if nigeria persists in importing refined petroleum products there is no end in sight to the exorbitant costs of fuels the punch remains steadfast in its long canvassed position that while the subsidy in its present form is decidedly destructive and unsustainable domestic self sufficiency in refining is the only lasting solution to product availability price stability and maximisation of the benefits of crude for the president major general muhammadu buhari retd the dilemma is daunting as renewed pressure to remove the subsidy mounts amid the country s precarious finances he is confronted with taking a decision and no choice is without risk the nigerian national petroleum company reported paying n1 3 trillion subsidy for petrol january to may it says nigeria s average daily consumption is 66 8 million litres it shelled out n210 38billion in january n219 78billion february n245 77billion march n271 59billion april and n327 1billion may an additional n27 23 billion was spent to repair its four comatose refineries as global oil prices spike and the naira slides further against the us the figure is bound to ascend in comparison the 2022 federal budget is n17 12 trillion in the past five years nigeria made an average of 39 billion annually from selling crude oil the central bank of nigeria said back in 2011 the goodluck jonathan government frittered n2 7 trillion on petrol subsidies triggering mass protests in 2012 that forced the government to backpedal on total subsidy removal nigeria s energy crisis is self inflicted at home the subsidy thrives on opacity corruption abandonment of domestic refining and a shutting out of the private sector in the downstream oil and gas sector on the international front russia s war on ukraine has triggered a jump in prices rather than reap a windfall however nigeria s indefensible reliance on importation is damaging its brittle economy the international oil companies have been divesting from nigeria citing weak infrastructure among other reasons the industry is also undermined by vandalism and oil spills of which 4 919 incidents were recorded between 2015 and march 2021 the country lost about 1 billion revenue due to oil theft in the first quarter of 2022 the industry regulator said importing petroleum products is patently irrational nigeria is simply subsidising other economies by this reckless behaviour its four refineries with combined capacity to process 445 000 barrels of crude daily are comatose guzzling funds and being a monopoly forcing the country to rely on imports resultantly the economy is tottering businesses and households groan under the weight of exorbitant fuel prices as the other refined fuels have been deregulated factories are closing job losses are rising tax revenues come short and growth projections estimated at 3 4 per cent by the international monetary fund in 2022 are being reviewed downward next the government is struggling to meet its basic financial obligations due to petrol subsidy payments it borrows to pay salaries and finance capital expenditure including through ways and means printing money the national debt stock rose to n41 2 trillion in first quarter 2022 many sub national governments struggle to pay salaries as oil prices remain high and the naira weak the cost of imports and subsidies are bound to rise too the bretton woods institutions other multilateral agencies state governors and the organised private sector repeatedly and stridently advocate the removal of petrol subsidy curiously they are less insistent on the imperative of immediately selling the loss making refineries and launching an emergency national programme to establish privately owned refineries in record time they should press for a total immediate end to the government s participation in the downstream undoubtedly the current subsidy regime is unsustainable and fraudulent but its removal in isolation without a programme of domestic refining exit of the nnpc from refining and distribution and sale of the state owned refineries is fraught indeed it could trigger a worse economic and social crisis subsidy is a symptom of the disease not the ailment without significant domestic refining exit of the state from the wholesale and retail oil sub sector complete subsidy removal could trigger runaway inflation the accompanying economic impact is better imagined for a country already on tenterhooks wracked by insecurity joblessness discontent and unprecedented division the fallout could easily overwhelm the country the multilateral organisations and the ops should rather strongly impress it upon the government to urgently promote private refineries and immediately sell the state refineries shamefully nigeria is perhaps the only country without adequate domestic refining capacity among the world s major crude oil producers the united states government owns none of the country s 139 refineries but they produced 18 8 per cent of the world s refining output in 2012 says london based consultancy hydrocarbon technology but nigeria s leadership is hooked on state capture it must bite the privatisation bullet its only hope is the 650 000 bpd dangote refinery whose commencement date has been shifted several times certainly domestic refining will firm up the naira the total removal of petrol subsidy will precipitate economic recession it should only be removed in phases accompanied by a vigorous programme to promote private refineries with incentives privatisation and creation of an investment friendly environment thereafter any subsidy if required will go to the local economy an instance effective july 2021 the australian parliament granted 1 8 billion in subsidies to sustain two major refiners viva energy and ampol this was to maintain 1 250 jobs and create 1 750 new construction jobs that is the appropriate way to provide subsidy the nigerian state should also rebuild its security system to checkmate petrol smuggling across the porous borders there is no alternative to domestic self sufficiency in refining that should be the urgent national priority
santa fe state investments are being buffeted by turbulent financial markets as new mexico voters consider whether to divert more money each year toward early childhood education programs a report thursday from the legislature s budget and accountability office shows that the state s four major public pension and permanent funds shrank by about 825 million during the first three months of the year amid a federal interest rate hike the russian invasion of ukraine and a wave of covid 19 infections the losses are a tiny share of the funds 66 3 billion valuation that grew by 40 over the past five years a 19 billion surge a statewide referendum in november will decide whether to increase annual distributions slightly from the state s nearly 26 billion land grant permanent fund that fund is sustained by investment returns along with oil extraction and other natural resource development on state trust lands currently 5 of the fund balance each year goes mainly toward public schools and universities the referendum would increase the rate to 6 25 to provide about an additional 200 million to public education the increased withdrawals would go toward public school funding for at risk students and early childhood education programs advocates for the increase want to expand programs such as pre k child care assistance and voluntary home visits to new parents critics worry the changes undermine the growth and sustainability of trust the referendum would amend to the state s constitution and also requires authorization from congress
