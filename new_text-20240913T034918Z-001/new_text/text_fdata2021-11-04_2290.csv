quarantine rules could last until end of 2022 the hong kong government is choosing to ignore the pleas of the foreign business and financial communities to ease some of the world s strictest covid quarantine restrictions they may remain in place until the end of 2022 this will persuade an increasing number of foreigners to leave the city and foreign companies to move parts of their operations to other asian cities following letters from the american and european chambers of commerce the asia securities industry and financial market association asifma in october sent a letter to financial secretary paul chan calling for a timeline to relax travel restrictions there is a growing sentiment among hong kong s international financial services community that talent people and business operations were leaving the city said asifma which represents 155 of the largest banks asset managers and professional service firms in the city almost three quarters of firms were struggling to attract and retain talent in hong kong it said without a clear and meaningful exit strategy from the current zero case approach hong kong risks losing its vital international status it added a few days later the chief executive gave her response most of the so called group exemptions will be cancelled she said as one of a series of tighter restrictions apparently her priority is to open the border with the mainland and persuade the central government that hong kong is safe in recent months hong kong has succeeded in driving down the number of locally transmitted covid 19 cases to near zero but this is not enough for beijing this means that exemptions to quarantine given to diplomats and executives of international financial institutions when they return to hong kong are likely to be cancelled an executive in a foreign it firm said that satisfying beijing took precedence over the demands of the foreign business community the exit began during the student protests and has continued after the implementation of the national security law and these quarantine rules he said next year beijing hosts the winter olympics and the communist party congress when president xi could receive a third and unlimited term these events take precedence over everything else so the vaccination rules could remain in place here until end 2022 last month six officials in ejin banner city in inner mongolia were fired or disciplined for slow response and ineffective management of covid 31 new cases were detected in the city out of 49 locally transmitted cases in the region it was a reminder if any were needed to all officials in china including hong kong of the penalties for mistakes in handling the pandemic another important date next year is july 1 which marks the 25th anniversary of hong kong s return to china to mark the event the hong kong palace museum will open it is expected to be attended by a senior chinese leader possibly even president xi himself the leader will announce that unlike many countries in the world china has saved its people from covid a measure of its greatness said a western diplomat this means that there cannot be any relaxation of the restrictions at least until then in an article in china daily last week stephen phillips director general of invest hong kong said that there was no factual evidence of an exodus of foreign companies the number of overseas and mainland companies has increased by 10 per cent since 2017 to a record 9 049 in 2021 the mainland ranked first with 2 080 companies followed by japan with 1 388 the u s with 1 267 and the u k with 667 he said the it executive said that international firms would keep their hk china headquarters here but some had moved asia pacific base to singapore tokyo and other cities with the current restrictions how can a manager supervise his factories and offices in different countries out of hong kong he said the freezing of accounts last december by hsbc of former legislator ted hui and his family had alarmed foreigners it seems that even his account in britain was frozen so even your money outside hong kong is not safe i know companies which had moved their money out of hsbc in response hsbc said that it had no alternative but to follow an instruction from the police according to its legal obligations contact us at

in _depletion and abundance_ i write about the difficulty of committing to a lifestyle change in a world where you always seem to have more time where defining events are always on the horizon but never present i use the phrase time to pick up your hat which i take from a short story by robert heinlein as a way of thinking both about how difficult it is to change and how necessary on the one hand the story is a typical 1950s nuclear era tale of apocalypse in it the main character a bartender is dealing drinks when two scientists walk into his bar both are terribly terribly worried about nuclear war and have reason to be they spend the afternoon exploring all the risks and dangers and the bartender previously unaware of how urgent the situation was listens in horrified fascination finally as the afternoon winds up the bartender tells the men that if they really believed what they were saying they would get out of the city since it is a likely target he argues that they can t be serious about it because the aggregate of the evidence they are presenting demands that they pick up their hats and get out but they argue they have reasons to stay and they can t know with absolute certainty the bartender listening to them makes up his mind that they are right he hands them the keys to the bar picks up his hat and gets as far out of the city as he can at the last moment with the building behind him he hesitates realizing that he s made no plans prepared nothing and turns around to call a family member and tell them he is coming home only of course since this is fiction to see the mushroom cloud going up in front of him what interests me about this story isn t the mushroom cloud at the end but the thought process at the center of the story the ways in which we often disregard the implications of our own thinking the difficulty we have with abandoning old assumptions even if we know our way of life can t go on even if we know that we re headed for a fall i think most of us like to think it won t come that soon it won t be that bad we ll have time for the things we want and need i find myself thinking of this in response to john michael greer s two latest posts on the process of our economic crisis in endgame his post from last week greer usually wary of calling the end of things always anti apocalyptic makes his most apocalyptic seeming of prognostications that we don t have much time what this means if i m right is that we may have just moved into the endgame of america s losing battle with the consequences of its own history for many years now people in the peak oil scene and the wider community of those concerned about the future to be sure have had or thought they had the luxury of ample time to make plans and take action every so often books would be written and speeches made claiming that something had to be done right away while there was still time but most people took that as the rhetorical flourish it usually was and went on with their lives in the confident expectation that the crisis was still a long ways off we may no longer have that option if i read the signs correctly america has finally reached the point where its economy is so deep into overshoot that catabolic collapse is beginning in earnest if so a great many of the things most of us in this country have treated as permanent fixtures are likely to go away over the years immediately before us as the united states transforms itself into a third world country the changes involved won t be sudden and it seems unlikely that most of them will get much play in the domestic mass media a decade from now let s say when half the american workforce has no steady work decaying suburbs have mutated into squalid shantytowns and domestic insurgencies flare across the south and the mountain west those who still have access to cable television will no doubt be able to watch talking heads explain how we re all better off than we were in 2000 those of my readers who haven t already been beggared by the unraveling of what s left of the economy and have some hope of keeping a roof over their heads for the foreseeable future might be well advised to stock their pantries clear their debts and get to know their neighbors if they haven t taken these sensible steps already those of my readers who haven t taken the time already to learn a practical skill or two well enough that others might be willing to pay or barter for the results had better get a move on those of my readers who want to see some part of the heritage of the present saved for the future finally may want to do something practical about that and soon i may be wrong and to be frank i hope that i m wrong but it looks increasingly to me as though we re in for a very rough time in the very near future now greer and i often disagree although the substance of our disagreements tends to be pretty fine that is i think we agree on more than we disagree upon in this case i m inclined to disagree with his prognostication that we re headed for hyper inflation i agree that quantitative easing is occurring i agree that we re headed as greer argues in his next essay for life as a third world country i ve been writing about our future as ordinary human poverty for years and i think that s the most likely expression of both energy depletion and climate change that we get seriously unpleasantly poor i suspect this will most immediately be via a rapidly increasing deflation not hyper inflation but the endgame as greer puts it isn t all that different for ordinary people do i agree we re on the cusp of a big downleg i wouldn t be surprised i m not sure i d state it quite as firmly as greer but all the economic signs i can see suggest that there s an ill wind blowing and it is picking up i hope those of my readers who haven t done what they can to basically make themselves secure will feel a new sense of urgency and do so the problem with the heinlein story or any other moment in time is that life is rarely convenient every disaster has people saying well that wasn t all that bad and people who will gladly tell you just how bitterly awful it was even in historical senses the start dates for many events are in dispute what i agree with greer about is this if you are still assuming that our collective crisis will wait until you are finished with school have paid off the mortgage are ready to move etc that s a bad idea all your plans should include a what if something unpleasant occurred now assumption we all have differing abilities to make our lives secure but what we can do build up a basic reserve of food work with other people be aware of those in need around us get out of debt plant a garden those things are always a good idea anyway the time and energy you expend on them will not be wasted even if you could have left your hat hanging a bit longer sharon
hong kong october 31 ani amid national security concerns the us revoked china telecom s licence to counter possible infiltration of its key networks by chinese companies the decision was made by the us federal communications commission fcc and it comes at an important time shortly after us president joe biden and his chinese counterpart xi jinping vowed to rebuild communication channels after years of rising tensions it is clear that even the current administration is not helping china anymore reported the hk post according to the fcc china telecom is subject to control influence and exploitation by the chinese communist party ccp government and it is highly likely that it will be forced to comply with the chinese government s illegal requests to acquire data this could be a huge security concern for the us with china s 2017 national security law in place us actions can only be said to be justified reported the hk post this law was passed on june 27 2017 and it came into effect the very next day on june 28 2017 it gives the communist party of china sweeping powers to control and mine data from companies under its purview most of which have an international presence the regulator further said that ownership and control of the said entity by the chinese government raises significant national security and law enforcement risks by providing opportunities for the company and the chinese government to access store disrupt or even misroute us communications continuing to give china telecom access to usa s market would be equal to inviting espionage china is known to steal trade secrets and other confidential business information reported the hk post in fact the fcc also added that china telecom america s conduct with it and other us government agencies also demonstrated a lack of trustworthiness and reliability even the department of justice had said that china telecom made inaccurate statements about where us records were stored reported the hk post with its licence revoked china telecom has 60 days to discontinue its us services this news alone was enough to send us listed chinese tech stocks to go down sharply china telecom america s spokesperson responded by saying that fcc s decision was disappointing and that it would pursue all available options china telecom is known to provide services to chinese government facilities in the us the fcc had warned previously that it may shut down us operations of three state controlled chinese telecommunications companies based on the risks assessed and raised by us security agencies the firms in question were china telecom americas china unicom americas pacific networks corp and its wholly owned subsidiary comnet usa llc just two months back a senator from the philippines accused china telecom of espionage china telecom had recently bought shares in dito telco which according to the senator was undertaken deliberately to conduct espionage within the country reported the hk post last year the fcc designated huawei technologies and zte corp as national security threats to communications networks a declaration that stopped us firms from tapping into a usd 8 3 billion government fund to purchase equipment from these companies ani
britain s foreign secretary liz truss left and united nations framework convention on climate change mexican politician patricia espinosa greet ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky centre as they arrive to attend the cop26 un climate change conference in glasgow on monday afp photo glasgow focus at the cop26 summit turned on wednesday to how the world will pay for its ambitions to quit fossil fuels and help vulnerable nations survive climate change as campaigners expressed scepticism over promises of billions from financiers and governments after a world leaders summit yielded a landmark deal slashing methane emissions negotiators are now tasked with keeping alive the paris agreement goal of limiting warming to 1 5ºc but a simmering diplomatic spat between the united states china and russia over their climate action ambitions showed the fragile nature of talks aimed at averting disastrous global heating with funding crucial for turning climate pledges into reality a financial coalition representing trillions in private capital made net zero pledges on wednesday cop26 president alok sharma said there was big momentum from the private sector but he acknowledged that governments of wealthy nations failed to honour a key pledge to help poorer nations green their energy grids and respond to increasingly extreme drought and flooding he told the conference it was regrettable that the decade old vow to provide 100 billion annually had not been delivered by 2020 as promised and would likely not be met until 2023 delays in the funding have reopened tensions between vulnerable nations often the least responsible for emissions and polluting richer countries climate finance in 2021 is as volatile as the strengthening storms that rip through the fabric of our economy year in year out fiji s economy minister aiyaz sayed khaiyum told the conference adding it was still unclear in what form the money would come in how many years until we wake up and realise that we have built a system that actually destroys the planet by design he said slamming continuing subsidies for fossil fuels net zero but former bank of england governor mark carney told the conference the global financial system has been transformed to deliver net zero with billionaire businessman michael bloomberg he is spearheading an initiative by a group of 450 banks insurers and pension funds with 130 trillion in assets to help countries achieve carbon neutrality carney said the glasgow financial alliance would help the world reach net zero emissions by 2050 at the latest us treasury secretary janet yellen told the conference mobilising private capital was essential no amount of public financing alone will be sufficient to meet the demands of the climate crisis she warned but campaign groups reacted with scepticism pointing out that funds involved were still investing heavily in oil and gas the commitments they have made are so full of loopholes that there is plenty of space for some of the worst financiers of the worst polluters on the planet said kenneth haar of the corporate europe observatory long way to go and on the streets of glasgow extinction rebellion and other activists responded to the cop26 finance themed day with a protest against greenwashing there s been too many words not enough action said one protester janet dressed in a hard hat and high visibility jacket emblazoned with the slogan build back greener delegations will spend the coming days thrashing out details of the paris agreement rulebook including rules governing carbon markets and a unified stock take on emissions cutting plans although organisers say they want cop26 to keep the 1 5ºc heating limit within reach the un says the most up to date climate pledges put earth on course to warm 2 7ºc british prime minister boris johnson told parliament on wednesday that negotiations have a long way to go whether we can summon the collective wisdom and will to save ourselves from an avoidable disaster still hangs in the balance he said destroy consensus on tuesday leaders committed to lower their emissions of methane a potent greenhouse gas by at least 30 per cent this decade experts said the pledge could have a significant impact on short term heating but a two day world leaders summit ended with barbed comments from the two largest emitters the united states and china us president joe biden criticised counterpart xi jinping for skipping the summit after china declined to sign the methane pledge it just is a gigantic issue and they walked away biden said before leaving glasgow he said the same was true of russian president vladimir putin who is also missing the talks but china and russia pushed back on that assessment and in a sign the acrimony could sour negotiations china s special climate envoy xie zhenhua told reporters late tuesday he did not support shifting the temperature warming goal to 1 5ºc from a less ambitious paris cap of well below 2ºc if we are to only focus on 1 5ºc it means we are destroying this consensus between all parties xie said

will now turn the call over to tim crew tim timothy c crew chief executive officer thanks robert and good afternoon everyone thank you for joining the call we have a couple of items of news to report today in addition to issuing our fiscal 2022 first quarter financial results we also announced a substantial restructuring and cost reduction plan i ll discuss both matters in turn overall first quarter results were on track our top line and bottom line were respectively above and at our expectations largely due to solid sales of several key products our gross margin however was lower than anticipated primarily due to growing competitive pressures on our base portfolio turning to our balance sheet our cash position increased to more than 105 million as of september 30 2021 up from approximately 93 million at june 30 2021 we continue to emphasize the importance of our cash position as we believe it affords a strategic flexibility in how we run our business maintaining adequate cash levels to support our operational needs the launch of our durable product pipeline remains a key focus meanwhile as often mentioned across the industry we are operating in a particularly competitive environment especially for oral generics the market generally and some of our products such as probenecid esomeprazole levothyroxine tablets and chlorpromazine specifically have been deteriorating more quickly than the declines we had anticipated this environment certainly reverses our pivot toward expanding our portfolio to include more durable assets such as the three respiratory and two insulin products in our pipeline however we do not expect the current competitive environment to abate in the near term while we are disappointed in the accelerating declines we are taking actions to address the current competitive environment first we have revised down our fiscal 2022 guidance and second while preserving our core portfolio strategies we are taking immediate and proactive steps to make lannett a leaner and more focused organization so with that let s turn to the restructuring and cost reduction plan we announced earlier today again our plan retains our core strategies while further optimizing our operations improving efficiencies and reducing costs the plan will be implemented in phases and we expect we will be completed in about 18 months key elements of the plan include first consolidating our manufacturing footprint from two facilities to 1 this includes transferring liquid drug production to our main plant in seymour indiana from our facility in carmel new york and closing the carmel plant once relevant products are transferred and pursuing its sale we are already in active discussions with several potential parties our seymour plant will be strengthened in this process by increasing the technologies it supports and expanded its portfolio with smaller volume but decent margin liquid products thus further optimizing our overall network the second element of the restructuring plan involves the r d function this includes reducing headcount and eliminating development formerly dedicated to the carmel site and discontinuing future development programs targeting liquid generic medications as we no longer see adequately scaled returns in that sector we will also raise product threshold requirements and start internally developed products and api selection earlier the goal of which is to focus on fewer potentially larger market opportunity products and come to market as part of the so called first wave of generics we will continue to be a targeted generic manufacturer focused on attractive select internal development areas where we believe we can successfully compete but we will scale those investments to what the business can support today and continue to augment our pipeline with durable partnered assets like generic advair and insulin and the third element of the restructuring plan is further rationalizing over time as we have in the past certain lower margin products this particular exercise primarily involves scaling back or phasing out some low margin and low volume otc products that were made at carmel and two very low margin prescription products ultimately the plan is expected to result in a workforce reduction of approximately 11 from current levels another 3 or so of the workforce mainly at the plant we expect not to replace as attrition occurs other existing vacancies will also not be filled in total we anticipate cost savings approximately 20 million annually so now let s turn to our pipeline while we tend to focus on the potentially transformational value of our durable pipeline there are a number of interesting pipeline assets that could be launched before the end of next fiscal year including subflooring sulfate oral solution sumatriptan and flutamide and our business development team is hard at work to secure more we currently have approximately 12 andas pending at the fda including partner products plus three additional products that are approved and pending launch we also have more than 20 products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts with regard to our large durable partnered product pipeline i ll provide an update on two of the 5 starting with our generic advair diskus product the fda provided mid cycle disciplined review comments on the pending anda and we are working to address the fda s helpful comments and intend to respond to as many of the agency s request as possible before the fda due dates we expect to receive additional comments from the fda on the fda assigned goal date of january 31 2022 as previously disclosed we expect the product to undergo more than one review cycle we believe and we re planning for a launch that is possible next fiscal year i d note the application approval is also contingent on a successful fda inspection of the overseas facilities involved the cro site that conducted the bioequivalence and clinical studies has already been inspected by the fda and the observations they shared we believe are addressable given inspection backlogs due to covid 19 we appreciate the parent priority fda has assigned to these inspections we have formally asked the fda to schedule an inspection of the manufacturing site and look forward to their visit in the near future regarding our biosimilar insulin glargine product we remain on track for submitting the investigational new drug ind application next month and commencing the pivotal trial around march 2022 while there are always execution risks we expect to launch this product in fiscal year 2024 in terms of our expectations for next year s clinical trial we are not aware of a u s trial failure of a well characterized biosimilar and at this point we believe our product is well characterized and highly similar based on the results of our structural and functional assays those assays have been early reviewed by the fda we are also seeing positive trends in formulary decisions for 2022 demonstrating payers continued effort to pursue affordable insulin express scripts has added viatris biosimilar and interchangeable insulin glargine semglee as a preferred product for 2022 on one of their formularies in addition florida illinois and texas have included walmart s relion insulin as a preferred product on their 2022 state medicaid formularies we will continue to monitor how payers adopt biosimilar and interchangeable insulins as we develop our go to market plans all five of the durable products in our pipeline are differentiated from the average oral generic product that are under the aforementioned industry pressures because of the significant technical expertise required for development and the substantial and largely dedicated plant investments needed to manufacture them so for all of these products we expect only a handful of competitors and thus more durable value also as noted on the last call we are evaluating and in negotiations for additional market and product opportunities for insulin and drug device inhalation products there continues to be additional multibillion dollar markets to pursue in these areas with both current and future partners when combined with our targeted internal development efforts we believe we have built and continue to expand an exciting pipeline of opportunities one brief comment on legal matters we have earlier reached a settlement agreement with genus lifesciences related to our numbrino product while the terms of the settlement are confidential the various court challenges levied by genus related to the product and our right to market it have all been dismissed to sum up today s remarks we have reported better than expected top line for the quarter we have revised down our fiscal 2022 guidance to reflect the increasingly competitive environment for a base oral generics portfolio however our cash levels remain substantial our core strategies remain in place and we have begun implementing restructuring plans to become a leaner more focused organization the plan is expected to be completed in approximately 18 months and generate annual cost savings of approximately 20 million our pending generic advair diskus anda continues to make its way through the fda review process we expect to submit an ind application for biosimilar insulin glargine next month and commenced the pivotal trial around march of 2022 we anticipate both these and our other durable assets can contribute significantly to our future sales and one final comment we appreciate the frustrations our investors may have over the pressures we are now forecasting in our near term results we are keenly aware of our current stock and bond valuations however our optimism on future expectations remains quite high our durable pipeline of exciting opportunities are steadily progressing and we believe we have the capabilities discipline and resources to get them to market over the next few years with that in mind our management and our board will continue to carefully consider various options looking to enhance investor value across the near immediate and longer term with all of that i ll turn the call over to john john john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer thanks tim and good afternoon everyone i ll begin with our financial results on a non gaap adjusted basis for the 2022 first quarter net sales were 101 5 million compared with 126 5 million for the first quarter of last year gross profit was 20 6 million or 20 of net sales compared with 34 4 million or 27 of net sales for the prior year first quarter interest expense increased to 12 8 million from 11 2 million net loss was 10 6 million or 0 27 per share versus net income of 2 2 million or 0 06 per diluted share adjusted ebitda was 10 0 million turning to our balance sheet at september 30 2021 cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately 105 million up from 93 million at june 30 cash increased during the first quarter due to a few factors first as a result of our refinancing earlier this year we did not have any required debt interest or principal payments in q1 the second relates to timing of certain inflows and outflows of cash and the third was the receipt of a prescription drug fee refund looking ahead we expect to receive additional income tax refunds continue to benefit from initiatives to improve our working capital and we have no mandatory principal payments on our debt until maturity accordingly we expect to maintain a healthy cash position of 80 million plus through the end of fiscal 2022 as for our liquidity we also have access to our 45 million credit facility which to date we have not drawn upon turning to our revised guidance for fiscal 2022 we now expect net sales in the range of 370 million to 400 million down from 400 million to 440 million adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 19 to 21 down from approximately 23 to 25 adjusted r d expense in the range of 25 million to 28 million down from 26 million to 29 million adjusted sg a expense ranging from 55 million to 58 million down from 58 million to 61 million adjusted interest expense of approximately 52 million unchanged the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 22 to 23 up from 21 to 22 adjusted ebitda in the range of 22 million to 32 million down from 40 million to 55 million and lastly capital expenditures to be approximately 10 million to 14 million down from 12 million to 18 million regarding the phasing of the quarters we expect net sales and adjusted ebitda in q2 to be lower than q1 ramping up slightly in the second half of fiscal 2022 with q4 net sales and adjusted ebitda to approximate q1 this reflects the new product launches we ve previously discussed combined with the initial benefits from the cost restructuring gross margin to decline slightly in q2 and q3 from q1 we expect q4 gross margin to be higher than q1 as the restructuring plan begins to take effect and r d expected to increase from q1 and sg a to decrease from q1 with that overview we would now like to address any questions you may have operator questions and answers operator we have a question from scott henry from roth capital scott henry roth capital analyst just a couple of questions first i think you might have hit on this a little bit but obviously there was some revenue upside in q1 and some downside the rest of the year can you talk about what products drove the upside and where the weakness is coming from going forward john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer hi scott this is john so the upside for the quarter was the strength in infectious diseases specifically posaconazole we had talked about that category coming down in q1 and we saw it relatively even actually ticking up a little bit and that is still though being forecast to come down now in q2 significantly and hold that for the remainder of the year so that was the majority of the difference scott henry roth capital analyst okay and then the downside the rest of the year john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer again the downside rest of the year would be the posaconazole competition and infectious disease is coming down again significantly but across the categories we re still seeing strong competition which are bringing down each category down by a bit you re seeing that in antipsychosis which came down to a little below 4 million which is a continuous decline from q4 other also came down a little bit some of that was around probenecid which was discussed a little bit earlier and numbrino is still seeing sales that are less than what we were what we would call a more normalized number which is and it s running about a little bit less than half of that scott henry roth capital analyst okay and then contract manufacturing not that particularly relevant but we do have to model it way down should we expect that to stay down are you prioritizing away from that john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer again it s not a matter of prioritization and there s some ebbs and flows in there it s the run rate may come up a little bit with some increases toward the back end of the year timothy c crew chief executive officer i would note scott it s tim here that toward the end of last year one of our contract manufacturing opportunities concluded and that was part of the step down we still are open for business and appreciate those sort of opportunities but they re smaller this year than last year scott henry roth capital analyst okay and then if i could shift to the pipeline you talked about the advair diskus fda meeting we know that it was going to take multiple cycles but that specific meeting if you can can you characterize whether it went about as planned did it go better than expected or worse than expected just so we can get a sense of how it s moving along relative to expectations john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer all right just to be clear it wasn t an fda meeting we noted in the script that there was disciplined review letters that come back from the various parts of the fda that reviewed those applications there is quite a few comments that come from a file of this complexity and we have been working on those responses i don t think there was too much in those disciplined reviews that were surprising to us we believe we can respond to most of them shortly some of them take a bit longer and thus will reappear in a in what we call the crl complete response letter that we d expect in january all in all i think we are where we want to be and need to continue to work with the fda including the overseas inspection of the facility to get this product into next fiscal year scott henry roth capital analyst okay and question on thalidomide i haven t heard about that in a little while where exactly does that r d program stand currently john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer so scott we have earlier disclosed that but for an api we believe we are in an approvable state there has been some progression at that suppliers situation in their facility suggesting that they will have resolution of the fda concern with the api and therefore we noted in our script that this product could come back into our forecasting for next fiscal year scott henry roth capital analyst okay and then just a final question the ebitda guidance certainly down for the rest of the year particularly if i pull out the stronger first quarter that ebitda number is pretty significantly below the interest expense number even if not cash interest expense what are your thoughts on that in terms of kind of bridging that gap and is there any risk to any covenants i know you re sitting on a lot of cash but sometimes the debt covenants can be cumbersome anything anywhere that you would comment on john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer well scott we ll start with the debt covenants as part of our refinancing from last year the financial covenants was removed it s not included in our new agreements so that s not a concern provide us the flexibility that we needed and to bridge for this year there s one large item that s included in our overall cash flow expectations that s the significant tax refund that we re expecting to receive sometime in the third quarter that s currently on our balance sheet for a little bit more than 30 million that helps bridge some of the cash flows with the declining ebitda timothy c crew chief executive officer scott just to add as john noted in the script we are forecasting a cash balance in excess of 80 million at the end of this fiscal year and of course the restructuring itself will start improving our cash flows as it comes into full effect later this year operator our next question comes from elliot wilbur from raymond james tim smith raymond james analyst this is tim smith calling on behalf of elliott wilbur and i d like to ask a few questions first are you facing any potential delays to reaching target gross margin above 30 within your previous target within the next three to five years john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer so the gross margin that we have talked about toward the end of our strategic plan in 2025 are clearly driven by the emergence into our in line from our current pipeline the bespoke and larger durable assets to the extent those products are successfully launched their in market margins are quite a bit higher than 30s but we of course have were expected to be higher well higher than the 30s but we of course have margin sharing agreements with those partners which brings it back down into that sort of range so while the pressures on our near term portfolio are being reflected in our near term results most of those products would have had lower margin and significantly lower margins by the time we launch so our overall expectations for 2025 have not changed a great deal from last quarter it s the near term results that we re facing those pressures and we remain optimistic about our pipeline in the out years tim smith raymond james analyst okay great also can you please talk about the trends in base generics erosion both volume and price and how does that trend in this most recent quarter john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer so the market as we ve said has been competitive we clearly don t talk to pricing specifically on any sort of public forum or private when outside of our own company but the competitive environment is fundamentally reflecting more supply out there and not a lot of new generics and both of those trends has been putting the pressures into the to our results and i think you re seeing those same comments across most of the industry for the generic portfolios that are being discussed in the quarterly results operator and now i would like to hand the call back to management for final remarks timothy c crew chief executive officer all right it s tim again thanks again for joining the call and thanks to our employees customers and partners still working hard in challenging times to provide high quality low cost medicines for our patients we look forward to sharing our progress on our next call and some of you perhaps at the upcoming investor conferences which we ll be at this quarter and into next have a good night operator duration 29 minutes call participants robert jaffe principal and senior vice president timothy c crew chief executive officer

steven donziger an american attorney who waged a legal battle to fight chevron s pollution in ecuador was sentenced for contempt of court oct 1 the lawsuit against donziger was riddled with flaws its conditions were excessive and arbitrary to such an extent that the un human rights council condemned it and the process was mired in alleged corruption but what the donziger case most represents is that the u s federal court system is broken corrupt and in desperate need of reform the legal trials and tribulations of donziger began in 2014 four years after he won a 9 5 billion judgement against chevron for polluting the amazon when he was sued in american courts for alleged ethical impropriety chevron had no real grounds to sue donziger leaked chevron documents have proved that the company explicitly sought to demonize him instead chevron took advantage of how america s court system effectively allows a wealthy party to bury another in a complex lawsuit until they run out of money to fight it it s a concept called slapp or a strategic lawsuit against public participation and the sole goal is to harass critics into silence even though the u s court system does have in place penalties for meritless lawsuits getting to the actual point where a lawsuit is deemed meritless takes time often years meaning that defending oneself against them will take millions of dollars in legal fees and in most of these cases one is ineligible for a public defender so they will be paying out of pocket for their legal defense these are completely permissible in federal court because our legal system doesn t have the infrastructure in place to protect victims of slapp lawsuits for donziger things were much worse than a retaliatory lawsuit the judge presiding over his case lewis a kaplan of the southern district of new york held investments in funds with large chevron holdings in other words the judge in donziger s case had financial ties to the company seeking to prosecute donziger while you d imagine that such a conflict of interest would disqualify a judge from sitting in on a case they re actually extremely common in federal court a recent wall street journal investigation found that since 2010 over 130 federal judges have violated laws or ethical rules by hearing cases involving companies in which they or their family owned stock of the 685 affected court cases about two thirds of the rulings favored the companies that they had ties to such conflicts of interest undermine confidence in a judge s ability to fairly preside over a trial yet are encouraged by a lack of monitoring and transparency of judge s financial disclosure forms as well as the common practice of federal judges earning supplemental incomes these conflicts of interest played an even greater role in donziger s case first judge kaplan permitted testimony at trial against donziger by an ecuadorian official who had accepted money from chevron and would eventually admit to lying in a blatant conflict of interest second when donziger refused to hand over phone records during the trial kaplan ordered donziger be tried separately for failing to comply with the court the federal government refused to intervene so kaplan took the abnormal step of picking a judge and a private law firm to try the new case against donziger rather than picking randomly both the private law firm and the judge had direct and indirect financial ties to chevron demonstrating further conflicts of interest that should not be permissible in any fair system of justice all of these details the retaliatory lawsuits and the conflicts of interests ought to be repugnant to anyone who believes that every citizen no matter what they are alleged to have done deserves a free and fair trial the fact that what has happened to donziger was not an isolated incident but rather a high profile demonstration of systemic failures within the federal judiciary making it clear that our federal court system is an institution in urgent need of reform and there are plenty of potential reforms to adopt changing where judges can be nominated from imposing term limits on the life long terms circuit and appellate court judges serve expanding ethical requirements and creating a body to enforce the ethical rules already on the books this doesn t have to be a partisan issue either both republicans and democrats will benefit from a court that is fairer and less corrupted by dark money in fact the only groups who should be afraid of increased ethics in the federal judiciary will be the monied interests that have benefited from the corruption of the status quo ultimately this column merely skims the surface at what s wrong with our federal judiciary it ignores issues involving the appointment of blatantly unqualified judges a profound lack of diversity among judges and an overall lack of resources that impedes americans right to a speedy trial or access to a trial by jury but we have the chance to right these wrongs the justice system may have failed mr donziger but we still have the opportunity to fix it and we must in order to continue to ensure that our system of federal courts provide liberty and justice for all matt heller is an opinion columnist for the cavalier daily he can be reached at opinion cavalierdaily com

will now turn the call over to tim crew tim timothy c crew chief executive officer thanks robert and good afternoon everyone thank you for joining the call we have a couple of items of news to report today in addition to issuing our fiscal 2022 first quarter financial results we also announced a substantial restructuring and cost reduction plan i ll discuss both matters in turn overall first quarter results were on track our top line and bottom line were respectively above and at our expectations largely due to solid sales of several key products our gross margin however was lower than anticipated primarily due to growing competitive pressures on our base portfolio turning to our balance sheet our cash position increased to more than 105 million as of september 30 2021 up from approximately 93 million at june 30 2021 we continue to emphasize the importance of our cash position as we believe it affords a strategic flexibility in how we run our business maintaining adequate cash levels to support our operational needs the launch of our durable product pipeline remains a key focus meanwhile as often mentioned across the industry we are operating in a particularly competitive environment especially for oral generics the market generally and some of our products such as probenecid esomeprazole levothyroxine tablets and chlorpromazine specifically have been deteriorating more quickly than the declines we had anticipated this environment certainly reverses our pivot toward expanding our portfolio to include more durable assets such as the three respiratory and two insulin products in our pipeline however we do not expect the current competitive environment to abate in the near term while we are disappointed in the accelerating declines we are taking actions to address the current competitive environment first we have revised down our fiscal 2022 guidance and second while preserving our core portfolio strategies we are taking immediate and proactive steps to make lannett a leaner and more focused organization so with that let s turn to the restructuring and cost reduction plan we announced earlier today again our plan retains our core strategies while further optimizing our operations improving efficiencies and reducing costs the plan will be implemented in phases and we expect we will be completed in about 18 months key elements of the plan include first consolidating our manufacturing footprint from two facilities to 1 this includes transferring liquid drug production to our main plant in seymour indiana from our facility in carmel new york and closing the carmel plant once relevant products are transferred and pursuing its sale we are already in active discussions with several potential parties our seymour plant will be strengthened in this process by increasing the technologies it supports and expanded its portfolio with smaller volume but decent margin liquid products thus further optimizing our overall network the second element of the restructuring plan involves the r d function this includes reducing headcount and eliminating development formerly dedicated to the carmel site and discontinuing future development programs targeting liquid generic medications as we no longer see adequately scaled returns in that sector we will also raise product threshold requirements and start internally developed products and api selection earlier the goal of which is to focus on fewer potentially larger market opportunity products and come to market as part of the so called first wave of generics we will continue to be a targeted generic manufacturer focused on attractive select internal development areas where we believe we can successfully compete but we will scale those investments to what the business can support today and continue to augment our pipeline with durable partnered assets like generic advair and insulin and the third element of the restructuring plan is further rationalizing over time as we have in the past certain lower margin products this particular exercise primarily involves scaling back or phasing out some low margin and low volume otc products that were made at carmel and two very low margin prescription products ultimately the plan is expected to result in a workforce reduction of approximately 11 from current levels another 3 or so of the workforce mainly at the plant we expect not to replace as attrition occurs other existing vacancies will also not be filled in total we anticipate cost savings approximately 20 million annually so now let s turn to our pipeline while we tend to focus on the potentially transformational value of our durable pipeline there are a number of interesting pipeline assets that could be launched before the end of next fiscal year including subflooring sulfate oral solution sumatriptan and flutamide and our business development team is hard at work to secure more we currently have approximately 12 andas pending at the fda including partner products plus three additional products that are approved and pending launch we also have more than 20 products in development and expect to add more from both external and internal efforts with regard to our large durable partnered product pipeline i ll provide an update on two of the 5 starting with our generic advair diskus product the fda provided mid cycle disciplined review comments on the pending anda and we are working to address the fda s helpful comments and intend to respond to as many of the agency s request as possible before the fda due dates we expect to receive additional comments from the fda on the fda assigned goal date of january 31 2022 as previously disclosed we expect the product to undergo more than one review cycle we believe and we re planning for a launch that is possible next fiscal year i d note the application approval is also contingent on a successful fda inspection of the overseas facilities involved the cro site that conducted the bioequivalence and clinical studies has already been inspected by the fda and the observations they shared we believe are addressable given inspection backlogs due to covid 19 we appreciate the parent priority fda has assigned to these inspections we have formally asked the fda to schedule an inspection of the manufacturing site and look forward to their visit in the near future regarding our biosimilar insulin glargine product we remain on track for submitting the investigational new drug ind application next month and commencing the pivotal trial around march 2022 while there are always execution risks we expect to launch this product in fiscal year 2024 in terms of our expectations for next year s clinical trial we are not aware of a u s trial failure of a well characterized biosimilar and at this point we believe our product is well characterized and highly similar based on the results of our structural and functional assays those assays have been early reviewed by the fda we are also seeing positive trends in formulary decisions for 2022 demonstrating payers continued effort to pursue affordable insulin express scripts has added viatris biosimilar and interchangeable insulin glargine semglee as a preferred product for 2022 on one of their formularies in addition florida illinois and texas have included walmart s relion insulin as a preferred product on their 2022 state medicaid formularies we will continue to monitor how payers adopt biosimilar and interchangeable insulins as we develop our go to market plans all five of the durable products in our pipeline are differentiated from the average oral generic product that are under the aforementioned industry pressures because of the significant technical expertise required for development and the substantial and largely dedicated plant investments needed to manufacture them so for all of these products we expect only a handful of competitors and thus more durable value also as noted on the last call we are evaluating and in negotiations for additional market and product opportunities for insulin and drug device inhalation products there continues to be additional multibillion dollar markets to pursue in these areas with both current and future partners when combined with our targeted internal development efforts we believe we have built and continue to expand an exciting pipeline of opportunities one brief comment on legal matters we have earlier reached a settlement agreement with genus lifesciences related to our numbrino product while the terms of the settlement are confidential the various court challenges levied by genus related to the product and our right to market it have all been dismissed to sum up today s remarks we have reported better than expected top line for the quarter we have revised down our fiscal 2022 guidance to reflect the increasingly competitive environment for a base oral generics portfolio however our cash levels remain substantial our core strategies remain in place and we have begun implementing restructuring plans to become a leaner more focused organization the plan is expected to be completed in approximately 18 months and generate annual cost savings of approximately 20 million our pending generic advair diskus anda continues to make its way through the fda review process we expect to submit an ind application for biosimilar insulin glargine next month and commenced the pivotal trial around march of 2022 we anticipate both these and our other durable assets can contribute significantly to our future sales and one final comment we appreciate the frustrations our investors may have over the pressures we are now forecasting in our near term results we are keenly aware of our current stock and bond valuations however our optimism on future expectations remains quite high our durable pipeline of exciting opportunities are steadily progressing and we believe we have the capabilities discipline and resources to get them to market over the next few years with that in mind our management and our board will continue to carefully consider various options looking to enhance investor value across the near immediate and longer term with all of that i ll turn the call over to john john john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer thanks tim and good afternoon everyone i ll begin with our financial results on a non gaap adjusted basis for the 2022 first quarter net sales were 101 5 million compared with 126 5 million for the first quarter of last year gross profit was 20 6 million or 20 of net sales compared with 34 4 million or 27 of net sales for the prior year first quarter interest expense increased to 12 8 million from 11 2 million net loss was 10 6 million or 0 27 per share versus net income of 2 2 million or 0 06 per diluted share adjusted ebitda was 10 0 million turning to our balance sheet at september 30 2021 cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately 105 million up from 93 million at june 30 cash increased during the first quarter due to a few factors first as a result of our refinancing earlier this year we did not have any required debt interest or principal payments in q1 the second relates to timing of certain inflows and outflows of cash and the third was the receipt of a prescription drug fee refund looking ahead we expect to receive additional income tax refunds continue to benefit from initiatives to improve our working capital and we have no mandatory principal payments on our debt until maturity accordingly we expect to maintain a healthy cash position of 80 million plus through the end of fiscal 2022 as for our liquidity we also have access to our 45 million credit facility which to date we have not drawn upon turning to our revised guidance for fiscal 2022 we now expect net sales in the range of 370 million to 400 million down from 400 million to 440 million adjusted gross margin as a percentage of net sales of approximately 19 to 21 down from approximately 23 to 25 adjusted r d expense in the range of 25 million to 28 million down from 26 million to 29 million adjusted sg a expense ranging from 55 million to 58 million down from 58 million to 61 million adjusted interest expense of approximately 52 million unchanged the full year adjusted effective tax rate in the range of 22 to 23 up from 21 to 22 adjusted ebitda in the range of 22 million to 32 million down from 40 million to 55 million and lastly capital expenditures to be approximately 10 million to 14 million down from 12 million to 18 million regarding the phasing of the quarters we expect net sales and adjusted ebitda in q2 to be lower than q1 ramping up slightly in the second half of fiscal 2022 with q4 net sales and adjusted ebitda to approximate q1 this reflects the new product launches we ve previously discussed combined with the initial benefits from the cost restructuring gross margin to decline slightly in q2 and q3 from q1 we expect q4 gross margin to be higher than q1 as the restructuring plan begins to take effect and r d expected to increase from q1 and sg a to decrease from q1 with that overview we would now like to address any questions you may have operator questions and answers operator we have a question from scott henry from roth capital scott henry roth capital analyst just a couple of questions first i think you might have hit on this a little bit but obviously there was some revenue upside in q1 and some downside the rest of the year can you talk about what products drove the upside and where the weakness is coming from going forward john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer hi scott this is john so the upside for the quarter was the strength in infectious diseases specifically posaconazole we had talked about that category coming down in q1 and we saw it relatively even actually ticking up a little bit and that is still though being forecast to come down now in q2 significantly and hold that for the remainder of the year so that was the majority of the difference scott henry roth capital analyst okay and then the downside the rest of the year john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer again the downside rest of the year would be the posaconazole competition and infectious disease is coming down again significantly but across the categories we re still seeing strong competition which are bringing down each category down by a bit you re seeing that in antipsychosis which came down to a little below 4 million which is a continuous decline from q4 other also came down a little bit some of that was around probenecid which was discussed a little bit earlier and numbrino is still seeing sales that are less than what we were what we would call a more normalized number which is and it s running about a little bit less than half of that scott henry roth capital analyst okay and then contract manufacturing not that particularly relevant but we do have to model it way down should we expect that to stay down are you prioritizing away from that john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer again it s not a matter of prioritization and there s some ebbs and flows in there it s the run rate may come up a little bit with some increases toward the back end of the year timothy c crew chief executive officer i would note scott it s tim here that toward the end of last year one of our contract manufacturing opportunities concluded and that was part of the step down we still are open for business and appreciate those sort of opportunities but they re smaller this year than last year scott henry roth capital analyst okay and then if i could shift to the pipeline you talked about the advair diskus fda meeting we know that it was going to take multiple cycles but that specific meeting if you can can you characterize whether it went about as planned did it go better than expected or worse than expected just so we can get a sense of how it s moving along relative to expectations john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer all right just to be clear it wasn t an fda meeting we noted in the script that there was disciplined review letters that come back from the various parts of the fda that reviewed those applications there is quite a few comments that come from a file of this complexity and we have been working on those responses i don t think there was too much in those disciplined reviews that were surprising to us we believe we can respond to most of them shortly some of them take a bit longer and thus will reappear in a in what we call the crl complete response letter that we d expect in january all in all i think we are where we want to be and need to continue to work with the fda including the overseas inspection of the facility to get this product into next fiscal year scott henry roth capital analyst okay and question on thalidomide i haven t heard about that in a little while where exactly does that r d program stand currently john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer so scott we have earlier disclosed that but for an api we believe we are in an approvable state there has been some progression at that suppliers situation in their facility suggesting that they will have resolution of the fda concern with the api and therefore we noted in our script that this product could come back into our forecasting for next fiscal year scott henry roth capital analyst okay and then just a final question the ebitda guidance certainly down for the rest of the year particularly if i pull out the stronger first quarter that ebitda number is pretty significantly below the interest expense number even if not cash interest expense what are your thoughts on that in terms of kind of bridging that gap and is there any risk to any covenants i know you re sitting on a lot of cash but sometimes the debt covenants can be cumbersome anything anywhere that you would comment on john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer well scott we ll start with the debt covenants as part of our refinancing from last year the financial covenants was removed it s not included in our new agreements so that s not a concern provide us the flexibility that we needed and to bridge for this year there s one large item that s included in our overall cash flow expectations that s the significant tax refund that we re expecting to receive sometime in the third quarter that s currently on our balance sheet for a little bit more than 30 million that helps bridge some of the cash flows with the declining ebitda timothy c crew chief executive officer scott just to add as john noted in the script we are forecasting a cash balance in excess of 80 million at the end of this fiscal year and of course the restructuring itself will start improving our cash flows as it comes into full effect later this year operator our next question comes from elliot wilbur from raymond james tim smith raymond james analyst this is tim smith calling on behalf of elliott wilbur and i d like to ask a few questions first are you facing any potential delays to reaching target gross margin above 30 within your previous target within the next three to five years john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer so the gross margin that we have talked about toward the end of our strategic plan in 2025 are clearly driven by the emergence into our in line from our current pipeline the bespoke and larger durable assets to the extent those products are successfully launched their in market margins are quite a bit higher than 30s but we of course have were expected to be higher well higher than the 30s but we of course have margin sharing agreements with those partners which brings it back down into that sort of range so while the pressures on our near term portfolio are being reflected in our near term results most of those products would have had lower margin and significantly lower margins by the time we launch so our overall expectations for 2025 have not changed a great deal from last quarter it s the near term results that we re facing those pressures and we remain optimistic about our pipeline in the out years tim smith raymond james analyst okay great also can you please talk about the trends in base generics erosion both volume and price and how does that trend in this most recent quarter john kozlowski vice president of finance and chief financial officer so the market as we ve said has been competitive we clearly don t talk to pricing specifically on any sort of public forum or private when outside of our own company but the competitive environment is fundamentally reflecting more supply out there and not a lot of new generics and both of those trends has been putting the pressures into the to our results and i think you re seeing those same comments across most of the industry for the generic portfolios that are being discussed in the quarterly results operator and now i would like to hand the call back to management for final remarks timothy c crew chief executive officer all right it s tim again thanks again for joining the call and thanks to our employees customers and partners still working hard in challenging times to provide high quality low cost medicines for our patients we look forward to sharing our progress on our next call and some of you perhaps at the upcoming investor conferences which we ll be at this quarter and into next have a good night operator duration 29 minutes call participants robert jaffe principal and senior vice president timothy c crew chief executive officer

double digits building upon significant gains achieved last year additionally gross margin expanded 440 basis points reflecting increases across all three of our luxury houses operating margin of 18 5 was significantly above our expectation as a result earnings per share of 1 53 was better than anticipated looking at group revenue trends by geography revenue growth continued to exceed our expectations in the americas and would have been even stronger if not for inventory constraints consumer demand for our brands was healthy and benefited from an increase in social gatherings in emea revenue trends were also above our expectations with growth across all houses we saw a strong momentum driven by robust domestic consumer demand as stores in the region reopened and vaccination rates increased significantly in asia revenue was flat due to covid 19 related restrictions in japan southeast asia and australia as well as an increase in covid cases in china which resulted in new travel and other regional restrictions however revenue in mainland china increased during the quarter even with greater restrictions now turning to second quarter performance by brand starting with versace results significantly exceeded our expectations once again revenue increased 45 demonstrating the strength of the brand and the success of our strategic growth plan at the core of these strategies is the bold and fearless design vision of donatella versace vision is based on versace iconic italian heritage and unapologetic glamour versace has created three very powerful iconic pillars with virtus la medusa and the launch of our new la greca signature pattern in september la greca is donatella s modern interpretation of versace classic greek key motif which gene first introduced in 1988 the signature pattern illustrates versace s rich history and the brand s ability to draw from the past to create innovative designs for the future la greca is off to a very strong start and is reflected across all product categories including accessories footwear ready to wear and jewelry we continue to believe the signature pattern will accelerate the trajectory of versace s revenue growth as our third iconic pillar women s accessories continued to perform well as retail sales increased strong double digits with our three iconic pillars we are confident in our ability to position versace as a leading luxury leather house we are making significant progress in our goal to expand accessories revenue to 1 billion over time looking at footwear we are gaining authority as a women s footwear brand and have begun to build out our core offerings focused on our iconic codes in the second quarter women s footwear sales at retail increased double digits additionally we saw strength in men s and women s ready to wear with retail sales up double digits versace s bold and fearless designs were positively received by consumers and we saw an especially strong response to the new la greca

and consumer engagement versace s fall campaign featured global superstar dua lipa as she introduced the new la greca collection the pop icon the versace brand with her impeccable style fearless attitude and universal appeal dua lipa has over 125 million followers on her social media accounts additionally versace generated widespread acclaim and media coverage during milan fashion week first

significant revenue and increase brand awareness for both fendi and versace as a result versace was the top engaged italian fashion brand on social media during milan fashion week during the quarter versace continued to adone the world s most famous celebrities the axialite presence at the met gala it was extensive with donatello dressing celebrities including lil nas x stephen curry maluma and channing tatum these powerful initiatives among others help to drive a 26 increase year over year and versace s global database overall versace s second quarter results speak to the strength of the

have the key building blocks in place to realize the full potential of this amazing brand and our more optimistic than ever about versace s future moving to jimmy choo results were ahead of our

jimmy choo inherent glamor confidence and bearing attitude we are successfully translating these brand codes into the foundation of jimmy choo s key product strategies focused on expanding the

which is based on timeless fashion and just glamor looking at michael kors key product strategies we are focused on three growth pillars first capitalizing on signature second growing mkgo our active collection and third expanding our men s business we believe both mkgo and men s represent incremental revenue opportunities that will bring new customers to the brand now let me discuss the continued progress we have been making with our initiatives first signature is a core growth strategy and we plan to increase this classification to 50 across all product categories signature has become an important foundation and driving force behind revenue growth in every region globally as we have been building out the signature classification it has been generating a higher aurs and gross margin expansion in the quarter overall signature presented 39 of the assortment compared to 32 last year and drove sales across all categories in accessories signature penetration was even greater

the newest launch of mkgo has exceeded our expectations across all product categories for the fall the mkgo line features our signature mk print with parts of orange and logo taping we are attracting

is a true product extension not cannibalizing our existing businesses looking at men s second quarter retail sales increased double digits globally as we focus on timeless essentials with a modern edge accessory sales were strong driven by signature we continue to believe that men s represents an increment billion dollar revenue opportunity now turning to brand awareness and consumer engagement

chief financial and chief operating officer thank you john and good morning everyone starting with second quarter results revenue of 1 3 billion increased 17 versus prior year exceeding our expectation performance was driven by better than anticipated results across all three of our luxury houses michael kors revenue growth would have been even stronger if not for inventory constraint which were driven by greater than anticipated supply chain delays and extended factory closures net income was 235 million resulting in diluted earnings per share of 1 53 this was above our expectation better than anticipated revenue gross margin and operating margin as well as a lower tax rate looking at revenue by channel total company retail sales increased approximately 20 these results were driven by robust e commerce and store sales both of which increased double digits wholesale also grew but at a lower rate by geography revenue remained strong and above our expectation in the americas and emea increasing 20 and 25 respectively versus prior year in asia revenue was approximately flat with the continued restrictions in japan southeast asia and as well as new travel and other regional restrictions in china however revenue in mainland and china increased during the quarter even with the greater restriction turning to revenue performance by brand versace revenue was 282 million a 45 increase to prior year and above our expectations global sales in our retail channel increased over 30 with strong double digit increases in both e commerce and store sales by geography total revenue in the americas increased approximately 80 revenue in emea increased approximately 50 and revenue in asia increased 4 versace ended september with a global luxury fleet of 211 retail stores a net increase of 5 from prior year for jimmy choo revenue was 137 million a 12 increase to prior year and above our expectations global sales in our retail channel increased over 20 with double digit increases in both e commerce and store sales by geography total revenue in the americas increased 20 revenue in emea increased 15 and revenue in asia was approximately flat jimmy choo ended the quarter with a global fleet of 237 retail stores a net increase of 10 from prior year at michael kors total revenue was 881 million an 11 increase to last year and above our expectations revenue growth would have been even greater if we had more product available to meet consumer demand we estimate inventory constraints at a mid single digit impact on michael kors second quarter growth rate global sales in our retail channel increased in the mid teens with double digit increases in both e commerce and store sales wholesale revenue also increased over prior year but at a lower rate by geography total michael kors revenue in the americas increased 13 and revenue in emea increased 16 revenue in asia decreased 3 reflecting the more extensive regional restrictions michael kors ended the quarter with a global fleet of 823 retail stores a net decrease of 5 from prior year now looking at total company margin performance gross margin expanded 440 basis points to 67 6 390 basis points above our expectations we were pleased to achieve gross margin expansion across all three of our luxury houses this improvement primarily reflected increased full price sell throughs and select price increases at jimmy choo and michael kors operating expense as a percent of revenue was 49 1 compared to 46 8 last year on an absolute basis operating expense increased approximately 23 or 119 million versus prior year this increase primarily reflected higher variable expenses reinvestments in our business and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as lapping prior year covid related savings total company operating margin of 18 5 was 550 basis points above our expectations primarily driven by better than expected gross margin expansion as well as expense leverage on higher than anticipated revenue all brand operating margins exceeded our expectations at versace operating margin expanded 920 basis points to 19 5 at jimmy choo operating margin was 0 7 and then michael kors operating margin was 25 our tax rate for the quarter was 3 7 compared to 20 last year the lower rate primarily reflected a discrete item associated with the covid related tax change in italy as a result we were able to release a portion of our deferred tax liabilities in the country now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow we ended the quarter with cash of 234 million and debt of 1 1 billion resulting in net debt of approximately 900 million total liquidity at the end of the quarter was 1 3 billion during the quarter we repaid approximately 200 million of debt as well as repurchased approximately 100 million of shares additionally our board has authorized a new 1 billion share repurchase program this demonstrates the strength of our free cash flow generation and balance sheet providing additional capacity to return cash to shareholders over the longer term looking at inventory we ended the quarter with 866 million down 7 compared to prior year this is lower than we had expected giving greater than anticipated supply chain delays and extended factory closures which constrained our ability to deliver higher revenue compared to our initial expectations transit times increase even more during the quarter in addition factory closures in vietnam extended significantly longer than anticipated further impacting our inventory position well factories have reopened and it will take some time before they return to full capacity going forward we expect to build inventory to support sales growth over the remainder of the year now turning to guidance looking at the full year fiscal 2022 we are pleased to be raising guidance based on the underlying strength of our business this updated guidance incorporates the greater than expected industry wide supply chain challenges including factory closures and extended transportation delays these headwinds constrained revenue growth in the second quarter and are expected to continue for the near future in addition to delays we now expect the supply chain situation to result in nearly 200 basis points of higher expenses relative to our prior forecast in the back half of the year however the success of our strategic initiatives is currently offsetting these headwinds therefore enabling us to raise our revenue margin and earnings outlook for fiscal 22 we now forecast capri holdings of approximately 5 4 billion above our prior guidance of approximately 5 3 billion reflecting the better than anticipated second quarter performance as well as an increase in our 3rd quarter outlook full year our guidance assumes versace revenue of approximately 1 06 billion jimmy choo revenue of approximately 575 million and michael kors revenue of approximately 3 765 billion for the year we now expect approximately 250 basis points of gross margin expansion this reflects greater than anticipate benefits from our ongoing strategic initiatives including stronger full price sell throughs and select price increases which more than offset the higher than previously expected supply chain costs as well as the removal of remaining gsp savings given the delay in approval of gsp we have removed it from our fiscal 2022 forecast turning to operating expenses we ve continued to forecast operating expenses of approximately 2 6 billion as a result we now expect the full year operating margin of approximately 18 above our prior guidance of 16 for versace we now anticipate an operating margin in the mid teens range for jimmy choo we now expect a slightly negative operating margin and for michael kors we continue to anticipate an operating margin in the mid 20 range turning to our expectations around certain non operating items we now anticipate net interest income of approximately 10 million an effective tax rate of approximately 17 and weighted average shares outstanding of 154 million as a result we now expect to generate diluted earnings per share of approximately 5 30 for fiscal 22 turning to our 3rd quarter guidance we anticipate total company revenue of approximately 1 46 billion we forecast versace revenue of approximately 235 million jimmy choo revenue of approximately 145 million and michael kors revenue of approximately 1 08 billion we now anticipate our 3rd quarter operating margin will be approximately 20 this reflects gross margin expansion with the benefits of our ongoing strategic initiatives more than offsetting approximately 200 basis points of higher supply chain costs relative to our prior forecast in the quarter operating margin also includes incremental investments in marketing e commerce and regional growth initiatives to support revenue growth for versace we anticipate an operating margin in the low double digit range as a reminder versace reports on a one month lag and the 3rd quarter does not include december the single most profitable month in the year for jimmy choo we expect an operating margin in the negative mid single digit range and for michael kors we anticipate an operating margin in the high 20 range turning to our expectations around certain non operating items we forecast net interest income of approximately 4 million an effective tax rate of approximately 14 and weighted average shares outstanding of 154 million as a result we expect diluted earnings per share of approximately a 1 65 in conclusion we are pleased with our second quarter results and the strong momentum of the business particularly in the phase of greater supply chain challenges this performance reflects the strength of our fashion luxury houses in the execution of our strategic initiatives as the world emerges from the pandemic we remain confident that our three brands versace jimmy choo and michael kors positions capri holdings to achieve meaningful long term revenue and earnings growth now we will open up the line for questions questions and answers operator thank you our first question comes from the line of kimberly greenberger with morgan stanley please proceed with your question kimberly greenberger morgan stanley okay great thank you so much congratulations on the great momentum in your business and obviously as you indicated john and tom the inventory constraints particularly at the michael kors brand presented i think even greater sales momentum i m wondering if you can just talk to us about the ability to get back in stock and when do you think you ll have an opportunity to get sort of into an inventory position at the michael kors brand that you feel is a really good inventory in stock position and any worries or concerns as we head into the holiday season about any particular categories or areas where you feel like you wish you had a little bit more inventory john d idol chairman and chief executive officer good morning kimberly and thank you for joining us in that question i m going to apologize to everyone on this call unfortunately there is some construction going on on the floor above us so we re going to have a little bit of a covid situation where we can t control some hammering i apologize as it relates to inventory are divided into two i ll talk about kind of the current situation holiday and then i ll let tom take on the longer term perspective first off we are extremely pleased with how our results turned out for the quarter across all three of the luxury houses and obviously in particular versace was really extraordinary and we continue to believe that the strategic initiatives that we put in place at versace jimmy choo and michael kors if you recall when the pandemic broke one of the first things we said is we weren t going to change what are our strategic initiatives were in fact we were going to continue to really focus on those as our guiding lights so i think that s proving to be a smart decision on our part and our executive teams around the world and i want to applaud them because they are all really implementing the great results that we re having as it relates to inventory the biggest inventory issue is at michael kors and it is global because the supply chain issue is one that is quite challenging predominantly with shipping product around the globe so it is not just a north america issue it s impacting us in all regions of the world and let s just first start with the timing piece of that that has clearly added somewhere between 45 and 60 days onto our deliveries on a global basis sometimes a little bit more than that and then of course we had the issue with vietnam shutting down which we did not anticipate in our planning which we couldn t have and that has reopened it s going to take time for these factories to reach full capacity and then get back into a cadence that will really feel our supply chain needs so i would say that we go into the 3rd fiscal 3rd quarter calendar 4th quarter with lighter inventory than we would have liked to have had and that being said you can see by our forecasts we ve raised our guidance and what we re seeing is we re just selling through the products that we have the customer demand is absolutely outpacing what our inventory is one of the if you can call it saving and i talked about this last two calls is we took a position some time ago to reduce our promotional cadence regardless of what our competitors are doing around us and stuck to that and eurs were higher and our conversions are higher and all of that is turning into higher revenues at higher gross margins which is flowing right through to the bottom line so i think we feel that we will meet our expectations for the holiday season i would say the consumer is quite strong not just in north america but in europe and even in asia in asia the bigger issue is just that kind of the starts with covid that are continuing to happen in that region although it does seem to be in japan which is one of our largest regions in asia starting to kind of mitigate itself and hopefully we ll see a more normalized return over the balance of this quarter and certainly into our fourth quarter and so we re encouraged by what we think will begin to happen in asia as we ve seen in america and in emea so as it relates to holiday we will not be in the inventory position that we would have wanted to be in that being said we do have inventory that we believe is going to really generate the revenues that we forecasted and meet the consumer demand that we re going to be able to service given the inventory levels we have additionally we ve flown merchandise here knowing that there was a delay as i said between 45 and 60 days and so we ve got inventory here in the right places in the right holiday gifting categories in particular so i think we feel good about that and of course versace and jimmy choo have been less affected by this for a variety of reasons so we feel that we re in a very good inventory position with both of those brands so we re looking forward to a very robust holiday season really with the backdrop of the consumer is healthy that the consumer is out and engaging in social activities and we think that they re going to be looking forward to really strong gift giving and enjoying parties with their families let me now turn it over to tom to talk about that a little bit longer term question as it relates to supply chain tom edwards chief financial and chief operating officer sure so as we look at the longer term kimberly we do expect these delays to continue into fiscal 2023 we don t believe very short term issue but longer term we do believe the situation will begin to normalize in the meantime we are working on a number of initiatives and john mentioned some around holiday and hearing some product over but also other initiatives to help mitigate the situation in terms of how and where we produce ocean shipping methods and strategic contracting with our carriers as we look at the rest of this year we do expect to be building inventory for michael kors and the group overall as we work through this situation so we don t believe the factories will continue to be the immediate issue they have reopened and are building capacity but we do believe the extended delays will continue turning the prepared remarks this is a 200 basis point impact versus our prior expectations in the back half and it s really the power of our three brands that is allowing us to offset this so it s great consumer desire and we have the continued ability to offset these costs with pricing increases john d idol chairman and chief executive officer yes on the last note kimberly as you know we started to raise prices about two years ago in particular in michael kors and just recently started at jimmy choo and that was something we were doing regardless of the supply chain situation so we ve been able to mitigate cost just because that was a strategy that we had and i ve said in previous calls we re going to continue to do that michael kors is going to become more expensive and we think that s the right positioning for our brand and that will be a strategy regardless of whether there was a supply chain issue or not okay thank you very much kimberly kimberly greenberger morgan stanley thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ike boruchow with wells fargo please proceed with your question ike boruchow wells fargo hey john and tom congrats and josh if you are there welcome i guess john it s a good question to ask but i think four months ago you gave us some building blocks for next year i believe it was 5 9 billion and a 16 5 margin you re already well above that the 16 5 on a much lower base of revenue so i know you re probably not going to want to get into specifics on next year but can you kind of walk us through how do we think about the business from here or should there be a step down in margin or are you kind of creating a new base for the overall business as you guys continue to outperform john d idol chairman and chief executive officer good morning and thanks for the question ike i think it s too early for us to really be talking about our fiscal 2023 projections obviously we are exceeding our 2022 projections and forecasts which gives us obviously again a real foundation to continue to build upon where we are today i think the one area we feel comfortable in talking about we ve said it on previous calls is we do believe our gross margins will expand approximately 100 over what tom gave for our annual guidance so we feel confident in saying that that is the objective that this company feels that we will achieve again i just think it s early to be talking about where we will land in revenues and even more importantly operating margin because as i said in the last two calls we re going to continue to invest in particular in marketing and other initiatives in the company which will drive revenues and if we drive revenues and we have substantial operating process that will drive eps and we think that in particular versace and jimmy choo have a long long way to go in terms of their growth so we don t want to under fund those businesses and then additionally michael kors clearly the consumer is engaging with our brand when you look at the database growth of 21 it s really showing that we are attracting a new customer a younger customer and we are engaging with existing large customers at a rate that we ve never seen before so we want to invest with michael kors as well so i think again it s a little early for us to be discussing that but clearly we are doing better than we had we think that that bodes well for a setup for our fiscal 2023 thank you ike thanks i m sorry i was going to make sure i was clear it was gross margin of 100 basis points increase i apologize i might have said the wrong thing the gross margin 100 basis point increase thank you ike operator thank you our next question comes from the line of omar saad with evercore proceed with your question omar saad evercome thanks good morning i ll add my congratulations to great results maybe you guys could talk a little bit more detail about how the e com and digital business is trying to some of your key priorities there and initiatives and how you expect that to progress as the stores continue to reopen and the role that digital and e commerce play for your brands and then also maybe if you could give us an update on watches i d appreciate it thanks tom edwards chief financial and chief operating officer certainly thank you omar what s been quite interesting is even as we ve opened our stores our e com business continues to grow and it s shown sequential improvement which is really not exactly what we thought would have happened which is exciting and again i think this is just coming from us really building our database and acquiring new consumers who are new to the brand many of those are younger consumers and they re more digitally native that being said we re seeing store traffic sequentially improve it s getting better every single week as people are returning to shopping as a way to have fun and a way to be social as matter of fact josh and i were in roosevelt field shopping mall yesterday at 12 o clock in the afternoon and we couldn t believe how many people were in the mall which is quite exciting to see and i think we feel confident that stores will continue to return as a very important core part of our business and with our digital tactics our marketing tactics our ability to communicate with our existing customers and our large customers i think we feel very strongly that the day that the e commerce business will continue to grow at a very very fast rate and again you ve seen that across all three of our brands and we re absolutely focused on that we believe it s not only a revenue opportunity for the company but we think it s one of the single most important parts of our marketing is how we re communicating to our consumers digitally both of those are consumers we want to acquire as well as consumers that we have with us today as it relates to watches again we re very pleased the watch business continues to grow it s not growing at the same exact rate it was when we saw that huge kind of jump during covid but it s still growing very nicely and we see again many new customers coming into the store they have never owned a michael kors watch before our business has gotten also very strong in our department store channels with watches as well so it s a category that we re pleased is returning to growth john d idol chairman and chief executive officer and in terms of investments in digital and e commerce omar we re making significant investments in digital analytics and expanding our capabilities across our brands company as well and looking at the e commerce platforms also looking at common state of the art platforms and new tools and capabilities across all three of our brands of course this extends into omni where we d spoken about clienteling before and the expansion of versace s omni capabilities for instance so this is a very very key focus area for the company thank you omar omar saad evercome thanks tom thanks john operator thank you our next question comes from the line of oliver chen with cowen company please proceed with your question oliver chen cowen hi the michael kors signature print execution has been very innovative what do you see happening there and as you think about price increases how would you balance offering the consumer strong value against where you see opportunity and i would also love a quick update on versace amends and hand back penetration you ve made a lot of good strides there as well thank you john d idol chairman and chief executive officer thank you oliver as it relates to our price increases at michael kors as i ve said to you our previous calls we were underpriced as it relates to our brand on a global basis so we are rectifying that situation and we may end up being higher than competitors over time because we think that michael kors is led by the demand he s a luxury runway designer we are carried in the finest stores in the world we are located in the finest locations in the world and we think that our brand needs to move more into the luxury space so for us value is created not only just in the price product relationship but also in how the brand is perceived and how we create the brand engagement with consumers so again i think you will continue to see us move in that direction and i ve said that we will raise prices all through the balance of next calendar year and we ll see how the consumer responds to that and if we see good response then we ll carry on with that philosophy on a go forward basis so michael kors is clearly going to continue to move into the luxury category signature as we ve said we want it to be about 50 of the total business inside of the company were on a perfect trajectory to get there that gives us an opportunity to create higher eurs because we take less markdowns in those areas it s reduced the amount of fashion below that we ve had into the stores we still create fashion around signature but it s just not at the same pace that we were doing previously we obviously shrunk the line sizes during covid and that seems to have been no issue as it relates to the consumers desirability for our product and so we see that going on very steadily going forward and then in terms of versace men s obviously it s a huge part of the versace business and in fact the largest part of the versace business when we bought the company i think we ve done an amazing job and i thank the entire team there for their initiatives of course led by donatella we are starting to become a larger women s business than we are a men s business and that s only natural that s where the company should be versus where it was historically in terms of leather goods we are much further along in terms of our development we now have three very strong pillars with la greca virtus and la medusa we did not think that we would be sitting here at this moment in time saying that we have three very strong accessories offerings for the consumer and that they would be responding in the way that they are in fact in some of the cases of versace we also ran low on merchandise and that was just sell out being much quicker than we had anticipated so we think that that really bodes well for our ability over the long term to have versace lead as a leather good house and reach 1 billion of its revenues in leather goods thank you oliver oliver chen cowen best regards operator thank you another question comes from the line of matthew boss with jpmorgan please proceed with your question matthew boss jpmorgan great congrats on a nice print maybe john as we can a potential structural changes post pandemic a couple of things i guess any change you re expecting in the overall growth for term for handbags and accessories do you see any constraints to a full recovery of your travel business over time and then tom if we tried our best to isolate the higher penetration of e commerce which i know is higher margin is there any way to think about this piece alone what you think this structurally adds to the company s margin profile post pandemic john d idol chairman and chief executive officer matt first off and thank you for your compliment under the nice print what is your question about handbag and accessory we couldn t really hear you matthew boss jpmorgan yes so a couple of things that i was focused on is there any change you re expecting for the growth rate of handbags and accessories or the overall term exiting the pandemic and then the second part was is there anything preventing a full recovery in your opinion of the travel business over time john d idol chairman and chief executive officer right ok so in handbags and accessories i think we saw right through the pandemic in particular the luxury goods part of handbag and accessories which i believe all three of our brands are in it has grown i mean that market continues to grow yes there was a small setback when all stores were closed etc but this category continues to be a representation i think for the consumer of their fashion style and the way that they want to express themselves so we saw that that did not really change except during the real hard lockdown periods so we don t is that there is going to be a change in trajectory we think on a global basis again accessories will grow somewhere in the 6 to 7 range change by marketplace so we feel very comfortable with the handbag and accessories luxury market growth and i would add i think we re all surprised at how strong the growth has been in north america and it s not just us all of our competitors european and america have shown those same types of results so really bodes where we think for the future as it relates to travel i would say there s two parts to the answered to that question first there is the tourists coming to markets we are beginning to annualize in the sense that they did not really there was some small return to europe this year where it s a very high penetration there has been no return to japan and korea which were typically higher penetration markets so that in the sense is behind us and we are not forecasting for any type of a strong return in that tourist market we do have some tourists that we believe will be returning to the us market shortly when the borders are open and we think that will be a positive for us so in our forecast we don t see tremendous movement in our trajectory at least in next fiscal year the second answer to that question is as i think i told you previously very substantial business in travel retail that would be airports and duty free shopping etc and again while there has been a very strong resurgence in that business inside of china which was unfortunately slowed during july and august during some of the issues that china faced we also are not forecasting for that business to recover in our fiscal 23 we think that s going to be further out more into our fiscal 24 we would look for a strong recovery in global travel and tourist travel and how that would impact not only our own stores but travel retail and then of course big key department stores in europe where those are substantial businesses for us which will be a very uptick for us in that period of time tom tom edwards chief financial and chief operating officer with regard to the e commerce question matt if you look at history we ve now doubled our e commerce penetration is about 13 pre covid and it s now in the mid 20s expected for this year and as we noted at investor day we expect that to continue to grow into the 30 range as a percent of our retail sales so when we look at it jimmy choo and versace s margins have always been very positive and strong compared to retail stores and e commerce just as a function of their luxury pricing and positioning michael kors has seen really a sea change over this last couple of years as the penetration has increased and revenue has increased e commerce margins have moved to above store level margins and we would this to be one of the supports for our gross margin expansion over time as john mentioned we would expect continued expansion 100 basis points next year and when we look at the components it s continued full price sell throughs building out our accessories businesses that you need to versace growing in asia which is structurally higher margin and of course this e commerce piece so i view it in that context of supporting the overall corporate goal matthew boss jpmorgan thank you both operator thank you our next question comes from the line of paul burroughs with citi please proceed with your question paul burroughs citi hey thanks guys curious if you can talk about that gross margin upside which brands are the largest increase and what were the biggest surprises to you and the drivers of that upside and then just second curious how your wholesale partners are thinking about the spring season from a unit perspective and what you can be able to deliver to them just given the supply chain constraints relative to what they would like to order and are you seeing cancellations given the 45 to 60 day delay thanks guys john d idol chairman and chief executive officer why don t i take the wholesale part first and then i ll turn the gross margin over to tom our wholesale partners around the globe are experiencing very strong sell throughs that date back i d say 7 or 8 years ago so really strong sell throughs and it s been accessories and footwear and women s ready to wear so we cannot get enough merchandise to our partners unfortunately at this moment there has been no cancellations everyone understands what the situation is and basically is taking any of the merchandise as it arrives we did fly as i said earlier most of our seasonal holiday gifting businesses here so anything that was very seasonal oriented we wanted to make sure it was here for the stores because it obviously becomes more obsolete if it s not here during the holiday period of time so we feel good about that we are going to be in a better position in q3 q4 our q4 as an inventory release as tom said you will start to see inventory build so we have kind of tactically mapped out what is happening with this delay and it s really more of a transit delay than anything there was a peace in vietnam but most of this is a transit delay and so we ve got a lot of that put into our projections and i would say that like ourselves our wholesale partners are planning the businesses up we ve had a great we re having a great fall season and therefore people are a bit super optimistic about what is in front of us in particular for next year and again i think that first and foremost comes to incredible product that michael and that donatello and sandra are really putting together with the design teams i think our marketing campaigns have been extraordinary if you look at versace or hailey bieber at jimmy choo at bella hadid at michael kors and look at powerful influencers who are associated with our brands who want to be part of our family and are really helping us communicate that message around the globe and you look at the incredible events that we re doing with all of our brands in china and how our brands are resonating there and the growth opportunity i want to remind everyone on this call we need to double our business in china with all of our brands we are under penetrated by 50 to all of our competitors so we have huge upside for ourselves there so i think the way we look at the situation it s quite optimistic and i believe our partners are looking at it in the same thing tom edwards chief financial and chief operating officer and with regard to the second quarter gross margin all three brands exceeded our expectations all and they exceeded them in a meaningful way so we were really pleased to see every house perform quite well and if you look at the themes across the first and foremost is full price sell through across all businesses is driving great results michael kors and jimmy choo we have the pricing benefit and then versace we re seeing continued traction in accessories that category which is quite important for the future continues to they re doing a great job there john mentioned signature michael kors which also expanded and that s also supporting the full price sell through for that brand so in general all three were well ahead of expectations thank you paul paul burroughs citi thank you guys good luck operator thank you our next question comes from the line of simeon siegel with bmo capital please proceed with your question paul burroughs citi great thanks guys congrats on really on those great results john congrats on the succession planning and honestly all that you ve built here and if you re listening congrats josh looking forward to have in the party i m sure you missed us all john so you as we ve spoken about it on past calls but just curious to hear if you ve any updated views on what you think the industry level promotional cadence will look like into next year and i know we have all the constraints right now but just to kind of echo your thoughts around holding price points if and when others start promoting again i would be curious to hear your view of the broader industry level and then tom if i could just ask any thoughts on the timing of the new share repurchase just given what seems to be achieved valuation and ongoing clear path visibility for you guys thanks a lot john d idol chairman and chief executive officer thank you stephen i appreciate those kind remarks about the company so i mean the promotional i continue to say that is not a topic we spent a lot of time on in this company any longer and maybe that s naive but first off versace and jimmy choo that s not a conversation we are pretty strict around what we do there and as it relates to michael kors we are a substantial part of the michael kors business has done outside of the united states both in europe and in asia again those are not conversations that are really relevant as it relates to north america it is relevant and we ve just made the decision that we re just not going to be as promotional and that means that we want to make more money and we ve shown that we ve shown that we can make more money on lower sales than we did on having higher sales and to chase our own selves or other competitors whichever when you want to call it so we ve made the decision prices are going higher we re going to have less promotional activities and we re going to let the consumer respond to that we re also operating a much lower inventory levels you will see inventories rise over the next two quarters and more of that this is a preview is going to be in some of our core products where if we get them here earlier we don t have to worry about this delay issue and it will substantially reduce our cost over time so we might hold a little more inventory in particular on basic product where we re just running reorder businesses and what that flow through as this supply chain issue kind of works itself out for what we think will be a 6 to 12 month period of time when i say that really starting from january 1st so we think it s going to take most of next year for that to work itself out and we ve got some ideas on how to mitigate those cost some of that will be holding a little higher inventory but really on core replenishment items so in our mind we are going to stick to our guns on what we said and we ve already seen other people starting to promote much more aggressively than we are and that s ok and if they do that s going to be their strategy and we wish them well but we re not going to start to go down that path we know where that leads and that leads to typically lower gross margins and trying to sell too many units and we re trying to chase too much business and that usually is something that long term doesn t the way that you wanted to so our perspective stay focused on the path that we have been going down that we think we ll get rewards from that with the consumer tom edwards chief financial and chief operating officer and with regard to timing of share repurchase i just like put a little context of our overall capital allocation policy and the strength of our balance sheet and free cash flow which is the reason that we put in the new 1 billion share repurchase program as a matter of fact year to date generating free cash flow about 350 million so our first priority remains paying down debt in the quarter we paid down 200 million and we ll continue to do so to further strengthen our balance sheet we do plan to return cash to shareholders in the form of share repurchase we think that s important we now have the broader capacity to do that over the longer term but we ll also be active in the near term and finally luxury acquisitions are the least priority where as things come up for luxury or european acquisitions we will look at these and that would be another use of cash in the future and another reason to strengthen our balance sheet so q2 is a great example of this balance where we paid down 1 million of debt and also repurchased 100 million of shares thank you simeon simeon siegel bmo capital that was it guys thanks a lot congrats again and best of luck for holiday john d idol chairman and chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our final question for today will come from the line of erinn murphy with piper sandler please proceed with your question erinn murphy piper sandler great thank you good morning and thanks for stake in the end my question john is around versace i have a 2 part question first i mean you put your long term margin target for versace just in the first half of this year but if i pencil out the guidance it implies that the back half ebitda margins go down to low teens so just curious what s driving that forecast maybe that s for both you as well as tom and then secondly any update to the search process around jonathan s replacement for versace thank you so much john d idol chairman and chief executive officer i will take that s cap and half i ll take the the johnson piece first off we want to thank jonathan for all of his efforts prior to us acquiring the company he s been an outstanding job trying to really reset the company and then the great thing about us acquiring versace is we clean the house and i think we told you we walked away from 150 million worth of multiple other lines that were in the company just shut them down we have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in refitting rebuilding opening new stores we believe in luxury i told everyone when we bought versace this takes time but if you invest properly and you believe in the future of luxury the returns are really spectacular look at some of our competitors and how those returns have turned out and how the revenues are working over time so i think we ve really positioned versace to be set up for at minimum hitting our 2 billion goals and to hit our long term margin targets and we will absolutely find a new leader it is going to be one of the most sought after positions in the luxury industry so i have no concerns about it will probably take us north of 6 months so we have someone into that role jonathan s with us until march and in the meantime i ll be working closely with jonathan and the management team to continue to achieve our strategic objectives and by the way we have an outstanding management team at versace so i m really proud of the teams that are at versace at jimmy choo and michael kors i think in all three companies we have some of the best executives not only in our corporate offices but in our store locations and just really great people and dedicated and super enthusiastic in terms of the margin targets and i will let tom speak to that but just know we re super pleased gross margins are coming in a little higher than we had anticipated some of that mix between how we re driving the accessories business versus ready to wear and even though it may not have a higher initial markup when you get through the sell through after markdowns etc it s a terrific business and so we re doing better than we had anticipated and as well as our e commerce business is really outstanding at versace so some of those things are really helping us drive the business but we re going to continue to invest we re not going to step back and and think that we have completed our mission our mission is still a long road in front of us to get to 2 billion and you have to spend money to do that and you have to believe in the development of marketing product and retail stores in your e commerce platforms to be able to reach those types of targets so we will continue to invest in versace but let me let tom talk too specifically about the 3rd and 4th quarter tom edwards chief financial and chief operating officer sure when we look at the back half in 3rd and 4th quarter first i just want to point out we expect margin expansion in both q3 and q4 versus prior year so versace is still building and expanding margin and for the year we ve raised our forecast and now expect a mid teens operating margin so as john mentioned we re very pleased with the progress of versace when you look at the quarter just kind of walking through it q3 is a seasonally lower operating margin quarter for versace it does not include december which is the most profitable month of the year for the brand because of our lagged reportings and it s also the lowest absolute sales quarter so we re seeing deleverage for both q3 and q4 we re also increasing our investments in brand growth we re ramping up of stores to be fully open versus the prior year so we have full store cost and we re also lapping some covid related savings that we were able to achieve and garner here on both the payroll and rent so those are some of the puts and takes but really we re still growing versus prior year i m very pleased with that trajectory and pace and in a very pleased with the overall brand position john d idol chairman and chief executive officer thank you very much aaron i d like to thank everyone for joining us today i m sorry we ran over a little bit but hopefully you heard some interesting information about capri holdings and how we intend on continuing our growth trajectory and again very excited about having josh join the team and he will be with us on our next call and we re talking about the continued success of the michael kors brand thank you everyone and have a great day operator duration 79

challenging dynamics for the past 20 months including accelerating inflation supply chain challenges and operational dislocations with extraordinary diligence professionalism resolve and customer focus that are consistent with the high standards we set for ourselves to provide context for our fiscal second quarter performance i ll highlight a few key metrics as compared to the same prior year period which was then our strongest quarter on record we achieved 48 revenue growth of which 15 was organic growth and 33 was inorganic growth from our truaire acquisition ebitda growth was 33 and quarterly earnings per share attributable to cswi rose to 1 14 compared to 1 10 in the prior year period for additional perspective if we compare this quarter s results to this quarter two years ago

minimizing product outages in short our customers rely on us to be dependable partners for their distribution network and we have not disappointed them next i would like to provide an update on our truaire manufacturing operations in vietnam as reported on our august earnings call in response to strict local covid protocols we were required to reduce the number of employees on site through extraordinary accomplishments by approximately 250 team members who lived and worked on site we continued manufacturing key products and kept all of our team members safe vietnam s covid restrictions have relaxed in recent weeks and we now have approximately 1 150 team members working at our facility and are in the process of returning to full production for perspective on average during august and september we shipped nine containers of product per week which compares with 22 containers in the week ended october 29 2021 we anticipate reestablishing full operations or approximately 36 containers per week by the end of november strategic production decisions we made in conjunction with our truaire inventory position in the united states proved sufficient to meet customer demands and as a result no loss of truaire revenue is expected for this fiscal year during the quarter we integrated two of the five truaire distribution centers and now ship both rectorseal and truaire products from our jacksonville florida and santa fe springs california warehouses this co location allows us to fulfill a portion of rectorseal s customer orders from the southeast and the west coast significantly reducing the time between order placement and delivery turning to our stated capital allocation priorities since closing the acquisition of truaire in december of 2020 we repaid 41 million of credit facility borrowings that funded that acquisition during the first six months of this fiscal year we paid 4 7 million in dividends and we have invested capital to implement our enterprise resource planning systems and automation safety and efficiency initiatives through our rigorous risk adjusted returns analysis we will continue evaluating inorganic investments and we have a very healthy pipeline of opportunities the key differentiator for our company is our distribution network and we will continue seeking to add products that exploit our distribution channels in the most profitable end markets we serve our organization stands ready to capitalize on the next compelling opportunity at this time i ll turn the call over to james for a closer look at our results and then i will conclude our prepared remarks with thoughts on the remainder of the fiscal year james perry executive vice president chief financial officer thank you joe and good morning everyone our consolidated revenue during the fiscal second quarter of 2022 increased 48 3 to 155 6 million with higher revenue across all three segments compared to the prior year period consolidated gross profit in the fiscal second quarter was 63 1 million representing 29 4 growth with the incremental profit resulting predominantly from the truaire acquisition and increased organic sales volumes and pricing initiatives gross profit margin was 40 5 compared to 46 4 in the prior year period this margin decline is due in part to inclusion of the truaire business and the 1 2 million of incremental cost of goods sold resulting from reduced production levels at the truaire manufacturing facility in vietnam the reduction in profitability was also impacted by ongoing material and freight cost inflation that outpaced instituted price increases in some mid markets served and a shift to lower margin projects in the engineered building solutions segment consolidated operating income increased by 16 7 to 25 9 million equating to a 16 6 margin a 450 basis point decrease over operating margin in the prior year period as the decline in gross profit was partially offset by an improved operating expense margin consolidated ebitda increased 33 3 to 33 8 million as compared to the prior year period consolidated ebitda as a percent of revenue was 21 7 and 24 2 in the current and prior year periods respectively as a reminder we are very focused on profitability comparisons utilizing ebitda due to the amount of intangible amortization resulting from the truaire acquisition last year reported net income attributable to cswi in the fiscal second quarter of 2022 was 18 million or 1 14 per diluted share compared to 16 4 million or 1 10 in the prior year period there were no adjustments in either period and in the current period there were 969 000 or 6 5 more weighted average outstanding shares primarily due to the shares issued to the sellers of truaire last december transitioning to a discussion of our segments as compared to the prior year quarter our contractor solutions segment accounted for 66 4 of our consolidated revenue and delivered 40 million or 63 1 total growth comprised of organic revenue growth from pricing initiatives of 4 8 million or 7 6 and inorganic growth from the truaire acquisition segment ebitda was 32 4 million or 31 3 of revenue compared to 23 1 million or 36 4 of revenue in the prior year period providing additional context for these results in april of calendar year 2020 which marked the beginning of our fiscal 2021 year traditional hvac r demand shifted out of our fiscal first quarter due to early covid restrictions and then rebounded quickly as initial restrictions were relaxed in the early summer of 2020 this demand shift resulted in our fiscal 2021 second quarter significantly outperforming our fiscal 2021 first quarter due to this dynamic we believe fiscal 2022 first half to fiscal 2021 first half is a compelling comparison with this year to date comparison our contractor solutions segment delivered 100 3 million or 88 6 total revenue growth comprised of 27 9 organic growth due to increased sales volumes and implemented pricing initiatives and inorganic growth from the truaire acquisition of 68 8 million this organic growth rate exceeds same period category growth for our largest end market served and is in part driven by four pricing actions the latest of which occurred earlier this week and will take effect in january during the fiscal first half of 2022 strong segment revenue growth was partially offset by significantly accelerated inflation in material and freight costs 1 4 million of costs associated with the reduced production at our truaire vietnam facility as well as the increased headcount depreciation and the optimization of expenses related to our erp system segment adjusted ebitda in the fiscal first half was 71 8 million or 33 6 of revenue compared to 40 4 million or 35 7 of revenue in the prior year period as the increased expenses discussed above and the inclusion of truaire outpaced revenue growth continuing to our engineered building solutions segment the air pocket we ve mentioned on previous calls has materialized and while current quarter revenue is roughly flat to the prior year period this has been achieved by adding lower margin shorter cycle projects to the mix which is negatively impacting current period profitability metrics segment ebitda was 3 million or 12 6 of fiscal 2022 second quarter revenue in evaluating fiscal 2022 first half performance revenue improved 3 6 million or 7 9 as compared to the prior year period and this segment has accounted for approximately 16 of consolidated fiscal 2022 first half revenue during the most recent period of a decline in construction starts our team actively sought backlog diversification that allowed this segment to stabilize top line revenue grow our market share in institutional education and commercial projects minimize our exposure to multifamily projects and expand geographically fiscal 2022 first half bookings increased 17 over fiscal 2021 second half with fiscal 2022 second quarter bookings up 18 over the fiscal 2022 first quarter demonstrating an improving trend as of the end of the fiscal 2022 second quarter our book to bill ratio for the trailing eight quarters was just below one to one our specialized reliability solutions segment posted another solid quarter of organic revenue growth of 10 4 million or 58 due to incremental sales volumes as the end markets we serve continue recovering from the covid driven lows of last fiscal year and price initiatives the fourth of which we successfully implemented last week considering fiscal first half growth the segment reported increased sales of 16 9 million or 45 6 all of which was organic price actions have addressed some of the inflationary pressures and as such segment ebitda margin was 8 9 in the second quarter of fiscal 2022 a 160 basis point improvement compared to fiscal 2022 first quarter transitioning to the strength of our balance sheet we ended fiscal second quarter with 17 3 million of cash and reported cash flow from operations of 42 8 million a slight decrease over the prior year primarily due to increased investment in working capital to support growing sales which resulted in higher accounts receivable and higher inventory levels during the quarter we reduced the amount outstanding under our 400 million revolving credit facility by 17 million resulting in approximately 200 million of availability as of the end of the fiscal second quarter as of quarter end our leverage ratio was approximately 1 5x well within our stated range of 1x to 3x these metrics leave us extremely well positioned for the continued disciplined allocation of capital as joe discussed the company s effective tax rate for the fiscal second quarter was 25 2 on a gaap basis and the company continues to expect a 25 tax rate for fiscal year 2022 in light of current economic volatility due to persistent rapidly rising material and freight costs combined with the lag in the effectiveness of some of our pricing initiatives cswi is providing consolidated guidance for the fiscal 2022 third and fourth quarters as follows for the third quarter we expect an ebitda range of 17 million to 18 5 million and an eps range of 0 40 to 0 45 for the fourth quarter we expect an ebitda range of 33 million to 35 million and an eps range of 1 10 to 1 20 we are providing this guidance due to the unusual circumstances that we have discussed on this call today and to address the current external estimates for the remainder of our fiscal year we do not necessarily expect to provide guidance in future quarters with that i ll now turn the call back to joe for closing remarks joseph armes chairman president chief executive officer thank you james the first half of fiscal 2020 was marked by 62 top line growth driven across all reporting segments and all end markets served nearly 27 of this growth was organic achieved through a combination of price and volume adjusted eps grew by 36 to 2 60 so you can understand why our team is proud of this performance we are seeing real time improvements in our supply chain our end markets have strong underlying fundamentals specific to our contractor solutions segment as people continue to work from home they are investing in their comfort via home renovations at a rate higher than before the pandemic these are financed by rising home equity and low interest rates we remain optimistic about fiscal 2023 as our ebs segment bidding activity remains robust our recent bookings are strong and new construction activity is regaining pre pandemic momentum at the end of september the architectural billing index was well into expansionary territory at 56 6 which is higher than the august reading of 55 6 and this is similar to the double digit improvement indicated in the bidding and construction starts data provided by dodge in the second quarter these are strong indicators for future growth in the markets served by our ebs segment our new srs segment leadership has introduced a multifaceted operational effort focused on reduced complexity and increased production accuracy prioritizing product innovation we recently introduced four new products into the market while simultaneously evaluating adjacent markets for organic sales growth and market expansion our current month production run rate results in much improved plant utilization and the joint venture with shell has begun investing capital to expand production capacity at our whitmore facility so we are well positioned to serve our srs customers through the upcoming cycle at cswi we recognize that our success begins with our team members who have demonstrated strength resiliency and an outstanding leadership response to covid and its many ramifications we take seriously our responsibility to care for employees and their families and as a reminder we did not have any pandemic related layoffs last fiscal year our objective is to compensate our people fairly to treat them extravagantly to focus on recognition of excellent performance and to facilitate their professional development we know firsthand that this has great business and community benefits we believe that this has translated directly into employee loyalty and higher engagement supported by lower than industry average turnover we recently completed an employee engagement survey with our team members in north america australia and the united kingdom this was the third such survey in our 6 year history and this year we achieved a 93 response rate which is our highest ever we are currently analyzing the results but early indications are quite positive and we will develop action plans to address key findings while labor and wage pressures dominate business media we have avoided the workforce shortages that have been widely experienced throughout the economy i would like to extend my sincere thanks to our truaire team members in vietnam and welcome them back to work our commitment to our employees in vietnam including fair wages and a safe and dignified working environment is reflected in the fact that over 80 of our team members chose to return to work in our facility when we called we will certainly benefit from the continuity of knowledge this experienced workforce provides as always i would like to close by thanking all my colleagues here at cswi who collectively own 5 of the company through our employee stock ownership plan as well as all of our shareholders for their continued interest in and support of our company we believe that aligning the interests of our employees and shareholders through our employee stock ownership plan is a powerful driver of our collective success which differentiates our company from those with which we compete and with that maria we re now ready to take questions questions and answers operator our first question comes from john tanwanteng with cgs securities please proceed with your question jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst hey good morning everybody thanks for taking my questions james i was wondering if you could help me better bridge the sequential decline in the profitability i think you called out the specific truaire disruption but i was wondering if you could help me quantify the rest between the increased investments you re making the inflation and whatever else may have been in the bucket james perry executive vice president chief financial officer yes john it s james yes we mentioned specifically the 1 2 million of cost of goods sold because of the under absorption and some extra wages that we paid the employees that were working in that facility at the cost of goods sold line so the drop in gross profit of about 5 that s maybe 1 of it or so the rest is really that inflationary pressure we see from materials and freight costs we did mention there s a little bit of increased headcount here and there some of those things most of those type things that we mentioned the erp expenses and other would be below the gross profit line so i ll get to that in a minute but the gross profit line beyond the one callout we had it s really the fact that we ve been raising prices as quickly as we can and as quickly as kind of market conditions allowed we mentioned for example we just this week in our contractor solutions business announced a price increase that s effective at the beginning of january so that gives us good line of sight into our fiscal fourth quarter but we ve had now four price increases this calendar year in that segment and it takes a while to get them in just given industry standards and competition and those kind of things it s about a 60 day lag usually is kind of what we re looking at for the most part and for example the last price increase was right at the beginning of august right about the time we had the earnings call in the last couple of months since we had that price increase freight costs took another step up we ve started to see that stabilize some material prices have taken a step up and of course you have the lag of when those costs work their way through inventory and then finally hit the cost of goods sold as you sell that product as well so it s really that inflationary pressure you saw we gave guidance for the third quarter and now fourth quarter as well we re going to see that similar type hit here in the third quarter thus the earnings per share and ebitda guidance that we gave you but you can see the sharp recovery in the fourth quarter given that we now have kind of pricing behind us and you re going to see some of that s already taken effect the biggest piece in contractor solutions will take place in the fourth quarter when we also have a return from the low point of seasonality in q3 so we really think we re going to have a tailwind starting in fourth quarter into fiscal 2023 below the gross profit line we saw that we ve even picked up a little bit yes we had some expenses with erp and headcount extra depreciation with truaire those kind of things but we actually picked up a little bit from the gross profit line to the operating profit line then of course you look year over year you ve got a big difference as you well know now that we include truaire a lot more amortization depreciation which is why ebitda is a metric we really look at does that help jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst yes it does i guess the obvious follow up to all of that is as you go through q3 and q4 and i understand the drivers that you re seeing when you get to q4 and your profitability jumps back up is that your margins getting back to historical levels or is it more of a little bit more catch up from maybe volume that you might have missed earlier this year just help me understand what gets you to that level and if there s still more catch up to do after that as you head into the next fiscal year james perry executive vice president chief financial officer sure yes this is james again i ll continue and i appreciate you mentioned the guidance as we mentioned that s temporary for now we ll see but we thought it would really help given how unusual conditions are today so i appreciate you take a note of that as we look at fourth quarter you re looking at a quarter that with the guidance we gave you looks a lot like the second quarter from that perspective from an ebitda and eps perspective i think margins are still recovering back to somewhat normal levels i think we re going to continue to have a guide path to that but what we ve really focused on is recovering our profit dollars with our price increases we would like to be able to recover the profit margin i think in time we have that opportunity but for now recovering those profit dollars and seeing that ebitda and eps return to our more like second quarter type levels i think you re seeing us achieve that first goal of profit dollars the margin is a little tougher just because of the math as you raise prices that match costs your numerator denominator may get you to the earnings number but the profit margin is still going to be a little bit pressured i think as we see a return to somewhat normalized costs in time and as we see pricing continue to be rather sticky over time i think we have the opportunity for margins to continue to recover to historical levels we re just now starting the process of really getting deep into what our fiscal 2023 that start april 1 look like so it s a little early for us to talk too much about that other than to say given the order visibility we had given the market conditions we have we think we ve got a nice tailwind moving into the fourth quarter and then into fiscal 23 jonathan tanwanteng cjs securities analyst and then last one for me you gave good color i guess on the orders on the architectural side i was wondering how that squares with what you see in the p l in the next one or two quarters have we hit the trough there yet joseph armes chairman president chief executive officer i think as we mentioned in the back half you re going to see some pressure the orders that we ve been taking here this fiscal year as you all know we ve talked about an air pocket for a while and it didn t appear as much on the revenue line as we talked about but more as you work your way down the income statement and you look in the 10 q at the operating income line you re going to see that pressure continue for a little bit that is one reason that you see the q3 profitability down a bit that segment did a really nice job with profitability in the third and fourth quarter last year you see some pressure this year because the team has done a good job of finding orders but they re the shorter cycle lower margin projects the orders that we re taking now as you well know generally those project based orders for the bigger projects are longer term in nature we see those really helping us return to the higher levers of margin and profitability as we begin fiscal year 23 operator ladies and gentlemen we ve reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back over to joe armes for closing remarks joseph armes chairman president chief executive officer great thank you very much we really appreciate everyone joining us this morning and appreciate your interest and support of our company

middle east continue to be affected by destocking and those in europe by seasonal factors our ebitda margin rose above 20 following an increase in average selling prices while the increase in cost of sales was contained despite higher raw materials and energy costs by an improved industrial performance and higher absorption of fixed costs with the continuing ramp up of operations at our industrial facilities in the united states including the reopening of our ambridge pa seamless pipe mill and our baytown tx heat treatment and finishing facilities and higher activity levels working capital during the quarter increased by 276 million cash provided by operating activities totaled 53 million and with capital expenditures of 74 million during the quarter our free cash flow was slightly

2021 termination of nkktubes joint venture on november 2 2021 tenaris reached a preliminary agreement with jfe holdings inc jfe to terminate the joint venture for the operation of the seamless pipe manufacturing facility in kawasaki japan the facility located in the keihin steel complex owned by jfe has been operated by nkktubes a company owned 51 by tenaris and 49 by jfe since 2000 nkktubes has been dependent on jfe s keihin steel complex for the supply of raw materials energy and other essential services on march 27 2020 jfe had informed tenaris of its decision to permanently cease as from jfe s fiscal year ending march 2024 the operations of its steel manufacturing facilities located at the keihin complex in light of that development tenaris and jfe engaged in discussions and ultimately determined that the project was no longer economically sustainable and accordingly amicably agreed to terminate their joint venture and liquidate nkktubes the parties have agreed to cease nkktubes manufacturing operations by the end of june 2022 and to dissolve the company by the end of december 2022 tenaris and jfe highly recognize the contribution of nkktubes employees the parties are committed to work in good faith to provide adequate communication and support under the present circumstances tenaris and jfe are also committed to ensure the supply of tubular material including 13 chrome alloy products to nkktubes international customers after its closure in addition jfe will support nkktubes domestic customers according to customers needs tenaris and jfe will also engage in an open dialogue with suppliers local community groups and governmental entities affected by the nkktubes dissolution tenaris and jfe intend to continue discussing cooperatively with respect to other aspects of the dissolution of the joint venture with a view towards reaching a definitive agreement prior to june 2022 for information on the accounting impact of the nkktubes termination see note 23 subsequent events to the consolidated condensed interim financial statements as of september 30 2021 market background and outlook the strength of the global economic rebound so far this year and lower levels of investment in the energy sector over the past years have resulted in a tighter energy market as opec countries continue to contain production levels and large publicly listed us shale producers restrain capital spending global oil inventories have declined below 5 year average levels and are supportive of high prices drilling activity in the u s and canada continues to increase led by private operators and further gradual increases are likely in the coming months in latin america drilling activity has shown a recovery this year with higher activity in the vaca muerta shale in argentina and in colombia as well as the offshore regions of brazil mexico and guyana in the eastern hemisphere drilling activity is now recovering gradually and this recovery should extend further in the coming months though demand for octg will continue to be tempered by ongoing destocking in key middle east markets we anticipate that sales will show a further increase in the fourth quarter again led by north america where the market has absorbed excess octg inventories and prices are increasing our ebitda margin in the fourth quarter should remain close to the current level as price increases compensate for raw material energy and logistic cost increases on october 27 2021 in response to a petition from u s steel tubular products a small number of other u s domestic welded octg producers and a steelworkers union the u s department of commerce doc initiated anti dumping duty investigations on octg imports from mexico argentina and russia and countervailing duty investigations on octg imports from russia and south korea the international trade commission itc is required to make a preliminary determination of injury in case of a negative itc determination the investigations will be terminated otherwise the investigations will proceed until the doc and the itc make final determinations tenaris which imports octg from argentina and mexico to complement its production in the united states believes that the petition is unjustified and intends to vigorously challenge any claim that its imports are causing or threatening injury to the u s domestic octg industry at this time tenaris cannot predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the potential impact if any that the resolution of this matter may have on tenaris s business over the past 15 years tenaris has realized substantial investments more than any other company in acquisitions and new production to build up a competitive octg production system in the united states we believe we are well placed to continue

year on year the sequential increase reflects an 8 increase in volumes and a 6 increase in average selling prices mainly driven by higher prices on our sales in the americas in north america our sales increased mainly due to higher sales of octg products in the united states and canada and higher sales of octg and line pipe in mexico in south america sales increased mainly due to higher sales of octg products in argentina colombia and guyana in europe sales declined reflecting lower sequential sales in the north sea following a strong second quarter and seasonally lower sales of line pipe products to distributors in the middle east and africa sales declined reflecting ongoing destocking in the region and lower shipments of high value products to qatar in asia pacific our sales declined

president donald j trump recently helped celebrate the 400th anniversary of the virginia general assembly the oldest elected legislature in the western hemisphere three of my relatives served in it which is of interest to me and of course there is the importance of the general assembly in our nation s history and heritage another reason to pay attention to the anniversary is this the behavior of some current delegates who seem to not only hate virginia and its past but also america and who utilized trump s visit and speech to grandstand moral we might consider whether all groups are willing to assimilate to the neocons proposition nation that s because america is not an idea or a proposition america is an organic whole with a past a language a religion and a culture all now threatened by the post 1965 immigration disaster the first successful english settlement of the thirteen colonies which became the u s a jamestown was established in 1607 by 1619 about 1000 colonists lived in the town and outlying settlements on july 30th 1619 a legislative body was formed by combining a governor s council of state with 22 burgesses representing the colonists thus was virginia s representative legislature now known as the virginia general assembly formed making it the oldest continuous law making body in the new world as its informational web page says it was then and is now a legislative body comprised of citizen legislators elected representatives that serve in a part time capacity meeting full time responsibilities about the general assembly virginia gov for 157 1619 1776 years this legislature made laws for virginia a colony of the british empire upon independence in 1776 the house of burgesses was officially replaced by the house of delegates but they met in the same place with many of the same members as the encyclopedia virginia puts it the house of delegates was the house of burgesses by another name house of burgesses matthew s gottlieb encyclopedia virginia the colonial house of burgesses was formative in the development of american government as the encyclopedia virginia describes it the house of burgesses was a superior school for statesmen not only for those serving virginia but also for those serving the new united states in the past four hundred years more than 9 600 burgesses and delegates have served in the lower chamber you can look them up here in this database the upper chamber now known as the senate replaced the former governor s council upon independence another way of looking at it is to note that the virginia general assembly was part of the british empire from 1619 to 1776 of the united states from 1776 to 1861 of the confederate states of america from 1861 to 1865 and of the united states from 1865 to the present that s four hundred years of making laws for the commonwealth of virginia a succession of buildings in jamestown williamsburg and richmond the location of the current virginia capitol building designed by thomas jefferson and charles louis clérisseau have served as its home i m of colonial virginia stock myself although my particular line finally wound up in oklahoma my great great great great uncle alexander white served in the house of burgesses from 1772 to 1773 and from 1782 to 1786 in the post independence house of delegates attended the virginia ratifying convention in 1788 and then represented virginia s 1st district in the first two congresses under the newly ratified constitution 1789 1793 the ss alexander white a liberty ship in world war ii took his name later two of alexander s nephews brothers to each other and each of them my first cousin four times removed were in the general assembly 1 robert white served in the virginia house of delegates and was later a judge 2 francis white served in the virginia house of delegates the u s congress and the virginia senate and this is just one family think of all the burgesses and delegates who have served in the past century you can look them up here the four hundredth anniversary of the virginia general assembly is definitely a landmark this is what trump came to celebrate on july 30th 2019 the four hundredth anniversary also you can consult this text here divided into sections which has video also everything about trump is controversial and this appearance was no exception but it s not just about trump the controversy shows just how alienated from this organic american whole the historic american nation some influential people in our country really are the house of delegates black caucus boycotted trump s speech completely and instead stayed in richmond for a wreath laying ceremony and a visit to the site of a former slave jail in other words it was a big pity party for the perpetually aggrieved del delores mcquinn refused to use trump s name and instead called him the tenant in the white house mcquinn choked back tears as she said trump s criticism of minority members of congress was also aimed at every person of color in the united states of america that peevish protest aside trump s 22 minute speech began on this day 400 years ago here on the shores of the james river the first representative legislative assembly in the new world convened by the devotion of generations of patriots it has flourished throughout the ages and now that proud tradition continues with all of you to every virginian and every legislator with us today congratulations on four incredible centuries of history heritage and commitment to the righteous cause of american self government this is truly a momentous occasion trump described in detail the assembly s first session which took place just a mile south of where we are gathered now in a small wooden church the burgesses were adventurers and explorers farmers and planters soldiers scholars and clergymen all had struggled all had suffered and all had sacrificed in pursuit of one wild and very improbable dream they called that dream virginia jamestown he said was america s beginning the creation of english settlers who forged what would become the timeless traits of the american character they worked hard they had courage in abundance and a wealth of self reliance they strived mightily to turn a profit as the years passed ships bearing supplies and settlers from england also brought a culture and a way of life that would define the new world it all began here trump discussed the great charter of 1618 when jamestown s government went from military to civilian rule based on english common law for the first time virginia allowed private land ownership it created a basic judicial system finally it gave the colonists a say in their own future the right to elect representatives by popular vote with true american optimism the assembly even endorsed a plan to build a world class university in the still rugged wilderness it was a vision that would one day be fulfilled just miles from here at one of america s earliest educational institutions the esteemed college of william and mary great place trump also discussed the arrival of the brave strong women 90 of whom were tobacco brides who arrived in 1619 at a price of 150 pounds of tobacco per bride eager men greeted them at the dock the arrival of single englishwomen was an investment in the future many bachelors had returned to england but with the arrival of the women many stayed and built families thus was the colony s survival ensured trump also spoke about another upcoming four century anniversary the arrival in late august of 1619 of the first africans as slaves or indentured servants it was the beginning of a barbaric trade in human lives he said indeed the transatlantic slave trade was barbaric but the jamestown colonists did not start it the transatlantic slave trade had existed for almost a century with the active participation of black africans on the west coast of that continent and today let the record show black americans have the most wealth and the highest standard of living of any african origin ethnicity in africa europe or the americas of course this fact is ignored by those who demand reparations for slavery those reparations not just in freedom and prosperity but also in trillions of dollars of welfare state subsidies are already paid in full after about 13 minutes a delegate named ibraheem s samirah a democrat representing the 86th district parts of fairfax and loudoun counties interrupted to denounce trump the chicago born muslim child of palestinian refugees he landed in the assembly on february 20 after a special election to fill the seat of his predecessor who went to the state senate to win the seat samirah defeated republican gregg nelson an air force vet mr president you can t send us back virginia is our home the palestinian dentist said mr president you cannot send us back virginia is our home the honorable virginia delegate stood in front of the podium and held up a sign deport hate reunite my family and at the top go back to your corrupted home trump was silent but some in the audience booed samirah and chanted trump trump trump after samirah was led out the president listed by name and county the famous virginians who served in the assembly george washington thomas jefferson james madison and james monroe four of our first five presidents and then patrick henry george mason george wythe and richard henry lee these illustrious men were samirah s predecessors in the virginia legislature and as per the custom and law of their time they were also all slaveholders are all their legacies on the chopping block trump closed his discourse with these significant words our hard won culture of self government must be nourished protected and constantly preserved that is why we must speak out strongly against anyone who would take power away from citizens individuals and state governments such as yours in america the people will forever rule the people will forever reign and the people will forever be sovereign but what people ibraheem samirah and others of his religion delores mcquinn whose bitterness is such that she can t celebrate the anniversary of the lawmaking body of the state in which she lives despite the prosperity and freedom she enjoys largely because of men who look like trump how about the millions of immigrants still pouring into our country what will virginia be like in another hundred years if these people get power what will america be like american citizen allan wall email him moved back to the u s a in 2008 after many years residing in mexico allan s

prefecture of northwest china s qinghai province the earth is heating up at a rapid rate glaciers and icebergs are melting wild fires have become common bird and marine species are declining farmed sea food production is increasing as natural stocks diminish in some regions seasonal fruits are changing and big cities such as cape town have had a near encounter with day zero as water sources dry up migration as a result of drought and in search of grazing land for livestock is a common feature in many african countries cross border conflicts and deepening human insecurity as a result of these forces could lead to a reversal of africa s development trend the biosphere and its species have been put at enormous risk by an industrial civilization that places profits above all else and does not care about human solidarity across borders industrialization in europe was driven by coal mining and the exploitation and plunder of africa s mineral and human resources the united states boom has a lot to do with the exploitation of cheap oil from the middle east which was secured through wars and bloodshed countries such as south africa the 14th largest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world accelerated its industrialization on the back of gold mining coal powered electricity generation and steel production from the early 1920s onwards but even at its height south africa s industrial development benefited just its white minority the anglo american owned mineral industrial complex together with financial conglomerates extracted most of the value and sent most of those profits offshore to modernise the capitals of europe unfortunately even after nearly three decades of democracy not much has changed in south africa s economic ownership structure yet like other countries of the global south south africa now also has to mitigate the effects of climate change while maintaining a decent growth rate and creating more jobs and making efforts to alleviate poverty the much talked about energy transition should take into account the negative impacts of industrial civilization the role that advanced industrial economies such as the us and european countries played in global warming and the reparation they owe to humanity for wreaking havoc on the environment for countries such as south africa that were colonized and suffered apartheid and whose industrial development was skewed in favor of a white minority managing the energy transition will require public policy and finance to be oriented toward addressing this historical injustice and the new risks associated with the large number of jobs that will be lost in many sectors especially in coal mining and coal powered energy sectors thus europe is being hypocritical in pressing african countries to follow the low carbon green development path without delivering the much needed climate funds and without taking responsibility for climate change western countries should not see climate finance a freebie for developing countries but as reparation for the humongous damage they have caused to the environment also europe has not been entirely faithful to the climate cause a recent article in the nature says subsidies in the form of tax breaks or direct payments that make extracting coal oil or gas cheaper are prevalent in western countries with the specter of energy crisis hovering over europe as gas prices rise sharply on the back of a surge in demand and climate policy induced uncertainties many governments have resorted to shelling out gas subsidies while developing countries are forced to abandon fossil fuels according to an overseas development institute and climate action network report european governments give more than 112 billion a year in subsidies to the fossil fuel sector this shows how incredibly difficult decarbonization of the economy is for both rich and poor countries especially the latter that are capital starved on the agriculture front europe s common agricultural policy has struggled to rein in on farm emissions a recent european court of auditors report said the cap mostly finances measures with a low potential to mitigate climate change does not seek to limit or reduce livestock 50 percent of agriculture emissions and supports farmers who cultivate drained peatlands 20 percent of emissions the overall cap budget is more than 400 billion 26 percent of which is attributed to climate adaptation and mitigation in the same year that the european union signed the paris agreement the european commission overestimated the cap fund it spends on climate action claiming it to be 26 percent of the total cap budget when it was actually 18 percent according to the european court of auditors five years later the european commission still has not got this right despite having launched the european green deal in december 2019 the continuation of cap and its financing of activities that generate emissions is a double edged sword that pollutes the environment and distorts international trade which harm the interests of african and other developing countries that have comparative advantage in agriculture european countries are also contemplating strategic gas reserves through pooled procurement of natural gas and expanding storage infrastructure so as to avoid disruptions to energy supplies caused by high prices in the future yet developing countries have been discouraged from using gas as a back up alternative europe has planned investments of about 104 billion in gas pipelines and liquefied gas terminals notwithstanding its rhetoric of a green deal these investments are in the name of securing greater security of energy gas supply to sustain jobs and businesses what does this mean for the global south africa in particular we contend that african countries maintain an energy mix rather than follow the lead of europe africa s path to low carbon development should be carefully managed and based on the continent s own development needs and realities also african countries should be careful not to decommission their coal and other energy resources because that will pose a threat to energy security in the future and undermine their industrialization efforts western countries that are pushing for faster decarbonization need to lead by example and help african countries with the promised funds to fight climate change in fact african countries should tie the pace of climate mitigation to the resources delivered by europe and threats of carbon tax adjustment at the border by the eu should make african countries pause and think about future trade relations and diversify away from europe to asia africa can negotiate better trade relations with china for example and reduce its dependence on european countries which insist on inequitable terms of trade it is important that african countries work together to find local solutions to the dual crises of climate change and national energy emergencies and be weary of outside solutions that will eventually privilege the global north africa needs to mix it up to ensure energy security the views don t necessarily reflect those of china daily mzukisi

company says its rejected contract was last best and final offer deere co says the proposed contract offered striking workers which union members rejected tuesday is the company s last best and final offer jen hartmann a spokesperson for deere said wednesday the company was proud of its six year contract offer which would have boosted pay and benefits for about 10 000 uaw workers she said deere informed the uaw the ball is in their court uaw members on strike since oct 14 rejected the deal 55 percent to 45 percent despite gaining majority support from quad city union members union members at manufacturing plants waterloo and dubuque however rejected the contract that means the strike will continue by 10 100 production and maintenance employees at 12 deere facilities in iowa illinois and kansas it is the first major walkout at the agricultural machinery giant in more than three decades hartman said company officials will be communicating with the uaw to make sure that that is understood and clear we can move toward our first goal to get employees back to work this is certainly a tough time of year for everyone but we would like to see everyone back to work in response brian rothenberg a spokesperson for uaw said the union s bargaining team continues to discuss next steps the uaw appreciated the community support of our members on the picket line the proposed contract offered improved wages and benefits from the initial agreement which was overwhelmingly voted down oct 10 but a union member at deere s davenport works said the last offer didn t encompass all of the uaw s demands but that the offer probably would have been ratified if it had been the company s first offer i think the company got a little greedy there with that first tentative agreement and it backfired and it ended up putting us out on strike because the agreement was so awful the worker said that kind of galvanized a lot of people s frustration for the last 20 years workers on wednesday returned to the picket lines for day 20 of the strike in temperatures around 30 degrees outside of davenport works union members were picketing without burn barrels which are barred by court order a worker from john deere parts distribution center in milan said december is typically their highest paying month if they aren t back to work by then they will miss out on a large portion of income for the year union workers said they are divided on incentive payments wage increases and retirement benefits which is responsible for the rejection vote s narrow margin and tensions in locals there is nothing else to bargain deere s hartmann said we continue to believe this is a really great offer and because it does even push us into that place where we need to make sure we are competitive this is the best we are going to do in terms of the wages benefits health care and retirement that we have to offer employees deere officials said they are moving forward with their plan to put salaried workers into plant roles to keep production moving hartman said she could not confirm if deere was considering hiring outside workers to fill union member s manufacturing roles deere stock closed wednesday at 342 30 down 75 cents striking uaw members picket outside the deere co davenport works on oct 14 the first day of the first work stopped at the manufacturer in decades union members rejected the company s second contract offer tuesday and were back on the picket line wednesday meg mclaughlin quad city times via ap

washington reuters the federal reserve threw its weight back behind the drive for a full u s jobs recovery on wednesday restating its belief that current high inflation is expected to be transitory and despite risks to that view arguing that price pressures will ease and pave the way for stronger employment and economic growth in the months to come even as the u s central bank announced it was tucking away one of its main pandemic fighting tools by trimming its massive bond buying program beginning this month its latest policy statement and fed chair jerome powell s remarks in a news conference signaled it would stay patient and wait for more job growth before raising interest rates supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizeable price increases in some sectors the fed said in its latest policy statement adding that an easing of supply constraints is expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation powell emphasized what he said is the fed s intent to push labor markets further with low interest rates and to withhold judgment about the limits of job creation until further outbreaks of the coronavirus have been contained ideally we would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn t another covid spike and then we would be able to see a lot to see how does labor participation react in the post covid world he told reporters we are going to have to see some time post covid or post delta anyway to see what is possible powell said in reference to the coronavirus variant that was largely responsible for a covid 19 surge and economic slowdown over the last three months yet inflation was uncomfortably high powell acknowledged blaming it on turmoil in global supply chains that is likely to last until perhaps the second half of next year posing a challenge in the meantime to families on fixed incomes or those earning lower wages inflation for the last five months has been running at twice the fed s 2 target and moving in a way powell said could well satisfy the central bank s benchmark for a rate increase once maximum employment is reached but for now he said the fed would be patient in deciding when to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate from the near zero level a counter to rising bets in financial markets that inflation would prompt the central bank to end its pandemic era support for the economy sooner than later the fed last year said it would allow higher inflation in hopes of encouraging more job growth but as prices rose this year so did skepticism about the depth of the central bank s commitment to that new approach we don t think it is time yet to raise interest rates there is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment powell said adding that he thought that goal could perhaps be met late next year end of asset purchases the fed as widely expected announced on wednesday that it would begin reducing its 120 billion in monthly purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities at a pace of 15 billion per month with a plan to end the purchases altogether in mid 2022 that bond buying taper the source of market turbulence when the fed plotted its exit from a similar asset purchase program that was rolled out to fight the 2007 2009 recession this time came off without a hitch the central bank s message of ongoing accommodative policy helped push the s p 500 index and the nasdaq composite to record closing highs treasury yields ended the day higher but the move was more pronounced on longer dated maturities that are more sensitive to inflation expectations the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note ended the session back above 1 60 for the first time in a week while the yield on the 2 year treasury note a proxy for fed interest rate expectations ticked fractionally higher to about 0 46 indeed investors in recent weeks had focused less on the bond buying taper and more on the fed s reaction to a surge in prices that promises to last much longer than anticipated when it first took root in the spring powell s response was to acknowledge the uncertainty but argue that was part of the reason the fed should not rush into a rate hike when it was still possible inflation would ease on its own and allow workers more time to navigate into jobs as the pandemic subsides supply chain bottlenecks will abate and job growth will move back up he said and as that happens inflation will decline from today s elevated levels of course the timing of that is highly uncertain hedging their bets the fed instructed its market agents at the new york fed to begin executing the reduced bond purchases in the middle of this month but only laid out that plan for november and december starting in mid november it will buy 70 billion of treasuries and 35 billion of mbs per month a pace that will drop to 60 billion of treasuries and 30 billion of mbs per month in mid december policymakers the fed said judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month but are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook if the economy continues to progress as expected the fed could finish tapering those purchases by the middle of next year powell said he stressed that officials have the flexibility to speed up or slow down the taper based on what happens in the economy they re hedging their bets but that s not anything new because we ve heard publicly they re a little less confident that things are going to come down as quickly on the inflation side as they thought said joseph lavorgna americas chief economist at natixis in new york along with supply disruptions things just drag on a bit longer and the statement reflects those realities lavorgna said reporting by howard schneider additional reporting by jonnelle marte dan burns and

washington a brutal loss in blue leaning virginia and a too close for comfort race in new jersey sent divided democrats in washington scrambling for answers wednesday and calling for new strategies to unstick a stalled legislative agenda before they sustain more political damage republican glenn youngkin edged democratic former gov terry mcauliffe in the virginia governor s race erasing president joe biden s 10 percentage point margin of victory just a year ago in new jersey heavily favored democratic gov phil murphy was neck and neck with gop political newcomer jack ciattarelli in a state biden had carried by 16 percentage points the results were ominous for democrats far beyond those states the party s eroding support does not bode well as it clings to narrow house and senate majorities ahead of midterm elections next year elections without presidential races historically mean many lost seats especially in the house for the party holding the white house congressional leaders on wednesday tried bolstering the appeal of biden s stalled domestic legislation and used the election results to call for action the two measures a 1 trillion infrastructure bill and a 10 year 1 75 trillion package of social and environment initiatives financed largely with taxes on the wealthy and corporations have been slowed for months by infighting between progressives and moderates i would hope this clarifies everybody s thinking about how important it is to get these bills behind us said rep gerald connolly d va who represents some of washington s prosperous suburbs the time for kvetching is over sen tim kaine d va lamented that some fellow democrats wanted to be purist about whatever their own particular goals were left right and center he added a lot of politics is about timing and there was a time to do this that would have helped in both of these states three quarters of voters said drawn out negotiations in washington over biden s governing agenda were an important factor in their vote those voters were more likely to back youngkin according to preliminary results from ap votecast a survey of virginia voters rather than swift passage of the compromises on the table progressives used the moment to urge the party to restore the liberal priorities dropped during talks they blamed the election losses on democrats failure to make the bills bold enough biden and congressional leaders have cut in half what was a 3 5 trillion package of social and environment initiatives curtailing or eliminating provisions embraced by progressives but opposed by spending shy moderates the lesson going into 2022 is that democrats need to use power to get big things done for working people and then run on those accomplishments period the progressive change campaign committee said in a statement progressive rep ro khanna d calif said democrats continued delays on their economic bills hurt but cited other factors too i think there is a general sense of discontent a tough year with the delta variant the challenges in the supply chain the sense that washington has been gridlocked we can t control the external circumstances but we can control getting things done khanna said after arriving back in the u s early wednesday morning from global summits in europe biden planned remarks on covid vaccinations for kids but otherwise had no public schedule as he and his advisers took stock of what lessons could be gleaned from the virginia and new jersey voting house speaker nancy pelosi d calif and house ways and means committee chairman richard neal d mass said they were preparing to add paid family leave provisions to the domestic policy bill the proposal has been a key priority for progressives but had been lopped out after moderate sen joe manchin d w va complained about its costs the national republican congressional committee the house gop s campaign arm signaled its optimism wednesday by adding 13 democratic held house seats to the 57 it was already targeting for 2022 in a cycle like this no democrat is safe said nrcc chairman rep tom emmer r minn even so democrats said much could change in 12 months including an easing of inflation and the covid 19 pandemic and enactment of their party s economic agenda it could be a very different political environment by next spring connolly said
bmw profit report november 3 2021 the bmw group continued to demonstrate its high level of profitability in the period from july to september 2021 with revenues profit before tax and net profit all at record levels for a third quarter the group s strong performance during this period was driven in particular by favourable product mix factors and positive pricing effects for new vehicles as well as stable selling prices of pre owned vehicles the bmw group also posted new record figures for deliveries to customers revenues and profit before tax for the nine month period and in light of this strong performance confirmed its outlook for the full year at the quarterly press conference the outlook for the current year was raised in an ad hoc announcement dated 30 september clearly demonstrating the group s underlying profitability at the same time the group is relentlessly driving forward the process of becoming a climate neutral premium automobile manufacturer the bmw group shows how profitability and transformation go hand in glove we see technological change as a great opportunity to strengthen our business model on a sustainable basis with our focus on climate neutral mobility we are consistently driving the company forward to make it future proof said oliver zipse chairman of the board of management of bmw ag in munich on wednesday the bmw group s consistent focus on sustainability ultimately leading to a circular economy was underlined with the unveiling of the bmw i vision circular concept vehicle at the iaa in munich in september this first fully recycled and recyclable vision vehicle created by the bmw group provides a forward glimpse of sustainable premium mobility in the year 2040 when it comes to climate protection the relevant question is how big is the carbon footprint of a vehicle over its entire life cycle including the impact of raw materials industrial production the active use of the vehicle and recycling that is the currency that ultimately counts and the one by which our performance will be measured zipse emphasised that s why our understanding of sustainability goes far beyond developing e drive systems we aim to leverage circular economy principles to achieve a maximum of climate protection starting with the sustainable selection of individual raw materials for production and considering the life cycle of our vehicles as a whole e mobility expanding at faster pace high growth rates achieved the bmw group is swiftly and systematically expanding its range of electrified models with demand for electrified vehicles on the rise it sold 231 575 fully electric and plug in hybrid vehicles during the first nine months of 2021 twice as many as one year earlier 2020 116 400 units 98 9 sales of fully electric vehicles grew particularly dynamically rising by 121 4 to 59 688 units 2020 26 957 units during the third quarter the bmw group received high acclaim from international automotive experts and journalists alike for its new fully electric bmw ix and bmw i4 vehicles order intake worldwide is high for both models with deliveries to customers due to start from this month onwards with the bmw i4 and the bmw ix we are taking e mobility to a new level the bmw ix is the innovation flagship that gives upcoming bmw models new capabilities that include 5g technology the latest generation of software and the most advanced e drive the bmw group has ever developed the bmw i4 comes straight from the heart of the bmw brand and offers customers a whole new dimension of driving pleasure the statement we are making could not be clearer if a vehicle bears the bmw badge then it s a genuine bmw regardless of the drive variant said zipse the bmw group s electric mobility strategy is moving relentlessly towards its steep ramp up phase as early as 2023 the group will have 25 electrified models on the roads 13 of them fully electric in the period up to 2025 the bmw group is set to grow its sales of fully electric vehicles by an average of more than 50 annually delivering around two million fully electric vehicles to customers by the middle of the decade growth in revenues and profit before tax the bmw group recorded significant sales volume growth in the first nine months of the current year with deliveries rising by 18 to 1 932 224 units 2020 1 638 167 units in the third quarter reduced production volumes of the bmw group due to the supply situation impacted delivery figures during the period from july to september a total of 593 177 bmw mini and rolls royce brand vehicles were delivered to customers 2020 675 592 units 12 2 the continuation of positive pricing effects for new and pre owned vehicles as well as a favourable product mix more than compensated for the lower sales volume driving third quarter revenues up to 27 471 million 2020 26 283 million 4 5 adjusted for currency factors 3 5 revenue growth for the nine month period was even more pronounced rising significantly to 82 831 million 2020 69 508 million 19 2 adjusted for currency factors 20 5 the improved price penetration for new and pre owned vehicles is primarily due to the bmw group s attractive product range strong customer demand and the generally lower availability of vehicles due to the shortage of semiconductors business during the current financial year to date has benefited substantially from the favourable stable market situation and continued brisk demand said nicolas peter member of the board of management of bmw ag finance the latest set of reported figures underlines the operational strength of the bmw group and demonstrates the outstanding commitment of our workforce looking ahead to the upcoming changes in the bmw group s business model he added our ability to generate profit is the prerequisite for transforming our business model our stated policy is to finance the necessary investments out of ongoing operations with a combination of prudent planning good management and a keen focus on efficiency and profitability we are excellently positioned to do so future oriented investments remain at high level research and development activities during the period under report were focused on new models as well as on the electrification and digitisation of the vehicle fleet and automated driving in other words on key issues in terms of driving the process of transformation and strengthening the company s future viability r d expenses recognised in the income statement amounted to 1 600 million in the third quarter 13 8 up on the previous year taking the total for the nine month period to 4 337 million 2020 4 140 million 4 8 total r d expenditure amounted to 4 369 million slightly lower than one year earlier 2020 4 397 million 0 6 due to revenue growth the research

the nine month period and to 2 883 million 2020 1 924 million for the third quarter in addition to improved pricing for new and pre owned vehicles as described above ebit also benefited from the unchanged low level of allowances required to be recognised for credit risks the partial reversal of the provision for eu antitrust proceedings recorded in the second quarter also had a positive impact on nine month earnings the financial result for the nine month period was a net positive amount of 2 240 million 2020 329 million in the third quarter 534 million 2020 540 million the result from investments benefited in particular from the group s share of the profit reported by the chinese joint venture bmw brilliance automotive ltd shenyang which increased to 1 475 million for the nine month period 2020 959 million 53 8 other financial result went up to a net positive amount of 940 million 2020 negative 282 million in the third quarter positive 173 million 2020 positive 200 million whereby the improvement was mainly attributable to the continued favourable fair value development of interest rate hedges resulting from the rise in yield curves in the usa the remeasurement of investments held by the bmw i ventures fund as well as the investment in sgl carbon had a positive impact group profit before tax ebt amounted to 13 153 million 2020 2 962 million in the third quarter

significantly up on previous year automotive segment sales in the third quarter of 2021 were impacted by semiconductor supply issues deliveries to customers in europe and asia were down whereas sales in the americas region rose year on year over the nine month period however sales growth was recorded for all major regions worldwide including an excellent performance on european markets where deliveries of bmw mini and rolls royce brand vehicles were up by 11 9 to 725 721 units 2020 648 494 units the limited availability of semiconductors caused third quarter deliveries in asia to fall to 254 739 units 2020 288 907 units 11 8 however the figure contrasts sharply with group performance over the nine month period during which 835 090 units were delivered to customers 2020 705 789 units 18 3 third quarter sales figures for china dropped to 203 008 units 2020 230 920 units 12 1 here too figures were well up over the nine month period with 670 964 bmw mini and rolls royce brand

greater degree by higher raw materials prices and fixed costs in particular r d expenses as well as by the lower sales volume the nine month financial result recorded by the automotive segment amounted to 1 711 million 2020 615 million in the third quarter 374 million 2020 383 million as described above the main driving factors were the improved result from the at equity accounted chinese

washington nov 3 xinhua u s federal reserve chair jerome powell stressed on wednesday that the fed can be patient on raising interest rates as the central bank is set to start tapering its asset purchases later this month amid elevated inflation concerns our decision today to begin our tapering asset purchases does not imply any direct signal regarding our interest rate policy powell said wednesday afternoon at a virtual press conference after wrapping up a two day policy meeting we continue to articulate a different and more stringent test for the economic conditions that would need to be met before raising the federal funds rate powell said adding there is still ground to reach maximum employment both in terms of employment and participation we don t think it s time to raise rates now if we do conclude it s necessary to do so we will be patient but we won t hesitate he said in a policy statement released wednesday the fed pledged to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at the record low level of near zero as widely expected meanwhile the central bank decided to begin reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases by 10 billion u s dollars for u s treasury securities and 5 billion dollars for agency mortgage backed securities later this month the fed had pledged to continue its asset purchase program at the pace of 120 billion dollars per month including 80 billion dollars in u s treasury securities and 40 billion dollars in agency mortgage backed securities until substantial further progress has been made on employment and inflation at today s meeting the committee judged that the economy has met this test and decided to begin reducing the pace of its asset purchases powell said referring to the federal open market committee fomc the fed s policy making committee if the economy evolves broadly as expected we judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month implying that increases in our securities holdings would cease by the middle of next year he said joseph gagnon senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics said the fed s decision on tapering was widely expected and well received by markets bond yields and the dollar moved very little after the announcement stock prices rose slightly gagnon said adding the current pattern of bond yields suggests that market participants expect the fed to raise rates about half a percentage point in the second half of 2022 however jay h bryson chief economist at wells fargo securities believed that the fomc will wait until 2023 before commencing a tightening cycle we believe that the level of payrolls will not regain its pre pandemic peak until the end of 2022 bryson said wednesday in a note but we readily acknowledge that the committee could pull forward its pace of tightening somewhat if payrolls recover more quickly than we currently forecast and or inflation remains stubbornly high bryson said the announcement of tapering came as u s inflation rates remained elevated in recent months in the 12 months through september the core personal consumption expenditure pce price index the fed s preferred inflation measure rose 3 6 percent for a fourth straight month remaining at the highest level since may 1991 according to the commerce department inflation is now being driven by monetary and fiscal policy being too expansionary at a time that we are running into severe supply chain problems shipping problems and large increases in international oil and food prices desmond lachman resident fellow at the american enterprise institute and a former official at the international monetary fund told xinhua i do not expect those pressures to ease anytime soon and i expect that inflation will be higher than the fed is forecasting lachman said adding the tapering will not do very much to reduce inflation one must remember that even with tapering the fed will continue to buy a lot of bonds till it ends the tapering by the middle of next year and it will keep policy interest rates at the zero bound he said while it was highly uncertain when u s inflation will eventually moderate due to supply chain bottlenecks powell said inflation could move down by the second or third quarter of next year if we were to see signs that the path of inflation or longer term inflation expectations was moving materially and persistently beyond levels consistent with our goal we would use our tools to preserve price stability powell said noting the central bank will be watching carefully to see if the economy is evolving in line with expectations a bloomberg survey released on tuesday showed that economists are closely divided on whether u s interest rate liftoff will be in 2022 or early 2023 with a slim majority estimating the latter timing enditem

the third quarter and the forward curve for each are encouraging however continuing with the theme established earlier in the year although commodity price driven e p company cash flow increases have been significant surplus cash flow has generally been applied to debt reduction and returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this is expected to continue in the foreseeable future the industry e p capital reinvestment ratio in canada capital spending as a percentage of cash flow is anticipated to be much lower in 2021 than the past ten years looking into 2022 industry analysts are generally projecting that e p companies spending in the western canadian sedimentary basin will be higher than 2021 generally however e p companies are less focused on production growth than they have been in previous years strong commodity prices and the constant degradation effect of well declines is still expected to drive an increase in spending on well drilling and completions wti and aeco prices have recently been trading at their highest levels since 2014 e p companies have been reluctant to support improved pricing for oilfield services as e p companies seek to maximize financial performance by controlling costs current oilfield service pricing is however insufficient to generate appropriate returns inflation and cost increases for wages fuel and inventory are increasing essential s cost structure given recent cost inflation current pricing is also insufficient to support the expansion of crews and activation of additional equipment for

to recruit and retain employees in a very tight labor market in a recovering oil and natural gas market small and specialized service fleets including the deep coil tubing industry fleet in western

depletion and depreciation expense and corporate g a costs which both increased earnings by 1 7 million or 0 01 per share partially offsetting these favourable factors was a 3 5 million or 0 01 per share reduction from higher production costs net earnings in ytd totalled 660 3 million 2 48 per share a 19 increase from 555 1 million 2 06 per share in ytd 2020 the increase in net earnings compared to the same period a year earlier mainly reflected revenue growth a lower effective tax rate a reduction in rehabilitation and transaction costs lower care and maintenance expense and the impact of other income of 3 1 million in ytd 2021 versus other loss of 31 4 million in ytd 2020 on an after tax basis increased revenue had a 77 0 million or 0 29 per share favourable impact on growth in net earnings in ytd 2021 a lower effective rate 28 0 in ytd 2021 versus 31 9 in ytd 2020 increased net earnings by 36 1 million or 0 13 per share the lower effective tax rate mainly resulted from a 15 6 million net tax recovery in q3 2021 as well as the impact of favourable adjustments resulting from re assessments of prior year tax returns in q2 2021 other factors contributing to net earnings growth year over year were a 23 6 million or 0 09 favourable after tax impact from the 32 6 million increase in environmental remediation provisions in q3 2020 included in ytd 2020 rehabilitation costs as well as a 21 9 million or 0 08 per share impact related to the 33 8 million of pre tax transaction fees in ytd 2020 mainly related to the detour gold acquisition on january 31 2020 the 34 5 million pre tax change in other income loss compared to ytd 2020 increased ytd 2021 net earnings by 23 5 million or 0 09 per share on an after tax basis and mainly resulted from 23 5 million pre tax of foreign exchange losses recorded in q3 2020 also having a favourable impact on the change in net earnings in ytd 2021 versus ytd 2020 were the impact of lower covid 19 related costs in ytd 2021 3 5 million after tax in ytd 2021 compared to 9 8 million after tax in ytd 2020 as well as a reduction in average shares outstanding 266 5 million shares in ytd 2021 versus 269 9 million shares in ytd 2020 both factors contributed 0 02 per share to the increase in earnings per share year over year partially offsetting the favourable impact of these factors were higher production costs and depletion and depreciation expense largely reflecting higher business volumes in ytd 2021 compared to ytd 2020 on an after tax basis higher production costs reduced net earnings by 37 7 million or 0 14 per share while higher depletion and depreciation expense lowered net earnings by 42 4 million or 0 16 per share adjusted net earnings 1 adjusted net earnings 1 in q3 2021 totalled 241 3 million 0 91 per share compared to 254 0 million 0 92 per share in q3 2020 and 246 9 million 0 92 per share the previous quarter the main difference between net earnings and adjusted net earnings 1 in q3 2021 was the exclusion from adjusted net earnings 1 of the 15 6 million net tax recovery related to maximizing the use of eligible tax deductions under ontario mining tax following a restructuring of the company s canadian corporate entities effective january 2 2021 in addition also excluded from adjusted net earnings 1 in q3 2021 were foreign exchange gains of 6 0 million 4 2 million after tax as well as costs

production was 35 higher than the 140 067 ounces produced in q3 2020 and increased 14 from the previous quarterly record of 165 880 ounces in q2 2021 the increase in production quarter over quarter mainly reflected a 5 increase in tonnes processed as well as an 8 improvement in the average grade with mining during the quarter focused largely on high grade areas as part of the phase 2 mining plan production costs at detour lake in q3 2021 totalled 109 5 million including 1 2 million of covid 19 related costs compared to 87 4 million in q3 2020 and 102 6 million the previous quarter the increase compared to q3 2020 largely related to higher consumable costs including diesel and electricity as well as increased maintenance and contractor costs in addition to the impact of a stronger canadian dollar in q3 2021 while the increase from the previous quarter mainly related to lower deferred stripping in q3 2021 and higher levels of ore mined resulting in reduced capitalization of costs operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 averaged 601 in q3 2021 versus 634 in q3 2020 and 610 the previous quarter the improvement in operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 compared to both prior periods largely reflected the favourable impact of a higher average grade and increased tonnes processed on sales volumes as well as the impact of changes in gold inventories aisc per ounce sold 1 in q3 2021 achieved quarterly record at 937 a 26 improvement 1 259 in q3 2020 and 6 lower than 996 the previous quarter sustaining capital expenditures 1 at detour lake in q3 2021 totalled 51 8 million

ounce sold 1 averaged 647 in ytd 2021 versus 630 in ytd 2020 excluding the impact of a stronger canadian dollar in ytd 2021 operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 improved from ytd 2020 as the favourable impact of a higher average grade and tonnes processed on sales volumes more than offset higher mining costs related to increased total tonnes mined ore and waste the impact of higher diesel prices and a lower proportion of mining costs being allocated to deferred stripping in ytd 2021 versus ytd 2020 as well as higher milling costs largely related to increased maintenance expense aisc per ounce sold 1 averaged 994 in ytd 2021 compared to 1 156 in ytd 2020 during ytd 2021 sustaining capital expenditures 1 at detour lake totalled 144 9 million 297 per ounce sold compared to 188 8 million 491 per ounce sold for the same period in 2020 the reduction in sustaining capital expenditures 1 versus ytd 2020 largely reflected lower deferred stripping costs which were mainly included in growth capital expenditures 1 in ytd 2021 and reduced expenditures for tailings management largely reflecting expenditures related to the cell 2 starter dam in ytd 2020 growth projects growth capital expenditures 1 at detour lake in ytd 2021 totalled 137 0 million 56 3 million in q3 2021 including 66 4 million related to deferred stripping with the remaining 70 6 million related to the procurement

quarter the increase in production from q3 2020 mainly reflected a higher average grade in q3 2021 compared to the same period a year earlier when operations were impacted by excessive heat in the mine and ongoing protocols related to the company s covid 19 response the reduction in production from q2 2021 reflected lower tonnes processed due largely to higher levels of underground maintenance and reduced equipment availability as well as the impact of a lower than planned average grade due mainly to mine sequencing production costs in q3 2021 totalled 30 2 million versus 26 0 million in q3 2020 and 34 1 million the previous operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 averaged 657 versus 648 for the same period in 2020 and 586 the previous quarter excluding the impact of changes in exchange rates operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 improved from q3 2020 mainly due to the favourable impact of a higher average grade and tonnes processed on sales volumes in q3 2021 more than offset by increased operating costs related to mine development and maintenance the 12 increase in operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 from q2 2021 resulted from the impact of lower ounces sold compared to the previous quarter with operating cash costs 1 9 lower compared to the previous quarter aisc per ounce sold 1 averaged 859 in q3 2021 a 21 improvement from 1 081 in q3 2020 largely reflecting the

totalled 10 9 million or 197 per ounce sold lower sustaining capital expenditures 1 in q3 2021 compared to the previous quarter mainly related to the timing for mobile equipment procurement and lower capital development metres being completed in q3 2021 production at macassa for ytd 2021 totalled 148 855 ounces based on processing 243 614 tonnes at an average grade of 19 4 g t and average recoveries of 98 0 the 148 855 ounces of production for ytd 2021 increased 14 from 130 754 ounces for the same period in 2020 mainly reflecting an increase in the average grade which increased 11 from 17 5 g t in ytd 2020 both average grades and tonnes processed in ytd 2020 were impacted by reduced operations during q2 2020 as part of the company s covid 19 response as well as reduced workforce productivity and equipment availability caused by excessive heat in the mine during q3 2020 production in ytd 2021 was below expected levels due largely to reduced equipment availability caused by increased maintenance requirements poor battery performance and delays in receiving new batteries with the result being lower tonnes produced reduced operating development metres and a lower average grade resulting largely from changes to mine sequencing production costs for ytd 2021 totalled 99 2 million versus 80 2 million including 3 3 million related to the company s covid 19 response in ytd 2020 with the increase largely related to a higher proportion of underground mining costs being allocated to operations versus capital expenditures as well as the impact of a stronger canadian dollar in ytd 2021 operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 averaged 645 compared to 573 for the same period in 2020 with the impact of higher operating cash costs 1 being partially offset by the benefit of increased sales volumes mainly resulting from an increase in the average grade aisc per ounce sold 1 averaged 884 for ytd 2021 versus 915 a year earlier with the reduction mainly reflecting lower sustaining capital expenditures 1 as well as higher sales volumes in ytd 2021 versus the same period in 2020 sustaining capital expenditures 1 totalled 26 3 million 175 per ounce sold compared to 39 0 million 290 per ounce sold in ytd 2020 with the reduction largely resulting from lower levels of capital development and reduced expenditures for equipment procurement growth projects growth capital expenditures 1 at macassa for ytd 2021 totalled 72 2 million 29 2 million in q3 2021 of total growth expenditures 1 for ytd 2021 32 7 million 10 9 million in q3 2021 related to the 4 shaft project during q3 2021 the shaft advanced approximately 500 feet and had reached a depth of 6 100 feet as of september 30 2021 with development of the 6 100 level station also being completed the project ended q3 2021 ahead of schedule on track for completion in late 2022 an additional 12 9 million 3 0 million in q3 2021 of growth capital expenditures 1 in ytd 2021 related to a ventilation expansion project involving the development of two new ventilation raises the first raise was completed in june 2021 with the second expected to be completed in the first half of 2022 the two new raises will add approximately 200 000 cfm of additional ventilation into the mine the remaining growth capital expenditures 1 in ytd 2021 mainly related to a number of underground projects including lateral development from the mine towards the 4 shaft fosterville the fosterville mine produced 134 772 ounces in q3 2021 based on processing 180 255 tonnes at an average grade of 23 6 g t and average mill recoveries of 98 7 production in q3 2021 exceeded expected levels mainly due to continued grade outperformance in the swan zone the 134 772 ounces of production in q3 2021 compared to 161 489 ounces produced in q3 2020 and 157 993 ounces the previous quarter the change in production from q3 2020 resulted from a lower average grade largely related to mine sequencing within the swan audax benu and raptor zones the change in production from q2 2021 largely reflected a greater impact from grade outperformance during the previous quarter as well as well as changes to mine sequencing with high grade swan zone stopes initially planned for q4 2021 being advanced into q2 2021 production costs were 25 0 million in q3 2021 versus 22 7 million in q3 2020 and 23 0 million the previous quarter operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 averaged 170 versus 142 in q3 2020 and 162 in q2 2021 the increase from both prior periods largely resulted from higher tonnes mined and milled in q3 2021 as well as the impact of a higher average grade on sales volumes in both q3 2020 and q2 2021 aisc per ounce sold 1 averaged 337 compared to 349 in q3 2020 and 353 the previous quarter sustaining capital expenditures 1 totalled 11 4 million 78 per ounce sold in q3 2021 versus 18 1 million 117 per ounce sold in q3 2020 and 14 5 million 102 per ounce sold the previous quarter the reduction in sustaining capital expenditures 1 from q3 2020 mainly reflected lower levels of capital development in q3 2021 and reduced expenditures related to mobile equipment procurement lower mobile equipment expenditures largely accounted for the reduction in sustaining capital expenditures 1 compared to the previous quarter production at fosterville for ytd 2021 totalled 401 445 ounces significantly higher than target levels for the first nine months of the year largely reflecting grade outperformance in multiple swan zone stopes during ytd 2021 production in ytd 2021 compared to production of 476 459 ounces for ytd 2020 with the reduction reflecting a lower average grade consistent with the company s previously stated plan to reduce production with the intention of creating a more sustainable operation over a longer period while the mine continues its extensive exploration program partially offsetting the impact of a planned reduction in the average grade was a 28 increase in tonnes processed to 524 776 tonnes in ytd 2021 production costs were 74 8 million for ytd 2021 versus 61 9 million for the same period in 2020 with the increase from ytd 2020 largely resulting from the impact of a stronger australian dollar in ytd 2021 as well as significantly higher mining and milling rates in ytd 2021 versus ytd 2020 operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 averaged 184 versus 132 in ytd 2020 while aisc per ounce sold 1 averaged 367 compared to 311 in ytd 2020 the increases in operating cash costs per ounce sold 1 and aisc per ounce sold 1 versus levels in ytd 2020 mainly resulted from higher operating cash costs 1 largely reflecting higher mining rates in ytd 2021 and exchange rate changes year over year as well as the impact of lower sales volumes in ytd 2021 versus ytd 2020 sustaining capital expenditures 1 totalled 38 3 million 94 per ounce sold unchanged from 45 0 million 97 per ounce sold in ytd 2020 the reduction in sustaining capital expenditures 1 in ytd 2021 mainly reflected lower levels of capital development included in sustaining capital expenditures 1 compared to ytd 2020 with there being a greater focus on development in support of exploration activities in ytd 2021 compared to the prior year growth projects growth capital expenditures 1 at fosterville for ytd 2021 excluding capitalized exploration totalled 6 8 million 3 1 million in q3 2021 mainly related to construction of a surface refrigeration plant power transformer station and land procurement 1 the review of operating mines section includes a number of non ifrs measures the definition and reconciliation of these non ifrs measures are included on pages 37 44 of the md a for the three and nine months ended september 30 2021 full year 2021 guidance the company s full year guidance for

the first nine months of 2021 the company s ytd 2021 results included aisc per ounce sold 1 averaging better than the guidance range for the year operating cash costs per ounce 1 in line with guidance and production on track to achieve the top end of full year 2021 guidance also included in full year 2021 consolidated guidance is higher growth capital expenditures 1 with the expected increase mainly at detour lake reflecting a shift of deferred stripping costs from sustaining capital expenditures 1 to growth capital expenditures 1 resulting from a significant stripping campaign being

racked up movies and tv shows like infinity stones in 2021 following the likes of wandavision the falcon and the winter soldier loki black widow and shang chi and the legend of the ten rings eternals proved itself to be one of marvel s most intriguing and divisive movies yet eternals follows a race of superpowered immortal beings who have secretly lived on earth for thousands of years here s what you need to know about the marvel movie including its comic origins cast and when you can watch it at home advertisement when can you watch eternals on disney in australia marvel movies have traditionally been theatre only experiences but we saw that change with the simultaneous streaming release of black widow shang chi changed things again with an exclusive cinema window but eventually made its way to streaming on disney day eternals is following shang chi s model with a theatrical release window of at least 45 days before its release on disney disney confirmed audiences would be able to stream marvel s eternals on disney from january 12 2022 if the film follows the same schedule as other disney releases we should be seeing it appear around 7 pm aedt the film will be available in an imax enhanced edition like 13 other marvel movies on the platform it should also come with some neat bonus features like audio commentary from chloe zhao behind the scenes features and deleted scenes if you want to watch eternals and all the other marvel movies on disney you can get a subscription sorted here before you get watching here are some other things you should know about eternals celestials vs deviants vs eternals at the core of eternals are three races of alien god like beings they are of course at war with each other the celestials are like the prime creators they were responsible for creating our eternals characters they ve had a hand in major human evolutionary events and have also been known to use infinity stones every now and then the celestials spawned the eternals during a series of genetic experiments at the same time they also created the deviants a race of monstrous mutated beings the eternals have acted as guardians of humanity for centuries protecting them from their enemies the deviants they ve been hiding in secret helping us out from time to time but they never interfere this might explain why they didn t show up when thanos snapped away half of the population they were trying to protect in marvel s eternals however something significant happens bringing these super beings out of hiding what is marvel s eternals all about oscar winning director chloe zhao is behind the wheel for eternals and it s pretty different to anything we ve seen in the mcu before eternals covers multiple civilisations across multiple countries spanning multiple time periods so it has a lot of ground to cover and that s before you add in the absolutely stacked cast of characters but more on that later so do you need to see any other mcu

jpmorgan chase an american multinational investment bank has dropped a new prediction on how bitcoin btc usd will perform in the coming year the bank s strategists shared their btc prediction in a recent report to investors noting that btc s fair price in 2022 will be around 35 000 25 687 37 are you looking for signals alerts from pro traders sign up to invezz signals for free takes 2 mins reportedly the strategists based btc s fair value on the bank s price model at the time of writing btc is changing hands at 63 084 08 46 290 78 after losing 0 08 over the past 24 hours this value is 45 higher than jpmorgan s set price however the strategists believe that btc can surge to 73 000 if the current volatility decreases by 50 in 2022 led by nikolaos panigirtzoglou the team of strategists pointed out that this challenges the idea that a price target of 100k or above which appears to be the current consensus for 2022 is a sustainable bitcoin target in the absence of a significant decline in bitcoin volatility they added that the digital asset sector is on a multiyear structural ascent however the current entry point looks unattractive alternative asset class to continue swelling copy link to section advising investors the strategists noted that putting money in hedge funds and real estate will be more profitable in 2022 because traditional assets like stocks and bonds will underperform jpmorgan further noted that alternative assets which include private debt private equity and digital currencies will continue to outperform into 2022 according to strategists the alternative asset sector will return 11 in 2022 more than doubling the 5 gain that stocks and fixed income will net while panigirtzoglou and his team believe cryptocurrencies will gain 15 in 2022 they claim the ride might be too bumpy as such they don t encourage investors to add them as a core holding in their portfolios the investor report was part of jpmorgan s inaugural outlook centred on alternative investments per jpmorgan the alternative investments sector will grow to 25 trillion 18 31 trillion in 2022 doubling 2014 s level the bank added that many investment vehicles in this category are not easily accessible and exiting them can prove challenging because of liquidity constraints although this feature makes them unsuitable for money managers that have investment horizons shorter than a year jpmorgan believes their upside potential offers an opportunity to enhance performance to this end the strategists noted that the category is best suited for institutional investors that seek to invest new cash flows into alternatives compared to institutional investors that want to create strategic long term positions in alternative assets
article 3 months old always an independent thinker rudi has not shied away from making big out of consensus predictions that proved accurate later on when rio tinto shares surged above 120 he wrote investors should sell in mid 2008 he warned investors not to hold on to equities in oil producers in august 2008 he predicted the largest sell off in commodities stocks was about to follow in 2009 he suggested australian banks were an excellent buy between 2011 and 2015 rudi consistently maintained investors were better off avoiding exposure to commodities and to commodities stocks post gfc he dedicated his research to finding all weather performers see also all weather performers on this website as well as the special reports section rudi s view nov 04 2021 this story features goodman group and other companies for more info share analysis gmg this week s edition was written prior to highly anticipated meetings by the rba locally and the fomc in the us but has lost nothing of its relevance post both events in this week s weekly insights bonds versus earnings signal says sell but don t sell autumn has arrived for sydney properties covid is changing the world copper supercycle with a twist conviction calls by rudi filapek vandyck editor fnarena bonds versus earnings as far as historical battles between financial markets and central banks are concerned the past two weeks have generated a lot of excitement for bond traders locally who had chosen to challenge the rba s resolve in a global context that saw inflation worries spike including among the mighty central bankers in countries like canada the uk and the usa in case readers are not quite familiar with events or with the finer details behind the october bond market massacre for the many on the wrong side of the trend the rba has maintained it won t be raising the official cash rate until 2024 on occasion the central bank puts money where its official target lays through buying australian government bonds so that the forward yield on those bonds that expire in 2024 remains around the current cash rate of 0 10 but local bond traders had been testing the rba by selling bonds and pushing up the yield then all it took was one cpi release that surprised on the upside pushing core inflation to 2 1 and the central bank s defense of that 0 10 level got pretty much smashed into smithereens at one stage the yield on those 3 year government bonds rose to 0 80 or seven times above the level the central bank had been defending as accurate and appropriate admittedly it s not quite up there with george soros breaking the bank of england s defense of the british pound back in 1992 a victory that earned soros fund a cool 1bn at the time but the achievement should nevertheless not be underestimated either the local bond market has forced the rba explicitly into a change in official monetary policy that change has not yet been communicated but it is tangible and real because the rba can no longer defend a target of 0 10 when local bonds are suggesting otherwise this is why the message from governor philip lowe and co on melbourne cup day this year carries a lot more weight than usual the real question is however whether the rba s yet to be communicated confirmation that plans to lift australia s cash rate to a more normal level on the back of a stronger economy and stronger for longer price inflation also signals a change in overall dynamics for the local share market here i can only repeat the view i have been expressing for weeks the local bond market has overshot its implied pricing now appears well over the top way too aggressive to put it bluntly either equities are too sanguine about the way forward for inflation and bond yields or the bond market will have to calm down and retreat from its newfound trend momentum my allegiance still lays with the second scenario plus the recovery for the share market throughout october including for stocks like goodman group gmg csl csl and technologyone tne suggests i am not too far off the mark with my assessment as to how exactly this ongoing battle between the bond market and the rba will most likely unfold as i suggested last week i d be flabbergasted if philip lowe stands ready to start lifting the official cash rate from mid next year onwards and then in quick succession proceeds with a series of follow up hikes by late 2022 more realistic i think is assuming the rba has accepted defeat and might suggest sometime in 2023 looks plausible if not possible but let s wait and see shall we the second most important issue at the moment one that is receiving a lot less attention is that global economic momentum is slowing were this to go on for longer companies locally and in the usa might find it increasingly difficult to beat or meet expectations i hope we all realise that equity markets are where they are in 2021 at or near top notch valuations because corporate performances have been nothing but extraordinary on average and broadly speaking financial results in australia post august have been a lot less supportive as also proven by westpac wbc on monday but the agm season has generated more positive than negative momentum plus it has to be pointed out strong and solid businesses are still showcasing their nouse and positive operational momentum including by home consortium hmc aristocrat leisure all charter hall chc macquarie group mqg and yes even resmed rmd though the latter s cautious outlook for the coming two quarters has triggered a reversal in share price momentum while investors and market commentators tend to be worried about elevated valuations i think the biggest risk between now and february lays with companies that cannot meet guidance or expectations especially among smaller cap companies last week codan cda shares fell 18 on weak forward guidance control bionomics cbl quickly went from 70c to 47c shares in damstra holdings dtc closed at 71c on monday two months ago these were trading at 1 20 one year ago they were priced above 2 a2 milk a2m shares have fallen again and woolworths wow disappointed too today westpac shares lost more than 7 these are but a few examples but they show investors where true and tangible risk lays regime change has arrived those shenanigans in the bond market are only part of the story and in my view not even the most important part signal says sell but don t sell when is a technical sell signal not a signal to start taking risk off the table and sell some shares right now apparently as one of the technical models used by longview economics is flashing sell ceo and chief market strategist chris watling has urged clientele of the firm to ignore the signal markets have been strong and investors are nervous acknowledges watling and yes longview s sell off indicator is flashing warning signals but other indicators and models are still supportive and watling believes there is only limited evidence of euphoria in markets against a background of a still supportive macro and liquidity environment looking over global equity markets watling notes multiple indices and sectors have broken out of multi month trading patterns which should bode well for overall momentum in particular since risk appetite is recovering from the scary risk off conditions that had gripped the month of september as such watling is anticipating a period of sideways movement or a minor wobble at worst certainly nothing to get overly worried about until we re back in euphoria autumn has arrived for sydney properties and just like that market momentum in the sydney real estate market is evaporating at breakneck pace gone are the long queues for house inspections the fiery bidding wars the tactics to place an offer before the auction date what remains of course is the underquoting by agents but both on personal observation and feedback from industry sources it is clear the overall temperature for properties in sydney has cooled down remarkably and suddenly who or what is to blame remains an open question is it the end of lockdowns is it the prospect of rising interest rates is it fear for falling house prices it goes without saying a few weeks of cooling down in one market does not necessarily make for an accurate signal but the loss in overall buyer interest is remarkable to say the least and in sharp contrast with the frenzy that characterised this market until a few weeks ago let s find out how sustainable it is and in what form this reversal will start impacting on industry data and indicators covid is changing the world life after covid is gradually transforming into living with covid in most countries a recent report by boston consulting group bcg highlights this also means lots of changes of which some will be delaying a return to pre pandemic growth and conditions while changes elsewhere might prove of a more permanent character apparently pet owners worldwide have decided more online purchases are the way forward and they are unlikely to abandon the practice leading to a stronger growth trend post covid for those businesses providing supplies and services there are victims too while households are keen to get back on a plane to travel for leisure and holidays business travel might never recover and share a thought for the owners of bricks and mortar movie theatres now large parts of the population have fallen in awe with online streaming and gaming both businesses and investors will have to assess which of the changes are now essentially new trends and which ones are only of a fleeting nature as well as how to best respond to these changes see for example also jarden s research into packaging further below covid also has strengthened consumer s consciousness on environmental sustainability resulting in shifting priorities as well as in political demands plus changes in consumption reports bcg copper supercycle with a twist resources analysts at citi have held two convictions in 2021 copper is in the early stage of a multi year supercycle and a sizable sell off is on the cards for the months ahead a recent in depth study into the red metal s dynamics and outlook has further reinforced both predictions not only has citi become even more positive on the future price level and the duration of copper s superycle the team equally remains convinced the price is set to fall quite dramatically over the next six months or so put both predictions together and it won t surprise anyone the team at citi sees the next sell off as a strong buying opportunity for the longer term citi s strengthened bullishness on copper s outlook longer term is because of the global trend towards decarbonisation which translates into new supertrends for renewable power generation and electric vehicles and on current technological insights those trends depend on copper lots of it so why the big sell off in the mean time citi believes shortages in global power coal and gas markets in combination with china s weakening economic momentum added on top of more persistent shortages of chips semi conductors and container ships will ultimately result in global manufacturing stumbling into a temporary slow down and this will have ramifications for demand and the price of copper all this is happening while producers globally are ramping up production meaning the scenario of slowing demand is set to meet growing supply as we all know this is never a good outcome for a commodity such as is copper now to put some numbers to the

middle east continue to be affected by destocking and those in europe by seasonal factors our ebitda margin rose above 20 following an increase in average selling prices while the increase in cost of sales was contained despite higher raw materials and energy costs by an improved industrial performance and higher absorption of fixed costs with the continuing ramp up of operations at our industrial

2021 termination of nkktubes joint venture on november 2 2021 tenaris reached a preliminary agreement with jfe holdings inc jfe to terminate the joint venture for the operation of the seamless pipe manufacturing facility in kawasaki japan the facility located in the keihin steel complex owned by jfe has been operated by nkktubes a company owned 51 by tenaris and 49 by jfe since 2000 nkktubes has been dependent on jfe s keihin steel complex for the supply of raw materials energy and other essential services on march 27 2020 jfe had informed tenaris of its decision to permanently cease as from jfe s fiscal year ending march 2024 the operations of its steel manufacturing facilities located at the keihin complex in light of that development tenaris and jfe engaged in discussions and ultimately determined that the project was no longer economically sustainable and accordingly amicably agreed to terminate their joint venture and liquidate nkktubes the parties have agreed to cease nkktubes manufacturing operations by the end of june 2022 and to dissolve the company by the end of december 2022 tenaris and jfe highly recognize the contribution of nkktubes employees the parties

an open dialogue with suppliers local community groups and governmental entities affected by the nkktubes dissolution tenaris and jfe intend to continue discussing cooperatively with respect to other aspects of the dissolution of the joint venture with a view towards reaching a definitive agreement prior to june 2022 for information on the accounting impact of the nkktubes termination see note 23 subsequent events to the consolidated condensed interim financial statements as of september 30 2021 market background and outlook the strength of the global economic rebound so far this year and lower levels of investment in the energy sector over the past years have resulted in a tighter energy market as opec countries continue to contain production levels and large publicly listed us shale producers restrain capital spending global oil inventories have declined below 5 year average levels and are supportive of high prices drilling activity in the u s and canada continues to increase led by private operators and further gradual increases are likely in the coming months in latin america drilling activity has shown a recovery this year with higher activity in the vaca muerta shale in argentina and in colombia as well as the offshore regions of brazil mexico and guyana in the eastern hemisphere drilling activity is now recovering gradually and this recovery should extend further in the coming months though demand for octg will continue to be tempered by ongoing destocking in key middle east markets we anticipate that sales will show a further increase in the fourth quarter again led by north america where the market has absorbed excess octg inventories and prices are increasing our ebitda margin in the fourth quarter should remain close to the current level as price increases compensate for raw material energy and logistic cost increases on october 27 2021 in response to a petition from u s steel tubular products a small number of other u s domestic welded octg producers and a steelworkers union the u s department of commerce doc initiated anti dumping duty investigations on octg imports from mexico argentina and russia and countervailing duty investigations on octg imports from russia and south korea the international trade commission itc is required to make a preliminary determination of injury in case of a negative itc determination the investigations will be terminated otherwise the investigations will proceed until the doc and the itc make final determinations tenaris which imports octg from argentina and mexico to complement its production in the united states believes that the petition is unjustified and intends to vigorously challenge any claim that its imports are causing or threatening injury to the u s domestic octg industry at this time tenaris cannot predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the potential impact if any that the resolution of this matter may have on tenaris s business over the past 15 years tenaris has realized substantial investments more than any other company in acquisitions and new production to build up a competitive octg production system in the united states we believe we are well placed to continue

avast sweeping change towards a green economy is now being pushed by forces that may make an educated citizen rather uncomfortable of course news reports flash daily showcasing the brave young movement of eco warriors led by sweden s forever 15 year old greta thunberg or america s 17 year old jamie margolin who have become a force across europe and america leading such movements as the extinction rebellion this is zero hour the sunrise movement and children s eco crusade the young face of alexandria ocasio cortez daily sells the idea that the only way for outdated capitalist forces that have plagued the world for decades to be replaced is by imposing a sweeping green new deal that priorities de carbonization as a goal for humanity rather than continuing to allow the mindless forces of the markets to determine our destiny when eu president ursula von der leyen had stepped into her office she lost no time attacking china s belt and road initiative which is ironically representing a true 21st century new deal by saying some are buying their influence by investing in dependence from ports and roads we go the european way what is the european way not the development plans of charles de gaulle or konrad adenauer who envisioned industrial growth and increasing population as positives but rather a green new deal von der leyen then announced that i want europe to become the first co2 neutral continent in the world by 2050 i will put forward a green new deal for europe in my first 100 days in office attacking the mindless forces of the market and vested power structures of capitalism are not bad things to do but why must we de carbonize re regulating the too big to fail banks is long overdue but why do so many assume that a green new deal won t just empower those same forces that have run havoc upon the world for the past half century and just cause more death and starvation than has already been suffered under globalization one might only think to even ask such questions by first confronting the uncomfortable fact that behind such young cardboard cutouts as thunberg margolin cortez or the green new deal are figures whom one would not associate with humanitarianism by any measure green bonds and oligarchs when we begin to pull back the curtain we quickly run into figures like prince charles who recently met with the heads of 18 commonwealth countries to consolidate climate emergency legislation which was promptly passed in the uk and canadian parliaments at the end of the meeting charles said that we have 18 months to save the world from climate change and called for increasing the amount of private sector finance flowing towards the supporting of sustainable development throughout the commonwealth following the royal decree the bank of england and some of the dirtiest banks in the rothschild city of london web of finance have promoted green financial instruments led by green bonds to redirect pension plans and mutual funds towards green projects that no one in their right minds would ever invest in willfully the ecological social governance index esgi has now been set up across 51 of germany s banks including the derivatives bomb waiting to blow named deutschebank leading bankers supporting the esgi like mark carney of the bank of england have said that over 6 5 trillion euros could be mobilized under this new index which currently accounts for about 160 billion the creation of these green bonds run hand in hand with the bail in mechanisms which have now been implemented across the trans atlantic nations in order to steal trillions of dollars of from pension funds rrsps and mutual funds the next time a bailout is needed to prop up the too big to fails which currently sit atop a 1 2 trillion derivatives bubble waiting to blow on top of heading the bank of england former goldman sachs man carney has also endorsed the financial stability board s task force on climate related financial disclosures which was created in 2015 and was used as a guideline for the uk government s july 2019 white paper green finance strategy transforming finance for a greener future the white paper proposed to consolidate the uk s position as a global hub for green finance and positioning the uk at the head of green financial innovation and data and analytics endorsed by institutions representing 118 trillion of assets globally the carney led task force also spawned the green finance initiative in 2016 which is now a primary vehicle designed to divert international capital flows into green tech carney s former employer at goldman sachs has also created a green index for virtuous investing including two new sustainability indices to promote heavy investment in to green infrastructure called cdp environment ew and cdp eurozone ew the acronym cdp originates from the climate disclosure project a london based think tank that generated goldman sachs program goldman sachs marine abiad promoted the cdp index saying on july 10 we are convinced that sustainable finance enables financial markets to play a virtuous role in the economy just in case you thought the extinction rebellion was somehow untouched by the hand of social engineers a leading figure behind the movement named alex evans was a former consultant on the prince s international sustainability unit and co author of the us national intelligence council s global trends 2025 a transformed world which became an environmental foreign policy blueprint for the obama administration in 2008 currently evans also runs the collective psychology project where psychology meets politics other leading british intelligence figures managing the extinction rebellion movement included farhana yamin and sam gaell of chatham house the controlling institution behind the new york council on foreign relations could a benevolent green dictatorship be a good thing the devil s advocate speaks can t we presume that these central banks oligarchs and hedge fund managers just care about the environment so what if they are trying to modify humanity s behaviour in order to save the environment after all humanity itself is a selfish gluttonous pollution making machine and isn t better for everyone if those enlightened elite just transform the world economy so that we consume less and think more about the future if this line of thinking approximates something you ve felt inside yourself then you ve been brainwashed of course the world has turned into a consumerist cult over the past few decades which has sacrificed long term thinking for short term gain and of course we need a re organization of the system thunberg and the green new dealers aren t wrong about that stuff that s all fine and dandy but if you think that going along with the types of reform that aspires to put dollar values on reducing carbon footprints or spreading low quality and very expensive windmills and solar panels across the globe with the expectation that somehow these sources of energy will not cause a vast collapse of industrial capacity of civilization and an associated loss of capacity to sustain human life then you are fooling yourself one kilowatt of windmill energy is only the same as one kilowatt of nuclear power when applied to a mathematical equation but not in real life when applied to capital intensive work functions needed to melt industrial steel run machine tools power a vast agro industrial complex high speed rail system or construct things like belt and road initiative green energy sources do not come even close to cutting the iron the issue has always been population control the oligarchs running the grand green design since the club of rome s sir alexander king began the limits to growth study in 1970 knew that green low energy flux density sources of energy would constrict global population and that is exactly what they wanted sir king said as much in 1990 when he wrote in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome the real enemy then is humanity itself sir king was after all just following the lead of unesco founder and eugenics president sir julian huxley who wrote in 1946 political unification in some sort of world government will be required even though any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable it was only a few years later that huxley would co found the world wildlife fund alongside prince philip mountbatten and prince bernhardt of the netherlands all three were present at bernhardt s founding meeting of the bilderberg group to advance this grand conversion of society into a willful self extermination in 1954 and while huxley wasn t present in 1970 the other two oligarchs co founded the 1001 nature trust alongside 999 other wealthy misanthropes to fund the blossoming environmental movement these forces were also behind the coup d état in america which put the trilateral commission in power under jimmy carter and unleashed the controlled disintegration of the us economy from 1978 1982 this will be the topic of another study this grouping led by zbigniew brzezinski not only played the radical islam card against the soviet union but also established a program of population reduction through the promotion of green energy sources long before it was popular the oligarchs that are currently trying to reform humanity today don t care about the environment prince philip and bernhardt have been recorded to have killed more endangered species on safari than most people have killed mosquitos they just don t like people especially thinking people thinking people who question how and why arbitrary rules are applied to justify wars poverty and oligarchism which destroys lives both now and in the future the belt and road initiative and the tendency to grow the human population both quantitatively and qualitatively which such great projects entail is the target of the green new deal the legacy of scientific and technological progress that launched western civilization out of a dark age and into a renaissance in the 15th century is under attack because it is that lost ethic which the oligarchy knows may yet be awoken and which would bring the west into harmony with the russia china program for growth and development under a philosophy of win win cooperation both on earth and also in space the effects of the ideas of the renaissance coincided with the greatest rate of discoveries of universal principles as mankind sought to come to know the mind of god by studying the book of nature with a heart of love and attitude of humility exemplified in the figure of leonardo da vinci the explosion of new technologies that arose not only revolutionized astronomy medicine and engineering but gave birth to the modern industrial economy which coincided with the greatest rise of population in history this exponential rise has been used by malthusians for centuries as the proof that mankind is just another cancerous growth on the purity of mother gaia so if you don t agree with humans cancer philosophy and want something a bit more optimistic in your life then support a real new deal today matthew ehret is the editor in chief of the canadian patriot review senior fellow at the american university in moscow bri expert on tactical talk and has authored 3 volumes of untold history of canada book series in 2019 he co founded the montreal based rising tide foundation

devon energy wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of october 20 2021 with that i ll turn the call over to rick rick muncrief president and chief executive officer thank you scott it s great to be here this morning we appreciate everyone taking the time to join us on the call today devon s third quarter results were outstanding once again showcasing the power of our delaware focused asset portfolio and then the benefits of our financially driven business model our team s unwavering focus on operations excellence has established impressive momentum that has allowed us to capture efficiencies accelerate free cash flow reduce leverage and return of market leading amount of cash to shareholders simply put we are delivering on exactly what our shareholder friendly business model was really designed for and that is to lead the energy industry in capital discipline and cash returns now moving to slide 4 while our strategy is a clear differentiator for devon the success of this approach is underpinned by our high quality asset portfolio that is headlined by our world class acreage position in the delaware basin so with this advantaged portfolio we possess a multi decade resource opportunity in the best position plays on the u s cost curve and with this sustainable resource base we are positioned to win multiple ways with our balanced commodity exposure while our production is leveraged to oil nearly half our volumes come from natural gas and ngls providing us with meaningful revenue exposure to these valuable products this balance and diversification are critically important to devon s long term success as you can see on slide 5 the strength of our operations and the financial benefits of our strategy were on full display with our third quarter results this is evidenced by several noteworthy accomplishments so including we completed another batch of excellent wells in delaware basin that drove volumes 5 above our guidance we maintained our capital allocation in a very disciplined way by limiting our reinvestment rates to only 30 of our cash flow we re continuing to then the capture synergies and drive per unit cost lower we are also achieving a more than eightfold increase in our free cash flow we re increasing our fixed and variable dividend payout by 71 we re also improving our financial strength by reducing net debt 16 in the quarter overall it was another tremendous quarter for devon and i especially want to congratulate our employees and our investors for these special results now moving to slide 6 while 2021 is wrapping up to be a great year for devon the investment thesis only gets stronger and as i look ahead to next year although we re now still working to finalize the details of our 2022 plan i want to emphasize that our strategic framework remains unchanged and we will continue to prioritize free cash flow generation over the pursuit of volume growth as we have stated many times in the past we have no intention of adding incremental barrels into the market until demand side fundamentals sustainably recover and it becomes evident that opec spare oil capacity that s effectively absorbed by the world markets with this disciplined approach and to sustain our production profile in 2022 we are directionally planning on an upstream capital program in the range of 1 9 billion to 2 2 billion importantly with the operating efficiency gains and improved economies of scale we can fund this program at a wti breakeven price of around 30 this low breakeven funding level is a testament to the great work the team has done over the past few years to streamline our cost structure and to really optimize capital efficiency being positioned as a low cost producer provides us with a wide margin of safety to continue to execute on all facets of our cash return model with our 2022 outlook devon will have one of the most advantaged cash flow growth outlooks in the industry at today s prices with the full benefit of the merger synergies and an improved hedge book we re positioned for cash flow growth of more than 40 compared to 2021 and as you can see on the graph this strong outlook translates into a free cash flow yield of 18 at an 80 wti price the key takeaway here is that 2022 is shaping up to be an excellent year for devon shareholders now jumping ahead to slide 8 the top priority of our free cash flow is then fund our fixed plus variable dividend this unique dividend policy is specifically designed for our commodity driven business and provides us the flexibility to return more cash to shareholders than virtually any other opportunity in the markets today now to demonstrate this point so we ve included a simple comparison of our estimated dividend yield in 2022 based on our preliminary guidance as you can see devon s implied dividend is not only more than double that of the energy sector but this yield is vastly superior to us in every sector in the s p 500 index in fact at today s pricing devon s yield is more than seven times higher than the average company that is represented in the s p 500 index now that s truly something to think about in the yield starved world we currently live in and moving on to slide 9 with our improving free cash flow outlook and strong financial position i m excited to announce the next step in our cash return strategy with the authorization of a 1 billion share repurchase program this program is an equivalent to approximately 4 of devon s current market capitalization and is authorized through year end 2022 jeff will cover this topic in greater detail later in the call but this opportunistic buyback is a great complement to our dividend strategy and provides us with another capital allocation tool to enhance per share results for the shareholders now skipping ahead to slide 11 and to close out my prepared remarks i want to summarize devon s unique investment proposition through three simple charts beginning on the far left chart of our business is positioned to generate cash flow growth of more than 20 40 in 2022 which is vastly superior to most other opportunities in the market as you can see in the middle chart this strong growth translates into an 18 free cash flow yield that will be deployed to dividends buybacks and the continued improvement of our balance sheet and lastly on the far right chart and even with all of these outstanding financial attributes we still trade at a very attractive valuation especially compared to the broader market indices we believe this to be another catalyst for our share price appreciation as more and more of the investors discover devon s unique investment proposition and with that i ll turn the call over to clay to cover some of the great operational results we delivered in the third quarter clay clay gaspar chief operating officer thank you rick hey good morning everybody in summary devon s third quarter impressive results were the result of tremendous execution across nearly every aspect of our business we had wins in environmental and safety performance operational improvements continued cultural alignment strong well productivity cost control significant margin expansion and ultimately excellent returns on the invested capital this recurring trend in our operational excellence while managing significant organizational change and macro stress has now been established over multiple quarters and is a testament to the devon employees and strong leadership throughout the organization as i look forward to 22 and beyond i believe we re positioned to continue delivering but also take our performance to an even higher level of cohesion and productivity providing the energy to fuel today s modern world is critically important work i m very proud of what we do and how we do it as i look forward to devon s near and also long term goals i m confident in our ability to deliver on society s ever increasing expectations let s turn to slide 13 and we can dig into the delaware basin devon s operational performance in the quarter is once again driven by our world class delaware basin assets where roughly 80 of our capital was deployed with this capital investment we continue to maintain steady activity levels by running 13 operated rigs and four frac crews bringing on 52 wells during the quarter as you can see in the bottom left of the slide this is just focused development program translated into another quarter of robust volume growth and our continued cost performance allowed us to capture the full impact of the higher commodity prices turning your attention to the map on the right side our well productivity across the basin continue to be outstanding in the quarter with the results headlined by our boundary raider project some may recall that this is not the first time we ve delivered on impressive results from this well pad back in 2018 our original boundary raider project that s developed a good package of bone spring wells that set a record for the highest rate wells ever brought online in the delaware basin fast forward to today this addition of the boundary raider went further downhole to develop an overpressured section in the upper wolfcamp this project also delivered exceptionally high rates with our best well delivering an initial 30 day production rates of 7 300 boe per day of which more than that more than 60 of that was oil i call that pretty good for a secondary target moving a bit east into lea county another result for this quarter was the cobra project where the team executed on a 3 mile wolfcamp development this pad outperformed our predrill expectations by more than 10 with the top well achieving 30 day rates as high as 6 300 boe per day in addition to the strong flow rates this activity helped us prove the economics of the wolfcamp inventory in this area to further deepening the resource rich opportunity we hold in the delaware turning to slide 14 with the strong operating results we delivered this quarter high margin oil production in the delaware basin continue to expand and rapidly advance growing 39 year over year importantly the returns on invested capital to deliver this growth were some of the highest i have seen in my career bolstered by rising strip prices and our capital efficiency improvements we have delivered this year these efficiencies are evidenced on the right hand chart where our average d c costs improved to 554 per lateral foot in the third quarter a decrease of 41 from just a few years ago while we have likely found the bottom of this cycle earlier this year the team continues to be able to make operational breakthroughs that have thus far fought back most of the inflationary pressure we continue to win from a fresh perspective blending teams and also still relatively we re still working to know each other pretty early on these accomplishments are clearly demonstrated and the great work our team has done to drive improvements across the entire planning and execution of our resource to maintain this high level of performance into 2022 and we are focused on staying out ahead of the inflationary pressures that are impacting not just our industry but all aspects of the broader society while our consistency and scale in the delaware are a huge advantage the supply chain team is working hard to anticipate issues mitigate bottlenecks and work with the asset teams to adjust plans to optimize our cost structure and future capital activity turning to slide 15 another asset i d like to put in the spotlight today is our position in the anadarko basin where we have a concentrated 300 000 net acre position in the liquids rich window of the play as you may know rick and i both have a historical tie to this basin and we re thrilled to get to see the great work that our teams are doing to unlock this value for investors a key objective for us this year in the anadarko basin is to reestablish operational continuity by leveraging the drilling carry from our joint venture agreement with dow by way of background in late 2019 we formed a partnership with dow in a promoted deal where dow earns half of our interest on 133 undrilled locations in exchange for 100 million drilling carry with the benefits of this drilling carry we re drilling around 30 wells this year and our initial wells from this activity were brought on during the quarter the four well miller miller project is an up spaced woodford development in canadian counter county and is off to a great start with both our d c costs and well productivity outperforming pre drill expectations initial 30 day rates averaged 2 700 boe per day and completed well costs came in under budget at around 8 million per well while i m proud of how well the team hit the ground running now as we get into our processes lined out and efficiencies dialed in i foresee material improvements in well costs ahead the leverage returns from this carried activity will complete will compete effectively for capital with any asset in our portfolio in fact the strength of natural gas and ngl pricing the performance we re also seeing that in the anadarko basin will likely command relatively more capital than it did in 21 moving to slide 16 while the delaware basin is clearly the growth engine of our company and we re excited about the upside for the anadarko we also have several high quality assets in the oil fairway of the u s that generates substantial free cash flow while these assets don t typically grab the headlines their strong performance is central to this continued success of our strategy these teams are doing great work to improve our environmental footprint drive the capital program optimize base production and hopefully keeping our cost structure low as an example williston will generate over 700 million of 2021 free cash flow collectively these assets are on pace to generate nearly 1 5 billion of free cash flow this year lastly on slide 17 with our diversified portfolio concentrated in the very best u s resource plays we have a deep inventory of opportunities that underpin the long term sustainability of our business model so as you may have heard me talk about in prior quarters we have a brutal capital allocation process in regards to the competitiveness of how we seek the best investment mix for the company this is the first step of this process is to make sure that all the teams are working from the same assumptions and inputs since the close of our merger earlier this year we have undertaken a very disciplined and rigorous approach to characterize risk force rank the opportunity set across our portfolio this inventory disclosure is the result of our detailed subsurface work and evaluation across our portfolio that we converted into a single consolidated platform to ensure consistency turning your attention to the middle bar on the chart at the current pace of activity we possess more than a decade of low risk and high return inventory of what we believe to be in a mid cycle price deck as you would expect about 70 of our inventory resides in the delaware basin providing the depth of inventory to sustain our strong capital efficiency for many years to come let me be clear and this exercise we are focused on compiling a very important slice of our total inventory this summary is not meant to convey the full extent of the possible with these incredible resources these are really operated essentially all long lateral up spaced wells that deliver competitive returns in a 55 oil environment moving to the bar on the far right of the chart we also expect inventory depth to continue to expand as we capture additional efficiencies optimize spacing and further delineate the rich geologic column across our very acreage footprint expect we expect a significant portion of the upside opportunities to convert into our derisked inventory over time so the examples of this upside include the massive resource potential in the lower wolfcamp intervals continued appraisal success in the powder river basin and the significant liquids rich opportunity we possess in the anadarko basin the bottom line here is that we have that in abundance of high economic opportunity to not only sustain but grow our cash flow per share for many years to come with that i ll turn the call over to jeff for the financial review jeff ritenour chief financial officer thanks clay i d like to spend my time today discussing the substantial progress we ve made advancing our financial strategy and highlight the next steps we plan to take to increase cash returns to shareholders a good place to start is with the review of devon s financial performance in the third quarter where devon s earnings and our cash flow per share growth rapidly expanded and comfortably exceeded consensus estimates operating cash flow for the third quarter totaled 1 6 billion an impressive increase of 46 compared to last quarter this level of cash flow generation comfortably funded our capital spending requirements and generated 1 1 billion of free cash flow in the quarter this result represents the highest amount of free cash flow generation devon has ever delivered in a single quarter and is a powerful example of the financial results in our cash return and that the business model can deliver turning your attention to slide 7 with this significant stream of free cash flow a differentiating component of our financial strategy is our ability and willingness to accelerate the return of cash to shareholders through our fixed plus variable dividend framework this dividend strategy has been uniquely designed to provide us the flexibility to optimize the return of cash to shareholders across a variety of market conditions through the cycle under our framework we pay a fixed dividend every quarter and evaluate a variable distribution of up to 50 of the remaining free cash flow so with the strong financial results we delivered this quarter the board approved a 71 increase in our dividend payout versus last quarter to 0 84 per share this is the fourth quarter in a row we have increased the dividend and is by far the highest quarterly dividend payout in devon s 50 year history as you can see on the chart to the left at current market prices we expect our dividend growth story to only strengthen in 2022 in fact at today s pricing we are on pace to nearly double our dividend next year moving to slide 10 in addition to higher dividends we ve also returned value to shareholders through our efforts to reduce debt and improve our balance sheet so far this year we ve made significant progress toward this initiative by retiring over 1 2 billion of outstanding notes in conjunction with this absolute debt reduction we ve also added to our liquidity building a 2 3 billion cash balance at quarter end with this substantial cash build and reduction in debt we ve reached this debt to ebitda leverage target of one turn or less even with this advantaged balance sheet we re not done making improvements we have identified additional opportunities to improve our financial strength by retiring approximately 1 0 billion of premium excuse me low premium debt in 2022 and 2023 importantly devon has the flexibility to then execute on this debt reduction with cash already accumulated on the balance sheet and to route round out my prepared remarks this morning i d like to provide some thoughts on the 1 billion share repurchase program we announced last night while the top priority for free cash flow remains the funding of our market leading dividend yield we also believe that this buyback authorization provides us another excellent capital allocation tool to enhance per share results for shareholders given the cyclical nature of our business we ll be very disciplined with this authorization only transacting when our equity trades at a discounted valuation to historical multiples and in multiple levels of our highest quality peers we believe the double digit free cash flow yield our equity delivers as outlined on slide 6 represents a unique buying opportunity the reduction in outstanding shares further improves our impressive cash flow per share growth and adds to the variable dividend per share for our shareholders with these disciplined criteria guiding our decision making we ll look to opportunistically repurchase our equity in the open market once our corporate blackout expires later this week so in summary the financial strategy is working well we have excellent liquidity and our business is generating substantial free cash flow we re positioned to significantly grow our dividend payout to over the next year the go forward business will have an ultra low leverage ratio of a turn or less and we ll look to boost per share results is really opportunistically repurchasing our shares and with that i ll now turn the call back to rick for some closing comments rick muncrief president and chief executive officer thank you jeff great job in closing today i d like to highlight a few things number one devon is meeting the demands of investors with our capital discipline earnings and cash flow growth market leading dividend payout debt reduction and now a share buyback program number two devon is also meeting the demands of our market with strong oil production results great exposure to natural gas and ngls along with our consistent execution and number three lastly devon is also meeting the demands of society by providing a reliable energy before this pandemic during the pandemic and as we emerge from the pandemic and so our people throughout the five states where we operate continue to show up for work and work safely we didn t overreact with our capital program during the pandemic like many others did we actually strengthened the company with a merger and finally we re laser focused on then achieving the stated short term midterm and long term esg targets we re proud of the work we ve done and look forward to continuing meeting the needs of investors the market and society for the foreseeable future devon is a premier energy company and we re excited about the value we ll be able to consistently provide to our important stakeholders and with that i will now turn the call back over to scott for q a scott coody vice president investor relations thanks rick we ll now open the call to q a with that operator we ll take our first question questions answers operator your first question comes from the line of arun jayaram with jpmorgan securities arun jayaram jpmorgan chase and company analyst yeah good morning team rick i wanted to maybe start off talking about the inventory depths slide that you put out 11 plus years of a low risk development opportunity 70 in the delaware basin we have seen a couple of large permian basin trades with conoco and pioneer earlier this year so i want to get your thoughts on how you re thinking about portfolio renewal just given that inventory depth and perhaps clay could also comment on the ability of to derisk some of the wells in that 2 500 well bucket including that deeper wolfcamp zone rick muncrief president and chief executive officer yeah it s a great question arun and i ll have clay weigh in and provide some more details so the way we re looking at it is number one as clay has talked about we did a very comprehensive deep dive we and once again these numbers are strictly operated so we have not operated projects out there that are not in this camp we wanted to make it really clear that these are operated wells where we re going to control the drilling completion activities we also contemplated many of the sections that have been set up as 1 mile laterals are now 2 mile laterals with some of the acreage consolidations that we ve seen and in some cases where you ve got the federal units especially in the mexico side we ve seen now the opportunities to drill more and more of the 3 mile laterals and you saw the results we just put up not only this past quarter but over the last year or so so really really attractive opportunities i think there s going to continue to be opportunities for us to replenish our inventory there and a lot of this you mentioned a couple of transactions that have taken place in the broader permian but specifically in the on the delaware side you laid out the conoco s purchase of the shell acreage i can tell you arun that we operate wells that are the shell had non operated and has interest in we have opportunities to do a lot more trading and i think optimizing our portfolio that s the first thing i ll add to and i think that s going to optimize even further optimize the returns we get and then there s there are going to be other small opportunities out there we re really focused on bolt on type of things that really make industrial make a lot of sense from an industrial perspective and so i think you ll continue to see that i ll also just weigh in over the last two days we ve had an internal tech conference and when i look at the unbelievable technology that s being employed by devon today as we find more and more opportunities within the acreage we are already operating i got real excited and i think the entire organization is excited about what the future looks like and so those are a couple of ideas that we have and i m confident that our team will continue to keep a long runway of inventory opportunities in front of us clay you may want to add to that clay gaspar chief operating officer yeah thanks rick i ll just kind of reiterate a couple of your points number one arun as you well know we re always trying to drill our best well next and it s amazing to me as long as we ve all been in this business today we re drilling the best wells we ve ever drilled and it s not because we save them until today it s because our teams have continued to innovate get better how do we get on the efficiency side how do we figure out how to wring out the most optimal amount of resource from these incredible plays how do we understand the plays what rick was just talking about some of the technology we re involving today is absolutely outstanding second tip of the hat i d like to provide is to the land team and rick mentioned this the incredible work that s been done in trading around our core areas just makes us all better i mean both parties typically in the trade where we re like for like exchanging at the same time we re extending laterals we re building efficiencies in the ground floor level and that just makes us better and so those things will continue specific to your comment on moving some of the derisk the upside inventory to the derisked inventory absolutely that will happen the luxury that we have today is because we have so much quality out in front of us we don t have to invest a significant amount into that derisking program so we could accelerate it faster but we re going to be very measured about this by far most of our investment is just plowing the ground driving down costs getting exceptionally efficient and just ringing out that free cash flow machine that we talk about strategically so that will i have a high degree of confidence in that 2 500 wells and by the way it s a whole lot more than 2 500 we ll eventually roll into the derisk bucket and it s not too much of a stretch to say when we drill those some of those will be the best wells that we ve ever drill even five and 10 years from now arun jayaram jpmorgan chase and company analyst great thanks for that and my follow up is for jeff i wondered if you could just maybe provide a little bit more color on how management the board s thinking about the buyback jeff you mentioned that maybe post the blackout in a couple of days you would opportunistically look to be back perhaps using the buyback authorization but i wanted to get a sense of maybe you could better define this sense of opportunistic nature of the buyback and thoughts on do you think you d get the billion dollars done by year end 2022 jeff ritenour chief financial officer absolutely arun i mean where we sit today and we look at and i would point you back to slide 6 which was in our deck if you look at you know pick your price deck about 15 to 20 free cash flow yield we think an investment in devon stock is an absolute no brainer where we sit today you compare that to the multiples we re trading at relative to our highest quality peers probably again a half turn to a turn below those folks and i think it was a pretty easy decision for our board to go ahead and approve the billion dollar share repurchase and so as i made comments in our open once we get to the blackout here at the end of this week we expect to jump into the market and really get after it so we re excited about the investment opportunity that we have married with the fixed and variable dividend framework i mean just to be candid there just isn t anybody else in our sector that s providing this kind of cash returns to our shareholders arun jayaram jpmorgan chase and company analyst great thanks a lot operator your next question comes from the line of neil mehta with goldman sachs neil mehta goldman sachs analyst good morning team and nice quarter here i want to start off on the ngl side of the equation because it doesn t get enough attention in your portfolio but it s been a hidden driver for a lot of this cash flow generation can you just remind us how that business is set up here as you think about fourth quarter into 2022 obviously anadarko is a little bit more liquids rich and how that changes where that asset in particular competes within the portfolio clay gaspar chief operating officer yeah no neil it s a great question we appreciate you making the point for us because again it s been a real high point for us throughout this year obviously with the tailwind that we ve seen on ngl prices just to remind folks in 2021 we re producing over 130 000 barrels a day of ngls and i would expect moving into 2022 you ll see that grow a bit moving forward so it s been a really nice tailwind for us and as you point out it s not an insignificant portion of the cash flow that we re delivering and the free cash flow that we re delivering this year and expect that to grow you know moving into 22 rick muncrief president and chief executive officer really to expand on that a little bit and you have certainly you and your firm have your own view but ours is that we re pretty constructive on ngl pricing as the world wide economy just continues to get stronger and stronger and so i think a point s been made it s a real nice not real nice position to be in when you can see these kind of volumes to be put up and helps cash flow in a big way neil mehta goldman sachs analyst yeah i agree with that point and then the follow up is just when you think about moving outside of this maintenance mode type of program that the business model that s been set up here is generate a lot of free cash and return that capital to shareholders but when do you think it makes us actually pursue a modest degree of growth and what are the signals that you re looking for whether it s demand signals opec spare capacity to make that call rick muncrief president and chief executive officer yeah i think what we re looking at it neil is we re really focused as we said in our remarks on cash flow per share growth and it s when you start looking at 40 cash flow growth and in 22 over 21 just keeping your volumes flat absolute volume growth really doesn t have appeal we just need to we need to make sure that the as we said the opec barrels are back in the market and we ll watch things we ll be thoughtful but if you think about our retiring or repurchasing actually for 4 of your shares you are going to get some per share production growth and i think most of the investors that we talk to that s plenty good for them and that s how we re thinking about it neil mehta goldman sachs analyst thanks rick operator your next question comes from the line of doug leggate with bank of america doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning everybody i ve had some phone line issues this morning so i just want to check if you can all hear me ok rick muncrief president and chief executive officer we sure can doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst excellent well thanks rick for the presentation i got a couple of questions i guess the first one is on the break even and i just want to be sure i m reading this right so your 30 sustaining capital breakeven is using 250 gas which is obviously quite a bit below where the strip is right now so given your comments about your gas exposure if you use current strip what do you think your sustainable breakeven is and if i may tag on maybe for that what is the embedded cash tax assumption in that breakeven clay gaspar chief operating officer yeah doug just i frankly haven t done the math to give you an exact number but it s certainly lower and i would guess somewhere in the mid 20s would be the breakeven using the current strip of the call it 3 to 4 on gas prices and then ngl as well doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst on a cash tax basis clay gaspar chief operating officer yeah yeah on a cash tax basis you ll see we kind of noted that on again on slide 6 in our presentation where things sit today and where commodity prices sit we ll have to see how the rest of this year shakes out to give you an exact answer on where our nol balance will land but generally speaking we think it s going to be around 3 billion that we ll carry forward into 2022 on top of that we ll have some foreign tax credits which will also help us shield some of our income in next year so again depending on where commodity prices shake out we ll be in a pretty good position to shield a fair amount of that taxable income however we re guessing it s going to be somewhere in the mid single digits will kind of be our current tax rate as we move in 2022 and that s what we ve assumed in the forecast that we ve outlined on that slide 6 that i referenced earlier doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst ok thanks for that my follow up is first of all rick i m delighted to see the buyback introduced and we ll see how that plays out but i guess the question i have is your variable dividend is big not in the context of the total cash return but i think my view on this which is that it s somewhat backward looking i don t think the market necessarily gives you a discounted pull forward variable dividend as something that they re prepared to recognize so buybacks a more permanent buy here north per share who should we expect the split between the two to evolve over time rick muncrief president and chief executive officer well i think we ll the way we re looking at it now the variable the dividend concept this is i guess here in december will be the fourth quarterly distribution so i d say still relatively new it s been very very well received we think it s very prudent we agree with your comments on the share repurchase those are permanent and meaningful but i think with the variable dividend we ve had a lot of discussion some people have really asked us about are we wanting to bump that up to say a 75 threshold or something i think for us we think the 50 is a very very prudent level as the others plays out we talked to the base dividend this variable dividend now the share repurchase and then as jeff talk about the debt reduction those are all really i think add up to a very very compelling story for shareholders something that we feel you don t feel really good about so i think that we ll see how the share repurchase program goes i think the question will be down this question you re asking give us a few months give us a few quarters and let s see how things play out and what really makes sense but that s really how we re looking at it i think a balanced approach is pretty hard to compete with and jeff you may have some additional comments here jeff ritenour chief financial officer i would just i would reiterate that last point doug which is we feel like we re delivering all of the above so whatever your favorite mechanism for cash returns an investment in devon is delivering that as rick mentioned as we move into next year we settle out through the budget figure out down to that down the line item how we think the business is going to perform my guess is we re going to have opportunities to even build further on this framework with the potential to raise the fixed dividend on a go forward basis and then we ll reevaluate other additions to the framework as we move through the year and and see cash belt doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst guys let me sort of close out with a comment because you ve led the market on this you ve been early to it and i think you re really changing the perception of what the ngi business model can look like so congratulations on how things turn out jeff ritenour chief financial officer thanks doug operator your next question comes from the line of jeanine wai with barclays jeanine wai barclays analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking our questions rick muncrief president and chief executive officer absolutely good morning jeanine and thanks for sending the picture congratulations on the young one jeanine wai barclays analyst thank you she s adorable and thanks for looking maybe just following up on arun and doug s questions on the buyback can you just address how you specifically determine the size and the timeframe of the authorization and should we think about you revisiting either the buyback or the percent variable payout when you kind of get through a good portion of that billion dollar gross debt reduction or are those decisions independent i know you just mentioned that the 50 is prudent at this time you ll have to see how the business performs and it sounds like maybe in a couple of quarters you might revisit that but just maybe digging a little bit deeper on how it relates to the debt reduction jeff ritenour chief financial officer yeah that s right jeanine appreciate the question we as i mentioned just on the last question i think that the first thing we ll probably look to add onto our framework would be a potential raise of the fixed dividend but absolutely we re going to reconsider as we work our way through next year shall we upsize the share repurchase program beyond the billion dollars if we get to the end of the year and our cash build exceeds our expectations i think you could consider a special dividend and then certainly we would reevaluate the 50 threshold on the variable dividend however i would just point out we think there s real value and consistency of maintaining that framework and so i think generally you ll see us work around the edges on some of these other items that we ve talked about but those are all things that we ll debate with the board as we work our way through the year to your question about how do we determine size really it was just a function of looking forward with our projections using what we think is a rational price deck normalized price deck and a billion dollars felt like a fair amount but again as i mentioned earlier we ll reevaluate that as we work our way through it and see how it performs and certainly we ll have the potential to upsize that with our board jeanine wai barclays analyst great sounds great maybe my our second question is on the 22 budget so we know there s a few more moving pieces in the midstream side and in the other buckets as well are there any opportunities that you can walk us through on the midstream and the other bucket side and how those should trend every year now that the integration of wtx is complete and i think on the upstream side the 1 9 billion to 2 2 billion forecast is there anything else there other than inflation that is driving the range for example anything on efficiencies or anything macro related clay gaspar chief operating officer hey jeanine thanks for the question this is clay yeah i would say on the e p part specifically we all we love that our team continues to be more efficient there s always that hope and that opportunity ahead i can tell you we ve got some pretty good headwinds coming toward us as an industry inflationary wise so will we be able to fully offset inflation in this case we have not assumed that we would we ve baked in something north of 10 call it 10 to 15 inflation into our e p operations and then the above the other items midstream the other spin some of the corporate capital and the esg spin that s something that we re probably going to lean into a little harder this year in the range you could probably say about 200 million which would probably be sort of a high watermark i don t expect this every year but i think there s some opportunities for us to really take some significant steps to build out a little bit ahead make sure that we are being a little bit more forward thinking on some of our infrastructure and that will allow us to run our operations smoother including important factors like environmental so i think this is kind of gives you an idea of what we re thinking about and of course we ll continue to refine this as we seek board approval and next visit with you guys we ll give offer more details jeanine wai barclays analyst thank you very much rick muncrief president and chief executive officer thanks operator your next question comes from the line of john freeman with raymond james john freeman raymond james analyst good morning guys rick muncrief president and chief executive officer hey john john freeman raymond james analyst just kind of a follow up on jeanine s question so you ve mentioned that the drilling efficiencies that you have done a remarkable job on that have compressed the cycle times has been pulling forward activity i m curious on 2022 preliminary plan does that assume that you ll have a static rig and fractures relative to the 16 rigs five crews you have currently or does that assume potentially doing more with less next year rick muncrief president and chief executive officer yeah i would say john it s directionally the same we consider it flat activity you know how it works we ll depending on working interest other factors rigs will come and go we re always upgrading fleets contract rolls off contract rolls on but and directionally we are flat and consistent in our operations and i can tell you it s part of our inflationary hedge is that consistency as we look to our suppliers and try and get goal alignment with these important partners i can tell you what they want to know is that we re going to be very consistent in our operations through the fourth quarter of this year we re not abnormally dropping rigs and trying to monkey with the system and then as we roll into next year and so i think though that level of consistency helps tremendously internally and externally as well john freeman raymond james analyst great and then just my follow up question the terrific result in the boundary raider project and just i guess any additional color there in terms of repeatability kind of running room in that area any sort of breakthroughs and anything you did on the completion design or anything else that you might get to take to some of the other areas rick muncrief president and chief executive officer yeah john i think it s we re at the point of evolution where it s a million small things and so i think every new pad that we drill we re continuing to improve and it s we re shaving minutes and we re shaving just the small single percentage increases on all of these efficiency gains really continue to add up i think in this particular case we were sitting on top some amazing geology that certainly helps in this business but i think i look across the board and you re right i see the efficiency gains some of the capital that we saw in the third quarter and as we roll into fourth quarter that is there s some efficiency being baked in from the drilling and from the completion side that as you know starts stacking capital up a little bit we ve considered that as we looked at 22 we haven t built additional efficiency gains into 22 and as i mentioned on a previous question we ve actually acknowledged some pretty pretty significant exposure for inflation i think that s a prudent step to take john freeman raymond james analyst thanks appreciate it congratulations on a nice quarter rick muncrief president and chief executive officer thanks john operator your next question comes from the line of neal dingmann with truist securities neal dingmann truist securities analyst good morning guys i don t want to belabor the shareholder return obviously that is a topic in its early days rick i remember meeting up with you several months ago early on and you comment at that time this is i think maybe even just the one variable dividend that you thought maybe you weren t being properly compensated i m just wondering as you sit now with several under your belt you think you all been properly compensated for these and if not would you consider lowering the formula or doing something different on a go forward rick muncrief president and chief executive officer neal i think we have been rewarded to a degree i think but if you scott coody the number of phone calls inbound phone calls that he s getting from more and more generalist investors and people quite honestly he s never talked to or even heard of that s extremely encouraging so i think we have started to see the tip of the iceberg on our recognition the appreciation of how what a strong tool this variable dividend is so yeah i think that if you go back our conversation we had several months ago i think it was still just a little bit of a wait and see and we talked i think at that time about interestingly enough if you re just a yield investor you re out in mining for yield comparing opportunities if you look at bloomberg factset places like that it just picks up that fixed dividend it doesn t always contemplate the variables or specials those sorts of things so i think it s a little bit of a wait and see mode now you fast forward to where we are today and i think we have seen some recognition of that the feedback we get from our shareholders we ve seen the shareholder base actually change you know a fair amount so i think the calls we re getting would probably illustrate that yeah we re starting to get some get some recognition of the power that the variable dividend and certainly i think when people open the envelope here at the end of the year on this 0 84 per share dividend that s a nice one so i think it s going to continue to be very much appreciated so tip of the iceberg though neal dingmann truist securities analyst no i agree i m good to hear because you guys has certainly been a leader in all of this and then my follow up is maybe for you or clay you can t help but notice when you guys start the presentation on slide 4 having five distinct great areas and clay mentioned how strictly they compete for capital so with that said would you consider on some of those areas that maybe won t make it in your vote to the top of line would you fund those bring somebody else in as a partner or somebody else to fund those that way or would you more likely think about letting some of those assets go rick muncrief president and chief executive officer well as we stated on several occasions all five of our assets play a very key role in our going forward strategy you bring up something could you bring in a partner yeah absolutely that s always something you can do and the returns that they would get would be quite honestly phenomenal and of course we would get would be phenomenal i think so that s always an opportunity we just want to do the right thing for the long term success of the company and i can tell you that we continue in all of our basins to find more and more creative ideas on the resource and this is the subsurface and then so i think as we get into it a little next year or two we ll always have those opportunities and we ll evaluate them as they come along but our phone does ring so it is something that we contemplate clay you may want to comment on that clay gaspar chief operating officer yeah thanks rick and neal you know us well right i mean we are business folks and we really look for value creation opportunities and sometimes that comes in the name of buying assets or selling assets or doing creative structures all of that s always on the table we have to be very creative what i like i think something we ve highlighted this quarter is our joint venture with dow that s a perfect alignment we had a resource that we knew was not going to compete on a heads up basis we also had a little bit of a stagnant time so we knew that there could be a little bit of kind of start up friction we brought in a partner they love it it is a homerun for dow it is a homerun for us and as we cycle through this we re both winning and it s a great thing for the shareholders because ultimately that asset is being converted into value so we love those kind of deals both legacy organizations have a very creative bent to them and so i think that carries through to us going forward so i look forward to more creative opportunities ahead rick muncrief president and chief executive officer neal i ll add one more thing to that point that clay just made and i think that if you look at the legacy of devon it s a kind of company that people want to want to work with and so case in point is this dow partnership that s the second one the first one was launched back in the barnett days and so once you prove that you re a viable partner and that you can make people some money they will come back so i d like to add that neal dingmann truist securities analyst great detail thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of scott hanold with rbc capital markets scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst hey all thanks and congrats on the quarter i m going to touch a little bit on 2022 quickly here but when you look at maybe can you if you can give us some perspective on how big the non operated part of that budget is and obviously outside of the eagle ford but in places like the permian basin and even oklahoma how much non op spend do you do you have right now clay gaspar chief operating officer so scott speaking of partnerships we have a partnership in the delaware where we have a partner that we have prescribed agreement in place where we can offload some of the non op mainly because a non op is very hard to budget for and speaking from our own prior experience when you bust the budget and it s on somebody else s fourth quarter activity it can be a little bit frustrating so again we have a creative structure in place very beneficial to us very beneficial to our partner that act as a little bit of a shock absorber so as we think about opportunities in other areas and as commodity price increases and we see some non op partners lean into it a little bit we ll consider those options but i think it s probably 50 million to 100 million around the company is probably in the right ballpark scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst got it makes a lot of sense and obviously you guys s operational performance has been outstanding and it s not just the last quarter or two it s been for quite some time and when you think about managing growth based on the old macro right now if you re in a position where you are outperforming next year would the plan be to taper activity to stay within sort of a flattish growth outlook or would you drop capex a little bit to stay more flat clay gaspar chief operating officer yeah i hear you and i that s always the challenge right as we do better become more efficient the acceleration causes us to push toward the high side of the capital range it s what we re experiencing in the third and fourth quarter of this year i hope we have that same problem what i ll tell you is we are going to really try hard to honor the high side of that range and if necessary then we would trim back on activity to make sure we stayed inside that range it s not something we take lightly like i said earlier this is very disruptive to internal and external operations and so we don t take that kind of operational scaling up and down lightly i would tell you that it s something we plan to honor and to be very consistent in and sometimes there s other creative ways to make sure that we still meet our capital guidance and continue the incredible consistency that we have rolling scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst got it no i appreciate that and one really quick on for jeff jeff you mentioned the tax attributes of around 3 billion and that seems to hold off through 2022 is it fair to assume at strip like some time say mid 2023 a lot of that is utilized yeah that s right jeff ritenour chief financial officer and just to be clear in 2022 at the current strip prices we would expect to base some cash taxes and that s the assumptions we can outline on the slide deck but certainly as you move into 2023 if we maintain this sort of price level through this next year you re absolutely going to be in a cash tax position and you ll see that current tax ratio move higher scott hanold rbc capital markets analyst ok high class problem thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of matthew portillo with tph matthew portillo tudor pickering holt and company analyst morning all maybe a question for clay just on the prb i was curious if you could give us an update on your learnings from the delineation in the niobrara and what you would need to see from either a wild productivity perspective or from a cost perspective to feed that asset more capital over the medium term clay gaspar chief operating officer yeah matt this is one of the areas that doesn t get a lot of spotlight so one i appreciate the question and being able to talk about it this is the massive oil in place resource there is no question as we think about historical exploration exploring is figuring out if there s oil in place we re past exploration now it s figuring out how do we make how do we develop this in an economically competitive way in the portfolio that we have and therein lies the challenge the current the current delivery on economics doesn t compete in with the delaware basin obviously that is a tough portfolio to compete in so let s think about it we ve drilled a couple of 3 mile laterals that we brought on earlier this year i can tell you they re really strong we like the returns and they will compete they have very strong economics we ve got a lot of repeatability on that and so i look over to maybe how we did something with the anadarko basin if it s not competing in our basin how do we creatively create value for shareholders for an asset that sits in our portfolio and there s a number of ways to do that clearly other industry peers are active in the basin we look to learn from them we look to partner with them all of that s on the table certainly bringing in outside funding is certainly on the table the homework that we need to do is continue to improve on the repeatability and the certainty of the outcome and that allows us to negotiate the best opportunity for us to really wring out the value matthew portillo tudor pickering holt and company analyst perfect and then just maybe a follow up question on after specific capital allocation you ve had some absolutely phenomenal results around the acreage in lee on eddy county and then some of the state line acreage some wpx just curious how felix stacks up today what you kind of learned from your updated development program there and how we should think about the return profile of that position in the southern delaware basin versus your more northerly acreage rick muncrief president and chief executive officer yeah good question as we draw the circles we have some haley development that s in what we call the monument draw which is mostly felix the haley stuff was kind of in between state line and the eastern most side of the basin that pad recently came on during the third quarter big development i think 10 or 12 wells outstanding results so we re excited about that clearly as you move further east things just get more challenging the steering gets a little more difficult the economics get a little bit more difficult and again in this super competitive portfolio that we have it s just the eastern most stuff is not commanding the most capital today so as we look at the depth of inventory in lee and eddy and really loving counties that s where the lion s share of our capital activity will be matthew portillo tudor pickering holt and company analyst thank

you wouldn t know it from watching debates over voter suppression laws but higher turnout in elections does not automatically translate into democratic victories amid record shattering turnout republicans swept all three statewide offices in virginia on tuesday and appear to have flipped control of the house of delegates the old dominion provided its citizens with 45 days of early voting and conservatives and independents made the most of that opportunity this should shatter the myth that making voting easier is somehow inherently partisan but it does little to fix the democrats broader problems political independents in virginia swung 29 points since last year according to exit polls from favoring joe biden by 19 points to backing glenn youngkin by 9 points as much as anything else that s how the republican gubernatorial nominee won by 2 points in a state the president carried by 10 points advertisement as off year elections go turnout was a stunner three quarters as many virginians voted in 2021 as in last year s presidential contest in 2013 terry mcauliffe was elected governor with about 1 1 million votes on tuesday he attracted 1 6 million votes but still fell short democrats cannot blame the rules for losing fair and square the trump effect was in play but the biden undertow was stronger republicans won in tuesday s elections in part because biden turned out to be a bigger drag on democrats than former president donald trump was on gop candidates exit polling pegged biden s job approval rating among virginia voters at 45 percent and twice as many virginia voters strongly disapprove 46 percent of biden than strongly approve of him 23 percent trump was viewed unfavorably by 54 percent but youngkin nonetheless won about 1 in 5 of them follow this author james hohmann s opinions follow the results offered fresh evidence that trying to link every generic republican to trump isn t going to be the killer app that helps democrats hold the house and senate next year youngkin forged a coalition of forever trumpers and never trumpers he outperformed trump among every demographic group and in all but the reddest sections of the commonwealth and showed that democrats had rented the suburbs during the trump years but did not own them advertisement biden captured the white house with an anti trump coalition of convenience which included support from places such as hampton roads in the tidewater and bedroom communities outside richmond but that coalition is already fractured the bungled withdrawal from afghanistan made him look incompetent especially to the state s many veterans and military families strategists on both sides of the governor s race call the fall of kabul a turning point continuing congressional paralysis makes biden look impotent especially since democrats control both chambers moreover if biden seemed moderate during the 2020 campaign especially in comparison to his rivals for the nomination he s since governed more liberally than many of his own voters expected like alcoholics in denial that they have a problem too many democrats seem intent to play down their defeats it s fair to apportion some blame to mcauliffe for his gaffe about not wanting parents to tell schools what they should teach but the closeness of the governor s race in new jersey a state biden carried by 16 points shows the democrats weaknesses are national in scope even though barack obama won virginia twice and the state elected a black female republican to be lieutenant governor on tuesday some liberal activists are trying to suggest that racial animus was key to mcauliffe s defeat they note that youngkin promised to ban critical race theory in virginia public schools even though the graduate school concept is not taught this misses the point crt became a stand in for a deeper set of parental anxieties rather than address the fears directly or sincerely mcauliffe foolishly called it a racist dog whistle which made him seem aloof and condescending advertisement but exit polling showed the economy not education was actually the chief concern of virginia voters and youngkin the fleece vest wearing former investment banker was trusted more to handle the issue stock markets keep closing at record highs but inflation means higher prices for food and energy and supply chain problems create endless headaches these are federal problems that neither a speech at a summit nor a signature on a big spending bill will solve

market yesterday morning as was suggested by an incongruous 71 point gain in the futures pre open and so it was the asx200 closed up 68 points although not before the momentum algos pushed it up over 100 points by lunchtime up to yesterday the market had wallowed on falling commodity prices and a weak earnings report from westpac wbc and wouldn t you know these and the other big cap sectors were targeted by the buyer yesterday materials up 1 4 banks up 1 2 healthcare up 0 9 staples up 1 0 all sectors closed in the green bar technology which fell 0 2 on a 15 0 plunge for tyro payments tyr after a disappointing agm there was no clear trigger for the buying against the week s run of play the iron ore price did stabilise under us 100 t yesterday but that s about it the australian market has lagged wall street since the september swoon mostly given our far more significant weighting to rocks which may have something to do with it that and a still dovish central bank when all about are turning hawkish not the fed though despite yesterday coming out of the blue traders have endorsed the gains given the futures are up 37 points this morning after wall street applauded jay powell glasgow has proven a fillip for all things green including lithium such that all of orocobre ore pilbara minerals pls and mineral resources min appeared on the top five leaders board yesterday with gains of 4 7 blow me down if amp amp didn t top the board with a 9 3 flurry but only because it finally offloaded its life insurance business tyro was the only real standout on the losers board with the rba meeting now behind us and lowe waving the white flag on yield curve management local bond yields have been slipping back yesterday the two year fell 8 points to 0 56 with the rba s 0 10 cap now abandoned and the ten year fell 6 to 1 82 our ten year still remains solidly above the us equivalent even after a kick up in us yields last night but the two year gap has closed with the us at 0 47 which is the duration that most affects the exchange rate that has currently stalled in the us74 75c range despite commodity price weakness as the us dollar does its own thing happy with that last december the fed said it would continue to buy bonds until the economy had made substantial progress towards its goal of stable 2 inflation and a healthy labour market last night with progress having been made jay powell announced bond purchases would be tapered by us 15bn per month from a current us 120bn per month which is exactly what wall street expected to hear the tapering level is not set in stone but if unchanged would mean the end of qe by next july the market is still arguing that progress towards a 2 inflation rate is rather questionable but to the end the fomc statement suggested inflation is elevated largely reflecting factors that are expected to be transitory supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizable price increases in some sectors yep still transitory but we might note that us used car prices to cite one example which had appeared to have peaked and were heading down again are now heading back up again taking australia as an example eclipx group ecx at its result release yesterday warned that new vehicle supply shortage is expected to last into late next year and high prices for used cars will thus linger with regard powell s longstanding target of 2024 for the first rate hike there was no specific reinforcement the fed will be patient powell said just as lowe said on tuesday and tapering and tightening are two separate issues the latter not even being discussed by the fomc but the fed stands ready to act without hesitation if it is deemed necessary to do so so still more on the dovish side particularly compared to other central banks such as those of the uk canada and new zealand but not stubbornly so note new zealand yesterday reported a drop to a 14 year low unemployment rate of 3 2 in the september quarter from 4 0 the us ten year yield rose 3 points to 1 58 for wall street it was more a case of getting this meeting out of the way so life can go on and life at present is

buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of october 20 2021 david h mowry chief executive officer thank you operator today i am joined on the call by rohan seth our chief financial officer on today s call i will provide a brief overview of our third quarter 2021 business results operational highlights and some commercial insights from the period rohan will then provide details of our financial results as well as share our updated outlook for performance over the remainder of 2021 before turning the call back to me for some final comments i will then open the call to your questions during the third quarter of 2021 our business continued to perform well delivering solid results across each category over the period we did not see the negative impact from the delta variant that many other businesses within the healthcare sector experienced as a static procedure volumes and customer interest in capital equipment purchases remains strong and well above prior year levels as we anticipated many physician customers took well earned vacations in north america and europe over the course of the quarter while physician vacations and family holidays had only a minimal impact on treatment volumes within the period we know that demand for treatments in the fourth quarter of 2021 remained strong likely absorbing any pent up demand from the third quarter the physician vacations and associated treatment flow disruptions demonstrated a return to more normal routines and predictable patterns confirming the overall strength that continues across aesthetic practices this is further confirmed by informal surveys of aesthetic practices which are reporting fully book schedules through the end of the year turning now to our performance for third quarter 2021 total revenue for third quarter 21 was 57 4 million an increase of 47 over prior year results and 24 above our pre covid third quarter 2019 performance notably capital equipment sales continue to trend favorably during the quarter with capital equipment revenues of 32 2 million representing an increase of 33 over prior year levels cutera s capital equipment sales were driven by particularly strong performances from our direct sales teams in north america and europe as well as from strength in our distributor markets in north america our capital equipment performance sequentially improved over second quarter 2021 during the period we were able to expand our capital equipment sales force taking increased sales coverage into fourth quarter 2021 and beyond our new north american sales reps are coming along very nicely and doing the work necessary to build robust deal pipelines in advance of 2022 while we are yet to completely close the gap on pre covid 2019 capital revenue levels in north america we are pleased with the sales teams pace of improvement and excited to see how the newer sales reps will add to the collective we consider third quarter 2021 performance to be a positive leading indicator for future capital systems revenue growth as we fuel north american capital equipment sales with increased sales force coverage despite an increasingly competitive energy based aesthetic equipment market our sales teams across the u s and canada have steadily delivered sequential growth selling through competitive challenges by highlighting the features and benefits and economic value that the cutera portfolio offers our customers the revitalization and expansion of our north american sales force remains a positive driver of our business and coupled with investments in our key account managers we are building strong and sustained momentum providing differentiated service and support to our customers in europe during the third quarter 2021 we saw continued improvement of our capital sales allowing us to overcome headwinds typically associated with the seasonality of europe third quarter volumes our investments in recruiting and upgrading our sales team along with increasing our robust and experienced european leadership team have delivered the desired results of accelerating our capital equipment growth and all indicators point toward continued expansion of energy based equipment sales as we continue to cultivate deals and expand further in the key european regions such as germany as for our capital equipment sales in the direct markets of australia new zealand and japan there were some impacts from the covid travel restrictions and reduced patient treatment volumes due to lower vaccination rates respectively despite the regional headwinds from government imposed restrictions limiting people from venturing beyond five kilometers of their home in larger metropolitan centers of australia our team pushed through and delivered several deals in a very slow third quarter 2021 market looking forward restrictions are lifting across australia and we anticipate that our team will be active and aggressive closing out the year additionally we are seeing increasing vaccination rates across japan supporting our outlook for capital equipment revenue recoveries in both regions starting in the fourth quarter of 2021 and carrying well into 2022 as i previously noted we remain confident that the global capital systems spending environment is strong and still improving customer interest for capital equipment purchases continues to climb and we anticipate a solid fourth quarter to close out the year carrying this strength into 2022 now moving to the recurring revenue this business maintained the positive momentum coming off the prior quarter delivering 25 2 million in the third quarter of 2021 representing a growth of 68 over prior year during the quarter all three recurring revenue categories skincare consumable products and services contributed to our improved recurring revenue mix and the robust year over year growth during the third quarter of 2021 our skincare business delivered revenue of 14 8 million up 117 over prior year period this performance was ahead of expectations driven by greater volumes from physician customer restocking in advance of an announced price increase needless to say we are pleased by the continued success our skincare team in japan has delivered expanding active account basis an increasing penetration within the existing accounts going forward we anticipate that our normalized run rate for skincare will settle in below the third quarter levels as pre price increased inventories work down and patients resume their routines skincare and aesthetic treatment patterns once run rate settle in we expect to maintain revenues at market growth rates for this category with regard to consumables third quarter of 2021 revenue was 3 7 million representing a growth of 60 over the same period in prior year revenue growth in this category was driven by continued strength of patient traffic despite the seasonal disruption from summer holidays and physician vacations notwithstanding the seasonality north american performance was solid and steady driven by revenue generating activities carried out at practices by cutera new and expanding key account manager presence over the third quarter we continue to expand our key account manager team and have aggressively onboard of these new reps customer sentiment for these resources have been strong and we expect to see increasing consumable revenues for the business in the later part of fourth quarter 2021 and carrying into 2022 as the impact of our tam activities flow through our customers practices the third and final category within recurring revenue is our global services this category includes income associated with time and material repair fees as well as the sale of service agreements to owners of our energy based aesthetic systems global service revenue was 6 7 million in the period representing a growth of 14 over the prior year period driven by increased volumes of service agreements covering a growing installed base of systems we expect that global service revenues will continue to grow at a steady rate above capital as service agreement attached rates improve in addition to the growing volume of our active installed base of systems before turning the call over to rohan i would like to recognize the continued progress our team has made on one of our vital few initiatives gross margin expansion during the period like so many other businesses we experienced some specific headwinds from increasing costs of critical components and high demand materials additionally inbound and outbound freight expenses have increased more recently nevertheless our supply chain and engineering teams have continued to identify improvements to offset much of the impact of these costs being passed along meanwhile our sales teams have been exceptionally strong in holding price in the face of competition enabling us to not only maintain our margins but to expand from our other cost improvement efforts with that i d like to turn the call over to rohan rohan rohan seth chief financial officer thank you dave as i review my prepared remarks i want to note that i will primarily focus on non gaap results unless otherwise stated a complete reconciliation of gaap to non gaap is included in the earnings release we encourage listeners and readers to review our non gaap metrics in conjunction with the gaap results as contained in our earnings release total revenue for the third quarter was 57 4 million compared to 39 1 million for the same period in 2020 representing growth of approximately 47 north american capital equipment revenue was 20 7 million compared to 13 7 million for the same period last year representing growth of 51 over 3q 2020 international capital equipment revenue for the third quarter was 11 5 million as compared to 10 4 million in the third quarter of 2020 representing growth of 10 the year over year performance of our international capital sales benefited from our european sales team driving growth of 52 our australia new zealand team delivering 16 growth and our middle east and asia pacific distributor markets delivering a growth of 11 over the prior year period our teams within these markets continue to lay a strong foundation for sustainable growth over the next several years recurring revenue defined as consumables global service and skincare revenue was 25 2 million compared to 15 million for the same period last year representing 68 growth over prior year as dave mentioned earlier a source of pride for third quarter 2021 was our gross margin performance in the face of several economic headwinds within the third quarter of 2021 gaap gross margin was 58 2 versus 55 6 for the same period last year and non gaap gross margin finished at 58 3 versus 57 2 in q3 2020 these improvements were driven by continued leverage on our fixed overhead cost base and consistent execution against our vital few initiatives total non gaap operating expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were 28 4 million compared to 20 million for the same period last year our results reflect higher variable compensation expenses as well as increased investments to continue to drive our top line growth sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were 17 9 million compared to 10 9 million for the same period last year the higher expense was primarily driven by higher sales and investments in sales force expansion and optimization across multiple geographies r d expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were 4 7 million compared to 3 1 million for the same period last year driven by research and clinical investments in new technology finally g a expenses for the third quarter of 2021 were 5 7 million compared to 6 1 million in the prior year driven by reductions in administration expenses for the third quarter of 2021 our non gaap adjusted ebitda was 5 1 million compared to 2 4 million for the same period last year this continued improvement in our profitability is the direct result for our global teams working in concert and bringing a laser focus on driving growth with a view to our bottom line there were no materials or significant changes to our tax positions turning now to our balance sheet we ended the quarter with approximately 162 5 million of cash and equivalents compared to 42 4 million at the same time last year and 169 2 million at the end of second quarter 2021 the reduction in cash in the second quarter of 2021 is largely driven by erp expansion due to revenue mix and timing as well as investments in our erp program we ended the quarter with 35 5 million of inventory up 0 9 million from q2 2021 we expect our inventories will increase through year end driven by our efforts to continue to secure our supply chain as you may have picked up from my prepared remarks a key word that i have used over and over is investments and i d like to take a moment to provide some further details on this front we continue to prepare our company for the next phase of our growth one area where we have been increasing our investment is in our information technology infrastructure more specifically our new erp system with strong momentum in our core business and some pivotal growth initiatives on the horizon we are at a stage in our company s lifecycle where it s important to build a truly scalable architecture to support the next phase of our growth we continue to chip away at this area which is one of our vital few initiatives and we plan to have the system in place in advance of some of our new product launches in the next year finally moving back to our top line performance and outlook given our strong performance in the quarter and solid outlook we are increasing our guidance we are raising full year 2021 total revenue guidance to a range of 224 million to 228 million representing year over year adjusted revenue growth of 52 to 54 with that i will turn the call back over to dave for some closing remarks dave david h mowry chief executive officer thanks rohan as we look ahead to the next several quarters we are well positioned to execute our plans to accelerate growth through a reengineered and revitalized global direct sales force we have made critical investments in expanding our capital sales coverage as well as improving our sales leadership in each of our global direct sales organizations additionally we have made investments in repositioning our business relationship with our customer through investments in our key account managers these field based resources are tasked with driving activities which increased practice revenues for our customers as well as drive cutera consumable revenue we believe that our customers will recognize the benefit of our key account managers being fully aligned to the financial performance of their practice and elect to adopt other cutera energy based equipment into their practices our sales force optimization and expansion investments set the stage for a strong finish to the year as well as building momentum going into 2022 internally we have moved efficiently and effectively in the development of new and novel products representing first mover advantages as new products come together with our revitalized and fully scaled sales organizations we have the strength and capabilities to deliver amazing results our future is extremely bright as we continue to execute our plans and deliver strong sustainable results with that i d like to open the call to questions operator questions and answers operator thank you our first question is from matt o brien with piper sandler please proceed with your question simran kaur piper sandler analyst hi good afternoon guys this is simran on for matt thank you for taking the questions so first i want to start on skincare again really solid performance here i think you guys mentioned that the run rate going forward will be lower then obviously the implied rate here and on previous calls that kind of run rate you also mentioned wasn t really maintainable but it continues to outperform so how do we think about this franchise going forward and is 15 million the new base and then also if you could expand on any of the trends that you might be saying that suggests that this kind of growth is sustainable maybe even in markets outside of japan david h mowry chief executive officer yes thank you so much for the color simran and give our best to matt thanks for the question on skincare during the prepared remarks we mentioned a little bit of a pull forward due to an announced price increase that we delivered during the period it s hard to kind of estimate what that really is but we do believe that the run rate for this business on a more normalized rate is somewhere between 12 million or around 12 million not certainly not 15 million and certainly not 14 8 million which we saw in the period so we think that there s probably going to be a knock on effect in the fourth quarter of some kind of pullback because people bought ahead and so we re kind of still working through that the things we track on this and the reason why we do believe that there is some sustainability to this growth is the fact that we see growth coming from two elements here we see new accounts and account expansion we also continue to see penetrations within accounts where existing accounts are doing more altogether so like all in we think that there s some sustainability that comes from further expansion to new accounts we also think there s an ability to continue to penetrate newer accounts that haven t been fully penetrated yet and that gives us kind of the hope for the sustainability but that run rate does need to come back down to something that doesn t reflect a pull forward or a customer behavior that s not consistent with the run rate closer to kind of like 12 million simran kaur piper sandler analyst okay perfect and then real quick on the capital environment we see north america saw a sequential step up which you mentioned was really driven by the sales force here from that standpoint what how do you expect the momentum to carry forward into q4 and then 2022 david h mowry chief executive officer yes i think what s important for everyone on the call to understand and it s another great question is that north america has continued to have sequential improvement actually starting from third quarter last year to fourth to the first quarter of this year second and then third and they have continued to step forward some of this is the result of a focus on process and some of this is a focus on expanding the sales force itself which has been obviously beneficial more recently we ve hired a number of new territory managers and now territory managers are the entry level positions within our sales organization and they do require a little bit longer time for training and development as well as building their pipeline but we do think that this will continue to move forward in north america and have another kind of projection of sequential improvement as these folks continue to deliver greater kind of rep productivity simran kaur piper sandler analyst okay got it just if i could squeeze a quick one in here acne do we have any updates there or timing of when we can see any data or what we will get an update david h mowry chief executive officer so simran i m going to give you credit for not asking that as the first question i just want to point out to everybody we ve remained very tight lipped on acne for obvious reasons around protecting our competitive advantages that we believe that we re building internally to the business so we re not really talking about timing we re not talking about technology and we re certainly not talking about the data i would share with everyone listening that we continue to have an increasing level of confidence as we build experience inside the building with the product the technology and kind of what we see from kind of engagements with clinicians once we reach a point that we believe that it s appropriate for us to share with the market we will but for now we re going to just say that we re making good steady progress and that things remain on track for our internal plans simran kaur piper sandler analyst okay all good thank you for being a good sport operator thank you our next question is from jon block with stifel please proceed with your question jon block stifel analyst great thanks guys and good afternoon maybe first one dave on the north american sales force i don t think we re going to be able to get an actual number rep from you but where are you guys going to end the year versus call it the goal or the plan and when we think about 22 do you expect that north american sales force to sort of be where you really wanted to be by early or mid next year as some of these new products come into the fold david h mowry chief executive officer yes jon that s a great question and thanks for that i think you re hitting the right point we ve been slow and steady in our growth and our process improvements in north america i think we ve added to the collective effectively in each quarter over the last four or five quarters and i think we re going to exit this year with probably the right number of people in the right seats on the bus they re still building their pipeline they re still coming down the development curve but i think you re exactly right as we think about 2022 our intent is by we ll say mid 2022 we re hitting our stride with this sales organization in north america and we re delivering on kind of our expectations so we ll continue to add reps as opportunities exist but i think going into the early part of 2022 i think we have the right people we just need to move them through the development process jon block stifel analyst got it perfect thanks and rohan just to shift gears over to you you talked about gross margins of 60 60 plus low to mid at 1 60s and then of course skincare was ripping and so you sort of reconfigured that a little bit but still talk to 60 less what you re seeing with the supply chain and freight and obviously it s not specific to you guys it s so global in nature can we still get there over the next 12 to 24 months or just with what you re experiencing is there enough slack in the system where you re able to pull out costs from other parts of the equation where you still feel good on that low to mid 60 over time to be clear rohan seth chief financial officer yes so i think that s a great question jon and thanks for kind of summarizing what we ve talked about in the past so first of all i d say i m really pleased with the progress that we ve made so far year to date and my congratulations and thanks to our operations teams for all their efforts in getting us to the place that we are at we re not immune to the supply chain challenges that the rest of the world and the market has faced but i say that it hasn t impacted our growth it is not deterring us from that previously stated non gaap margin goal of mid 60s i would say it impacts our timing a little bit but i continue to be very confident in our ability to get there i d say over the next couple of years and there are several catalysts that are still in our bag to continue to deliver further expansion i would add that we saw a step change in our margin in 2021 and going forward the expansion and the changes would be more gradual jon block stifel analyst got it okay great and last one for me i ll throw a quick third one so rohan your track you said paying particular attention to your wording you were calling on investments i was paying attention to what other one i thought you said product launches next year in 22 being plural not singular so maybe if you dave if you could just talk to we re all so fixated on acne and i get it from a timing perspective of what you re willing to disclose but just when we think about that pipeline are there going to be other offerings is it going to be new platforms or outside of acne should we think of more maybe just refreshers across some of the other platforms that cutera currently has thanks guys david h mowry chief executive officer thanks jon great question so i m not going to give you an update on acne and i m not trying to be coy i do believe that there s reason to kind of be very tight to the vest that said r d work continues to be ongoing with other projects these are addressing other innovative spaces or markets that i think will be delivered as we continue to update our portfolio i think there s probably a mix of programs in our portfolio right now of projects some of them being more innovative and others being kind of updates to existing systems and our intent will be to kind of get through some of the development and activities we have outstanding with acne but also to follow that up with some additional products going into the core business that we have so we re anticipating bringing some other things out and once we get into 2022 and we provide guidance we ll give a little bit more insight into what we ll be delivering and when jon block stifel analyst perfect thanks guys appreciate it david h mowry chief executive officer thank you operator our next question comes from chris cooley with stephens please proceed with your question chris cooley stephens analyst good afternoon and thanks so much for taking the questions as much as i d like to ask about acne it sounds like i should pass so i will spare you maybe dave though i and rohan i really would appreciate if you could just give us a little bit of color when you think about the domestic market and also when you look internationally talk to us about maybe how you re seeing the various channels exhibit growth and really kind of trying to look at the traditional cosmetic derm or med derm type channel relative to the and how your portfolio plays to that and then i have a quick follow up thanks so much david h mowry chief executive officer thanks chris so first of all i think it s important for those on the call that maybe don t realize this is we look at our portfolio from a perspective of not only offering broad procedural coverage to the practitioner but also doing so in what we think is an economic advantage procedure fee so our intent while the capital is expensive from a standpoint of features and benefits we offer it covers a vast majority of procedures that can be done within the practice in addition we look at things that allow us to do procedures in less time returning treatment rooms and labor within the practice back to the practitioner for them to use in other ways so our intent is to be a very economically advantaged provider to the practice and we see that across both derms and med spas i think what we see in terms of growth is we see a continued evaluation and growth within the derm practices into incorporating esthetics more broadly we re seeing some of that as some of the older derms retire and younger derms come into the practice that they re incorporating smaller components into the practice that include cash pay procedures and so we continue to see that as a growth potential into existing practices as well as new practices being set up in terms of the med spas we think that they continue to the ones that survive the crisis and had good cash flows continue to invest broadly in doing more and greater procedures and they re looking for a low cost high profitability procedures to incorporate into their offerings as well so i think in both cases we have a portfolio that blends well into providing good coverage across multiple procedures and with the med spas offering them certain products such as our trusculpt flex that now can do a kind of an exercise in 15 minutes instead of what was 40 minutes so those type of things that we can produce and provide to the marketplace that allows them to collect similar or higher fees in shorter periods of time gives us that economic advantage for procedure fees chris cooley stephens analyst super thanks and just to maybe clarify there as well when you think about growth any of those respective channels as you ve defined them are you seeing it relatively balanced right now is one growing faster than the other just want to clarify that before i do my follow up david h mowry chief executive officer great question i think we see a little bit more growth right now in our portfolio with the derm practices and i think this is primarily driven by the investments we re making with our key account managers i think they blend very well into a derm practice not that they don t provide great support to med spas as well but i think in particular we found greater uptake out of the gate with the key account managers due to the nature of those practices and how they ve worked with other i ll say providers not capital providers but with other providers on their key account managers and they know how to engage with us and how to work to drive their revenues so i think that s helping a great deal in particular and i think we also find that our portfolio lends to more clinical selling and i think with our key account managers in particular being on board we ve hired people that have been in the esthetic space but understand the clinical value what we re providing and i think that indeed helps and kind of reinforces and supports our capital sales reps in what they re doing so i think we see slightly more growth in the derm and the core business side however we do see strong growth in those med spas that are extending and expanding their operations chris cooley stephens analyst perfect appreciate that and then just lastly for me when you look at the business here extremely strong third quarter guidance raise getting a favorable mix shift there and as a result profitability looks much improved as you re going forward and the company has a strong balance sheet as well when you look out into calendar 22 you re talking about launches plural i guess that includes acne but we re not going to talk about that does it also maybe include in licensing agreement or acquisitions or should we think about deploying that capital just for continued sales force expansion dtc and investment internally there in r d just kind of curious how you re thinking about other opportunities that may or may not be in the marketplace today david h mowry chief executive officer let me hit it at a high level on kind of the way we re looking at the business and then maybe rohan can talk about some of the other investments that we want to continue to fund but from a growth perspective we think that some of the best things that we could do is from an r d perspective is organic we have more ideas than we have the ability to deliver right now there are great great people here in our r d organization our technical organization and i think we want to continue to fund their ideas and their development efforts and i think that we ll be well served in doing so i think the second thing is we believe that while there s plenty of opportunities out there to go out and pick something up and tuck it in it doesn t really represent our portfolio and what we ve built here we think we re building something very special and we want to continue to invest in that in particular not that we won t look at opportunities when they come across but i think right now we re not out shopping we re out really focused on building and developing our own so rohan do you have anything you want to add to the investments rohan seth chief financial officer yes and i think what i d add dave is that the inherent opportunity that s available at cutera we were still a growth mindset business right we re focused on the p l for sure but our primary focus is investing for growth and that s how we re setting everything up trying to make everything scalable and really building a platform here to be able to launch into our next phase in terms of infrastructure in terms of sales structure and as dave mentioned r d obviously chris cooley stephens analyst thank you so much david h mowry chief executive officer thanks chris operator there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to dave mowry for closing comments david h mowry chief executive officer thank you maria for those of you on the call we want to thank you for your continued interest in cutera we remain excited and poised for growth and we look forward to providing you with an update to our full year 2021 results at our next update during the first quarter of 2022 until then take care thank you operator duration 39 minutes call participants david h mowry chief executive officer rohan seth chief financial officer simran

washington reuters the federal reserve threw its weight back behind the drive for a full u s jobs recovery on wednesday restating its belief that current high inflation is expected to be transitory and despite risks to that view arguing that price pressures will ease and pave the way for stronger employment and economic growth in the months to come even as the u s central bank announced it was tucking away one of its main pandemic fighting tools by trimming its massive bond buying program beginning this month its latest policy statement and fed chair jerome powell s remarks in a news conference signaled it would stay patient and wait for more job growth before raising interest rates supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy have contributed to sizeable price increases in some sectors the fed said in its latest policy statement adding that an easing of supply constraints is expected to support continued gains in economic activity and employment as well as a reduction in inflation powell emphasized what he said is the fed s intent to push labor markets further with low interest rates and to withhold judgment about the limits of job creation until further outbreaks of the coronavirus have been contained ideally we would see further development of the labor market in a context where there isn t another covid spike and then we would be able to see a lot to see how does labor participation react in the post covid world he told reporters we are going to have to see some time post covid or post delta anyway to see what is possible powell said in reference to the coronavirus variant that was largely responsible for a covid 19 surge and economic slowdown over the last three months yet inflation was uncomfortably high powell acknowledged blaming it on turmoil in global supply chains that is likely to last until perhaps the second half of next year posing a challenge in the meantime to families on fixed incomes or those earning lower wages inflation for the last five months has been running at twice the fed s 2 target and moving in a way powell said could well satisfy the central bank s benchmark for a rate increase once maximum employment is reached but for now he said the fed would be patient in deciding when to raise its benchmark overnight interest rate from the near zero level a counter to rising bets in financial markets that inflation would prompt the central bank to end its pandemic era support for the economy sooner than later the fed last year said it would allow higher inflation in hopes of encouraging more job growth but as prices rose this year so did skepticism about the depth of the central bank s commitment to that new approach we don t think it is time yet to raise interest rates there is still ground to cover to reach maximum employment powell said adding that he thought that goal could perhaps be met late next year end of asset purchases the fed as widely expected announced on wednesday that it would begin reducing its 120 billion in monthly purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities at a pace of 15 billion per month with a plan to end the purchases altogether in mid 2022 that bond buying taper the source of market turbulence when the fed plotted its exit from a similar asset purchase program that was rolled out to fight the 2007 2009 recession this time came off without a hitch the central bank s message of ongoing accommodative policy helped push the s p 500 index and the nasdaq composite to record closing highs treasury yields ended the day higher but the move was more pronounced on longer dated maturities that are more sensitive to inflation expectations the yield on the benchmark 10 year treasury note ended the session back above 1 60 for the first time in a week while the yield on the 2 year treasury note a proxy for fed interest rate expectations ticked fractionally higher to about 0 46 indeed investors in recent weeks had focused less on the bond buying taper and more on the fed s reaction to a surge in prices that promises to last much longer than anticipated when it first took root in the spring powell s response was to acknowledge the uncertainty but argue that was part of the reason the fed should not rush into a rate hike when it was still possible inflation would ease on its own and allow workers more time to navigate into jobs as the pandemic subsides supply chain bottlenecks will abate and job growth will move back up he said and as that happens inflation will decline from today s elevated levels of course the timing of that is highly uncertain hedging their bets the fed instructed its market agents at the new york fed to begin executing the reduced bond purchases in the middle of this month but only laid out that plan for november and december starting in mid november it will buy 70 billion of treasuries and 35 billion of mbs per month a pace that will drop to 60 billion of treasuries and 30 billion of mbs per month in mid december policymakers the fed said judge that similar reductions in the pace of net asset purchases will likely be appropriate each month but are prepared to adjust the pace of purchases if warranted by changes in the economic outlook if the economy continues to progress as expected the fed could finish tapering those purchases by the middle of next year powell said he stressed that officials have the flexibility to speed up or slow down the taper based on what happens in the economy they re hedging their bets but that s not anything new because we ve heard publicly they re a little less confident that things are going to come down as quickly on the inflation side as they thought said joseph lavorgna americas chief economist at natixis in new york along with supply disruptions things just drag on a bit longer and the statement reflects those realities lavorgna said reporting by howard schneider additional reporting by jonnelle marte dan burns and

attributable gold equivalent ounces for 2021 is forecast to be between 64 000 and 69 000 ounces the company is forecasting attributable gold equivalent production to be over 125 000 ounces in 2025 financial results sandstorm s revenue during the third quarter of 2021 was 27 6 million compared with 23 3 million for the comparable period in 2020 the increase is largely due to a 29 increase in the attributable gold equivalent ounces partially offset by an 8 decrease in the average realized selling price of gold net income was higher when compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in revenue partially offset by a 1 5 million decrease in gains recognized on the revaluation of the company s investments the increase in net income was also partially offset by an increase in depletion expense largely due to an increase in attributable gold equivalent ounces sold streams royalties of the gold equivalent ounces sold by sandstorm during the third quarter of 2021

sandstorm when compared to the third quarter of 2020 the change is primarily due to an increase in gold equivalent ounces sold from the black fox mine in ontario and an increase in royalty revenue from the diavik mine in the northwest territories north america excluding canada the gold equivalent ounces sold from operations located within north america but outside of canada contributed 11 more gold equivalent ounces when compared to the third quarter in 2020 the change was driven by an increase in gold equivalent ounces sold from the relief canyon mine in nevada the increase was partially offset by a decrease in gold equivalent ounces sold from the santa elena mine in mexico south america operations in south america contributed 84 more gold equivalent ounces when compared to the third quarter of 2020 the change is primarily due to an increase in royalty revenue from the vale royalties and an increase in gold equivalent ounces sold from the chapada mine in brazil other streams and royalties on mines in other countries contributed 53 less gold equivalent ounces sold when compared to the third quarter of 2020 the change is primarily due to a decrease in gold equivalent ounces sold from the karma mine in burkina faso the decrease from karma is primarily due to the conclusion of the five year fixed delivery period in the first quarter of 2021 reducing sandstorm s gold stream

statements to u s securityholders the financial information included or incorporated by reference in this press release or the documents referenced herein has been prepared in accordance with

respects and thus are not directly comparable to financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap the disclosure and information contained or referenced herein uses mineral reserve and mineral resource classification terms that comply with reporting standards in canada and mineral reserve and mineral resource estimates are made in accordance with canadian ni 43 101 and the canadian institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum cim definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves adopted by the cim council as amended the cim definition standards these standards differ significantly from the mineral reserve disclosure requirements of the united states securities exchange commission the sec set forth in industry guide 7 consequently information regarding

further the sec has adopted amendments to its disclosure rules to modernize the mineral property disclosure requirements for issuers whose securities are registered with the sec under the securities exchange act of 1934 exchange act these amendments became effective february 25 2019 the sec modernization rules and commencing for registrants with their first fiscal year beginning on or after january 1 2021 the sec modernization rules replaced the historical property disclosure requirements included in sec industry guide 7 as a foreign private issuer that files its annual report on form 40 f with the sec pursuant to the multi jurisdictional disclosure system the company is not required to provide disclosure on its mineral properties under the sec modernization rules and will continue to provide disclosure under ni 43 101 and the cim definition standards the sec modernization rules include the adoption of terms describing mineral reserves and mineral resources that are substantially similar to the corresponding terms under the cim definition but there are differences in the definitions under the sec modernization rules and the cim definition standards accordingly there is no assurance any mineral reserves or mineral resources that the company may report as proven mineral reserves probable mineral reserves measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources under ni 43 101 would be the same had the company prepared the mineral reserve or mineral resource estimates under the standards adopted under the sec modernization rules u s investors are also cautioned that while the sec recognizes measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources and inferred mineral resources under the modernization rules investors should not assume that any part or all of the mineralization in these categories will ever be converted into a higher category of mineral resources or into mineral reserves mineralization described using these terms has a greater amount of uncertainty as to its existence and feasibility than mineralization that has been characterized as reserves accordingly investors are cautioned not to assume that any measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources that the company reports are or will be economically or legally mineable further inferred mineral resources have a greater amount of uncertainty as to their existence and as to whether they can be mined legally or economically therefore u s investors are also cautioned not to assume that all or any part of the inferred mineral resources exist under canadian securities laws estimates of inferred mineral resources may not form the basis of feasibility or pre feasibility studies except in rare cases for the

this transcript appears in the november 5 2021 issue of executive intelligence review the coming fall of the cult of gaia this is the edited transcript of schiller institute founder and president helga zepp laroucheâ s keynote address to an international youth discussion october 23 2021 subheads and hyperlinks have been added view full size schiller institute helga zepp larouche first let me say â helloâ to all of you wherever you may be in whatever corner of the world i think we all are extremely aware that we are in very challenging times with many threats to the existence of the human species from the pandemic famine war danger and many things like that like hyperinflationary developments therefore i want to focus on the most important topic for today which is what underlies all of the different subjects one could discussâ that is what is the nature of man what is the identity of man in the universe what is life all about why do we exist two irreconcilable views of man there are questions which normally have been discussed in the past by religions by philosophers by poets today the whole question has basically been reduced to two fundamentally opposing views of what man is on the one side you have the almost dominantâ at least in certain countriesâ dominant view that man is a parasite that man burdens nature that he has a co 2 footprint which makes him trouble for mother earth and therefore he endangers the planet on the other side you have the idea that man is the most advanced existence in the universe that man is limitless perfectible that the world is in a systemic change a tectonic change the outcome of which will be determined as to which of the two views will prevail it is obviously not an easy situation for a young person if you are now 20 years or even 30 years and you have been born in the united states or europe or a developing country depending which country you are from itâ s very different but essentially i can say that almost for sure you have never experienced what is a good government if you are about 20 you were born in 2001 that was the year of the attack on the world trade center in new york then you had eight years of the bush administration eight years of the obama administration four years of trump if you were in germany you had 16 years of chancellor merkel a time of complete stagnation in this whole period you had 20 years of a war in afghanistan now you see what these 20 years resulted in namely that this period of the endless wars is ended and with what an incredible experience where the most powerful military force in the worldâ that of the united states and nato countriesâ could not win in 20 years against 65 000 taliban fighters that has left a complete vacuum in the strategic situation naturally all these other endless wars in iraq in libya in syria in latin america in africa you are plagued with incredible poverty and the effects of the pandemic were devastating you had mass migration in many countries the drug lobby or the drug producers and drug mafias are running the country if you look at the recent figures of the ilo the international labor organization 60 of all jobs worldwide are in the shadow economy which means that people have been living from hand to mouth just how fragile our world is has become very clear during the pandemic you have also been told by the mass media and most politicians that russia and china are autocratic states in which there is no freedom and no liberty if you look around the world you are actually in a horrendous situation there are more than 820 million people who are under nourished who go to bed hungry every day that means every 10th person does not have enough food one million die of hunger every month 2 billion people have no access to clean water view full size wfp michael tewelde the head of the world food program david beasley has been saying many times in the recent months that we are in front of a hunger catastrophe which is already going on of biblical dimensions he said basically this incredible information about almost 1 billion people going hungry may catch the headlines for a day but then itâ s forgotten again and nothing happens is there any chance the g20 would immediately organize an emergency summit saying this is intolerable we have all the technologies we could change that we could start an immediate humanitarian airlift to the southern hemisphere we could double food production we could make sure that not one child is going hungry anymore within a few months we are calling upon the farmers of the world to double the food production which they easily could do well obviously nothing like this is happening look at the u s mexico border where recently 15 000 people were gathering under this bridge and then were chased away with whips and devices worse than during the time of slavery look at the mediterranean this is not any better over the last several years hundreds of thousands of people have tried to flee from hunger in southwest asia in northern africa the border organization of the european union frontex is now in a court trial because it was involved in and condoned push back operations driving the refugees back into the water where there is an uncertain possibility to survive this has been happening in the recent period in greece and on the islands in croatia if you look at this incredible condition what is the reaction of the population in the united states or in european countries do people go into the streets and say â we want justice for all of these incredible situations because it would be so easy to remedyâ no nothing of this sort is happening ok during the pandemic people got a little bit upset because they were deprived of their usual kind of life but in general they were quite indifferent to the suffering in africa latin america iraq or afghanistan or haiti i think itâ s not wrong to say that what characterizes the outlook of most people in the united states and europe probably other places in asia as wellâ i come to that later on you could characterize it as â depraved indifferenceâ indifference against the suffering of people which reflects on the depraved character of those who are not acting this is basically all the result of a deliberate policy this is not a natural catastrophe this is actually something which my late husband lyndon larouche was warning against in 1971 he said that if the imf would continue their policy of monetarist austerity you would see practically pandemics erupting you would see mass genocide and the condition of the developing countries for the most part is the result of first a colonial policy and then the continuation of that policy by the imf world bank and the leading financial institutions of this world it is a cold blooded policy to keep the markets happy and the governments have long become the servants of these financial institutions view full size wikimedia commons fyraan the murderous madness of malthusians it is a complete lack of empathy because otherwise this could not exist for about 50 years it is in general a lack of interest to even find out about it on the side of the general population now since about two years we have an escalation of this policy in the west itâ s now called â shifting the trillions â this was a decision made by the top central bankers and leading bankers in august 2019 at their annual meeting in jackson hole wyoming where they decided on a regime change to shift the power from being in the hands of governments to the central banks which would determine not only the monetary policy but also the fiscal policy in other words the budgets and how investments occur in general it was called â shifting the trillions â there is actually a very interesting paper with that title which people should really read then these policies were announced with different names by the world economic forum at davos where it was called the great reset the green new deal in the united states the biden administration just released a fact sheet and a report directing that all investments should go into green technologies even earlier joachim schellnhuber talked about the great transformation of the world economy the decarbonization basically saying that all fossil fuels and related industries are out everyone has to go into renewables mostly nuclear energy is not regarded as a green technology even so there is some debate about that and now all of this has to be finalized by the great cop26 summit in glasgow which starts interestingly on halloween the 31st of october therefore a period comes to a head which was announced by prince charles in 2019 when he announced that the world has only 18 months left to save the planet naturally the fridays for future and greta thunberg had said there are only 12 years left of which now two years have passed already but what prince charles meant was that there are only three major summits which absolutely had to accomplish this transformation or it would be too late the first being the world food summit then the biodiversity summit and culminating now with cop26 in glasgow where actually all legislation and all governments had to be sworn in to go for this great reset all of this is in the name of stopping climate change that is actually quite absurd anybody who has ever looked into climate science which is very complicated and involves many different areas of natural science will find out that the climate has been changing for millions of years that has to do with the earthâ s position in our milky way galaxy it has to do with processes in the sun it has to do with cosmic radiation and now in the name of protecting the climate they are now pushing the biggest deception operation in history it has nothing to do with the real reasons for climate change the leading institutions of the united states u k the eu the imf the world bank the world economic forum are all proceeding on the basis of this first option i mentioned concerning the image of man that man is a parasite a pollutant a burden to nature klaus schwab has written a new book called stakeholder capitalism in that book he actually admits that the neo liberal system is a failed system something which was announced 50 years prognosed by my late husband what they mean by neo liberal system is that paradigm which occurred for the last 50 years which included outsourcing production into cheap labor markets to have no more warehouses for production but have trucks arrive just in time and going public on the stock exchange view full size clockwise from top left wef msc mueller wef pascal bitz now naturally it is quite clear that with the supply lines all collapsing they want to have a new model so what klaus schwab says in this book is that after recounting economic infrastructure development details from ethiopia its railroads agriculture gains the grand renaissance dam even renewable energy he insisted that it has to stop he writes that the kind of development being undertaken in ethiopia â reveals the central conundrum of the combat against climate change â and now comes the important quote the same force that helps people escape from poverty and lead a decent life is the one that is destroying the livability of our planet for future generations the emissions that lead to climate change are not just the result of a selfish generation of industrialists or western baby boomers they are the consequence of the desire to create a better future for oneself now that is quite something basically what he says is that any attempt to overcome under development to overcome poverty to create a better life is what destroys nature so naturally he calls it a conundrum an unsolvable paradox that is why he wants to now have a new model called â stakeholder capitalism â what that is supposed to be is the ominous name is â dematerialized growth â there should no longer be investments in physical economy but in financial titles instead in co 2 emissions trade which is practically a nonexistent thing you pay others like the developing countries to not produce so that you can produce to make money by speculating on non investment of others then they have this new thing the nebulous esg environmental social governance that is about everything you can imagine but it has nothing to do with production what that means is if this policy of the stakeholder capitalism is being implementedâ and it is being pushed right now actively by the eu commission by the u k and u s governmentsâ it means the de industrialization of the so called advanced sector it means the complete destruction of the mittelstand because it makes energy and many other raw materials so expensive that they are unaffordable it for sure means the impoverishment of masses of population it means more billionaires it increases the gap between the very rich and the very poor and it absolutely means no development for the developing sector which in practice means a massive population reduction for africa latin america and large parts of asia and even pockets of third world type conditions in the united states or europe this is the intended takeover of a malthusian world order the idea to have the malthusian world outlook to take over all institutions to create a world government which is run by such a regime view full size top left john linnel bottom cc kiefer more quotations from malthusians letâ s look at what malthusianism actually is and where it comes from it goes back to the british east india company and you cannot think about that outlook without taking into account the practice of the african slave trade the opium wars against china the whole colonial policy against africa india latin america letâ s look at the quote of thomas malthus from his essay on the principle of population all children who are born beyond what would be required to keep up the population to a desired level must necessarily perish unless room be made for them by the death of grown personsâ we should facilitate instead of foolishly and vainly endeavoring to impede the operations of nature in producing this mortality and if we dread the too frequent visitation of the horrid form of famine we should sedulously encourage the other forms of destruction which we compel nature to use instead of recommending cleanliness to the poor we should encourage contrary habits in our towns we should make the streets narrower crowd more people into the houses and court the return of the plague in the country we should build our villages near stagnant pools and particularly encourage settlement in all marshy and unwholesome situations but above all we should reprobate specific remedies for ravaging diseases and restrain those benevolent but much mistaken men who have thought they are doing a service to mankind by protecting schemes for the total extirpation of particular disorders now what this malthusian policy which was the policy of the british empire actually characterizes since then is an extreme form of calvinism which means that if you are rich that proves god is on your side because he has selected you you do not have any need to have compassion for the poor because itâ s godâ s choice that you are among the privileged there are many other writers other than malthus there was jeremy bentham who wrote a defence of usury bernard mandeville who had the incredible theory that private crime private vice is necessary to stimulate the economy and leads to public good for example if you have a murderer this is very good for the economy because that means the murderer eventually needs a lawyer who makes money you need a judge you need a court and all of these contribute to the well being of society the public good naturally all of these writings are complete lies and just a cover story but neverthelessâ then you have john stuart mill who developed the idea of utilitarianism namely that usefulness is the only criteria in everything which concerns society and the economy naturally this goes along with unbelievable racism not just racism practically against the poorer classes but a racism against all colored people look at this quote of bertrand russell who wrote in his book the impact of science on society in 1951 the white population of the world will soon cease to increase the asiatic races will be longer and the negroes still longer before their birth rate falls sufficiently to make their numbers stable without help of war and pestilence i do not pretend that birth control is the only way in which population can be kept from increasing there are others which one must suppose opponents of birth control would prefer war as i remarked a moment ago has hitherto been disappointing in this respect but perhaps bacteriological war may prove more effective if a black death could be spread throughout the world once in every generation survivors could procreate freely without making the world too full there would be nothing in this to offend the consciences of the devout or to restrain the ambitions of nationalists the state of affairs might be somewhat unpleasant but what of that really high minded people are indifferent to happiness especially other peopleâ s this was obviously the immediate basis for what prince philip had to say who was the founder of the world wildlife fund if you want to know one of the major reasons why the development of the developing countries is so absolutely nonexistent you make a list of how many projects of bridges or dams or railroads were not built because the world wildlife fund discovered an insect which was about to disappear if a bridge would be built there prince philip said you cannot keep a bigger flock of sheep than you are capable of feeding in other words conservation may involve culling in order to keep a balance between the relative numbers in each species within any particular habitat i realize this is a very touchy subject but the fact remains that mankind is part of the living worldâ each new field that is cultivated means another field that is withheld from wild species naturally wild species are more important than the human species the same prince philip in an interview with people magazine in 1981 answered the question â what do you think is the greatest threat to the environment â he answered human population growth is probably the greatest long term threat to survival we are facing a major catastrophe if itâ s not contained not only for the natural but also for the human world the more people there are the more resources they will consume the more pollution they will cause the more battles they will fight we have no other choice if it is not voluntarily controlled it will involuntarily be controlled by the increase in disease hunger and war in the event that i am reincarnated i would like to return as a deadly virus to contribute something to solving overpopulation view full size public domain another major malthusian expression is from dennis meadows who was one of the two authors of the famous book the limits to growth which was published and promoted by the club of rome it basically had the ridiculous thesis that the resources are limited and therefore we have sort of developed up to this pointâ which was 1972â and now we have reached an asymptotic barrier and have to go to zero growth and reduction of growth he said no even 7 billion people are too many for this planetâ if everyone is allowed to have the full potential of mobility nutrition and self development it will be 1 or 2 billion schiller institute defends humanity what characterizes the schiller institute the larouche organization is what my husband lyndon larouche already in the 1970s or starting in the late 1960s had put forward as development plans for africa a full development plan for the entire continent of africa with infrastructure ports railways highways energy production and distribution communication if that would have been implemented which we had many efforts to accomplish africa would be today the most developed continent with the most flourishing agriculture industry etc we worked on a 40 year development plan together with indira gandhi in the beginning of the 1980s we worked on latin american integration with president josã lã³pez portillo because we were working on all of that even before the club of rome developed this limits to growth perspective we had a very clear idea of how easy it would be to transform these continents and make them livable for every human being on this planet therefore when the club of rome published the limits to growth book it was clear to us this was an onslaught from the side of the oligarchy lyndon larouche immediately wrote a counter book with the title there are no limits to growth which is a scientific discussion of why resources are only limited when you stay on the same level of technology and that it is uniquely human creativity which redefines what is a resource that is essentially a limitless process and it is not limited to the planet earth it involves the entire universe as we have now demonstrated by space missions bringing back materials from the moon soon we will have helium 3 imported from the moon to produce fusion power on earth we are now talking about taking resources from asteroids there are now plans to have a village on the moon cities on mars so itâ s very clear that this whole conception of limits to growth was based on a fraud it was basically a computer model of linear functions leaving out the most important aspect namely that the definition of what a resource is will be always changing by inventions of new physical principles which redefine scientific and technological methods being used in the production process so we countered that from the very beginning i created an organization sort of a predecessor of the schiller institute which i called the club of life for the defense of life on this planet against these imperialists just to give you one more quote from somebody who wrote a disgusting book called the population bombâ paul ehrlich he says a cancer is an uncontrolled multiplication of cells the population explosion is an uncontrolled multiplication of people treating only the symptoms of cancer may make the victim more comfortable at first but eventually he diesâ often horribly a similar fate awaits a world with a population explosion if only the symptoms are treated we must shift our efforts from treatment of the symptoms to the cutting out of the cancer the operation will demand many apparently brutal and heartless decisions the pain may be intense but the disease is so far advanced that only with radical surgery does the patient have a chance of survival and in an interview with the guardian ehrlich said how many you support depends on lifestyles we came up with the 1 5 to 2 billion because you can have big active cities and wildernesses if you want a battery chicken world where everyone has minimum space and food and everyone is kept just about alive you might be able to support in the long term about 4 or 5 billion people but you already have 7 billion so we have to humanely and as rapidly as possible move to population shrinkage that is the bestial view here is one last quote from hans joachim schellnhuber who is one of the absolute gurus of the british empire he always wants to be only called commander of the british empire he was the director of the potsdam institute for climate impact research and later became the advisor of the pontifical academy of sciences and was very influential on the recent encyclicals of pope francis so he wrote at the 2009 climate conference in a very cynical way itâ s a triumph for science because at last we have stabilized somethingâ namely the estimates for the carrying capacity of the planet namely below 1 billion people now here we go â below 1 billion people â but we already have about 8 billion now so what is the plan of these people how to do away with the so called â superfluous eatersâ we had that already once 80 years agoâ well greta thunberg said the problem started in great britain and what she meant was the beginning of the industrialization in great britain the fight through the ages letâ s look at what is the real fight between these two images of man and forms of society around the same time in the late part of the 18th century when these really evil ideas of the malthusians developed around the same time friedrich schiller the german poet of freedom wrote a very important article called â the legislation of lycurgus and solon â and there he contrasted the model of the ancient greek city state of sparta and that of athens as the two fundamental models of society which are in absolute contradiction based on the corresponding two images of man as i said in the beginning man as an expendable parasite which can be killed off if there are too many or man as the highest expression in the universe and in this case schiller very presciently understood that sparta was really the basic model for this oligarchical system the basis for modern day malthusianism in this case lycurgus the ruler had organized the state in such a way that if you look at it in the first view everything looks very organized everything is for the benefit of the elite the state but if you look a little bit closer you see that they actually have slaves which they called helots and if there are too many of those you can actually kill them off and train your youth to shoot these helots until theyâ re culled as i think it was philip said is legitimate to do and this he contrasts with solon and the wise laws of the city of solon and when solon according to schiller was asked what is the purpose of society he said â progression that all citizens develop in the best possible way â now lyndon larouche wrote a very beautiful article in the â 70s already called â the secrets known only to the inner elites â in which he confronts exactly these two modelsâ and again i would recommend this as reading material the great reset is actually based on this imperial model it is maybe looking more modern it uses slightly different categories and notions but it is an exact copy of earlier oligarchical models which have a long tradition which have existed for at least the last 3 000 years 4 000 or 5 000 years and one can actually trace back the modern liberalism directly to the pantheism of earlier oligarchical societies which always were based on parasitical usury for the benefit of an elite of an upper class which treated the mass of the population as cattle view full size wikimedia commons they were always based on the mother earth cult exactly like the greenies like the ecologists or these people who treat nature and climate as a new form of religion this cult appeared in the earliest different civilizations you always had a mother earth kind of god on the one side and you mostly had a male god which was mostly in the form of a phallus symbol or a snake in the harappa dravidian civilization which was about 2 500 1 700 years before christ you had the goddess shakti on the male side you had the god shiva in the chaldean civilization you had ishtar in the sheba ethiopian civilization you had attar in the canaan civilization astarte in the hellenic egyptian you had isis on the female side and osiris on the male side in the phrygian civilization you had cybele and on the male side dionysus and finally in the ancient greek cult of delphi you had the mother earth goddess gaia and on the male side you had python what is the common characteristic of all these early gods and later the gods of olympus in the greek mythology was that they were completely arbitrary they would rule according to whims they would not give laws which you could rationally understand but they would make â rules â like an early â rules based societyâ where they would basically always look for the advantage of the ruling elites and they would basically control man whom they regarded as being controlled by hedonistic impulses and therefore in order to control these masses you had to manipulate these hedonistic impulses this happened in all empires the roman empire the circuses the amphitheaters having the christians eaten by lions to bring out the worst in peopleâ the worse they are the better you could control them what is common to all these mother earth cults is a cyclical world outlook there is no progress there is the eternal return of the same and it took mankind an enormous struggle to break through and break loose from this kind of an irrational domination of an oligarchy it is very fascinating to study how in the history of mankind man did break free and the first major such breakthrough was actually the greek poet or author homer in his iliad and odyssey he discusses how odysseus challenges the arbitrary rule of these gods so this was the first time that man at least in literature which is still available was able to free himself of this irrational control the next major step was the prometheus trilogy by the greek poet aeschylus of which only parts still exist but very clearly you can read there about the beautiful image of prometheus as one of the half gods who separated from the gods of olympus by bringing fire to man and there are some beautiful descriptions if you read the play prometheus how fire enabled man to make higher conquest of nature how he developed to have better food to have better living conditions and naturally why zeus hated prometheus for having brought this technology to man and that is why zeus had chained him to a rock and the bird is picking at his liver for eternity quite a brutal punishment but the promethean man corresponds very clearly to the idea of man the most advanced figure in existence in the universe then the major next step in the liberation of man was the ideas of socrates and plato what is the significance of especially plato is that the collected dialogues and writings of platoâ socrates is only being quoted by platoâ was to show man for the first time in a coherent fashion that man is not hedonistic that man is the only species which is capable of ideas that ideas are the real existence and the world of sense certainty is only the world of shadows the kinds of shadows you see as if you are sitting in a dark cave where the light from outside the cave is throwing shadows on the wall of the cave what you perceive as the shadow is not realityâ reality is outside the cave of sense perception this was a major step forward and still one step beyond that was the emergence of jesus christ of christianity because here you had for the first time the idea of man in the image of god the creator now since god is limitless in perfection in omniscient power man in the image of the creator is himself not just an image but as nicholas of cusa would later say imago viva dei in the living imageâ the image is living the â living image of godâ and therefore with christ the cyclical world outlook has been absolutely broken through forever and it is the advantage and merit of augustine who wrote several centuries later that the affinity between platonism and christianity is such that you find in plato a lot of the things which were revealed later by christianity which means augustine concludes that creative reason is able to identify what is being revealed in other words there is no contradiction between creative reason and belief and this is a very important tradition in european philosophy those who believe that there is a coherence between science and religion as compared to those who only believe that you can only trust the revealed word which is completely separate and above science and knowledge which you find today in the united states being a big controversy ecologists nazi defenders and prince philip there was a book written in 1949 immediately after the second world war and the nazi period by an author called armin mohler he wrote a book called the conservative revolution this is a very important book because he describes how conservation which is another word for the ecology outlook that was a counter movement against the ideas of 1776 and 1789 meaning the american revolution and the idea of the republic by a variety of conservative movements there were 400 such tendencies one of them became the nazis in this book armin mohler makes a very important observation where he quotes various authors and basically says what happened with christianity was that for the first time the idea of the cyclical world outlook was interrupted for good because with the emergence of christ being both man and god and the idea of every man in the image of god which came to the man through the person of jesus christ you had for the first time the overcoming detonation of the cyclical world outlook because it introduced the idea of limitless perfection of man this is actually very interesting because at one conference called â religion and environment â prince philip said explicitly referring to the cyclical worldview he said that in order to protect the environment and in order to protect nature one should go back to the pre christian mythologies to the mother earth idea to gaia to the cyclical world outlook because only if you think in this way can you accomplish the goals of environmentalism this oligarchical form of society in which a small elite would be running things over masses which were kept as backward as possible where only the privileges of nobility and the upper class the royals the kings the barons counts and so forth would be protected that was at least for most of the european history some forms of asian history and one would have to look at asian history chinese history a little bit differently but those were governmental forms which were dominant practically everywhere until the 15th century the first time you had governments which were not dominated by such oligarchical forms occurred in the italian renaissance already before you had here and there small forms of urban development the role of science and crafts improved the living conditions of people a little bit but the real big break came with the golden italian renaissance where now the role of scientific and technological progress is very explicit the increase of educationâ this was helped a little bit later also by guttenberg and the printing press which in europe only appeared in the 15th century in china it was earlierâ an increase in living standard as a result of this application of science and technology the increase in longevity you had great artistic breakthroughs the republican nation state breakthrough you had the emergence of the sovereign nation state now this is very very important because up to the 15th century you had always imperial forms of government you had emperors you had czars you had kingsâ even the very idea of kingdom was already a step forward from the standpoint of empire and if you study the long thousands of years of emergence of the nation state it is very fascinating and you can see that the image of man and the form of government actually went parallel to each other now nicholas of cusa was the first to formulate this principle of the sovereign nation state in his concordantia catholica where he said that for a good government you need the consent of the governed and you need a reciprocal legal relationship between the governed the governors and the government where basically a representative has to represent both the interest of the state and those who are governed in a reciprocal way that is why the republican system of government is superior to a pure democracy and why the sovereign government is the only form of government where especially in times of crisis the interest of the people can be protected and why all forms of supranational government are in the interest of the oligarchy because you have no way to protect the interest of the people view full size jean lã onard lugardon at the same time of the italian renaissance you had a similar tendency in france under the rule of king louis xi in which in 20 years of his rule there was a doubling of the living standard and a watershed breakthrough of this tendency was the american revolution where for the first time you had the establishment of a republic you had a constitution in which the preamble already said that the common good is what gives legitimacy to the government not only for the present but also to future generations there was from the very beginning of this sovereign nation state idea devoted to the common good which emerged in the 15th century an opposition which intended to destroy any form of society which would be based on the investment in scientific progress so as to increase the productivity of the productive powers in the case of the italian renaissance that opposition was venice the venetian empire which immediately started to factionalize to create unrest and friction and to fight to maintain the oligarchical model the empire the empire shifted its headquarters empires and people who belong to empires have no national loyalties but they always work together on an international level and they donâ t really care if the headquarters of the empire is in rome in byzantium in persia in venice in holland in great britain because they shift according to how things go and they are what lyndon larouche called a â slime mold â which may change like the color and form of a champignon a slime mold but it remains the same regardless of whether itâ s green brown stinks or not so this fight between that form of society and a sovereign republic has been the principal fight for the last 600 years in the 17th and 18th century there was the beginning of what would be called modern political economics on the european continent and it was known at that time under the name of â cameralism â major contributing thinkers were cardinal richelieu mazarin colbert and leibniz leibniz was the first to develop the idea of physical economy of the role of scientific and technological progress in increasing productivity and in a very small but important writing society and economy he talks about the role of academies to take care of social justice of the development of labor power as the only source of wealth of the importance to have a full manufacture in every country to be self sufficient in terms of all supply lines as we would say nowadays to go for a higher qualification of all apprentices to become masters themselves as quickly as possible and the main rule of the academy he said is to spread love and trust among the members so when you look at certain modern textbooks about the theory of leibniz what do they say they say that he developed the ideal of an authoritarian welfare state with a metaphysical intention where the statecraft coheres with the divine service and the aim is to further the mental development and morality of the members of society now obviously the idea that the economy should be in cohesion with the creation the laws of the universe and the moral development of the people that is obviously the exact opposite of the hedonistic conception of the british imperialism faction which we discussed before nothing is more feared by the oligarchy than a state that is furthering the moral and intellectual development of its citizens which obviously is the basis of sovereignty because only if you have well educated creative and therefore free citizens can a country be sovereign china and russia this is the real reason why you have right now such an incredible campaign against china and why china is portrayed as the absolute enemy opponent competitor adversary and why all the think thanks and the mainstream media and many governments and politicians regard china as the absolute threat i can tell you from my own experience with china which goes back to 1971â and all iâ m saying about china i have come to the conclusion of my own investigation and observation and iâ m not talking about something i read iâ m talking about something iâ ve looked at in detail for now about 40 years and i can tell you that china is not aggressive it is not imperial china is not trying to replace the unipolar world of the anglo americans theyâ re not trying to coerce people china is trying to create a new system of win win collaboration of what xi jinping calls â a community with a shared future for humankind â so why is this such a threat well china has for the last 30 40 years but especially the last 30 years made the most incredible development you have ever seen itâ s an unprecedented historical civilizational accomplishment because they have lifted 850 million of their own people out of poverty the belt and road initiative the new silk road is now cooperating with about 150 countries many of which have now for the first time had the chance to overcome the poverty left by the colonialist powers now if you think about the first quote from klaus schwab which i read to you the fact that china is putting such an emphasis on the intellectual and moral improvement of its citizens xi jinping talks about the need to have an aesthetic education for all students to produce a beautiful mind because only a beautiful mind can be the source of new great works of art then you understand why they regard china as such a threat because they are teaching literally millions and millions of students to become scientists to become teachers to become great artists to improve morally and intellectually that is exactly the opposite of what the klaus schwab model is that is why putin is absolutely right when in a very important speech which you should read october 21 at the valdai discussion club conference he said it is very clear that the current model of capitalism is not working and that we are now entering a new era that this is a transformation which is going on in the world over a completely different caliber he talked about the likelihood that things will get much worse he talked about a coming cataclysm and that the usual approaches donâ t function and he said after all it is clear that when a real crisis strikes there is only one universal value left and that is human life life is of absolute value a wake up call completely independently of putin who made that speech two days ago i wrote about two weeks or so a â wake up callâ which most of you have probably read by now where i in the first part discuss that people should not just look at this phenomenon or that phenomenon the part of the crisis that concerns them that all the different things that are going wrong on the planet from hunger to inability of countries to have vaccines against covid the hyperinflation all of these things are symptoms of the fact that this system is collapsing and that therefore professor guus berkhout and i issued this wake up call which should become the unifying point of departure to create an anti malthusian resistance of many many forces in the world who oppose this present attack on the value of life as it is expressed by the schwabs and philips and schellnhubers of this world in this wake up call after describing the present situation i developed several points which i think should be the points of discussion among many many forces in the world because we need to agree what image of man is the one we accept and therefore let me read to you these principles which i think are very basic and should be the starting point 1 human life is inviolable man is the only species endowed with creative reason which distinguishes him from all other living beings this creative capability enables him to continually discover new principles of the physical universe which is called scientific progress the fact that the human mind through an immaterial idea is able to discover these principles which then have an effect in the material universe in the form of technological progress proves that there is a correspondence between the lawfulness of the human mind and the laws of the physical universe 2 just as the spatial expanse and anti entropic evolution of the universe are infinite so is the intellectual and moral perfectibility of the human mind therefore every additional human being is a new source for further development of the universe and for the solution of problems on earth such as overcoming poverty disease underdevelopment and violence taking care of each other is key in this ongoing development it is the combination of creativity and empathy that transcends mere day to day exigencies 3 scientific and technological progress has a positive effect in that when applied to the production process it increases the productivity of the labor force and of industrial and agricultural capacities which in turn leads to rising living standards and a longer life expectancy for more and more people a prosperous physical economy is the precondition for the positive development of the common good providing not only the elites but all people with quality food clean water affordable and modern health care quality education modern communications and above all cheap and sufficient energy with high energy flux densities inherently safe third generation nuclear energy and the future use of thermonuclear fusion are indispensable for securing mankindâ s energy supply for an unlimited time unreliable energy systems and increasing energy prices are the mother of inflation poverty starts with energy poverty 4 the purpose of the economy has nothing to do with profit but with the happiness of people in the sense meant by gottfried wilhelm leibniz i e that people are able to develop all the inherent potentials they have into a harmonious whole and thus contribute to the best possible further development of mankind or as the wise solon of athens said the purpose of mankind is progress it is the duty of good government through its policies to provide for the happiness of its citizens in this sense beginning with universal education for all the goal of which must be to foster beautiful character through education and the development of an ever increasing number of geniuses this perspective is in accordance with vladimir vernadskyâ s conviction that the physical universe must inherently evolve in such a way that the share of the noã sphere increasingly grows in relation to the biosphere to be more specific growth should be two fold creativity for the material necessities and empathy for the immaterial needs taking care of each other and our natural environment is presented in our slogan â prosperity for all â in which all refers not only to us in the here and now but also to future generations 5 manâ s true destiny is not to remain an earthling his identity as the only known species endowed with creative reason is to explore space as we did with planet earth what space pioneer krafft ehricke called the â extraterrestrial imperative â or in a certain sense the new educational effect of space travel on man requires mankind to truly â grow up â that is to cast off his irrational impulses and make creativity his identity which has so far only been the case for outstanding scientists and artists of classical culture in this phase of
