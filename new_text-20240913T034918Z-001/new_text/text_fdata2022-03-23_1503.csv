recently tbk bank ssb confirmed a data breach that may have exposed the names addresses social security numbers and bank account information of certain customers if you received a data breach notification it is essential you understand what is at risk more about our investigation into this breach and what you can do if your data was stolen is available here last year 1 862 data breaches affected more than 189 million people on average victims of identity theft spend 200 hours and over 1 300 recovering their identity many victims also suffer emotional distress credit damage and may even end up with a criminal record taking immediate action is the best way to prevent the worst consequences of a data breach what we know so far about the tbk bank data breach according to an official filing by the company on around december 6 2021 tbk bank became aware of unauthorized activity on an employee s email account tbk bank secured the email account and then conducted an investigation into the nature and extent of the incident the company s investigation revealed that between december 1 and december 6 2021 the unauthorized party was able to access the employee s email account the investigation could not rule out the possibility that the unauthorized party viewed emails or attachments containing sensitive consumer information upon learning of the extent of the security breach tbk bank then reviewed the affected files to determine what information was compromised on january 28 2022 the company completed its review and while the compromised information varies based on the consumer it may include your name social security number driver s license state identification number and passport number on march 17 2022 tbk bank began sending out data breach notification letters to all individuals whose information was compromised as a result of the recent data security incident tbk bank is a state savings bank based in dallas texas tbk bank is a subsidiary of triumph bancorp inc which is a publicly traded company on the nasdaq under the ticker symbol tbk tbk bank has 63 branches across colorado illinois iowa kansas new mexico and texas the bank offers traditional banking products including individual and business checking and savings accounts mortgage loans personal loans business loans and more tbk bank has about 250 employees and generates approximately 161 million in annual revenue more about the causes and risks of data breaches often data breaches are the result of a hacker gaining unauthorized access to a company s computer systems with the intention of obtaining sensitive consumer information while no one can know the reason why a hacker targeted tbk bank it is common for hackers and other criminals to identify those companies believed to have weak data security systems or vulnerabilities in their networks once a cybercriminal gains access to a computer network they can then access and remove any data stored on the compromised servers while in most cases a company experiencing a data breach can identify which files were accessible there may be no way for the company to tell which files the hacker actually accessed or whether they removed any data while the fact that your information was compromised in a data breach does not necessarily mean it will be used for criminal purposes being the victim of a data breach puts your sensitive data in the hands of an unauthorized person as a result you are at an increased risk of identity theft and other frauds and criminal use of your information is a possibility that should not be ignored given this reality individuals who receive a tbk bank data breach notification should take the situation seriously and remain vigilant in checking for any signs of unauthorized activity businesses like tbk bank are responsible for protecting the consumer data in their possession if evidence emerges that tbk bank failed to adequately protect your sensitive information you may be eligible for financial compensation through a data breach lawsuit what are consumers remedies in the wake of the tbk bank data breach when customers decided to do business with tbk bank they assumed that the company would take their privacy concerns seriously and it goes without saying that consumers would think twice before giving a company access to their information if they knew it wasn t going to be secure thus data breaches such as this one raise questions about the adequacy of a company s data security system when a business government entity non profit organization school or any other organization accepts and stores consumer data it also accepts a legal obligation to ensure this information remains private the united states data breach laws allow consumers to pursue civil data breach claims against organizations that fail to protect their information of course given the recency of the tbk bank data breach the investigation into the incident is still in its early stages and as of right now there is not yet any evidence suggesting tbk bank is legally responsible for the breach however that could change as additional information about the breach and its causes is revealed if you have questions about your ability to bring a data breach class action lawsuit against tbk bank reach out to a data breach attorney as soon as possible what should you do if you receive a tbk bank data breach notification if tbk bank sends you a data breach notification letter you are among those whose information was compromised in the recent breach while this isn t a time to panic the situation warrants your attention below are a few important steps you can take to protect yourself from identity theft and other fraudulent activity identify what information was compromised the first thing to do after learning of a data breach is to carefully review the data breach letter sent the letter will tell you what information of yours was accessible to the unauthorized party be sure to make a copy of the letter and keep it for your records if you have trouble understanding the letter or what steps you can take to protect yourself a data breach lawyer can help limit future access to your accounts once you determine what information of yours was affected by the breach the safest play is to assume that the hacker orchestrating the attack stole your data while this may not be the case it s better to be safe than sorry to prevent future access to your accounts you should change all passwords and security questions for any online account this includes online banking accounts credit card accounts online shopping accounts and any other account containing your personal information you should also consider changing your social media account passwords and setting up multi factor authentication where it is available protect your credit and your financial accounts after a data breach companies often provide affected parties with free credit monitoring services signing up for the free credit monitoring offers some significant protections and doesn t impact any of your rights to pursue a data breach lawsuit against the company if it turns out they were legally responsible for the breach you should contact a credit bureau to request a copy of your credit report even if you do not notice any signs of fraud or unauthorized activity adding a fraud alert to your account will provide you with additional protection consider implementing a credit freeze a credit freeze prevents anyone from accessing your credit report credit freezes are free and stay in effect until you remove them once a credit freeze is in place you can temporarily lift the freeze if you need to apply for any type of credit while placing a credit freeze on your accounts may seem like overkill given the risks involved it s justified according to the identity theft resource center itrc placing a credit freeze on your account is the single most effective way to prevent a new credit financial account from being opened however just 3 of data breach victims place a freeze on their accounts regularly monitor your credit report and financial accounts protecting yourself in the wake of a data breach requires an ongoing effort on your part you should regularly check your credit report and all financial account statements looking for any signs of unauthorized activity or fraud you should also call your banks and credit card companies to report the fact that your information was compromised in a data breach below is a copy of the initial data breach letter

for those enterprises that have or had ongoing business arrangements and investments in russia now is the time to assess and fully understand risks entailed whether electing to stay in russia to withdraw or to curtail operations foreign investors with assets in russia need to move quickly to protect their right s and identify and prepare for possible disputes so should parties with commercial agreements including joint ventures with businesses in russia global sanctions on russia and their corresponding economic pressure continue to increase and the ripple effects and ramifications will only grow as evidenced by the disruptions already being experienced in natural resources markets the government of russia in response to these sanctions has imposed counter sanctions and credibly threatened to expropriate or nationalize russian companies with significant foreign shareholding when the investors home governments are unfriendly towards russia the invasion of ukraine has fundamentally altered the world order the tragic results already include both military and civilian casualties property loss and destruction and a mounting refugee crisis it is unclear when and how a cessation of hostilities will be achieved for those enterprises that have or had ongoing business arrangements and investments in russia now is the time to assess and fully understand risks entailed whether electing to stay in russia to withdraw or to curtail operations a variety of disputes are likely to arise whatever business decision is made the invasion has led to a range of financial and other sanctions that have upended global commerce an economy the size of russia has never before been impaired by substantial economic sanctions and export controls current foreign direct investments in russia are fundamentally changed and future investment plans in russia have largely halted hundreds of foreign investors with assets and activities in russia have acted quickly to announce exits from russia or fundamental changes to their russian businesses this enormous upheaval is reminiscent of other recent seismic events including 9 11 the arab spring and the argentinian financial crisis and comes on the heels of a global pandemic that already strained global supply chains although the future of global commerce involving russia is unpredictable one thing is certain these events will lead to legal disputes many of which will be resolved in international arbitrations foreign investors with assets in russia need to move quickly to protect their rights and identify and prepare for possible disputes so should parties with commercial agreements including joint ventures with businesses in russia global sanctions and export controls on russia and their corresponding economic pressure continue to increase and the ripple effects and ramifications will only grow as evidenced by the disruptions already being experienced in natural resources markets the government of russia in response to these sanctions has imposed counter sanctions and credibly threatened to expropriate or nationalize russian companies with significant foreign shareholding when the investors home governments are unfriendly towards russia commercial arrangements and joint ventures with private russian businesses and state owned enterprises alike have already been impacted by sanctions which may cause those businesses to be unable to function or to meet their commercial and financial obligations sooner rather than later treaty protections russia has credibly threatened retaliatory measures to harm foreign investors in russia as a result of sanctions from a long list of countries specifically russia has proposed legislation that would allow russia to seize companies with major shareholdings from host countries that have sanctioned russia and potentially to auction off the identified companies shares russia s long list of unfriendly countries covers approximately 60 of global gdp and encompasses the united states the uk most european countries canada australia new zealand switzerland japan south korea singapore taiwan and others and the list is growing the precise nature of possible russian action is still uncertain and differs on a company by company basis disputes arising out of russian harm to foreign investors have not yet materialized publicly but a general risk of russian action against foreign investors exists foreign investors in russia should plan now to manage and mitigate against possible future disputes with the government of russia one possible basis to recover for harm to a foreign investment is through an investment treaty investment treaties are often but not always between two countries and are known as bilateral investments treaties or bits investment treaties provide substantive protections to foreign investors and often include the right for the investor to bring arbitration claims directly against the host state in this case russia for violations of the treaty investment treaties provide a powerful mechanism that has led to hundreds of awards against states including several major awards against russia to date the first step to assess investment treaty protections in russia is to review the company s and its beneficial owners chain of ownership in the investment structure including whether there are treaty rights already in place russia has a large number of high standard investment treaties in force with countries from all parts of the world one notable absence from this list however is that there is no investment treaty in force between the united states and russia an additional complicating factor is that several of russia s earlier treaties particularly those completed near the time of the fall of the soviet union have narrow arbitration clauses for example some treaties restrict arbitration to claims involving free transfer of convertible currency out of russia and the amount in controversy for a nationalization or expropriation see for example bits with the united kingdom germany netherlands luxembourg spain switzerland and korea depending on an investor s existing treaty rights as well as tax and other commercial and legal considerations investors may wish to restructure their investments in russia prior to a dispute with russia arising in order to ensure maximum treaty protections restructuring could allow for new or additional treaty based protections including substantive rights as a foreign investor in russia and investor state dispute settlement as a means to prosecute claims against russia there are likely also good business reasons to restructure based on russia s existing threats toward investors located in home countries that are viewed by russia as unfriendly due to sanctions policies because future russian action is unpredictable and uncertain investors should move quickly foreign investors should also consider other options to enforce their rights beyond investment treaties for instance companies should evaluate existing political risk insurance policies contract protections for those foreign investors in russia who seek to exit the russian market or significantly curtail their business in russia it will be critical to evaluate contracts and joint venture agreements to evaluate their authority to take such action and to assess the commercial and financial consequences some commercial parties have already expressly contemplated sanctions impacting their agreements in russia some contracts will have specific language to cover this type of situation such as a joint venture party being designed as a specially designated national or an inability to perform under the agreement as a result of sanctions prohibitions but others will need to rely on more general provisions or will not definitively address the parties rights and obligations in these circumstances even without a specific clause dealing with effects of sanctions other provisions could provide relief in particular some force majeure clauses may be broad enough in some instances to allow a party to cease performance or even exit their commercial relationships in russia or with affected entities or persons there are a few key considerations when evaluating force majeure applicable law many jurisdictions such as new york will apply force majeure clauses strictly and narrowly whereas others might permit a broader interpretation covered events force majeure clauses often include a specific list of qualifying events acts of governments and war are two common events that could apply effect on non performance force majeure clauses typically require that performance be prevented or delayed by the particular force majeure event prevent often requires that performance be impossible whereas delay and other terms can be more flexible notice there is typically a requirement to provide timely notice of the occurrence of a force majeure event as well as updates and failure to follow the notice requirements may restrict a party s ability to later invoke force majeure effect of force majeure a force majeure clause typically excuses performance until the force majeure event no longer prevents or delays performance if a force majeure event affects performance for a long enough time either party may have the right to terminate if the force majeure clause does not cover the situation parties should consider other clauses that may be in their commercial agreements including those addressing material adverse change or changes in law depending on the circumstances a party could also look to the limitation of liability and consider whether an efficient breach is an option under the circumstances in addition a party should assess any sanctions compliance provisions in agreement and whether these provisions are sufficiently robust to permit suspension or termination of performance in light of sanctions risks in short these issues will arise in a large variety of contexts and the risk imposed and potential rights and obligations will be very case and contract specific and will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction the sooner advice is obtained the better prepared a contracting party will be to assess risks and consequences compliance with sanctions when restructuring investments in russia investors decision making must consider the evolving global sanctions on russia before taking steps to restructure or alter investments the united states has already imposed restrictions on foreign companies potential investments and commercial arrangements in russia for example full blocking or asset freezing restrictions through designation of certain russian individuals and entities including several banks as specially designated nationals sdns or parties subject to eu or uk asset freeze for instance a sdn designation prohibits u s persons from engaging in all direct and indirect transactions with designated entities and any entity 50 or more owned by the sanctioned party unless a general license applies additional payment processing restrictions and prohibitions on certain debt and equity transactions applicable to major russian banks and certain russian companies prohibition of transactions with russian state entities including the central bank of russia russian ministry of finance and the national wealth fund of the russian federation prohibition of new investment in the energy sector in russia which includes transactions that constitute a commitment of funds or other assets for or a loan or other extension of credit to new energy sector activities located or occurring in russia beginning on or after march 8 under eo 14066 under the rule the energy sector is broadly defined to include the procurement exploration extraction drilling mining harvesting production refinement liquefaction gasification regasification conversion enrichment fabrication or transport of petroleum natural gas liquified natural gas natural gas liquids or petroleum products or other products capable of producing energy such as coal or wood or agricultural products used to manufacture biofuels the development production generation transmission or exchange of power through any means including nuclear electrical thermal and renewable however certain transactions related to energy are authorized under general license 8a prohibition of exports reexports sale or supply directly or indirectly from the united states or by a u s person wherever located of u s dollar denominated banknotes to the government of the russian federation or any person located in the russian federation prohibition of transactions that involve any approval financing facilitation or guarantee by a us person wherever located of a transaction by a foreign person where the transaction by that foreign person would be prohibited by u s law if performed by a u s person or within the united states these new sanctions on russia impose limitations on types of transactions in russia that foreign investors subject to u s sanctions requirements may enter into with certain parties however the sanctions to date do not broadly prohibit a foreign investor from restructuring the organization of its existing investment in russia unless an sdn is involved for example a u s investor that wishes to add additional ownership to its investment structure or transfer ownership from one subsidiary to another would not per se violate existing u s sanctions on russia unless certain sdns are involved in the transaction however foreign investors in russia should carefully evaluate sanctions at the time of restructuring and the possibility of new sanctions when making changes to businesses in russia other jurisdictions such as the european union and the united kingdom have imposed similar restrictions hogan lovells has authored several client alerts on sanctions enacted on russia including eu sanctions measures uk sanctions measures including new restrictions on registration of foreign entities singapore sanctions measures japan sanctions measures and australian sanctions measures although specifics of future sanctions on russia are uncertain escalation of sanction measures are very likely the united states department of the treasury office of foreign assets control ofac is likely to designate additional sectors beyond the energy sector from which new investments are prohibited under its authority granted by president biden in eo 14068 which was signed on march 11 2022 additional sanctions could potentially

biden administration officials and lawmakers have been holding talks in recent weeks about possible legislation to regulate stablecoins and other digital assets the treasury department s nellie liang said tuesday but she was vague about how much progress has been made there s sort of a general agreement that stablecoins are growing and there should be actions to reduce emerging systemic risk liang the under secretary for domestic finance said during a panel discussion at the national association for business economics policy conference in washington so i m confident that we ll reach some consensus around some of these proposals somewhere the biden administration issued an executive order on digital assets two weeks ago that tasked the treasury with conducting a series of reports on the emerging technology and working with other agencies as well as congress on ways to promote its safe growth we recognize that new forms of money are gaining popularity in part because existing forms of money and payments had some weaknesses says nellie liang the under secretary for domestic finance at the treasury department win mcnamee bloomberg it followed a report in november by the president s working group on financial markets the office of the comptroller of the currency and the federal deposit insurance corp that recommended among other things stablecoin issuers obtain bank charters to guard against panicked runs in the event of a crisis mandating issuers hold bank charters would also prevent them from being controlled by commercial companies the report said we do think legislation for stablecoins is really important to establish necessary safeguards liang said in reiterating congressional testimony she gave in early february the current regulatory system doesn t address run risk in stablecoins and it doesn t address the whole payment provider infrastructure needed however she noted the report emphasized the flexibility that banking agencies have to adjust for differences between stablecoin issuers and traditional commercial banks that also make loans liang spoke about the potential of digital assets to promote financial inclusion another key feature of the biden administration s cryptocurrency related goals we recognize that new forms of money are gaining popularity in part because existing forms of money and payments had some weaknesses she said but she said there are additional routes to address unequal access to the financial system and the high cost of financial services for some groups she cited the fednow system a payments platform being developed by the federal reserve that will be low cost to users she also stressed an activities based approach supervision regulatory policies for new financial products may need to evolve but they should follow the same risk same regulation in the sense that regulation should be based on the risks of the activity rather than the technology itself

measures in addition to the financial measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states â œgaapâ this press release contains certain non gaap financial measures including contribution margin adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of a companyâ s financial or operating performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap we use the following non gaap measures to help us monitor the performance of our business measure our performance identify trends affecting our business and assist us in making strategic decisions contribution margin which is defined as net sales less cost of sales exclusive of depreciation and amortization divided by net sales adjusted ebitda which is defined as net loss plus interest expense net income tax benefit depreciation and amortization further adjusted to exclude equity based compensation acquisition and integration related costs and certain other non recurring non core infrequent or unusual charges as described below adjusted net income which is defined as net loss plus amortization further adjusted to exclude equity based compensation acquisition and integration related costs and certain non recurring non core infrequent or unusual charges including the estimated tax impacts of these adjustments free cash flow which is defined as net cash provided by used in operating activities less capital expenditures which consist of purchases of property and equipment as well as purchases of information technology software development and leasehold improvements contribution margin adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow are key measures used by management to understand and evaluate our financial performance trends and generate future operating plans make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and analyze investments in initiatives that are focused on cultivating new markets for our products and services we believe contribution margin adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow are useful measurements for analysts investors and other interested parties to evaluate companies in our markets as they help identify underlying trends that could otherwise be masked by certain expenses that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing performance contribution margin adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow have limitations as analytical tools these measures are not calculated in accordance with gaap and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap in addition contribution margin adjusted ebitda adjusted net income and free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics of other companies due to differences among the methods of calculation we have not reconciled the forward looking adjusted ebitda guidance included above to the most directly comparable gaap measure because this cannot be done without unreasonable effort due to the variability and low visibility with respect to certain costs the most significant of which are incentive compensation including stock based compensation transaction related expenses and certain fair value measurements which are potential adjustments to future earnings we expect the variability of these items to have a potentially unpredictable and a potentially

the focus of investors on climate related risks is growing and the biden administration is taking an all government approach to combat climate change the securities and exchange commission sec or commission is now proposing landmark requirements for public companies operating in the u s to disclose climate risks and emissions in their business operations according to remarks of sec commissioner allison herren lee at the march 21 2022 unveiling of the proposal this is a watershed moment for investors and financial markets the commission is proposing a rule requiring registrants under the exchange act to include certain climate related information in their registration statements and periodic reports such information includes climate risks and their material impacts on business strategy and outlook greenhouse gas ghg emissions further discussion below governance of climate related risks and relevant risk management processes climate related targets goals and transition plans and certain climate related financial statement metrics and related disclosures in audited financial statements this alert outlines the proposed requirements and next steps background along with the advent of major environmental laws in the 1970s the commission started work to require public companies to provide information about environmental risks that is considered material i e information that average prudent investor would reasonably consider important in their investment decisions the commission began publishing guidance for companies disclosing climate related risks in 2010 the 2010 guidance discussed the disclosure of material direct and indirect physical climate risks climate change mitigation regulations and economic and market trends many investors have asked for more disclosure requirements and oversight since 2010 however others have asserted that extensive disclosures impose unreasonable burdens on companies or seek information that does not clear the sec s materiality threshold under the biden administration the sec has taken an all agency approach to the establishment of new environmental social and governance esg disclosures these include issuing risk alerts and investor bulletins regarding esg investing creating the climate and esg task force in the division of enforcement announcing a greater focus on climate related risks and climate related disclosure in public company filings and issuing a request for comment from market participants on climate change disclosure the latest proposal is the largest and most concrete action regarding climate disclosures in the commission s history proposal the proposed rules would require registrants to disclose a range of climate related information the proposed rules require disclosures about two types of risks 1 the company s exposure to the physical risks of climate change physical risks and 2 the risks to the company from policies promoting the transition to a lower carbon economy transition risks this information includes impact of climate related severe weather events and other natural conditions and transition activities on the line items of a registrant s consolidated financial statements registrant s direct ghg emissions scope 1 and indirect ghg emissions from purchased energy scope 2 in absolute not including offsets and intensity emissions output terms and indirect emissions from upstream and downstream activities in a registrant s value chain scope 3 if material or if the registrant has set a ghg emissions target or goal that includes scope 3 emissions other requirements in the proposal regarding governance strategy and risk management include oversight and governance of climate related risks whether and how any climate related risks have a material impact on the company processes for identifying assessing and managing climate related risks metrics and targets used to show and manage any physical and transition risks and more detailed information regarding publicly set climate related targets or goals companies may also disclose information regarding identified climate related opportunities regarding specific disclosures registrants would be required to provide climate related disclosures in registration statements and exchange act annual reports e g form 10 k provide regulation s k mandated climate related disclosure in a separate section of its registration statement or annual report provide regulation s x mandated climate related financial statement metrics and related disclosures in a note to its consolidated financial statements and for larger companies obtain an attestation report from an independent attestation service provider covering scope 1 and 2 emissions disclosures at a minimum on timing the proposed rules would allow for a phase in period depending on the registrant s filer status additional phase in periods are outlined for scope 3 emissions disclosure and for certain assurance requirements the proposed regulations also include a safe harbor from liability for scope 3 emissions disclosure and an exemption from the scope 3 emissions disclosure requirement for smaller reporting companies next steps the proposal gives novel enforcement tools to the sec related to climate change challenges both in the proposal s finalization and in court are almost certain state attorneys general have argued that a range of esg related information does not meet the definition of material and therefore may not be the subject of sec disclosure requirements last year west virginia attorney general patrick morrisey threatened to sue the sec if it forced companies to disclose esg data and several u s senators have outlined similar objections climate advocates will likely argue that the scope 3 emissions requirement should be strengthened in addition some companies and trade associations will challenge the sec s role in climate policy generally and the financial regulatory disclosure requirements specifically especially for information that companies may claim is confidential business information some companies have also expressed opposition about requirements to collect and disclose extensive information about scope 3 emissions arguing that such emissions are not material are burdensome to collect are difficult to verify and result from supplier and customer activities that are not readily managed by the company in any event the public will have the right to submit comments on the proposed rule until the later of 60 days from march 21st the date the proposal was published on the sec s website or 30 days from the date the proposal is published in the federal register the rules may be finalized later this calendar year but the sec has experienced delays on this issue in the past under the proposal the largest companies would start disclosing climate risks in fy 2023 while smaller companies have until fy 2024 the proposal allows for an extra year to disclose scope 3 emissions

low interest rates high rents and working from home combined to push many young americans to buy their first home over the last two years but this version of the great american dream is not without its challenges as lauren morgan found out the day we moved in our air conditioner broke she told npr and so that was the first instance of is this a mistake morgan 30 and her husband own a quaint home in norwood mass outside of boston like many millennials they moved in june of 2021 and to get ahead of the hyper competitive market and ensure they won the bidding they decided to waive their inspection we have since had plumbing issues we currently have a hole in our dining room ceiling because we just had a leak in our plumbing morgan said then in the coldest week of winter their furnace broke and they had to get a new hvac system morgan calculates they have spent about 20 000 since they bought the house every time something does come up i say to my husband maybe we should be renting like if only we were still renting then the landlord could deal with this according to real estate witch home values increased nearly 20 between september 2020 and september 2021 with many millennials maxing out their budget and then later regretting it npr heard from a lot of first time homeowners who made compromises to secure a house of their own in part because they wanted so badly out of the high rental market i rented the same apartment for 12 years in nashville and recently got word that we are under new ownership and management and rent increases were going up in the past year abbie culberston said maya brodkey added when covid hit my wife owned a small business and overnight she didn t we were living in the bay area at the time and my employment was stable but without her income we weren t going to be able to continue to afford rent there don t forget the 1 rule professor hyojung lee of virginia tech studies the impacts of demographic and neighborhood change on housing markets and said the historically low interest rates were one driving factor that spurred people to buy and on the other hand the pandemic increased the huge demand for this type of single family house with a backyard he said many parents having their children doing remote learning spending 24 hours and seven days at their home desperately feel like need a backyard or a pool another pressure point was the flow on effect of 2008 financial crisis lee said as millennials stayed in rental homes longer which put pressure on housing stock so high income earners stayed in the rental market he said that pushed up rental prices for a long time period since like 2007 2008 and that created quite substantial increases in rental prices in these days and lee said that led to some questionable decision making besides being willing to skip inspections or buy sight unseen many millennials weren t ready for the other costs that come with home ownership there is kind of a 1 rule of thumb lee said so you have to think about you know saving about 1 of your housing value because that s the amount of money that you will spend annually for any type of upkeep justin sullivan getty images getty images home ownership is not enjoyed equally in the united states of course buyer s remorse in this housing market may seem like a good problem to have to those people who were shut out completely according to a report released this month homeownership among black people in the u s hovers between 42 and 45 while more than 70 of white people own their homes joshua devine is the director of racial economic equity at the national community reinvestment coalition and said we can t think about barriers in the housing market as a siloed issue you ve got to think about how housing relates to things like the workforce he said it s one of those wicked complex problems that require more of a comprehensive approach and strategy to overcome devine said this lack of home ownership was connected to the legacy of intentional housing discrimination and other barriers like today s wage stagnation it s also important to think about the market and the institutions within the market he said how do we make sure that we re holding them accountable to mitigating barriers but also strengthening access to credit in other words when this pandemic subsides and when this housing market calms down there will still be structural barriers to reckon with that could keep many americans from ever owning their first home copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

institute of mining metallurgy and petroleum definition standards on mineral resources and mineral reserves ni 43 101 is a rule developed by the canadian securities administrators which establishes standards for all public disclosure an issuer makes of scientific and technical information concerning mineral projects canadian disclosure standards including ni 43 101 differ significantly from the requirements of the united states securities and exchange commission sec and resource and reserve information contained in this press release may not be comparable to similar information disclosed by u s companies in particular and without limiting the generality of the foregoing the term resource does not equate to the term reserves under u s standards mineralization may not be classified as a reserve unless the determination has been made that the mineralization could be economically and legally produced or extracted at the time the reserve determination is made the sec s disclosure standards normally do not permit the inclusion of information concerning measured mineral resources indicated mineral resources or inferred mineral resources or other descriptions of the amount of mineralization in mineral deposits that do not constitute reserves by u s standards in documents filed with the sec investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories will ever be converted into reserves u s investors should also understand that inferred mineral resources have a great amount of uncertainty as to their existence and great uncertainty as to their economic and legal feasibility it cannot be assumed that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource will ever be upgraded to a higher category investors are cautioned not to assume that all or any part of an inferred mineral resource exists or is economically or legally mineable disclosure of contained ounces in a resource is permitted disclosure under canadian regulations however the sec normally only permits issuers to report mineralization that does not constitute reserves by sec standards as in place tonnage and grade without reference to unit measures the requirements of ni 43 101 for disclosure of reserves are also not the same as those of the sec and reserves disclosed by the company in accordance with ni 43 101 may not qualify as reserves under

san diego s pension board has unanimously approved lowering the city s pension payment nearly 31 million during the new fiscal year from 414 9 million to 384 3 million the smaller payment which was recommended by the pension system s actuary because of strong investment returns last year gives mayor todd gloria more money to spend in the proposed budget he s scheduled to release april 15 advertisement critics say san diego shouldn t lower its pension payment when the city still faces nearly 3 billion in pension debt but the actuary gene kalwarski stressed that the strong investment returns shrunk the debt from 3 34 billion to 2 95 billion investment gains shrink the city s pension debt and annual payment because a crucial part of the city s long term payoff plan is significant growth in the value of investments made by the city s pension system the lower annual payment and reduction in pension debt reverse trends that have seen both numbers steadily rising in recent years advertisement the city s annual payment spiked nearly 50 million last january from 365 6 million to 414 9 million the city s actuary had projected the payment to climb again this year to 423 1 million but it shrank instead to 384 3 million that s primarily because of the robust stock market last year the s p 500 gained 26 9 percent the dow jones industrial average gained 18 7 percent and the nasdaq composite gained 21 4 percent the pension system s investments have fared similarly gaining 23 6 percent between july 2020 and june 2021 advertisement the system gets the money to make those investments from city workers who must contribute toward the cost of their pensions and from city taxpayers the greater the return on those pension system investments the less money from workers and taxpayers the city needs to spend long term to cover pension payments made to retired employees this year s reversal a decrease of nearly 400 million in pension debt instead of a projected increase means the city is also projected to pay off the entire debt more quickly in 2033 instead of in 2042 advertisement the good news for the pension system must be tempered by the required payment of more than 80 million to unwind all the damage caused by 2012 s proposition b pension cuts which were overturned by the state supreme court four years ago the city council approved this winter spending 73 million to create retroactive pensions for 3 850 workers hired after the pension cuts took effect nearly a decade ago plus another roughly 8 million in court ordered penalties that money and the city s increased liability created by the new pensions will be part of a new actuarial analysis kalwarski is expected to complete in the coming months advertisement the lower pension payment is one of many factors that give mayor gloria more money to work with than previously expected when he unveils a roughly 1 7 billion proposed budget next month finance officials said last month that the city is projected to have 26 7 million in cash left over when the fiscal year ends june 30 primarily because sales tax and hotel tax revenues have come in at rates higher than projected the city also is projected to have 179 million in federal pandemic relief left over significantly more than the 150 million expected when the ongoing budget year began last july advertisement the projections however don t include san diego making any scheduled payments to increase the city s reserves to recommended levels

you won t have to take on a big risk with either of these two stocks rivian automotive has been a bit of a disappointment for investors down a whopping 58 already this year it has been a bigger bust than cathie wood s ark innovation etf which has crashed more than 30 while some investors have been hyping rivian as potentially being the next tesla type stock to own it s apparent that optimism may be waning in the once promising company in 2022 the carmaker only expects to produce 25 000 vehicles while still generating losses in the billions it could be a good contrarian pick if you re willing to take on significant risk however there are safer better options for growth investors out there such as cresco labs crlbf and paypal pypl 1 67 let s take a look 1 cresco labs marijuana producer cresco labs is one of the top multistate operators in the country it announced this week the launching of its 50th retail store in the country and 16th in florida cresco s retail operations span seven states and while its presence could be larger what s refreshing about the business is that it carefully picks where it expands to rather than simply seeking out any and all opportunities its newest location in lady lake florida is conveniently located near the villages a retirement community for people 55 and older which cresco s press release claims is the largest active adult community in the u s that could be a key move for the company as florida is a top u s medical marijuana market and cresco has been expanding into some other markets as well including massachusetts where in september 2021 it closed on an acquisition of a vertically integrated operator in that state a few months later in november it also added to its five sunnyside dispensaries in pennsylvania when it closed on its acquisition of cure penn which operates a location in lancaster pennsylvania amid all this growth cresco labs generates adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda margins of about 30 of revenue and it is one of the more profitable companies in the marijuana industry and with a run rate of close to 1 billion in revenue it s also among the largest in terms of revenue for growth investors looking for a top stock to own cresco makes for a great option unlike rivian this is an established business and one that has a strong bottom line 2 paypal fintech company paypal has been off to a rough start to 2022 with shares down close to 40 year to date the stock still makes for a solid growth investment as the global digital payments market is expected to expand at a compounded annual growth rate of 20 5 until 2030 according to estimates from research and markets there will likely be plenty of opportunities ahead for the company to continue building on its already strong numbers especially with paypal s exposure to the crypto world as the company launched a digital wallet in 2021 unfortunately it s the near term that has led to the stock s sell off investors weren t pleased with the company s underwhelming projections when it reported earnings in february estimating revenue growth of no more than 17 in the current year and given how fragile the markets have been in 2022 shares of paypal crashed on the news although the stock has come off the 52 week lows it hit shortly after earnings it is still down more than 60 from the high of over 310 16 that it reached within the past year the shares now trade at a bit less than 115 however with a solid profit margin of 16 over the trailing 12 months and still more growth in its future paypal presents a much safer growth stock to invest in than rivian and its reduced value only makes it a much more attractive buy on the dip as the business still looks to be in excellent shape coming off a year where it reported more than 5 4 billion in free cash flow

with a globally diversified portfolio this clean energy company can provide cash for years to come the ishares global clean energy etf is off by about a third since its early year highs in 2021 that suggests that clean energy stocks are already in a bear market including the roughly 30 drop in the value of brookfield renewable partners bep 2 52 wall street tends to go to extremes though so this could be a good opportunity for long term dividend growth investors to jump into the clean energy space and specifically brookfield renewable partners here s why this partnership could help power your portfolio as the world s energy markets increasingly go green balancing act the big clean energy stories in recent years have been in solar and wind they are clearly important but investors often forget that there are other forms of clean energy notably hydroelectric this is a very old technology that is reliable well developed and can provide baseload power the minimum amount of power needed to be supplied to the electrical grid at any given time which is something that intermittent solar and wind can t do hydroelectric makes up around 50 of brookfield renewable partners cash flow don t underestimate the importance of this as it provides a reliable foundation on which the company has been able to grow its other generating assets hydro is a key piece of the company s average contract life of 15 years and while hydro is destined to shrink in importance over time that s not a bad thing essentially most of the good hydro opportunities have been developed since there s a natural limitation to where the technology can be employed given the early stages of solar and wind development it is simply easier to build out those operations so there s a strong core here but the growth is going to come from other areas solar 15 of cash flow and wind 22 are more exciting to put some numbers on that the partnership has plans to expand its wind capacity of 5 4 gigawatts by another 8 8 gigawatts and solar capacity is expected to grow 34 8 gigawatts over its current 2 6 gigawatt level brookfield renewable partners transition business is also in growth mode with a current capacity of 4 9 gigawatts and development projects of 15 3 gigawatts transition is sort of a catchall that includes things like battery storage taking it to the next level so brookfield renewable partners has spread its eggs across a number of different technology baskets diversification is good for your portfolio and it has historically proved to be good for brookfield renewable partners portfolio too note that the distribution has been increased annually at a 6 compound annual rate over the past decade but there s another layer here about 64 of brookfield renewable partners cash flow is generated from north america that s a solid core the rest comes from latin america 19 of cash flow europe 15 and asia the remainder note too that these are big regional classifications there are a lot of countries underlying these categories even in north america which encompasses the untied states canada and mexico among a host of other smaller countries so there s a lot going on here and a lot of opportunity even in the company s largest region to put a dollar figure on this investment grade rated brookfield renewable partners believes it can invest between 1 billion and 1 2 billion a year in each of the next five years so there s a lot of growth and it s being spread across both the type of power project being developed and the geographic region in which it is being built that s a powerful mix that should support the partnership s long term goal of 5 to 9 annual distribution growth years to go before it rests while hardcore esg advocates might like for the world to simply switch overnight to clean energy it is far more likely to take decades and brookfield renewable partners has positioned itself to participate in a widely diversified manner that should reward investors for decades to come along with that balanced portfolio it offers a generous 3 distribution yield all in for those looking for a single investment to cover the clean energy space brookfield renewable partners could be the one name you ll want to add to your portfolio

turns out the great american dream is not without its challenges as lauren morgan found out the day we moved in our air conditioner broke she told npr and so that was the first instance of is this a mistake morgan 30 and her husband own a quaint home in norwood mass outside of boston like many millennials they moved in june of 2021 and to get ahead of the hyper competitive market and ensure they won the bidding they decided to waive their inspection we have since had plumbing issues we currently have a hole in our dining room ceiling because we just had a leak in our plumbing morgan said then in the coldest week of winter their furnace broke and they had to get a new hvac system morgan calculates they have spent about 20 000 since they bought the house every time something does come up i say to my husband maybe we should be renting like if only we were still renting then the landlord could deal with this according to real estate witch home values increased nearly 20 between september 2020 and september 2021 with many millennials maxing out their budget and then later regretting it npr heard from a lot of first time homeowners who made compromises to secure a house of their own in part because they wanted so badly out of the high rental market i rented the same apartment for 12 years in nashville and recently got word that we are under new ownership and management and rent increases were going up in the past year abbie culberston said maya brodkey added when covid hit my wife owned a small business and overnight she didn t we were living in the bay area at the time and my employment was stable but without her income we weren t going to be able to continue to afford rent there don t forget the 1 rule professor hyojung lee of virginia tech studies the impacts of demographic and neighborhood change on housing markets and said the historically low interest rates were one driving factor that spurred people to buy and on the other hand the pandemic increased the huge demand for this type of single family house with a backyard he said many parents having their children doing remote learning spending 24 hours and seven days at their home desperately feel like need a backyard or a pool another pressure point was the flow on effect of 2008 financial crisis lee said as millennials stayed in rental homes longer which put pressure on housing stock so high income earners stayed in the rental market he said that pushed up rental prices for a long time period since like 2007 2008 and that created quite substantial increases in rental prices in these days and lee said that led to some questionable decision making besides being willing to skip inspections or buy sight unseen many millennials weren t ready for the other costs that come with home ownership there is kind of a 1 rule of thumb lee said so you have to think about you know saving about 1 of your housing value because that s the amount of money that you will spend annually for any type of upkeep justin sullivan getty images home ownership is not enjoyed equally in the united states of course buyer s remorse in this housing market may seem like a good problem to have to those people who were shut out completely according to a report released this month homeownership among black people in the u s hovers between 42 and 45 while more than 70 of white people own their homes joshua devine is the director of racial economic equity at the national community reinvestment coalition and said we can t think about barriers in the housing market as a siloed issue you ve got to think about how housing relates to things like the workforce he said it s one of those wicked complex problems that require more of a comprehensive approach and strategy to overcome devine said this lack of home ownership was connected to the legacy of intentional housing discrimination and other barriers like today s wage stagnation it s also important to think about the market and the institutions within the market he said how do we make sure that we re holding them accountable to mitigating barriers but also strengthening access to credit in other words when this pandemic subsides and when this housing market calms down there will still be structural barriers to reckon with that could keep many americans from ever owning their first home copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
author miranda hart menafn the conversation invasive alien species are bad for ecosystems they reduce bidoversity and disrupt food chains including our own history is full of examples of intentional and unintentional introductions of invasive species the introduction of cane toads to northern australia in the 1930s to fight cane beetles led to decline of many native predators the fungus that causes chestnut blight snuck into north america via infected nursery stock four billion trees died in 40 years it s easy enough to see the devastation by invasive species of plants just look your window spotted knapweed eurasian milfoil and giant hogweed have completely changed communities across north america soil ecosystems what about creatures in the soil have they been affected by invasive species which species have gone extinct which ones are proliferating it is important to think about soil as an invisible ecosystem because many agricultural practices include the deliberate addition of microbes to the soil biofertilizers biofertilizers are microbes that are grown specifically for application to soil there are many microbes that are used as biofertilizers including bacteria and fungi and the most common application is to improve crop nutrient status these products are considered by some to be a more sustainable alternative to synthetic fertilizers the use of mycorrhizal fungi fungi that grow on plant roots as biofertilizers is becoming more common applying them as a kind of fertilizer makes sense because these fungi grow in plant roots and help plants get more nutrients from the soil companies encourage farmers to use biofertilizers with the promise that biofertilizers will lead to healthier soil the number of companies making mycorrhizal fungi has increased dramatically in the last decade but there s no easy way to know what they re selling where it s being used and how much is being released into the environment the root structure of red daikon radish farmers are being sold biofertilizers to increase crop yield shutterstock my lab looks at how mycorrhizal biofertilizers move in the environment and how they affect native ecosystems because mycorrhizas are an important part of all ecosystems introducing an alien mycorrhizal fungus may have unintended consequences for native mycorrhizas and ecosystems in general alien species the application of biofertilizers and mycorrhizal products involves introducing potentially invasive species these products which are alien to the environments they are placed in must establish in a novel environment under a wide range of conditions to do this they need to compete against and replace native fungi this is the definition of an invasive species the use of biofertilzers may not be a big problem if these products stay where we put them like in the greenhouse or in a farmer s field but if there is one thing we ve learned about microbes in the last 24 months it is that they move and they move fast there is evidence that mycorrhizal fungi can move over long distances through atmospheric currents or even as passengers on migratory birds in all ecosystems mycorrhizal fungi link plants in a community through hyphae thin strands of fungus that carry nutrients to plants in this way mycorrhizal fungi and their plant hosts become a superorganism with plants belonging to different species linked via mycorrhizal hyphae the filaments that make up the network of a fungi this allows plants to sense conditions elsewhere in the network by receiving warning chemicals through hyphae if there is a herbivore somewhere in the network and increasing defence chemicals before an attack occurs mycorrhizal fungi can also change the flow of sugars from the canopy when a seedling is shaded and needs more carbon read more how plants rely on friendly fungal bodyguards the problem is even though these networks are crucial for ecosystems science does not understand how they are affected by biofertilizers there is currently no research on how mycorrhizal networks are affected by the introduction of biofertilizers or what it means for ecosystems neither is there research beyond my lab of how far these products are moving but science is clear on one thing once we release these organisms into the environment we lose the ability to control them some fungi in soil can be useful others can damage the soil s ecosystem shutterstock regulating biofertilizers this is the crux of the matter we do not know how big of a threat biofertilizers pose to ecosystems yet these products continue to be marketed and released globally with little or no regulation in canada they are considered soil additives under the fertilizer act which is the federal legislation overseeing the safety of fertilizer and soil supplements regulation focuses on the toxicity of biofertilizers to humans and other animals not their risk as invasive species a better framework might be the plant protection act which exists to protect plants agriculture and forestry from the spread of plant pests while mycorrhizal fungi are not pests they are not universally beneficially in all contexts for example these fungi can act as a carbon drain for plants suppressing their growth under certain conditions it is not a stretch to say that in some cases they might act as plant pests if biofertilizers are not universally beneficial for all plants in all conditions they pose a real threat to soil biodiversity and perhaps even plant diversity if biofertilizers outcompete local fungi this could change the composition and productivity of plant communities this is a problem for natural systems but also for agriculture and forestry we need to better regulate these products to ensure that they are not a threat to ecosystems the thin skin of soil on our planet is home to the creatures who keep our ecosystems functioning we must not forget about them in our quest to make agriculture more sustainable

photo fernando lessa salmon in the fraser river a coalition of environmental groups is calling on alaska to halt the interception of hundreds of thousands of b c bound salmon before they return home to spawn in a letter addressed to alaska gov mike dunleavy four salmon conservation groups presented data indicating that in 2021 more than 650 000 canadian origin sockeye salmon were caught in the waters of southeast alaska that is six times the 110 000 sockeye b c commercial fishers caught last year we re just talking about the fish we know that are getting killed up there said greg taylor a longtime consultant with commercial and first nations fisheries b c salmon populations have plummeted to record lows in recent years in response the federal government closed 60 per cent of b c s commercial salmon harvest in june 2021 and announced a fishing licence buy back program under its 647 million pacific salmon strategy initiative the result for b c says taylor it makes us a spawning ground for alaska the fish expert was one of three authors on a recent report detailing the impact alaskan fishers are having on returning b c fish released in january under commission from the watershed watch salmon society and skeenawild conservation trust the research found alaskan fishers intercepted over half a million salmon on their way home to b c s skeena and nass rivers two of the province s most important spawning grounds after the fraser river but since then taylor says his team has dug deeper into the numbers the problem he says is much more widespread than initially thought canadian salmon caught in alaska are now thought to have origins in river systems across the coasts of vancouver island and the inlets of b c s mainland the biggest impacts says taylor are felt anywhere north of the city of nanaimo an unknown portion of returning fraser river sockeye are also thought to be taken in alaska waters it s not just in the north and the central coasts if you live anywhere in this province there are fish that are getting caught in alaska he said it s also not just sockeye at risk alaska provides little or no information on how many b c origin chum pink steelhead and coho salmon are caught in southeast alaska every year but in their letter to the governor the conservation groups state it is likely in the millions they call it a pink fishery that s why they want to be in that area but we know that the real prize is the sockeye said stu barnes operations manager of the skeena fisheries commission sfc we could have survived for four years off of what they got this year the sfc coordinates scientific research and fish stock conservation for the gitxsan wet suwet en and the gitanyow first nations together representing over 20 000 people who are among the most heavily dependent on salmon in the world we have communities that aren t meeting their food fish needs for going on 10 15 20 years said barnes so any kind of extra impact on our stocks right now is just making the access that much harder data shared with glacier media show southeast alaskan fisheries took 70 per cent of sockeye stocks for the nisga a nation last year 64 per cent of chinook in watersheds around bella bella and bella coola and 44 per cent of chinook stocks along a stretch of coast that includes the quinsam area of campbell river those numbers represent a small slice of the fishers hit by the combined effects of b c fishery closures and alaskan interceptions following the release of the report on southeast alaska salmon catches in january first nations across the province finally had data to back up what many had suspected all along it created a rallying point for more than just the skeena first nations said barnes in january ts ilhqot in nation tribal chair joe alphonse said the first nation was outraged over the interceptions especially at a time when the nation has made huge sacrifices to conserve salmon like many first nations working to recover salmon stocks the ts ilhqot in nation has implemented closures and denied its citizens their aboriginal right to fish said alphonse it s time said alphonse to review how the pacific salmon treaty is structured and where first nations sit at the international table since 1985 the canada u s pacific salmon treaty has been in place to settle international imbalances in fisheries prevent overfishing and ensure both countries receive equal benefits from healthy salmon populations over the last three decades new agreements have been reached every 10 years but the last agreement was signed in 2019 and the pacific salmon treaty isn t up for renewal until 2028 despite frustration on the b c side both barnes and taylor say there has been little response from the canadian government or those working on the pacific salmon treaty it s just not working for us under canada s banner barnes told glacier media at the domestic table we can say we have rights at the international table we say we have rights and they shrug their shoulders and say good for you how much fish are we getting on tuesday minister of fisheries oceans and the canadian coast guard spokesperson kevin lemkay said the department is was aware of the january report and is working with global affairs canada to address these concerns glacier media also reached out to the office of alaska gov dunleavy but he was not immediately available to comment taylor said the coalition received a neutral response from dunleavy s office saying it had received the letter in it the four conservation groups watershed watch salmon society skeenawild conservation trust raincoast conservation foundation and coastal rivers conservancy asked to sit down with the governor to work out a common sense solution for all sides that means closing district 104 to net fishing fishing grounds that make up an overwhelming percentage of intercepted b c bound salmon other suggested measures include reducing harvest rates in the area to avoid overfishing of canadian origin stocks and implementing independent catch reporting for target and non target species the group is also calling for fishers to release non target fish or bycatch back into the water before they die something already required in b c but while taylor says scientists and fisheries experts have the genetic tools to identify where and how big the problem is anything less than the closure of district 104 would be kicking the can down the road really we need to close that offending fishery and move them elsewhere he said taylor added he s optimistic the groups will get an honest conversation with the governor especially in a state that sells its salmon catch based on an image of sustainability it does not look good what they re doing now he said it just needs some common sense we cannot protect and rebuild our salmon population if they re getting killed the first thing you need to do is stop the bleeding

menafn realwire 60 of uk household water and energy customers prefer not to call customer service if they can use online tools to solve their problems according to macro 4 research crawley uk march 22 2022 most consumers are ready to swap customer service calls for digital self service in the wake of their experience during the pandemic according to new survey findings released by macro 4 the research which examines uk consumer attitudes to household energy and water suppliers suggests that 61 per cent of customers have become more comfortable interacting with companies digitally since the pandemic on websites apps and other online channels and 60 per cent would now prefer not to call a live customer service person at all if they can solve their issues themselves using online resources jim allum director commercial and technical at macro 4 a division of unicom global when asked what aspects of service are important in a household energy or water supplier 72 per cent of the 1 000 plus survey respondents said they now want utilities to provide online resources that make it easy to resolve their questions themselves rather than having to use the phone 93 per cent said it was important that they are able to contact their supplier in whatever way they prefer such as by phone email social media text or messaging apps and 93 per cent stressed the importance of getting a quick response whether they call or make contact digitally macro 4 a division of unicom global that helps enterprises accelerate digital transformation commissioned two separate surveys of over 1 000 household utility bill payers in the uk the results are published in a report giving uk utility customers a voice jim allum director commercial and technical at macro 4 said during covid 19 restrictions we all got used to doing more things digitally and for many people that would have included resorting to online self service since most contact centers at the time were experiencing significant delays due to soaring call volumes what s interesting is that the habit has stuck the majority of people are now happy to use self service instead of speaking to a customer service person on the phone especially for simple queries one positive of helping customers to do more for themselves is that it frees up hard pressed contact center agents to handle more complex queries by phone chat or email and this is where companies can add real value and it should also mean shorter wait times for those people who do need to speak by phone questions related to bills and charges often trigger calls to the contact center and this was one of the specific gripes identified by the research 31 per cent of energy customers and 26 per cent of water customers in the survey sample want their current suppliers bills to be easier to understand and 73 per cent regularly check their energy and water bills for mistakes allum said self service can play an important role by providing reassurance and clarity surrounding bills and how they are calculated for example if customers are given self service access to detailed historical information as well as basic analysis facilities to compare their own billing and usage rates over time they can rule out any anomalies for themselves further underlining consumers growing preference for digital resources and interaction nearly two thirds of the customers questioned in the survey believe it s more convenient to view all of their household bills online rather than on paper allum added ditching paper altogether is not yet an option however since nearly a third of the people we asked still want paper bills this research highlights the importance of building flexibility into your communication systems so that you can

washington d c in an interview with cnn retired gen david petraeus former u s cia director said it is not entirely surprising to see russian military forces encounter difficulties while invading ukraine adding that the russians are surprisingly unprofessional a former central intelligence agency director who led the 101st airborne division during the war in iraq in 2003 and commanded us forces in afghanistan petraeus said ukrainian resistance has impeded moscow s plans for a quick occupation noting that ukrainians have been relentless in their attempts to protect their country there are many reasons for the russians abysmal performance they are fighting against a very determined quite capable ukrainian force that is composed of special ops conventional forces territorial forces and even private citizens all of whom are determined not to allow russia to achieve its objectives he told cnn describing russian forces he added they clearly have very poor standards when it comes to performing basic tactical tasks such as achieving combined arms operations involving armor infantry engineers artillery and mortars they are very poor at maintaining their vehicles and weapon systems and have abandoned many of them they are also poor at resupply and logistical tasks we have known for decades that the soviet system now the russian system has always lacked one of the key strengths of u s and western militaries which is a strong professional non commissioned officer corps he added russia s weaponry paled in comparison to the tools available to by the u s military petraeus stressed adding the russians just have relatively unimpressive equipment given the investment supposedly made over the past decade or so they certainly don t have equipment comparable to what the u s has also russia s precision munitions have not been accurate and russia has not managed to cut off ukrainian airport runways after initially invading the country similar to what the u s did after the 2003 invasion of iraq he said we can also see this with the sheer frequency of the russians hitting civilian infrastructure like the hospital in mariupol other medical facilities and the government center in kharkiv petraeus told cnn russia s cyberwarfare capacity has also been unimpressive he said adding that its has been unable to take down the ukrainian command and control system petraeus stressed that russia underestimated the requirements for controlling kyiv and replacing the ukrainian government with a puppet regime in every single area of evaluation the russians starting with their intelligence assessments and understanding of the battlefield and their adversary and then every aspect of the campaign all the way down to small unit operations have proved woefully inadequate he added

photo fernando lessa salmon in the fraser river a coalition of environmental groups is calling on alaska to halt the interception of hundreds of thousands of b c bound salmon before they return home to spawn in a letter addressed to alaska gov mike dunleavy four salmon conservation groups presented data indicating that in 2021 more than 650 000 canadian origin sockeye salmon were caught in the waters of southeast alaska that is six times the 110 000 sockeye b c commercial fishers caught last year we re just talking about the fish we know that are getting killed up there said greg taylor a longtime consultant with commercial and first nations fisheries b c salmon populations have plummeted to record lows in recent years in response the federal government closed 60 per cent of b c s commercial salmon harvest in june 2021 and announced a fishing licence buy back program under its 647 million pacific salmon strategy initiative the result for b c says taylor it makes us a spawning ground for alaska the fish expert was one of three authors on a recent report detailing the impact alaskan fishers are having on returning b c fish released in january under commission from the watershed watch salmon society and skeenawild conservation trust the research found alaskan fishers intercepted over half a million salmon on their way home to b c s skeena and nass rivers two of the province s most important spawning grounds after the fraser river but since then taylor says his team has dug deeper into the numbers the problem he says is much more widespread than initially thought canadian salmon caught in alaska are now thought to have origins in river systems across the coasts of vancouver island and the inlets of b c s mainland the biggest impacts says taylor are felt anywhere north of the city of nanaimo an unknown portion of returning fraser river sockeye are also thought to be taken in alaska waters it s not just in the north and the central coasts if you live anywhere in this province there are fish that are getting caught in alaska he said it s also not just sockeye at risk alaska provides little or no information on how many b c origin chum pink steelhead and coho salmon are caught in southeast alaska every year but in their letter to the governor the conservation groups state it is likely in the millions they call it a pink fishery that s why they want to be in that area but we know that the real prize is the sockeye said stu barnes operations manager of the skeena fisheries commission sfc we could have survived for four years off of what they got this year the sfc coordinates scientific research and fish stock conservation for the gitxsan wet suwet en and the gitanyow first nations together representing over 20 000 people who are among the most heavily dependent on salmon in the world we have communities that aren t meeting their food fish needs for going on 10 15 20 years said barnes so any kind of extra impact on our stocks right now is just making the access that much harder data shared with glacier media show southeast alaskan fisheries took 70 per cent of sockeye stocks for the nisga a nation last year 64 per cent of chinook in watersheds around bella bella and bella coola and 44 per cent of chinook stocks along a stretch of coast that includes the quinsam area of campbell river those numbers represent a small slice of the fishers hit by the combined effects of b c fishery closures and alaskan interceptions following the release of the report on southeast alaska salmon catches in january first nations across the province finally had data to back up what many had suspected all along it created a rallying point for more than just the skeena first nations said barnes in january ts ilhqot in nation tribal chair joe alphonse said the first nation was outraged over the interceptions especially at a time when the nation has made huge sacrifices to conserve salmon like many first nations working to recover salmon stocks the ts ilhqot in nation has implemented closures and denied its citizens their aboriginal right to fish said alphonse it s time said alphonse to review how the pacific salmon treaty is structured and where first nations sit at the international table since 1985 the canada u s pacific salmon treaty has been in place to settle international imbalances in fisheries prevent overfishing and ensure both countries receive equal benefits from healthy salmon populations over the last three decades new agreements have been reached every 10 years but the last agreement was signed in 2019 and the pacific salmon treaty isn t up for renewal until 2028 despite frustration on the b c side both barnes and taylor say there has been little response from the canadian government or those working on the pacific salmon treaty it s just not working for us under canada s banner barnes told glacier media at the domestic table we can say we have rights at the international table we say we have rights and they shrug their shoulders and say good for you how much fish are we getting on tuesday minister of fisheries oceans and the canadian coast guard spokesperson kevin lemkay said the department is was aware of the january report and is working with global affairs canada to address these concerns glacier media also reached out to the office of alaska gov dunleavy but he was not immediately available to comment taylor said the coalition received a neutral response from dunleavy s office saying it had received the letter in it the four conservation groups watershed watch salmon society skeenawild conservation trust raincoast conservation foundation and coastal rivers conservancy asked to sit down with the governor to work out a common sense solution for all sides that means closing district 104 to net fishing fishing grounds that make up an overwhelming percentage of intercepted b c bound salmon other suggested measures include reducing harvest rates in the area to avoid overfishing of canadian origin stocks and implementing independent catch reporting for target and non target species the group is also calling for fishers to release non target fish or bycatch back into the water before they die something already required in b c but while taylor says scientists and fisheries experts have the genetic tools to identify where and how big the problem is anything less than the closure of district 104 would be kicking the can down the road really we need to close that offending fishery and move them elsewhere he said taylor added he s optimistic the groups will get an honest conversation with the governor especially in a state that sells its salmon catch based on an image of sustainability it does not look good what they re doing now he said it just needs some common sense we cannot protect and rebuild our salmon population if they re getting killed the first thing you need to do is stop the bleeding

with a globally diversified portfolio this clean energy company can provide cash for years to come the ishares global clean energy etf is off by about a third since its early year highs in 2021 that suggests that clean energy stocks are already in a bear market including the roughly 30 drop in the value of brookfield renewable partners bep 2 52 wall street tends to go to extremes though so this could be a good opportunity for long term dividend growth investors to jump into the clean energy space and specifically brookfield renewable partners here s why this partnership could help power your portfolio as the world s energy markets increasingly go green balancing act the big clean energy stories in recent years have been in solar and wind they are clearly important but investors often forget that there are other forms of clean energy notably hydroelectric this is a very old technology that is reliable well developed and can provide baseload power the minimum amount of power needed to be supplied to the electrical grid at any given time which is something that intermittent solar and wind can t do hydroelectric makes up around 50 of brookfield renewable partners cash flow don t underestimate the importance of this as it provides a reliable foundation on which the company has been able to grow its other generating assets hydro is a key piece of the company s average contract life of 15 years and while hydro is destined to shrink in importance over time that s not a bad thing essentially most of the good hydro opportunities have been developed since there s a natural limitation to where the technology can be employed given the early stages of solar and wind development it is simply easier to build out those operations so there s a strong core here but the growth is going to come from other areas solar 15 of cash flow and wind 22 are more exciting to put some numbers on that the partnership has plans to expand its wind capacity of 5 4 gigawatts by another 8 8 gigawatts and solar capacity is expected to grow 34 8 gigawatts over its current 2 6 gigawatt level brookfield renewable partners transition business is also in growth mode with a current capacity of 4 9 gigawatts and development projects of 15 3 gigawatts transition is sort of a catchall that includes things like battery storage taking it to the next level so brookfield renewable partners has spread its eggs across a number of different technology baskets diversification is good for your portfolio and it has historically proved to be good for brookfield renewable partners portfolio too note that the distribution has been increased annually at a 6 compound annual rate over the past decade but there s another layer here about 64 of brookfield renewable partners cash flow is generated from north america that s a solid core the rest comes from latin america 19 of cash flow europe 15 and asia the remainder note too that these are big regional classifications there are a lot of countries underlying these categories even in north america which encompasses the untied states canada and mexico among a host of other smaller countries so there s a lot going on here and a lot of opportunity even in the company s largest region to put a dollar figure on this investment grade rated brookfield renewable partners believes it can invest between 1 billion and 1 2 billion a year in each of the next five years so there s a lot of growth and it s being spread across both the type of power project being developed and the geographic region in which it is being built that s a powerful mix that should support the partnership s long term goal of 5 to 9 annual distribution growth years to go before it rests while hardcore esg advocates might like for the world to simply switch overnight to clean energy it is far more likely to take decades and brookfield renewable partners has positioned itself to participate in a widely diversified manner that should reward investors for decades to come along with that balanced portfolio it offers a generous 3 distribution yield all in for those looking for a single investment to cover the clean energy space brookfield renewable partners could be the one name you ll want to add to your portfolio
is a macroeconomic theory put forward in the late 1970 s by jude wanninski based on the teachings of university of chicago economics professor arthur laffer and the laffer curve ronald reagan adopted it as his economic policy in the 1980 s and during the 1980 republican primaries george herbert walker bush referred to it as voodoo economics economists have always recognized that tax cuts can be used to help stimulate economic growth in traditional keynesian economics tax cuts and or increased government spending are the prescribed remedy in times of recession to kickstart the economy but economists also recognize that tax cuts reduce government revenues and increase budget deficits so that these tax cuts can only be temporary the supply siders maintained that tax cuts could be across the board and permanent that economic growth would pay for itself essentially a free lunch the experiment with reaganomics saw the united states go from the world s largest creditor nation to the world s largest debtor nation in less than 10 years the huge deficits became a drain on the econmomy eventually george h w bush decided to raise taxes breaking his read my lips pledge the government s deficits started to decline but breaking his pledge cost bush politically bill clinton was able to defeat him in the 1992 presidential election the supply siders were out in force as clinton submitted his first budget the howls were heard across the country as he reversed america s course and took aim at the deficits mainly through tax increases dick armey phil gramm jack kemp and newt gingrich all in the supply side camp made their predictions if the clinton budget was passed doom and gloom would sweep the land the country would go into recession perhaps depression unemployment would skyrocket and inflation would rise forbes magazine urged readers to get out of the stock market to avoid the inevitable crash the wall street journal editorial page had no doubts that clinton s tax increases would sharply increase the deficit instead of reducing it the supply siders were wrong completely and totally wrong clinton s economic plan wiped out the deficits the economy surged markets soared unemployment was lower than economists thought statistically possible inflation never became a factor and yet some cannot believe their own experiences of the past twenty years reagan s tax cuts and huge deficits clinton s tax increases and reduced deficits there are still a few who put faith in supply side economics marginal fringe elements true but still they re out there very few economists believe in it though the experiences of the past twenty years are exactly what they predicted

eclipse metals is the first company to evaluate ivittuut in greenland for its lithium potential recent grab sampling at eclipse metals asx epm historic ivigtu t and grønnedal ika prospects in southwest greenland has returned elevated concentrations of up to 430 parts per million ppm lithium oxide the results mark the first lithium results ever for the multi commodity project which was previously mined for cryolite at ivigtu t anomalous lithium concentrations at ivigtu t are known to be associated with cryolithionite a rare lithium bearing fluoride mineral first discovered at ivigtu t in the 1900s jarlite muscovite biotite and zinnwaldite polymetallic prospects executive chairman carl popal said the new lithium results highlight the polymetallic nature of ivigtu t and the adjacent grønnedal ika carbonatite complex while cryolithionite was known to exist at ivigtu t previous operators had no interest in lithium and therefore did not assay for it he said the recognition of highly anomalous lithium is an exciting step in our work and provides us with a greater understanding of the complex multi commodity mineralisation at this historic mine mr popal said the results also offer the potential for defining rare earth elements ree precious and base metals and industrial mineral resources in what is believed to be a highly mineralised area he said further work would be needed to determine which minerals carry the anomalous lithium identified in an aplite dyke cutting the grønnedal ika carbonatite complex cryolithionite content cryolithionite at ivigtu t is known to occur as crystals measuring up to 19 centimetres long in massive cryolite and siderite cryolite cryolite veins and fluorite cryolite breccia in addition to ivigtu t the mineral has also been reported from the gasberg s topaz cryolite mine in russia and zapot pegmatite near hawthorne in the us state of nevada around 268 cryolite samples taken from the ivigtu t mine in the mid 1980s showed lithium concentrations ranging from 78 to 153ppm jarlite was also present at between 400ppm and 800ppm lithium as was muscovite 111 315ppm biotite 5812ppm and zinnwaldite 16 710ppm mr popal said while the latest results were encouraging a more systematic sampling approach and drilling program would be required to better constrain the lithium potential at ivigtu t

a recent study looked into the legacy of the clean water act by analyzing each state s water quality example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video florida usa it s been nearly 50 years since the united states passed the clean water act a law meant to rein in pollution and create a national standard for water quality following world war ii the united states saw massive development placing stress on waterways dealing with industrial and urban pollution attempts at regulating water pollution during the years that followed could not fully address the issue that was until 1972 when congress passed a sweeping set of amendments dubbed the clean water act the law officially established a basic structure for regulating pollutant discharges into waterways across the country in the years to come modifications and new amendments only strengthened the law but a recent study conducted by researchers at a national environmental non profit looked into the law s legacy across the country by analyzing each state s water quality what it found was florida ranked first in the nation for the total acres 873 340 acres of lakes deemed too polluted for swimming and aquatic life florida s estuaries ranked 2nd in the nation for most impaired tampa bay is the largest estuary in the state where the hillsborough river dumps into the gulf of mexico just last week keep tampa bay beautiful removed roughly 200 pounds of trash from a small section of the river you wouldn t believe how much trash we pick out kristina moreta the education director for ktbb said we weren t even a mile away from armature works we got 200 pounds of trash more than 99 percent of the state s estuaries are considered impaired eighty nine percent of the lakes are too polluted to swim in there are a couple of warning signs that have us concerned dr marcus beck a program scientist with tampa bay estuary program said we have lost some seagrass in the last couple of years we do have some water quality issues in old tampa bay in the northwest part of the bay that make us concerned the environmental integrity project which conducted the study found the source of much of florida s water problems was lake okeechobee according to researchers development north and south of the lake throughout the 20th century disrupted its natural water flow forcing the water out into the caloosahatchee and st lucie estuaries the result was an abundant amount of nutrient rich water fueling excessive algae blooms in these delicate ecosystems those blooms can be toxic to not only sea life but humans inhaling the air nearby while florida led the nation in that category researchers found many states were not in the best shape as well the nonprofit says while the initial impact of the clean water act created dramatic improvements in water quality its effectiveness has waned in recent years one main reason is its inability to regulate run off pollution from farm fields suburban lawns and parking lots researchers say much of the responsibility to oversee such pollution was deferred to state governments who in turn made landowners responsible a major source of runoff pollution is agriculture the report says in part the spreading of excess fertilizer and manure leads to nitrogen and phosphorus being washed into streams and rivers and feeding algal blooms a lack of enforcement in many states has veered the law away from its mission of making 100 percent of all waters in the u s fishable and swimmable according to the group in order to get the clean water act back on track and accomplish its goal researchers say congress should consider
aya batrawy steve karnowski and rob gillies associated press dubai united arab emirates russia s war in ukraine could mean changes for ed kessel s farm along a quiet stretch of western north dakota worldwide farmers like kessel are weighing whether to change their planting patterns and grow more wheat this spring as the war has choked off or thrown into question grain supplies from a region known as the breadbasket of the world ukraine and russia account for a third of global wheat and barley exports which countries in the middle east asia and africa rely on to feed millions of people who subsist on subsidized bread and bargain noodles they are also top exporters of other grains and sunflower seed oil used for cooking and food processing kessel said he may plant some more wheat and ride the tide of high prices that have spiked by a third since the invasion helping offset losses from drought and the increasing cost of fuel but not a lot more honestly it probably will help us plant a few more wheat acres we ll put a few more acres into wheat and a few more into sunflowers said kessel also first vice president of the north dakota grain growers association major grain producers like the united states canada france australia and argentina are being closely watched to see if they can quickly ramp up production to fill in the gaps from lost ukrainian and russian supplies but farmers are facing the prospect of another year of drought climbing fuel and fertilizer costs and supply chain disruptions from the covid 19 pandemic major producers also are hamstrung by factors like legal limits on exports and farming patterns that means uncertainty for countries like egypt lebanon pakistan iran ethiopia and others that cannot grow enough wheat barley corn or other grains to meet their needs the war has raised the specter of food shortages and political instability in countries that rely on affordable grain imports any extra grain exports from anywhere in the world will likely only partially offset lower black sea shipments over the remainder of the current season the international grains council said in its march report about half of the grain the world food program buys to feed 125 million people worldwide comes from ukraine the double blow of rising food prices and depressed wheat exports from the war is a recipe for catastrophe not just in ukraine but potentially globally the head of the u n food assistance agency warned it will impact millions and millions of people particularly in the poorest countries of the world wfp executive director david beasley told the associated press in the western ukrainian city of lviv last week as he visited a refugee center where food aid was distributed there are unanswered questions about how western sanctions on russia the world s top wheat exporter could affect its grain exports and distribution networks russia is also the biggest exporter of fertilizer while ukraine ships huge amounts of corn rye oats and millet the black sea region is a top producer of the grains used to feed livestock worldwide australia and india have responded with increased grain exports but there s little room for others to immediately do the same that s mainly due to recurrent drought said arnaud petit executive director of the international grains council the u s produced around 44 million tons of wheat for the 2021 2022 season just two to three years ago it was over 50 million tons petit pointed to drought and farmers switching to more profitable crops canada argentina and australia could try to ramp up wheat production for the coming season that ends in mid 2023 but it s too early to tell if farmers are changing their planting patterns to focus more on grains like wheat doug martin said it s too late for his family farm in manitoba canada to make significant changes to what s being planted now plus growing a range of crops spreads out risks most producers have a set idea of what they are seeding and will probably stick to that martin said although higher wheat prices will reap earnings for farmers that isn t enough incentive to expand production because prices are also climbing for crops like oats canola and barely there are other crops that are going to get good returns martin added any increased production is running up against surging costs for supplies the price of fuel has skyrocketed and the cost of fertilizer was already high because of a crunch in natural gas acutely felt in europe with cheaper fertilizers it could have been possible to grow our way out of a global food security problem possibly but nutrients are anything but affordable or even accessible right now said sylvain charlebois a professor in food distribution and policy at dalhousie university in canada philippe dutertre grows wheat in chemire le gaudin in the sarthe agricultural region about 210 kilometers 130 miles southwest of paris he hasn t decided whether to expand his wheat patch given soaring energy and electricity costs we might be able to act a little bit on the crop rotation but today france produces wheat corn rapeseed for oils and other cereals he said we don t have the certainty anymore to say that we will be able to guarantee the food security of france and europe tomorrow australian farmers experienced a bountiful wheat season still the agriculture department says australia will not be able to respond to lower ukrainian supplies right away because it s already sold its exports through september the situation is similar in argentina another major grain exporter a whopping 95 of its current wheat crop has already been sold jorge josifovich owns farmland in pergamino one of the richest agricultural areas in argentina where he grows wheat corn and soybeans despite higher wheat prices he said argentine farmers might not be motivated to plant more because of high fertilizer and fuel costs coupled with a rigorous price control imposed by the government that is unfavorable to producers who sell their production to exporters the calculus leaves the world s biggest wheat importers vulnerable including indonesia egypt pakistan and bangladesh as well as war torn yemen and cash strapped lebanon they are countries with huge populations in poverty relying on affordable wheat for their diets drought in the middle east is at its highest level in at least 20 years according to the gro drought index hindering any efforts to ramp up domestic wheat production there is potential for unrest if prices continue to rise particularly in nations without sufficient stocks of wheat they may be forced to wait to purchase it from the market switch to rice or draw from their wheat reserves in egypt the world s biggest wheat importer the government recently announced price caps for unsubsidized bread and fines for violators in response to soaring prices the world has 278 million tons of wheat stock to help buffer shortfalls from ukraine said petit of the international grains council half of that stock however is in china which holds more than a year s worth of supply to ensure food security for its 1 4 billion people meanwhile farmers a world away are making their own hard decisions tom bernhardt who operates a fifth generation crop and cattle ranch near linton in north dakota said no till farmers like himself won t deviate too much from their normal rotation and plant more wheat because it can lead to problems with soil health and weeds plus there s no guarantee wheat prices will remain high i have never planted additional acres just to chase a price the the 61 year old american farmer said karnowski reported from st paul minnesota and gillies from toronto associated press reporters susie blann in lviv ukraine oleg cetinic in
