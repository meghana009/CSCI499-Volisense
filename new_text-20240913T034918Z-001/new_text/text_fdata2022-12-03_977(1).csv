minot n d at the national level we ve all been watching the stunning collapse of the cryptocurrency industry headlined by the implosion of ftx one of the companies led by erstwhile billionaire samuel bankman fried ftx was a crypto exchange that allowed customers to transfer their wealth among various digital and traditional currencies but per reports it turns out ftx was loaning its customer s money without their permission to a sister company that was in turn using it to make risky investments it was a house of cards basically and when it collapsed the reverberations impacted the entire crypto industry not that things were great before that collapse over the last year crypto investors have lost trillions in value it s a stunning turn of events but what does it mean for north dakota specifically gov doug burgum has touted a couple of crypto related projects in our state arguing that north dakota s relatively cheap power and our business friendly environment are attractive to those looking to build power hungry data centers advertisement earlier this year atlas power in partnership with montana based fx solutions announced plans to make a roughly 2 billion investment into a crypto mining data center possibly the world s largest in the williston area burgum headlined the announcement which also made news due to the lurid background of one of the businessmen involved this summer bitzero blockchain inc a crypto company backed by shark tank star kevin o leary announced plans to build a data center at an abandoned cold war era radar base near nekoma home of the famous nekoma pyramid per a news release from burgum s office the company also planned to move its north american headquarters to north dakota the plan is for the company to build multiple data centers in north dakota with a total investment of nearly 1 billion per burgum s office neither of these projects have sought any public money beyond certain tax credits and incentives that are already in place and available to any business a facility built near ellendale by applied blockchain also doesn t seem to have accepted any public subsidies but the state and a local government did put public money on the line for a crypto data center in grand forks and as of right now it s looking like a bad bet in 2021 the city of grand forks approved a low interest 269 000 pace loan that went along with 500 000 grant from the state owned bank of north dakota for a roughly 100 million data center to be built in their community by texas based core scientific inc that data center has been completed and is currently operating but thanks in no small part to the crypto industry collapse core scientific is in tough financial condition the company warned of a bankruptcy filing last month saying it would miss key debt payments the minneapolis star tribune reported last week advertisement in the event of a bankruptcy proceeding or insolvency or restructuring of our capital structure holders of the company s common stock could suffer a total loss of their investment the company said in a filing with the sec in october shares of the company have been trading as low as 0 13 in november down from about 12 per share last november per the star tribune report to be clear these projects were pitched with cryptocurrency mining basically computers solving math problems to create cryptocurrency being only a part of the use of the data centers they can be used for other things too such as data storage how important cyrpto is varies from project to project the so called nekoma pyramid a cold war era radar facility that was recently sold to a crypto currency business that plans to use the property for a data center and crypto mining eric hylden forum news service still crypto was one of the larger puzzle pieces in these projects and given the state of that industry it s not entirely clear what the future of these investments is kevin lund president and ceo of the grand forks region economic development corp and someone who worked on bringing the company to his community told me that he spoke with representatives from core scientific about three weeks ago he said that while they acknowledged stress in the industry their grand forks facility was one of their best and there are no plans for disruptions in its operations burgum spokesman mike nowatzki told me their office hasn t heard any updates on potential blowback from the crypto industry collapse on the north dakota projects but directed me to commerce commissioner josh teigen teigen said that the four crypto data centers either operating in north dakota or in the process of being built all have components of traditional data centers he also said that he s checked in with them and that none of them had any direct exposure to the ftx collapse though he admitted that the fallout from that situation has hurt their industry overall could any of these projects be canceled we ve not heard of any development changes teigen told me

worries about inflation weighed on wall street friday leaving major indexes mixed after a report showed wages for u s workers are accelerating which is good news for them but could feed into even higher inflation for the nation the s p 500 ended 0 1 lower after having been down as much as 1 2 earlier in the day the nasdaq composite also trimmed its deficit falling 0 2 while the dow jones industrial average eked out a 0 1 gain the indexes all notched gains for the week stocks had been on the upswing for the last month on hopes the worst of the nation s high inflation may have passed already that fed expectations for the federal reserve to dial down the intensity of its big interest rate hikes such hikes aim to undercut inflation by slowing the economy and dragging down prices for stocks and other investments but friday s labor market report showed that wages for workers rose 5 1 last month from a year earlier that s an acceleration from october s 4 9 gain and easily topped economists expectations for a slowdown such jumps in pay are helpful to workers struggling to keep up with soaring prices for everyday necessities the federal reserve s worry is that too strong gains could cause inflation to become further entrenched in the economy that s because wages make up a big part of costs for companies in services industries and they could end up raising their own prices further to cover higher wages for their employees inflation is certainly moving in the right direction said adam abbas co head of fixed income at harris associates but the market is still going to have to go through some calibration of the risk that we level off at 3 to 4 core inflation versus a natural steady move down to the 2 goal set by the fed advertisement after such a strong move over the last three and a half weeks abbas said about expectations for an easing up by the fed maybe the market has gotten a little ahead of itself across the economy employers added 263 000 jobs last month that beat economists forecasts for 200 000 while the unemployment rate held steady at 3 7 many americans also continue to stay entirely out of the job market with a larger percentage of people either not working or looking for work than before the pandemic which could increase the pressure on employers to raise wages a labor market that remains much stronger than expected could make an already dicey situation for the fed even more complicated it s trying to slow the economy just enough to prevent the buying activity that gives inflation its oxygen without going so far as to create a recession the fed has signaled it will likely push the unemployment rate to at least 4 4 in its fight against inflation the most important number for the fed is probably the wage number said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments many traders are still betting on the fed to downshift the size of its rate hikes at its next meeting later this month as several officials at the central bank have hinted traders still largely expect the fed to raise its key overnight interest rate on dec 14 by half a percentage point after hiking by a heftier three quarters of a point four straight times but expectations are rising for what the fed will do in 2023 treasury yields jumped immediately after the jobs report s release on speculation the fed may ultimately hike rates higher than thought a few moments before advertisement the yield on the two year treasury rose to 4 29 from 4 24 late thursday the 10 year yield which helps set rates for mortgages and many other loans fell to 3 49 from 3 51 another month with a strong jobs report and torrid wage gains is a reality check for where we stand in the inflation fight said mike loewengart head of model portfolio construction at morgan stanley global investment office the strong labor market data follows up on several mixed reports on the economy the nation s manufacturing activity shrank in november for the first time in 30 months for example while the housing industry is struggling under the weight of much higher mortgage rates such data points had raised hopes the fed s rate hikes were taking effect and would ultimately pull down inflation even though friday s report showed hiring was stronger than expected it also clearly demonstrated that the nation s downward trend in hiring is continuing november s jobs gains matched the low seen in april 2021 which was the weakest since december 2020 when the number of jobs shrank more economists are still forecasting the u s economy to fall into a recession next year in large part because of higher interest rates while the fed won t back away from a hike of just half a percentage point in december they still have no clue what they ll do in 2023 said allpsring s jacobsen associated press business writers elaine kurtenbach and matt ott contributed send questions comments to the editors previous next filed under

according to a press release by the wyoming stock growers land trust it has helped to place a 2 423 acre ranch in johnson county under four separate conservation easements get our free mobile app all four easements were fully donated by the mcphee and jacob families who each own sections of the patchwork ranch members of the mcphee and jacob families said in the release we are so pleased to have our ranch protected by a conservation easement this land was homesteaded and ranched by ellis patch and several other patch relatives more than 100 years ago their goal was to preserve the land as open space providing habitat for the wildlife they loved and providing an opportunity for their descendants to have a glimpse of this centennial wyoming ranch in its natural beauty in perpetuity we are grateful to the wyoming stock growers land trust for making this goal a reality the patchwork ranch is situated along the foothills of the big horn mountains south of buffalo wyoming and is a cow calf operation the land trust secured funding from the wyoming wildlife and natural resource trust the homer and mildred scott foundation the tucker foundation and the purdy family foundation it is a non profit and with the addition of the patchwork ranch now has a total of 295 361 protected acres across the state according to an annual report of its finances for the 2021 fiscal year it had 2 899 265 in total revenue and 1 987 251 in total expenses mostly from stewardship and conservation programs jessica crowder executive director of the land trust said it s important for this kind of land to be preserved understanding that private lands to provide so much value to our state from economic value keeping rural communities economically alive they provide food and fiber to our state and country they provide wildlife habitat so the public benefit from keeping agriculture lands intact now and into the future is just immense these particular lands in johnson county that we ve recently placed a conservation easement on add to those values and just really help us keep the character and the uniqueness of wyoming that we all hold so dear crowder that conservation like this is done to prevent the land from being used for housing development even if that wasn t an issue for the patchwork ranch i think what s interesting in wyoming is that we have seen more people coming into wyoming more people interested in living in our great state and so while the risk may not be imminent there s always a risk in the future that someone may recognize the beauty that may exist in the future and like to build houses in an area or subdivide an area so on any project we do that risk could be there at some point in the future casperites debate when to start decorating for christmas

production tells the story of romanian refugees chaim eric da costa and chaya shaina silver baird who arrive in halifax in 1908 and settle in montreal fleeing their homeland hoping to make a new life in canada although the play s narrator a character the program calls the wanderer ben caplan tells us early on that this will be a story specifically about jewish refugees the resonances of the tale more a sketch than a naturalistically detailed drama expand into a parable that might easily encompass the trials terrors and triumphs of any group forced to leave their native land for the perils and prospects of a better life elsewhere chaim and chaya are both haunted by their pasts he has lost his entire family in a brutal pogrom and come to the new world alone she arrives with a large extended family but is traumatized by the death of her husband and baby during the journey he radiates optimism about making a new life with her she remains emotionally paralyzed we follow their struggles across the 20th century to connect survive and thrive together advertisement 3 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content photo by stoo metz photography jpg i have to admit to my surprise that i found old stock underwhelming the performance is dominated by caplan s wanderer who provides commentary and a song after each brief scene between the characters who become part of what is essentially his backup band da costa on woodwinds silver baird on violin along with graham scott keyboards and accordion and jeff kingsbury percussion it felt to me like caplan s show a big man with a big voice and an oversized presence who co wrote most of the songs with director christian barry he sings and dances plays guitar and banjo tells ironic jokes asks for our applause and generally demands our attention at one point describing how chaim and chaya have finally consummated their relationship he offers up dozens of euphemisms for the sex act going on like the proverbially drunk uncle at the bar mitzvah well past the point where it was funny caplan has a versatile voice at its best in prayerful minor key laments but most of his songs are loud and sound similar their lyrical commentary lost in the general soundscape his character s borscht belt stand up style shtick may be meant to mitigate the painful realities of chaim and chaya s lives but i resented his omnipresent mediation wanting him to let the refugee story tell itself so i might fully invest in the characters who felt more like puppets their story

here are the highlights of events related to the war in ukraine over the past 24 hours under a condition biden to talk with putin about ukraine us president joe biden has allowed talks with vladimir putin if it would end the war in ukraine at a white house press conference after speaking with french president emmanuel macron who is on a state visit to the united states biden who has so far denied such an opportunity said let me choose my words very carefully i m ready to talk to mr putin if he actually has an interest in deciding that he s looking for a way to end the war he hasn t done that yet macron said he would continue to talk with the russian president to try to prevent escalation and get some very concrete results such as the safety of nuclear plants american subsidies the two leaders also looked for ways to ease some economic tensions in the oval office talks biden promised macron to make changes to us legislation passed by the us congress this year to calm european fears that they could harm the eu economy at issue is the inflation reduction act which provides 0 billion in subsidies for us made products that will make european exports and goods uncompetitive at a meeting on wednesday with us lawmakers macron described the plan as super aggressive towards european companies reuters reports european leaders say the legislative package signed by biden in august would be a major blow to the european economy which is suffering from the effects of the war in ukraine six million ukrainians are without electricity six million ukrainians are without electricity the mayor of kyiv warned residents of the capital to stock up on warm clothes food and water due to the danger of a complete blackout in the city vitali klitschko called on his fellow citizens if they have the opportunity to move to smaller settlements near kyiv because the capital is expecting an extremely cold winter according to ukrainian authorities 40 of the country s energy infrastructure was destroyed in the russian strikes advisor to zelensky about 13 000 ukrainian soldiers died in the war between 10 000 and 13 000 ukrainian soldiers have died since the beginning of the russian invasion this was stated by mykhailo podolyak adviser to ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky ukraine rarely releases casualty figures and the senior official s comments to ukrainian television have not been confirmed by the military however he also cited the army general staff in june podolyak said that between 100 and 200 ukrainian soldiers were dying every day last month top us general mark milley said that around 100 000 russian and 100 000 ukrainian soldiers had been killed or wounded since the war began earlier this week president of the european commission ursula von der leyen mistakenly reported of 20 000 civilians and over 100 000 military personnel have been killed since the start of russia s invasion later her statement was edited and there was no mention of such figures a total of three ukrainian embassies received threatening letters ukrainian foreign minister dmitry kuleba said three ukrainian embassies had received threatening letters soaked in red liquid firstly not two but already three and secondly the letters are not with an explosive but with another substance i will not comment yet we will soon come out with an official position on the subject let s put it this way inside these envelopes there was a symbolic threat passed on to ukraine i can only say that all the envelopes were soaked in red liquid at the time of their receipt kuleba said on the air of the united ukraine telethon italy s government has approved arms supplies to ukraine to continue italy s new government has issued a decree authorizing arms supplies to ukraine to continue into 2023 the italian parliament has 60 days to turn the decree into law details of italy s military supplies to ukraine are classified but last month a representative of the ruling coalition told reuters that rome was preparing a new supply including air defense systems requested by kyiv italian media reported that the country will provide ukraine with four old generation aspide anti aircraft missile systems with 18 missiles each along with radars delivery is expected to take place in late december or early january next year italy temporarily puts the refinery of the russian giant lukoil under state management italy s new government led by prime minister giorgia meloni yesterday placed russian oil giant lukoil s refinery in priolo sicily under temporary management of the state to avoid its closure and ensure the continuity of the nation s energy supply afp reported there was a danger that the lukoil controlled isab refinery one of the largest in europe would stop production due to the impending entry into force on december 5 of the european union embargo on the import of russian crude oil by sea the temporary management is planned for a maximum period of 12 months the source specified the government passed a decree in this direction the emergency intervention aims to protect both a strategic national energy site and the employment levels that are so important for sicily and for the whole country meloni said in a brief statement without specifying the content of the decree by placing the refinery under state supervision rome is following the lead of berlin which in september took control of the german operations of russian oil group rosneft which operates multiple refineries there the survival of the isab refinery is at stake as it is forced to supply its oil entirely from russia given that before the war in ukraine the share of russian oil was 10 15 fearing sanctions european banks stopped financing the refinery and giving it the guarantees needed to import oil from other countries isab has the capacity to refine 10 million tons of crude oil per year with the possibility that it can be increased to 14 million tons it provides about 20 of the national needs this is a temporary solution to avoid the blocking of machines and activities and subsequent disasters for employment commented renato scifani governor of the sicily region before the council of ministers the decision to place the company under state supervision will make it possible to look for possible buyers without necessarily ruling out the option of nationalization he noted

newsletter how to la every weekday you ll get fresh community driven stories that catch you up with our independent local news subscribe the u s is enduring an unprecedented poultry health disaster with a highly contagious bird flu virus triggering the deaths of some 52 7 million animals the culprit is highly pathogenic avian influenza or hpai it has ravaged farm flocks and chicken yards in 46 states since february when the first cases were reported in commercial flocks it s the worst toll on the poultry industry since 2014 2015 when more than 50 million birds died that earlier outbreak also started in the winter but while that ordeal was over by the following june the current outbreak lasted through the summer and has surged anew i m hopeful that this is not the new normal for us dr richard webby director of the world health organization s collaborating center for studies on the the ecology of influenza in animals tells npr the brief view all slum housing enforcement new l a county rule requires inspections forced treatment debate is a major change in mental health care coming usc valedictorian school cancels speech over safety concerns some birds have died from the disease itself but the vast majority are being culled through flock depopulation to try to stop the virus from spreading that includes millions of chickens and turkeys in barns and backyards that had been raised to provide eggs or meat here s what you need to know about the 2022 outbreak in the u s 52 695 450 million birds have been wiped out the losses stretch across the u s and they re deepest in the country s middle more than 1 million birds have been killed in each of 11 states that stretch from utah to the midwest and on to delaware according to the u s department of agriculture in iowa two massive egg laying operations had to cull more than 5 million birds in single incidents earlier this year unlike the 2014 15 outbreak this one is being driven by wild birds not by farm to farm transmission for commercial and backyard flocks many early infections centered along the intersection of the central and mississippi flyways of migratory wild birds as those birds traveled so did the virus we don t know exactly what it is about it but it does seem just to be able to grow and transmit better in wild birds webby who is also a member of the infectious diseases department at st jude children s research hospital in memphis tells npr wild birds are the perfect mechanism to spread a virus because they of course fly everywhere he adds influenza viruses are common among wild aquatic birds which often show no symptoms despite being infected in january the dangerous h5n1 flu virus was found in an american wigeon duck in south carolina the first u s case since 2016 according to the centers for disease control and prevention more reports poured in over the following weeks and months raising alarms as the virus spread to more states a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus can cause disease that affects multiple internal organs with mortality up to 90 to 100 in chickens often within 48 hours the cdc notes however ducks can be infected without any signs of illness avian flu poses only a low risk to humans it s very rare for a human to be infected with the avian virus the first u s case of a person infected with avian influenza a h5n1 virus was reported in april in colorado the patient recovered after experiencing a few days of fatigue the virus does not pose a special risk in the nation s food supply given proper handling the cdc states that like any poultry or eggs heating food to an internal temperature of 165 f kills any bacteria and viruses present including hpai viruses the virus is like a kid in a candy store the bird populations haven t seen viruses like this before webby says so in terms of their immune response they re all immunologically naïve to this influenza virus right now it s like a kid in a candy store racing around infecting bird populations he says u s experts had been bracing for an outbreak watching successful strains of the h5n1 influenza virus proliferate in europe and elsewhere now that the virus is here it shows no sign of going away a key part of the challenge webby says is that like the sars cov 2 virus the avian flu virus has spun off several variants of concern and right now a specific version of the virus known as clade 2 3 4 4b is ruling the roost you can think of that like an omicron variant because of its wide prevalence webby says viruses are notoriously quick to mutate and since its arrival in north america the avian influenza virus has continued to change when the virus came over into the americas it started to interact with the viruses that we have in our wild birds here picking up different combinations of other genes webby says comparing the current u s virus to the one in europe webby says from the outside looking in they look very similar but when you actually go on the inside and take a look the viruses we have here are quite different now from what was in europe it s possible that wild bird populations will build up an immunity to the virus but webby warns that it will take months to understand whether that is happening at a meaningful level the outbreak hasn t raised all poultry costs if you like to eat chicken you re in luck this version of the influenza virus doesn t affect broilers chickens raised for meat as badly it does layers table egg laying hens and turkeys for whatever reason turkeys and layer birds tend to be more susceptible to the virus says amy hagerman an assistant professor at oklahoma state university who specializes in agricultural economics the chicken that most people think of their chicken tenders their chicken sandwiches all of those things haven t tended to have the same kinds of impact she adds hagerman warns that in a time of inflationary pressure and supply chain snags it can be hard to directly link a price hike to the virus but she notes that u s egg prices can be affected if just a few farms have to dispose of their flocks generally speaking these complexes are over a million birds easily hagerman says it takes fewer egg laying operations being affected by hpai to drive up the price of eggs and egg products she adds especially since the majority of u s production goes to the domestic market the virus has hit many turkey farms but because those operations tend to be smaller and the cases have been spread out over time and space producers have mostly been able to absorb the losses building up stocks of frozen turkey ahead of the end of year holidays so yes we certainly saw an increase in turkey prices in this holiday season hagerman says but not as much as we might have anticipated given the extent of this outbreak what about vaccines the presence of the virus in the commercial food chain raises a number of possible trade headaches but so would using a vaccine to fight it a lot of countries don t use vaccines for this virus in their poultry webby says one of the big complications is timing on a vaccine hagerman says generally you need two doses of a vaccine and then a length of time to achieve full effectiveness if you have a bird that has a very short feeding window before it s ready for harvest that can be a lot more challenging because you also need to allow the withdrawal period after the vaccine before the bird is harvested she adds another central issue is the difficulty of surveillance of knowing whether a bird is infected with a deadly influenza virus but isn t showing symptoms because they ve been vaccinated but the calculations might change if the virus is determined to be endemic in wild birds or in a geographic area that certainly seems to be the case in europe and africa webby says adding my gut feeling is we re headed that way in the americas as well these are actually discussions that are going on now webby says describing ideas such as what kind of post vaccination surveillance would be needed to make sure your trading partners are happy that the virus is not circulating silently the last outbreak didn t survive the summer this one did experts say poultry farms should be credited with limiting the virus as much as they have hailing the success of surveillance and biosecurity programs but nearly 11 months after the first known wild case in the current outbreak the deadly influenza virus is still here generally when the weather gets hot influenza goes away for the most part hagerman says that was the case in the 2014 2015 outbreak which came

politics government hochul ready for a bold fight to battle state s housing crisis we are in the midst of a housing crisis that has been decades in the making gov kathy hochul new york lt governor kathy hochul visits new york city school photo by spencer platt getty images long island ny gov kathy hochul is ready for a fight as she rolls up her sleeves to tackle the housing crisis that has many new yorkers packing their bags and heading for states where jobs and housing are ripe for the taking according to hochul while job opportunities currently in new york the housing situation is bleak speaking at the new york housing conference awards recently hochul said throughout her stints in local government she s embraced the fight for affordable housing taking on nimbyism or the not in my backyard mentality and rezoning and leading the charge for housing creation since taking office last year hochul said she and her administration have carried that charge forward i want to make sure people still want to come to new york that they can have a job and build a future she said that s not just aspirational it s what been doing since day 1 in my first state of the state since taking office after former gov andrew cuomo resigned after sexual harassment accusations hochul said affordable housing has been front and center with her pledge to make the largest investment in new york state s history by preserving and creating 100 000 affordable housing units to the tune of 25 billion over five years it was bold she said but she added there is a sense of urgency that cannot be ignored we have a finite amount of time to correct the wrongs of the past hochul added that she has cut the red to tape to accelerate new york hotel conversion to housing stock and has tackled discriminatory housing practice across the state it is not a new phenomenon but it should be a non phenomenon she said growing up in western new york hochul said her parents were activists inviting people from communities of color to sit on our front porch in an all white neighborhoods that s the environment i grew up on but discriminatory housing practices still exist today we have to call it out and try to rectify it long island has long been considered one of the most racially segregated suburbs in the nation and a new report released in 2021 by the state senate reviewed evidence of discrimination in real estate practices that may be contributing the committee was tasked with creating the final report on fair housing and discrimination on long island the investigation points out that long island has 291 communities but the vast majority of its black residents live in just 11 of those the committee offered a multi step recommendation to address the problems during her speech hochul pointed to initiatives she has spearheaded such as an eviction prevention program 539 million for a homeowners assistance fund and 100 million in rent supplements for people still reeling from the pandemic she added i m not here to make history i m here to make a difference her goal is that all new yorkers have the same advantages she had growing up hochul said her parents started off in a trailer park and eventually bought a little cape cod house as her father got an education and their lives improved i watched my parents success unfold from the progression of homes they could afford hochul said and it was the fact that there were homes to move into plentiful housing later when factories closed in the 80s and paychecks disappeared people were forced to leave their homes hochul said today new yorkers are facing a dearth of housing that has many forced to leave she said we have to accept the fact that we are once again staring down a crisis hochul said this new crisis could potentially block families from achieving their dreams they may go elsewhere and this time it s not a lack of jobs it s the opposite the jobs are here but the housing is not when families have to move far from one another with grandparents unable to see their grandchildren hochul said it symbolizes a breaking down of the social order she added we are in the midst of a housing crisis that has been decades in the making in new york state hochul said jobs are created at three times the rate of housing there are 3 25 million jobs but only 400 000 units of housing do you see the disconnect we now have jobs but where to put the workers where are they supposed to live other states such as new jersey and connecticut have created enough housing to accommodate the new jobs in their states hochul said her goal is to leave no stone unturned to find solutions hochul said she and her team have been looking at models nationwide as a result of a deliberative lengthy process we arrived at a very bold and impactful initiative the ideas are not easy at all but they are necessary she said a she did not immediately discuss details those will be revealed in her state of the state address hochul said to think of her talk as a trailer for a movie that will premier in january but it has to be an oscar winner we have no choice this has to be extraordinary she described bold and audacious action as necessary what caused the crisis hochul said was not a lack of state funding new york is also a leader in tenant protections she said here s the real problem she said we re a national leader in blocking housing according to hochul the brookings institution said the suburban counties that surround new york city may be the worst in the country in terms of regulatory and zoning hurdles new york is essentially in a league of its own when it comes to constricting housing development other cities including denver seattle austin and others she said are developing new housing at a rate two to four times higher than new york and while the lack of affordable housing in the new york city region is staggering it s even worse in the suburbs hochul said there has been virtually no new housing created in large swaths for years compared with suburban areas across the country long island and westchester are at the very bottom of the list along with the dearth of housing there are also escalating home prices and rental costs hochul said even upstate her own young staff can t find affordable rentals the idea of buying a house is so out of their reach new york hochul said is in competition with other parts of the country to attract and retain the top talent part of new jersey and other states have built four to five times more units of housing per capita that suburban long island has it would be one thing if the comparison were made to california an impossible commute for new yorkers but for those states that are geographically close that have done the work and built the inventory they are the ones poised to capture the talent for jobs that are going to our state as governor i don t want to see that i want to see them living in our state i want their grandchildren to live here hochul said unemployment is only 2 2 percent on long island right now hochul said the jobs are there they are looking for workers but they can t find housing in new york there is an unrealized capacity for more housing production and not taking advantage of that is unconscionable and morally reprehensible with impacts that could be economically catastrophic hochul said a lack of housing and a dramatic increase in rental costs have led to what can potentially become an out migration crisis hochul said hochul wants to give kids the same opportunity for advancement earlier generations enjoyed this is our opportunity to seize she said this doesn t have to be our destiny stop letting the old ways be our ways we need to have this common vision she added i actually like a good fight and i m up for the task there has been nimbyism on steroids those who said don t come to my community because you don t look like me i don t want you her that has to be over she said we need to act boldly there s no kicking the can up the road i m picking up this can and saying we re going to fix this i will not be deterred

nearly nine months after a bipartisan group of u s house members sent a letter questioning the securities and exchange commission s investigation into cryptocurrencies including the failed ftx exchange the lawmakers are maintaining their position that the agency s approach to regulating crypto is deeply flawed in public comments since ftx s collapse last month the congressmen led by minnesota republican tom emmer have largely called ftx s demise a singular issue that deserves scrutiny they argue the episode only reinforces their point that the sec s regulation of cryptocurrencies is arbitrary and ineffective ftx co ceo ryan salame was a major campaign contributor to the congressional leadership fund the political action committee emmer controlled as the head of the house republican campaign arm in the 2022 election cycle u s rep ted budd a north carolina republican who also signed the letter also received substantial support from salame in his u s senate bid this year the members letter was dated march 16 and objected to the sec s enforcement division taking steps to collect information from crypto companies as the information collection wasn t publicly known to be related to any active investigation the role was better suited to other departments within the commission they wrote citing sources familiar with the situation the progressive news magazine the american prospect first reported that ftx was among those the sec was seeking information from the march letter was addressed to sec chairman gary gensler in addition to emmer and budd it was signed by florida democrat darren soto florida republican byron donalds ohio republican warren davidson new jersey democrat josh gottheimer massachusetts democrat jake auchincloss and new york democrat ritchie torres the members told gensler the sec may be overstepping its jurisdiction by tasking its enforcement division with seeking information from firms that so far are not regulated by the commission and that investigations could have violated the federal paperwork reduction act that requires federal agencies not overwhelm private entities according to the letter it appears there has been a recent trend towards employing the enforcement division s investigative functions to gather information from unregulated cryptocurrency and blockchain industry participants in a manner inconsistent with the commission s standards for initiating investigations the letter said after ftx which had been the third largest crypto exchange declared bankruptcy last month the letter s signers who made public statements condemned ftx ftx failed after founder sam bankman fried improperly used another business he founded the trading house alameda research to hold a large number of ftx s tokens ftx collapse only proves point members say but the central thesis of the march letter that the sec s scattershot enforcement of crypto firms was unpredictable and ineffective was bolstered by the ftx example members have said they denied that the letter sought to shield ftx from federal regulators soto said in a nov 26 series of tweets that he believed the sec should investigate ftx the march letter wasn t about ftx he said but the crypto industry writ large the letter sought clarity on sec positions regarding its document request authority for crypto firms in general he tweeted the letter was not specific to ftx didn t reference ftx nor did our office have any contact with ftx regarding the letter the letter did not stop or slow down any investigations into ftx rep soto also has not received any contributions for ftx a spokesperson for donalds said in a written statement he remains concerned with the sec s approach to regulating digital assets in the absence of congressional legislation and still questioned why the sec used its enforcement division for voluntary information requests the sec has openly engaged in regulation by enforcement with little guidance as to which assets are legally subject to the sec s jurisdiction the spokeperson added the congressman feels that this combination severely hampers the marketplace and is an unsustainable method of governance the spokesperson was adamant that donalds never attempted to influence any of the sec s ongoing investigations emmer said the ftx episode did not undermine the idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies but rather was a failure by bankman fried and federal enforcement ftx a centralized exchange ran counter to the idea of decentralization he said ftx s collapse is not a crypto failure emmer tweeted nov 22 it s a failure with garygensler and sam bankman fried decentralization is the point in a nov 13 tweet davidson also said the fallout showed the sec s enforcement approach was not working at this point it s hard to believe that secgov hasn t engaged in selective enforcement he posted on nov 13 they worked closely with the biggest entities like ftx for years while engaging in endless discovery requests clearly gensler perhaps the sec structure are not up to the task at hand aides to emmer davidson gottheimer and budd did not respond to messages seeking comment representatives for the sec did not respond to a message from states newsroom seeking comment a relatively new phenomenon there is little explicit in federal law about how cryptocurrencies should be monitored gensler has said that cryptocurrencies which can be traded like stocks should be regulated like securities of the nearly 10 000 tokens in the crypto market i believe the vast majority are securities he wrote to treasury secretary janet yellen in october offers and sales of these crypto security tokens are covered by the securities laws campaign cash four of the letter s signers received campaign contributions from people associated with ftx emmer raised 8 700 in his most recent reelection campaign from individuals who listed ftx or ftx us as their employer including 5 800 the maximum allowed by law from salame the co ceo according to federal election commission records emmer s reelection campaign raised a total of 1 9 million from individuals in the 2022 cycle emmer was also the head of house republicans campaign organization which was not subject to the same limits on campaign contributions as his own reelection and that group received 2 75 million from ftx employees according to data from open secrets a nonprofit that tracks campaign spending the bulk of that figure 2 million came from a single contribution salame made in september salame s political action committee american dream federal action also spent 517 000 on television advertising for budd s successful senate campaign salame was the sole funder of american dream federal action according to fec records bankman fried had his own political action committee protect our future which contributed to democratic candidates though it did not support anyone who signed the march letter bankman fried contributed 27 million of the 28 5 million the committee raised in the 2022 cycle according to fec records gottheimer received 11 600 from ftx employees in the 2022 cycle including the maximum 5 800 from bankman fried

across wall street this year s bleak expectations for banker bonuses are rapidly proving true as a slump in dealmaking ends the industry s war for talent and firms regain the upper hand in setting pay jpmorgan chase bank of america and citigroup are all weighing plans to cut bonus pools for their investment bankers by as much as 30 according to people with knowledge of the internal deliberations some firms are planning to give low performers no reward at all the proposals are still under discussion and could change in coming weeks the people said michael nagle bloomberg such are the early snapshots of the industry s year end bonuses after corporate dealmaking and sales of new securities waned amid 2022 s market swoon investment banking revenue across the five biggest u s banks plummeted 47 a whopping 18 8 billion decline in the first nine months at goldman sachs group even traders who reeled in more aren t immune from bonus cuts for legions of bankers and traders their annual bonuses can stretch into millions of dollars and is many multiples of their annual salary wall streeters spend months banking on their bonuses to pay for tony private schools luxury vacation homes and private club memberships less than a year ago employers were locked in a vicious bidding war for talent with some firms forgoing firings almost entirely as they struggled to maintain adequate staffing dismissals restarted a few months ago and now with a growing number of wall streeters freshly unemployed banks have more leverage to keep a lid on pay many employees lack other viable options star performers will be looked after said anthony keizner a managing partner at the executive search firm odyssey search partners but as opposed to highly compensating some bankers and letting go of others it seems like the more common strategy will be to cut bonuses more broadly representatives from jpmorgan citigroup and bank of america declined to comment it s not all doom and gloom rates and commodities traders have helped propel fixed income trading revenue to 53 7 billion across wall street the second best performance on record at bank of america and citigroup that means executives may hold bonus pools for traders around last year s levels some of the people said and executives at those banks are discussing rewarding top rates currencies and commodities traders with higher pay packages gorman s warning goldman is set to break with rivals by reducing the bonus pool for traders by a low double digit percentage people with knowledge of the matter said earlier friday the firm is under particular pressure to limit pay after spending more than forecast on an expansion into consumer banking executives dialed back that campaign in october four months ago goldman also stood out when it signaled plans to resume periodic culls of underperformers but since then morgan stanley citigroup and barclays have followed suit in recent months job cutting holdouts have qualified their assurances with bank of america saying there s no plans for firings at this stage but the common practice of culling of underperformers is expected to resume next year the people said some people are going to be let go morgan stanley chief executive james gorman said thursday at the reuters next conference we re making some modest cuts all over the globe in most businesses that s what you do after many years of growth zeroed out on wall street bonuses and other incentives are notoriously volatile as the industry cycles through booms and busts in the final months of the year banks grade their workers performance and set bonus pools that they can share with the most generous portions for rainmakers the outlook for banker bonus pools has been dimming for months typical deal advisers may see their bonuses drop as much as 20 while awards to their counterparts in underwriting plunge 45 the compensation consultant johnson associates estimated last month this is going to be a more difficult compensation season jefferies chief executive rich handler and president brian friedman warned their employees this week just like it will be for every firm in our industry this year banks including citigroup bank of america and barclays are considering giving dozens of their lowest performers no bonus at all known as getting zeroed out or receiving a goose egg doughnut or bagel at goldman the number of bankers getting nothing could surpass 100 a barclays spokesperson declined to comment bonus snubs are often a precursor to a firing but also sort of a dare if a company wants to lower headcount it can throw out a bunch of them and see if enough people get the message to speed up attrition or with terminations at other firms on the rise some managers may bet that recipients will keep showing up to their desks cheaply where else are these bankers going to go keizner said the banks want their teams to stick around because when things turn back around the banks don t want to find themselves understaffed and scrambling again limiting hires indeed some smaller firms may resist their normal urge to snap up talent with the outlook on wall street now so uncertain evercore for example is limiting replacement hires for those bankers who leave the lower payouts to bankers may not inspire much sympathy outside finance in new york city the securities industry s overall bonus pool will decline 22 from last year when the average payout was 257 500 according to estimates from the state s comptroller thomas dinapoli that would still be more than four times higher than

restomods are a great compromise if you want a gorgeous american classic with modern power and handling and they ve been around for decades now but i bet you haven t seen too many italian exotics with u s made v8 engines under their hoods haven t you and mind you i m not talking about factory made classics like the de tomaso pantera iso grifo or the bizzarinni 5300 gt nope i mean a fully fledged build that involves an actual swap like this 1970 lamborghini espada that s up for sale on ebay right now wait what a super rare espada devoid of its factory v12 mill yup as preposterous as it may sound someone actually swapped the 3 9 liter v12 for an american made v8 and it s a bit outrageous because the espada series i made from 1968 until early 1970 was built in fewer than 200 units these cars are rare to say the least so what s the story here well the seller says the drivetrain conversion was made by a previous owner sometime in the late 1980s there s no info as to why the v12 was replaced but we do know that the lambo now draws juice from a fuel injected v8 of the chevrolet variety the conversion was professionally done and retained the original lamborghini differential but the exact displacement of the replacement unit is unknown according to the ad the v8 is built on a 5 0 block believed to be either 5 4 or 5 7 capacity however exact displacement has not been verified we also don t get info on power and torque but the seller claims the engine is similar to the race prepped corvettes that dominated the scca during that era if this is true this espada should be more powerful than stock 325 horsepower all that oomph hits the rear wheels through a five speed borg warner gearbox the swap is said to have improved power delivery handling and usability while eliminating the costs associated with maintaining an exotic v12 engine while that may be true given that old lambo mills are quite fussy it ruins the car s value as a rare classic engine swap aside the espada looks gorgeous inside and out thanks to a restoration that was performed in 2011 the refresh also came with a color change as the original verde pallido paint was removed and the car was refinished in azzurro metallizzato using an existing toyota color the two tone interior is perfect beyond some slight traces of use so what s the value of a nicely restored espada that s been stripped of its original v12 it s difficult to say but the auction set up by ebay seller flatsicks has a high bid of 42 100 with a little more than 24 hours to go the reserve hasn t been met for reference series i espadas in excellent and all original condition usually average more than 150 000

by michael s derby reuters persistently massive inflows of cash into a key federal reserve facility are in large part being driven by a bank liquidity regulation change from last year a report from the new york fed said friday the fed s facility offers what are called reverse repos which allow eligible firms to park cash at the central bank in exchange for a risk free return the rule playing a role in the inflows is a regulation called the supplementary leverage ratio which determines how much liquidity banks need to have on hand the slr standard was eased during the most acute phase of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 when fears about market functioning abounded and it was restored at the end of march 2021 returning to a tighter standard after the slr relief period ended banks had less flexibility to expand their balance sheets by increasing their holdings of reserves and treasuries wrote bank economists gara afonso marco cipriani and gabriele la spada that had a knock on effect on money market funds the main user of reverse repos which surged cash into the reverse repo facility after the regulation change banks were less inclined to take deposits and that cash instead flowed to the money funds which had to invest that money somewhere the paper said meanwhile banks reduced short term debt offerings constraining what money funds could invest in and on top of that fed rate hikes further drove cash into money market funds as financial markets navigated a shift in the cost of short term borrowing according to the authors the fed s revere repo facility is a key part of the toolkit it uses to manage the setting of its federal funds rate target which it uses to influence the path of the economy to achieve its inflation and job goals the reverse repo tool offers money market funds and other firms a place to park cash at the fed overnight and earn a return it s currently at 3 8 and is a better yielding investment than many private securities that come with more risk the fed s reverse repo facility was largely unused into the spring of 2021 and then inflows steadily ramped up inflows peaked at 2 426 trillion at the end of september before easing slightly to friday s inflow of 2 05 trillion fed officials have been sanguine by the massive levels of inflows some have made the case that as the fed raises rates and reduces the size of its balance sheet to combat high inflation inflows to the reverse repo facility should decline over time thus far it hasn t really happened however meanwhile issues around the right setting for the slr are under consideration by financial authorities who are treading cautiously on the issue history shows the deep costs to society when bank capital is inadequate and thus how urgent it is for the federal reserve to get capital regulation right said michael barr the fed s point man on bank oversight in comments thursday reporting by michael s derby editing by andrea ricci

mixed the three year muni ust ratio wednesday was at 62 the five year at 69 the 10 year at 74 and the 30 year at 97 according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the three at 63 the five at 68 the 10 at 77 and the 30 at 97 at a 4 p m read despite the fed s attempts to cool the economy and lower decades high inflation the jobs report beat expectations and showed an additional63 000 new jobs in november above the 200 000 expected investors though should be prepared for increased market volatility said nigel green ceo and founder of the devere group the jobs report will trigger turbulence as the labor market is still strong despite the federal reserve imposing the biggest series of rate rises in decades in its battle to cool inflation he said this wage inflation means that the u s central bank is likely to be raising interest rates for longer than anticipated he said the labor market remains far too hot for the fed s liking and it will take much slower growth in employment and wages to return inflation to the central bank s 2 target on a sustained basis said wells fargo securities senior economist sarah house and economist michael pugliese they noted a downshift to a 50 basis point rate hike in december is likely but the fed still has a ways to go in its tightening cycle so far 2022 has been a painful year for investors in most asset classes however the fixed income market munis specifically has suffered a drawdown in line with some of the worst in history said david grean a portfolio manager at parametric stubbornly high consumer price inflation caused the federal reserve to quickly pivot from accommodative monetary policy to hiking six times bringing the target range between 3 75 and 4 grean said this policy has contributed to a dramatic increase in nominal interest rates and a significant adjustment of municipal bond valuations 2022 will be remembered as the worst year in the bond market s history as persistently higher inflation led to ever higher fed target rate expectations and a hectic unwind of the bond rally that occurred over the past 15 years bofa strategists said in a report for the municipal market they said a cumulative 110 billion of outflows from muni mutual funds prompted issuers to postpone many deals until 2023 they believe 2023 is shaping up to be a much more promising year as the fed is expected to complete its tightening program in the first few months of the year the economy is expected to enter a mild recession and market yields are expected to make a final round of rising early in the year before

november would see the addition of 200 000 jobs the jobs report showed the labor market especially wage pressures is not cooling quickly at all said edward moya senior market analysts at oanda a headline gain of 263 000 jobs was almost above the most optimistic estimate and the gain with wages was jaw dropping he said average hourly earnings rose twice as fast as forecast on a monthly basis which will keep fueling inflationary pressures underscoring the unique current economic environment a slower pace of job growth could be deemed a positive development for the economy in that it should help reduce inflation pressures stemming from the jobs market said wells fargo securities senior economist sarah house and economist michael pugliese but the fed s efforts to curb demand have yet to make much of a dent on this front the fed is tightening monetary policy but somebody forgot to tell the labor market said brian coulton chief economist for fitch ratings the good thing about these numbers he said is that it shows the u s economy firmly got back to growth in the second half of the year but job expansion continuing at this speed will do nothing to ease the labor supply demand imbalance that is worrying the fed coulton noted strong job creation and a big increase in wages underscore the federal reserve s argument that a lot more work needs to be done to get inflation under control it has certainly jolted the market said james knightley ing s chief international economist but with recessionary fears lingering market participants will remain skeptical over how long the strong performance can last continued solid employment gains and a reacceleration in wage growth to set up tense december fomc meeting said mickey levy and mahmoud abu ghzalah of berenberg capital markets monthly payroll employment growth was well above fed chair powell s estimate of the rate needed to keep up with population growth they said worryingly for the fed nominal wage growth accelerated to 0 6 month over month and 5 1 year over year up from 0 5 and 4 9 respectively in october levy and ghzalah said moreover upward revisions to prior month s data strengthened the tone of the report and the tentative trend of moderating wage growth hinted at in the september and october employment reports was revised away they said with chair powell explicitly tying core services inflation to nominal wage growth and given his assessment that core services inflation would be the best judge of the future trajectory of inflation levy and ghzalah noted they said that november s jobs report strengthens the case for a higher terminal rate and will likely prompt the fed to err on the side of caution in both the level and duration of policy tightening particularly given their concerns over the potential for a wage price spiral to develop fed policymakers have made clear that they want to see a healthier balance between supply and demand in the labor market house and pugliese said ideally they said robust labor supply growth would alleviate the need for much pain on the demand side but the labor supply picture this year has been underwhelming and today s report was yet another disappointment on that front the labor force participation rate is now below where it was in january furthermore powell recently said policies to support labor supply are not the domain of the fed our tools work principally on demand the message from chair powell and company is clear labor cost growth needs to slow to a rate consistent with the fed s 2 inflation target and the fed will do what it takes to achieve this goal on the demand side regardless of what is happening on the supply side house and pugliese said policymaker s objective is a gradual and controlled slowdown in demand and the data suggest some success in this regard they noted nonfarm payroll growth has averaged 272 000 per month over the past three months below the 391 000 average for the year to date other labor market indicators such as job openings quits small business hiring plans and consumer sentiment about job availability suggest the labor market is cooling rather than freezing over house and pugliese said these factors give the fomc the labor market data they need to downshift to a 50 bps rate hike at its upcoming december meeting that said payroll growth of 263 000 is still too fast at this stage of the business cycle and wage growth of around 5 is half to one percentage points above what would be consistent with the fed s inflation target they noted a downshift to a 50 bps rate hike in december seems likely but the fed still has a ways to go in its tightening cycle house and pugliese said if the fed sticks with a more moderate 50 bps hike in december as they have earlier indicated the 75 bps hike may ultimately be the elephant in the room said beth ann bovino us chief economist at s p global ratings either way with still hot pricing pressure our forecast of 5 00 to 5 25 exit fed funds rate seems increasingly likely if the fed eases too much or too soon she said they are once again behind the curve and are forced to catch up with more rate hikes next year with an even higher exit rate next year that means an even worse recession for 2023 bovino said while we see it as a short and shallow one a recession is on the horizon with the fed playing grinch

the labor shortfall became more acute last month as more americans dropped out of the workforce u s businesses are creating jobs at a rapid clip but the pool of workers they can hire from keeps shrinking that s the key takeaway from the november jobs report published friday and it s not an encouraging one for the federal reserve advertisement the labor shortfall that s troubled employers since the pandemic hit became even more acute last month as more americans dropped out of the workforce wages jumped the most in nearly a year as firms compete to hire scarce talent from the fed s point of view all that extra cash in consumers pockets means more spending power which leads to more inflation putting pressure on the central bank to hit the brakes even harder we have about 4 million fewer workers than the pre pandemic trend so we re very far behind said beth ann bovino chief economist for the united states and canada at s p global ratings the fed can t force people to come to the workforce all they can do is weaken the economy to rebalance things advertisement that expectation triggered a selloff after the jobs data as investors bet on even higher interest rates aimed at squeezing the economy stocks slumped with the s p 500 dropping about 1 2 before paring some of those losses and yields on two year treasury bonds surged while u s payrolls grew faster than economists expected last month rising by 263 000 from october the pace of wage growth was an even bigger surprise average hourly earnings rose twice as much as forecast business there s no labor shortage just not enough good jobs employers in california and the u s are scrambling to fill jobs as the dust from the pandemic begins to settle just don t call it a labor shortage that s linked to the shrinking pool of available talent the so called participation rate essentially the share of americans who are either working or actively looking for a job declined for a third straight month something that hasn t happened in more than a decade at 62 1 it s significantly below pre pandemic levels advertisement trouble finding child care early retirements and lower than usual immigration all add up to a u s workforce that s smaller than it would otherwise be the fed s hope has been that as the economy cools many of those people who dropped out will be pressured to come back but that hasn t happened instead companies are having to pay more and that s a red flag for the fed ever since u s prices began to climb sharply last year earnings for most workers have lagged behind inflation but central bankers see a risk that pay and prices will combine to push each other higher in what s known as a wage price spiral that s not a reality yet but it is a danger fed chair jerome h powell suggested at a brookings institution event this week advertisement the inflation we re seeing now is not principally related to wages he said we think that wage increases are probably going to be a very important part of the story going forward although the headline numbers in friday s report point to a full steam ahead job market buried in the details are a few indications that things may be poised to cool down for example many of the newly created jobs are concentrated in areas such as leisure and hospitality or local government that are still in some ways playing catch up after all the pandemic disruption meanwhile major industries including retail and transportation and warehousing are cutting staff advertisement other recent data have also suggested that a labor slowdown may be coming job openings have eased continuing claims for unemployment insurance have climbed steadily in recent weeks and a recent survey showed fewer than 1 in 5 small business owners plan to hire in the near term still those signals were drowned out in friday s numbers by the strong hiring and surge in pay strikingly even industries that aren t in great shape on the face of it like real estate beset by a housing crunch or the information sector that s seen layoffs at high profile tech firms were still adding staff overall it s good that people are getting work and people are getting higher wages said s p s bovino but if workers continue to demand more wages to keep up with ever higher overall costs then you end up seeing that spiral that the fed fears the most advertisement bloomberg staff writer catarina saraiva contributed to this report

137 earlier in the week to avert a strike the senate voted down a second bill guaranteeing workers a week of paid time off as our colleagues alexander bolton and karl evers hillstrom reported while a majority of senators voted for that measure it failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to pass keeping the trains running the white house described biden s decision to sign the bill as a necessary step to avoid economic catastrophe our colleague alex gangitano reported at a signing ceremony the president pointed to the delivery of chlorine to municipal water supplies and of farm produce to markets as services that stood to be interrupted in the event of a strike we have averted those catastrophes and ensured that workers would get a historic 24 percent wage increase biden added biden said he would keep fighting for increased sick leave advertisement advertisement i didn t commit we would stop just because we couldn t get it in this bill he said next steps for now the deal will go forward

unions appeared to admit defeat smart leaders thanked democratic leadership for their support at the negotiating table and on the floors of congress in an attempt to achieve more for our members but they excoriated the 43 senators all republicans except sen joe manchin d w va who voted against including the paid sick days advertisement advertisement what the unions are saying smart said in a statement that new lean staffing measures that have made railroad companies record profits have forced to work more hours have less stability suffer more stress and receive less rest the letter framed the debate in the context of a sustainability crisis in the workforce that keeps america s trains running no american worker should ever have to face the decision of going to work sick fatigued or mentally unwell versus getting disciplined or being fired by their employer yet that is what is happening every single day on this nation s largest freight railroads the statement added the 43 senators who opposed the measure all have paid sick days as do their staff smart noted progressive push and line crossing conservatives before thursday s votes progressives had expressed hope they would be able to pass both the measure forcing through the agreement and a complimentary one forcing companies to grant a full week of sick days advertisement advertisement this is not a radical idea it s a very conservative idea and it says if you work in the rail industry you will get seven paid sick days sen bernie sanders i vt said before the vote sen elizabeth warren d mass said many

socially responsible investing by pulling 2 billion in state assets from asset management giant blackrock advertisement advertisement the divestment comes as part of a broader republican campaign against environment social and governance esg investing florida s move follows similar divestments by gop leaders in states like texas in dueling statements each side accused the other of putting politics over financial performance reason for divestment the conservative politicians have accused asset managers like blackrock who have made statements about the importance of decarbonization while continuing to invest in new fossil fuels of putting progressive politics over financial returns i need partners within the financial services industry who are as committed to the bottom line as we are and i don t trust blackrock s ability to deliver florida chief financial officer patronis jimmy patronis said in a statement using our cash to fund blackrock s social engineering project isn t something florida ever signed up for patronis added advertisement advertisement what kind of social engineering patronis cited a january open letter that blackrock chief executive larry fink wrote to ceos laying out his views on the importance of stakeholder capitalism fink described this as capitalism that gains more sustainable returns by spreading the benefits from a company wider along the value chain helping to shape society stakeholder capitalism is not about politics it is not a social or ideological agenda it is not woke fink wrote it is capitalism driven by mutually beneficial relationships between you and the employees customers suppliers and communities your company relies on to prosper carbon considerations in the letter fink rejected the idea of divesting from the fossil fuel sector but identified sustainability as the most likely source of the next generation of significant economic growth and creation of new businesses the next 1 000 unicorns won t be search engines or social media companies they ll be sustainable scalable innovators startups that help the world decarbonize and make the energy transition affordable for all consumers he wrote blackrock focused on sustainability not because we re environmentalists but because we are capitalists and fiduciaries to our clients run for office florida s patronis described this line of thinking as an attempt to avoid dealing with the messiness of democracy i think it s undemocratic of major asset managers to use their power to influence societal outcomes patronis wrote if larry or his friends on wall street want to change the world run for office start a non profit donate to the causes you care about what did blackrock say company representatives called the move by the state politically motivated we are surprised by the florida cfo s decision given the strong returns blackrock has delivered to florida taxpayers over the last five years blackrock representatives said in a statement according to fast company the company said it was disturbed by the emerging trend of political initiatives like this that sacrifice access to high quality investments and thereby jeopardize returns which will ultimately hurt florida s citizens hitting back in a mirror to patronis s accusations blackrock representatives added that fiduciaries should always value performance over politics natural

study has found the effect of wind power in replacing more polluting sources saved 2 billion in health costs in 2014 according to the study published on friday in science advances these savings could reach 8 4 billion if operators turned off more polluting sources when excess wind power was available there s a catch the electricity industry would have to spin down the most polluting plants at

eli lilly and other pharma companies are accused of artificially inflating the price of insulin for decades chicago cn a vial of insulin can cost as little as 2 to manufacture yet at the pharmacy counter people with diabetes often end up paying hundreds for the life saving medicine progressives have long pointed to the gulf between insulin s production costs and its consumer price tag as proof that america s privatized health care system hurts all but the exceedingly rich on friday afternoon the office of illinois attorney general kwame raoul seemed to agree in a 125 page fraud lawsuit filed in cook county circuit court on friday the office accused eli lilly cvs pharmacy novo nordisk and several other pharmaceutical companies of artificially inflating the cost of insulin by over 1 000 since the late 1990s today insulin has become the poster child for skyrocketing and inflated drug prices the suit states the complaint singles out eli lilly in particular noting the price for a dose of its analog insulin humalog rose by 1 527 between 1997 and 2018 remarkably nothing about these medications has changed the complaint states today s 350 insulin is the exact same drug defendants originally sold for 20 the canadian scientists who developed the first insulin treatments frederick banting james collip and charles best intended for the medication to be readily available after filing for a u s patent on their insulin extraction technique in 1923 they then sold it to the university of toronto for 1 equivalent to about 15 today insulin does not belong to me it belongs to the world banting reportedly said after making the sale their move to sell the patent to the university was in fact specifically meant to defend against proprietary monopolies on the technique in a letter to then university president robert falconer the scientists explained that when the details of the method of preparation are published anyone would be free to prepare the extract but no one could secure a profitable monopoly despite the scientists intentions in the 21st century several companies do hold an effective monopoly on the manufacture and sale of insulin a 2020 study by the mayo clinic found that three manufacturers novo nordisk sanofi aventis and eli lilly control about 90 of the global insulin market similarly three pharmacy benefit managers companies that negotiate the price of medications with retail pharmacies control about 75 of their own market those three pbm companies cvs caremark optumrx and express scripts are all named as defendants alongside eli lilly and novo nordisk in the friday suit it accuses the companies and several others of deliberately conspiring to fix insulin prices for the sake of billions in profit in 2021 alone eli lilly reported over 48 billion in total assets in the last decade alone manufacturer defendants have in tandem increased the price of their insulins up to 1000 often down to the decimal point within a few days of each other the suit alleges the suit also notes that 13 of illinoisans about 1 3 million people live with diabetes making the pharma companies alleged monopoly scheme a public health threat unable to afford defendants price increases many diabetics in illinois have begun to to engage in highly risky behaviors such as rationing their insulin skipping their refills injecting expired insulin re using needles and avoiding doctors visits the complaint states besides seeking an end to the pharma companies insulin price gouging raoul s suit also asks the court to levy steep fees on them 50 000 for each deceptive or unfair act or practice as well as a disgorgement of all the profits the companies gained through the alleged price fixing scheme illinois is not the first state to attempt to rein in insulin prices nor the first to try and punish pharmaceutical corporations for fixing them new jersey diabetes patients filed a rico class action against insulin manufacturers in 2017 and harris county texas filed a similar suit in 2019 the companies have also fought back such as when a pharma lobby group waged a yearlong court battle in minnesota in 2020 hoping to overturn the state s insulin price cap program for low income residents the price of insulin also recently came into public focus when on nov 10 a mock eli lilly twitter account declared that insulin was free the tweet later revealed to have been sent by a writer for the left wing labor publication more perfect union cost eli lilly 22 billion and a 4 fall in its stock when eli lilly s actual twitter account posted a tweet apologizing for the false proclamation later the same day it prompted hundreds of users to criticize the company over its insulin prices the company has not tweeted since then

thank you for inviting me to join you and share my thoughts on threats and opportunities around the world as much as things have changed since my first days at heritage there are some things that do not change the threat to freedom is one of them most important is the vigilance with which all americans and foundations like heritage must vigorously defend and promote freedom in the world i recall visiting the former soviet union and having a former prisoner of conscience tell us he had learned about the heritage foundation from the voice of america he said that knowing someone in the outside world cared about his cause is what kept him going and helped him keep his faith i am sure nobel laureate aung san suu kyi who is still under house arrest in burma would say the same thing to us if she were here today i remember another occasion when ed feulner phil truluck and heritage board members visited the berlin wall shortly before it was torn down we recalled how ronald reagan had asked mikhail gorbachev to tear down this wall as it turned out it was not gorbachev who tore down the wall it was free germans on both sides pulling it apart in a way you would find most satisfying chunk by chunk grasping at the freedom and friendship and unity that was long past their due today the berlin wall is gone and in its stead stands a space where freedom echoes i have been back to berlin several times since then and it is changing but always you can feel where the wall once was freedom s enemies think that their works crafted with hatred and terror will last forever that history will prove them right but they are wrong they were wrong about the berlin wall and they will be wrong about ground zero as well that hole in lower manhattan will one day disappear just as that no man s land in berlin did but we will not forget who caused both horrors what is left is the certain knowledge that fear and terror did not and will not triumph over liberty answering the call over the past century our nation has been called on to stand up for liberty not only for our own but for that of others we have answered that call many times it is no different today we face numerous challenges from international terrorists in iraq and afghanistan and from proliferation such as by north korea and iran in each case the enemies of freedom wish not only to dominate and kill but to confuse and demoralize us and our allies ladies and gentlemen they cannot succeed unless we let them we are freedom s force and freedom we know is the true foundation of justice and peace there are those in the world who have a false idea of freedom to them freedom is their right to lord over others sometimes in the name of religion nationhood or political ideology freedom is wrongly seen as a right to oppress ethnic tribal or racial enemies a misplaced sense of victimhood becomes an excuse to seek freedom for oneself but to deny that freedom to others this is of course not freedom at all it is its opposite it is the twisted ideology of terrorists and tyrants the world over who try to turn all the good values in the world upside down love for one s countrymen for example into hatred of outsiders or to transform perversely the belief in god into a motivating force for acts of terror and vengeance whereas these enemies of freedom try to demonize democracy and progress and construct walls of fear we tear down walls with force if we must but more often stone by stone through patient deliberate diplomacy today s tension between those who despise freedom and those who treasure it will not ease any time soon too much is at stake the enemies of freedom profit from unrest poverty famine and disease it is far more lucrative for them to stifle opportunity than to work for peace stability and prosperity too many people see freedom as the right of the few to rule over the many that is why we must stay the course in this war on terrorism it is why we must stay the course in iraq and afghanistan it is why we must forcefully reject proliferation of nuclear biological and chemical weapons the enemies of freedom are testing our will of that there can be no doubt we may need to be flexible in our tactics to deal with them but we must never lose sight of our strategic goals while many roads may lead to our destination we must never allow ourselves to get off course that is precisely what the terrorists wish us to do they want to confuse us and our allies into believing that we cannot win or that our fight is not worth the cost their real targets are the hearts and minds of the american people and our allies in the war on terrorism the terrorists know that their only road to victory is if the civilized world weakens in its resolve to fight secretary of state colin powell expressed it this way freedom prosperity and peace are not separate principles or separable policy goals each reinforces the other so serving any one requires an integrated policy that serves all three the challenges are many for the world is full of trouble but it is also full of opportunities and we are resolved to seize every one of them the changing threat of international terrorism international terrorism combined with the proliferation of weapons of mass terror is of course the greatest threat to the world today i would like to spend a few minutes describing some of our efforts in dealing with these threats placing special emphasis on what we have sought to do at the united nations and on other international efforts the terrorists war against america as your own jim phillips will certainly attest did not begin on september 11 nor did our defense but the conscience and will of the world to respond to the threat certainly did as national security adviser condoleezza rice testified last week we have been single minded in responding to the 9 11 attack on america and to the possibility that terrorists may try to obtain and use weapons of mass destruction but there is much more work to do the threat itself is changing while al qaeda s original network has been disrupted its fractured cells are working with indigenous groups they use the internet and media not just to communicate but to recruit they use attacks like those in spain and iraq to rally support for their cause every perceived step backwards for the coalition gives incentive for a new cell to form and for those on the sidelines to join the terrorists believe they can outlast us that they can break our will so our greatest challenge is to remain patient to stay the course and to apply power and diplomacy as each is needed the future of freedom for all people demands no less the clear and present threat from al qaeda presented an opportunity to mobilize the u n security council to act council members came together after september 11 to mandate a broad range of counterterrorism measures by all states and to create a counter terrorism committee that would monitor those steps and promote strong action a few months later the council at our urging strengthened existing sanctions against osama bin laden al qaeda and the taliban to freeze assets and prevent travel by anyone who supports them over 300 individuals and entities are on the u n sanctions committee list now and it is growing we will continue working in the security council to make both committees even more effective since 9 11 we have also worked through u n agencies like the international civil aviation organization and the international maritime organization to strengthen security measures for aviation and shipping we have done even more for example we have led efforts to prevent terrorists from acquiring portable shoulder fired missiles that can shoot down aircraft we have worked closely in the g 8 to strengthen export controls and protections for government stocks of these weapons and we have secured commitments from six countries to destroy almost 9 500 of them the importance of the president s proliferation security initiative our greatest fear of course is that terrorists might get their hands on weapons of mass destruction chemical biological or nuclear weapons the proliferation of such weapons is a grave threat to the peace and security of the entire world the president recognizes that since proliferation is a global threat it requires a global response he has laid out an ambitious strategy typical of this president s desire to think outside the box he created a new global partnership for counterproliferation called the proliferation security initiative some 60 nations have shown an interest in or are collaborating with us to stop the flow of weapons of mass destruction across land sea or in the skies this initiative is already proving its worth german and italian authorities acting under the authority of the psi and using u s and british intelligence stopped a ship on its way to libya they found and seized several containers carrying sophisticated centrifuges that could be used in nuclear weapons programs they were being trafficked by a network run by dr abdul qadeer khan a scientist and father of pakistan s nuclear bomb in september the president called upon the u n security council to adopt a resolution to deal with proliferation of weapons of mass destruction the resolution calls on member states to criminalize the proliferation of these weapons among non state actors enact strict export controls consistent with the highest international standards and secure all sensitive materials within their borders we are also working with the international atomic energy agency the iaea in vienna to curb proliferation and strengthen nuclear safeguards with our aid and that of other countries the iaea has been pressuring iran to adhere to its pledges and suspend its enrichment and reprocessing activities the iaea also has been useful in managing the destruction and verification of materials associated with libya s program of weapons of mass destruction to strengthen the iaea the president has proposed creating a special verification committee to ensure that violators of proliferation agreements are discovered and held accountable staying the course in iraq i believe that just as helping libya come clean of its weapons of mass destruction and ousting al qaeda from afghanistan have made the world safer so too has removing saddam hussein from power no one need fear an attack from him again yet we face threats inside iraq from former regime elements foreign radical islamic terrorists and some homegrown insurgents as the president said this week the defeat of violence and terror in iraq is vital to the defeat of violence and terror elsewhere and vital therefore to the safety of the american people we all desire more security in iraq but we should not lose sight of what has been accomplished the loss of even one iraqi american or coalition life in this conflict is to be mourned yet we should not forget that iraqis no longer have to fear the fate of those who lie in hundreds of mass graves around the country the iraqis also have a new interim constitution which sounds familiar to anyone who understands democratic republics it guarantees freedom of religion worship and expression the right to assemble and organize political parties and the right to vote it forbids discrimination based on religion or gender or nationality it is as nina shea at freedom house puts it a democratic milestone in that region iraq s market economy is stabilizing the world bank group estimates its domestic output will rebound by 33 percent this year alone critical infrastructure such as clean water electricity and reliable telecommunications systems has also vastly improved all 240 hospitals in iraq have reopened over 22 million vaccinations have been administered and over 25 000 tons of medicine and supplies have been delivered more than 5 5 million children are back in school and over 51 million new textbooks that teach tolerance are now in circulation the next step is working out a mechanism for creating the interim iraqi government we welcome ambassador lakhdar brahimi s recommendations for structuring that government his contributions will be key to ensuring that a new government of iraq is elected through transparent democratic elections the iraqi governing council has established an electoral committee to work with the united nations on plans for national elections next january these are important steps on iraq s path to sovereignty and we hope that the u n will continue to advise iraq during the political transition i should also note that both president bush and secretary powell have discussed a new security council resolution on iraq we are starting to consider what kind of resolution might be appropriate looking at the kinds of elements that could be in the resolution for example it could build on resolutions 1483 and 1511 it could extend a hand to a new iraqi government it could deal with reconstruction activities including the future of the development fund for iraq and with the continuing need for security so that the iraqi people can complete the political process it could encourage other nations to get involved in security and reconstruction efforts and it could structure a role for the u n in the political framework particularly in supporting the process toward elections ladies and gentlemen there is progress in iraq and we have a lot still to do and yes it is true that the cost of war is always high but so too is the cost of inaction we know that over the years at least 300 000 people lost their lives at the hands of saddam hussein including from bounties he offered for suicide bombings in israel for those who say the cost of our action in iraq is not worth the price i would ask them not merely to compare today s losses with the much larger losses under saddam hussein i would also ask why they would wish to preserve a regime that surely would have killed thousands of more people in the future promoting democracy in the middle east and beyond ladies and gentlemen what is at stake in iraq is not merely the success or failure of american policy also at stake is whether freedom and democracy can take root and thrive in the middle east one of the president s clearest priorities is what he calls a forward strategy for freedom it pervades all our foreign policy freedom he said at the national endowment for democracy honors and unleashes human creativity and creativity determines the strength and wealth of nations the opportunity is ripe for democracy in the middle east but so too is the threat of failure democracy cannot be imposed people cannot be free to choose a democracy if they live in fear and surely it can take a long time to develop democracy indeed it took a great many years centuries even for it to develop in the western world the problem is that the people of the middle east cannot wait that long for democracy most people in this region want the fruits of freedom just as much as anyone and they want it now the lack of freedom in the middle east is a major driving force of the hatred and fear that fuels terrorism and seeks to export it the president is increasing funding for the region the middle east s humanitarian and security and development needs are huge and unless they are adequately addressed governments have neither the will nor the resources to change a key element of the president s initiatives is democracy building crucial if we are to eliminate many of the motivations of those who engage in terrorism one of the four pillars of the president s middle east partnership initiative which secretary powell unveiled at heritage just shortly after i left is political reform through concrete steps words like democracy ballots voting petitioning and campaigning will become part of the everyday lexicon in that region it also promotes public private partnerships to train candidates and voters to encourage representative and competitive multiparty systems and to improve elections since the 1970s the number of electoral democracies around the world has grown from 40 to 120 surely more from the middle east could join these ranks and when they do not only will their governments and societies transform but the region will as well so too will the international organizations to which these new democracies belong the united nations founded by democracies would be far more effective if its current membership were more democratic even more so if its member states which uphold political civil and economic freedoms at home would champion them in the u n arena unfortunately too often they do not too often opportunities to address the threats facing the world and to advance freedom are squandered we are working hard to change that fact we are asking democracies to stand with us on principle and advance political freedoms economic freedom and human rights i am happy to tell you this proposal for an informal democracy caucus is catching on a proactive caucus of democracies is beginning to collaborate at the u n commission on human rights to promote freedom in that forum one example is our work on a resolution this year to promote and consolidate democracy which we are sponsoring with romania and peru it is vigorously supported by the 32 democracies on the 53 member commission we hope this is a sign of greater collaboration to come another example is the very significant vote in the commission condemning cuba for its human rights abuses this resolution is stronger than last year s and the win took a lot of work we also won similar votes cosponsored with the european union on north korea belarus and turkmenistan these resolutions are important they shine a bright light on the plight of the oppressed more importantly they let them know the world is still standing with them concerns about globalization ladies and gentlemen many wise people over the years have understood the relationship of challenges and opportunities seeing the one in the other one such opportunity that unfortunately all too many people today see as a threat is globalization i would like to end by saying a few words about this subject it may seem unrelated to terrorism and other topics i have discussed but it is in fact closely related globalization is a buzzword for tearing down barriers to commerce information and technology its engine is the same desire to be free that motivates democratic activists living under oppression to throw off their yoke of tyranny yes globalization can be disruptive and it is indeed an agent of change but all around the world those people and countries that seek to harness that change rather than stand against it are the most successful and productive they also are the greatest force for peace and prosperity in the world they are the growing middle and entrepreneurial classes of the world who make things and who create economic growth whose main political desire in life is not to lord over others in order to control the spoils of power but to be free to enjoy the fruits of their own labor in other words to be left in peace economic freedom the answer to globalization concerns is at the heart of our current international economic policy you might call it our forward strategy for free markets whether it s signing free trade agreements with countries like chile jordan bahrain and australia or a regional agreement with central america nations or establishing the world s largest free trade zone among 34 countries in the western hemisphere we are striving to open markets and unleash opportunity our international economic agenda extends to multilateral forums as well we continue to talk with countries that support the principles of economic freedom on how we can advance them throughout the u n system we are also leading efforts to revitalize the doha development round of the world trade organization and we will be hosting a g 8 summit later this summer where discussions should include how to promote economic development in the greater middle east we will also move forward with the millennium challenge account an innovative program to ensure that foreign economic assistance is more effective the first group of qualifying countries for this program will soon be rewarded for putting in place policies that advance freedom democracy and prosperity such policies include good governance transparency public private partnerships and access to health care and open markets these are the best ways to unleash the forces of freedom that can reduce hunger and poverty and prevent terrorism from taking root countries that fail to put in place the right policies fail their people those who do not tackle corruption trafficking in persons and international crime allow their people to be robbed of the fruits of their labor those who fail to take advantage of the liberating effects of globalization are far more likely to succumb to the temptations of terrorists they will become the alienated and the forgotten on whom terrorists prey with their perverse and obscure ideologies all the more reason to push for an open and successful global economy all the more reason to press for economic policies that create a tide that lifts all boats and all the more reason to continue the trade and development policies this administration has developed to produce economic growth for all
washington reuters u s federal reserve officials have signaled plans for a half point interest rate hike at their meeting this month and while that would be a step down from recent rate increases new projections issued then could show a policy rate headed toward levels last seen on the eve of the 2007 financial crisis moreover in an outlook that could lean against market expectations for rate cuts by the end of next year the 19 u s central bankers new forecasts may well show the federal funds rate remaining at that elevated level at least through 2023 the updated outlooks will be a fresh chance for fed officials to show how their raise and hold strategy is expected to play out in terms of the ultimate level of the overnight policy rate and the progress of growth inflation and unemployment in what they hope is a resilient economy the rate setting federal open market committee meets on dec 13 14 capping a volatile year that saw the central bank respond to the fastest outbreak of inflation since the 1980s with the fastest increase in interest rates since then to try to offset it that aggressive response sent a shock through the financial system that at one stage erased nearly 12 trillion of u s stock market value and more recently pushed home mortgages rates to 7 for a population used to cheap money graphic 2022 u s stock market value loss equity markets have risen lately and rocketed this week when fed chair jerome powell in what were likely his last public remarks before the meeting said the fed was ready to slow down from a string of four straight three quarter point rate hikes a potentially inconvenient outcome for a fed chair who wants to keep financial conditions tight and keep public expectations firmly focused on the inflation battle but powell has also been blunt about the tradeoff even if the central bank starts moving in half point or quarter point steps the policy rate is heading higher towards a still undefined appropriately restrictive stopping point and officials intend to leave it there for some time fed officials from san francisco fed president mary daly to st louis fed president james bullard often at opposite ends of recent policy debates have both discussed rates possibly rising above 5 next year the last time the fed s policy rate rose above that point was june 2006 to july 2007 at the onset of the 2007 to 2009 financial crisis and recession when the federal funds rate crested at 5 25 if there is concern about crossing that line fed officials have not voiced it new york fed president and fomc vice chair john williams said recently he would expect a restrictive interest rate through at least next year inflation much too high powell in a lengthy conversation at the brookings institution this week sketched out what may indeed be a lengthy transition for the fed and the u s economy to a world of only slowly receding inflation high interest rates and potentially chronic worker shortages to lower the pace of price increases he said it was clear that energy needed to be sapped from a job market where the demand for workers remains far beyond the number of people ready to take jobs an imbalance lodged in u s demographics and immigration policy and amplified by the pandemic graphic unemployed to job openings embedded in the new summary of economic projections will be estimates of just how big a toll fed officials feel will be paid in terms of rising unemployment and slower growth as its policies begin to bite data released thursday showed the fed s preferred measure of inflation was 6 in october a drop from september s 6 3 rate and the lowest this year but still triple the fed s 2 target it will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining by any standard inflation remains much too high powell said employment data on friday will estimate payroll growth for november another important piece of information for policymakers who feel prices are unlikely to fall until job and wage growth slow the economy has been adding an average 407 000 jobs per month this year though the pace dipped under 290 000 from august through october and analysts expect a figure as low as 200 000 new jobs added for november it is still above the 183 000 added monthly in the decade before the pandemic graphic rates and inflation projections way off the mark fed projections have raced through the year to catch up with reality as of last december the median projection by officials was that their policy rate would end 2022 at just 0 9 with the preferred inflation measure falling to 2 6 an implicit bet that inflation would in part ease on its own the highest individual fed funds projection was just 1 1 they were off by a factor of four with the expected half point increase at the next meeting the policy rate will end the year in a range between 4 25 and 4 5 graphic the federal reserve s target interest rate powell this week acknowledged the difficulty forecasting in an environment still roiled by the pandemic and its after effects but there s also little choice as the central bank ends its headlong drive to frontload rate hikes to tighten borrowing and credit conditions the mechanism through which the fed tries to change the course of the economy and begins as powell described it to feel the way to a stopping point as of september the fed narrative still included a benign outcome of continued growth steady progress on inflation and an unemployment rate rising less than a percentage point to 4 4 at the end of next year from the current 3 7 what some have referred to as an immaculate disinflation coming at little cost to the real economy the fed funds rate was seen ending 2023 at 4 6 it will powell said need to be somewhat higher the upcoming projections will show that final destination perhaps coming into view and give a better assessment of the possible cost as well reporting by howard schneider editing by dan burns and andrea ricci by howard schneider

the senate judiciary subcommittee on competition policy antitrust and consumer rights discussed the potential pros and cons to a proposed merger between the two largest grocery store chains in the country maria tibbetts for tri state livestock news merger a conversation between senators grocery chain ceos an economist and more over a potential grocery store merger sounded eerily like discussions about meatpacker consolidation the senate subcommittee on competition policy antitrust and consumer rights hosted a hearing on a proposed merger between the nation s two largest grocery store chains albertsons and krogers on nov 29 2022 while the two chains are considered the largest in the actual grocery industry the kroger s ceo rodney mcmullen testified that his company is the fourth largest in total revenue behind wal mart amazon and costco he if the merger is allowed the company would remain at number four in size subcommittee chair senator amy klobuchar d minnesota who is a known advocate of anti trust efforts emphasized the importance of competition especially in an industry like the grocery business which is crucial to americans health and well being i think everyone knows competition policy is an important priority for me over the last decade the grocery industry has become increasingly consolidated with the top four chains now making up more than two thirds of all grocery sales she said the lack of competition translates to higher prices and lower quality she said yet this proposed merger worth over 24 billion combines the two largest grocery store chains in the country she added food prices have been rising for many reasons and too many americans are struggling to put affordable nutritious food on the table one third of grocery stores have closed in the last 25 years leaving ten percent of americans in areas that lack easy access to healthy food she said these and many other americans sometimes have to resort to gas stations fast food joints dollar stores or other options for their food needs this is not the same as a grocery store this has implications on our health and safety especially for the american children who don t have enough to eat she said senator mike lee r utah expressed serious concern over the merger as well both klobuchar and lee explained that in 2015 albertson s was approved by the federal trade commission to merge with safeway a caveat of the approved merger was that 168 stores would be sold nine months later the largest buyer went bankrupt albertsons bought back many stores klobuchar said albertsons bought back 29 stores at a fraction of the stores value the ftc official who signed off on that divestiture now runs the anti trust practice at the law firm representing kroger in it s purchase of albertsons said lee hollywood couldn t write a more cynical plot if it tried yet they assure us this is the merger that will make everything better they ve announced 2 8 in investments they ve promised a 4 billion payoff to their shareholders their press release hints at other motives like increased data collection advertising and a greater focus on esg the new environmental social and governance standards requiring greater oversight and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions do americans really need a grocery store that collects more of their personal information and push their woke agenda he said his utah constituents certainly don t lee complained that the two ceos had declined to provide substantive answers and promised that they would during the testimony mcmullen testified that times have changed and with them grocery buying habits when we discuss competition we look at where customers are shopping for food and eating our customers buy at wal mart restaurants costco trader joe s aldi dollar general and many other options he said every competitor i just named is non union he added his company operates on razor thin margins and the merger would give them the ability better compete the merger would give us the flexibility national footprint and digital capabilities to compete more effectively our commitment is fresh affordable food for everyone the kroger s ceo said our fundamental business model is built around lower prices to attract more customers he explained a variety of investments they planned to make including 500 million dollars in the albertson s stores 1 billion to secure union jobs and more he said they will not close any stores distribution centers or manufacturing facilities or lay off front line workers as the result of the merger senator lee questioned how the company would be held to its promises michael needler the ceo of a 100 store grocery store chain called fresh encounter inc and also the president of the national grocers association testified that consolidation has created difficulties for independent grocers even though he himself initiated a large purchase in his own company when i took over the leadership of our business i had about 25 stores we had margin pressures and eroding sales the only way to survive i decided was to scale up i took a big risk we doubled and tripled our business with the purchase of other struggling companies needler said he s not opposed to enterprising growth and he s agnostic about the proposed merger he is concerned about enforcement of competition laws however if guard rails are not in place competition and thus consumers could be harmed he said our view is this america s grocery sector is getting less competitive from increasing concentration and unchecked buyer power due to lack of enforcement of the robinson patman act on a daily basis dominant retail chains force suppliers to choose from a level playing field and discrimination against independent grocers who have no legal recourse needlers said that grocery power buyers entrenched their dominance in the pandemic era as supply chains broke down and inflation took hold in the early part of the pandemic independent grocers like me struggled to stock must have products meanwhile the largest national chains demanded on time complete orders by threatening suppliers with steep penalties he said as inflation increased wholesale prices to independent grocers were sometimes higher than those to other grocers in the midst of this disruption the news of kroger albertsons merger was not surprising to me it can be boiled down to two words buyer power needler explained that mega corporations like amazon engage in predatory pricing practices which forces discrimination against its competitors countless grocers have been put out of business in areas we now consider food deserts through successful predatory pricing campaigns he said let me say it again we re not afraid to compete against anyone no matter how big but what we do oppose is the lack of constraints on buyer power which thwarts our ability to compete on price he said the robinson patman act of 1936 meant to prohibit economic discrimination against independent businesses is not being enforced he said the law is meant to prohibit economic discrimination against independent businesses those laws are still on the books but the ftc and doj have not brought any case in over 20 years this failure is especially evident across rural american towns that have lost grocery stores it s time to dust off these tools protect the free market our food supply and the american consumer the rpa must be enforced or revived he said should the merger be approved congress and the ftc must learn from the failure of safeway and albertsons merger he said local operators should be allowed to buy divested assets he believes i don t see less competition going forward said the kroger s ceo it s easy for a customer to take a right turn or a left turn we will continue to invest in pricing we ll also invest in service and fresh product he said klobuchar expressed serious concern over mergers in general it is important for congress to start looking at these mergers and all this consolidation we are seeing in a bigger light and realize these are going to be bumping up against our consumers every single day and if we just say oh this is too hard or oh someone lobbied against this we are not going to be doing the job that those before us did whether it was changing the laws way back with democratic and republican support for clayton act or sherman act or work that was done with the at t breakup she said let this be a warning sign of what s to come if we keep burying our head in the sand

attorneys for the state of oregon are making their case to a federal judge today arguing that measure 114 s magazine ban and permit to purchase law should take effect on december 8th as scheduled in order to prevent unnecessary deaths from taking place ironically however if the goal of the ballot measure is to ensure that only those deemed worthy enough by the state or its political subdivisions to own a gun can do so then the law is already proving to be an utter failure advertisement as we ve been reporting for the past few weeks the narrow passage of measure 114 approved by just 50 7 of voters has led to a huge spike in the number of gun sales at the moment the oregon state police are so backlogged with background check requests on firearm transfers that they re automatically delaying all new requests and the oregon capital chronicle reports that it could take months to get through the checks that have already been submitted under federal law if a background check request isn t completed within three days dealers are allowed to proceed with the sale many firearm retailers choose not to take that route but faced with a crush of customers who fear their ability to purchase a firearm will be completely curtailed if measure 114 takes effect without the permit to purchase system in place some gun shops in oregon have made the decision to conclude the transaction if they haven t heard back from the state police within 72 hours the owner of a gun store in tigard who spoke to the capital chronicle on the condition of anonymity said he s no longer waiting for background check to clear he said he and some other gun shop owners he knows are completing all sales no matter the weapons sold unless oregon state police determine a customer has failed a background check within three business days he said he s sold about 500 firearms this way all the people releasing these firearms we re not happy about this but we don t have a choice the dealer said other gun shops are openly advertising the loophole to encourage sales j b firearms in beaverton announced on nov 20 in a popular gun blog that it would invoke what it called a nuclear option to speed up the process in the post on the northwest firearms message board the store encouraged customers to buy a weapon submit information for the background check and return three days later but before thursday dec 7 to pick up their purchases we also invite and encourage all other oregon federal firearms licensees to join us in adopting this policy the store said in its announcement if this state wants to take us down we believe we should go out with a bang not a whimper advertisement not every gun store owner the capital chronicle spoke with has invoked the nuclear option some say they re concerned about potential liability for proceeding with the sale while others say they re unsure when exactly the 72 hour window actually starts ray gunter owner of emerald valley armory in creswell said he s not selling firearms until someone passes a background check because doing otherwise might be illegal he echoed concerns from several other gun store proprietors that the policy might open them up to legal liability and license seizure but like the four other gun dealers interviewed for this story he expressed a deep frustration with the background check backlog at oregon state police its firearms instant check system unit received more than 48 000 requests for a background check between nov 9 and 22 according to the agency s data the surge has slashed its rate of ruling on a background check within three days from 84 between 2018 and nov 8 election day to 61 between election day and thanksgiving kennedy said oregon state police are now delaying all new requests for background checks starrett of the oregon firearms federation said he s not sure when the three day period technically begins when the gun dealer submits the background check or when state police notify the dealer that they ve started looking at it the latter case would narrow the rule s application to a smaller group of customers that confuses some gun shop owners and managers including gunter in creswell he said he s not taking advantage of the three day rule but might consider changing his policy if he had more clarity he said advertisement none of this would be happening were it not for measure 114 s passage the chaotic rollout of the gun control measures including the distinct possibility that all lawful commerce in firearms will have to be halted until the permit to purchase system is put in place has understandably caused a lot of oregonians to want to buy a gun while they still can not because they ll be prohibited under the new laws but because the new laws will make it impossible for any one to buy a gun at least until the system is set up after that measure 114 will just place incredible burdens on those who want to exercise their fundamental right to keep and bear arms along with unfunded mandates for law enforcement that will likely reduce the number of officers on patrol in many jurisdictions measure 114 was so ill conceived that we don t even have to wait for it to take effect to see the unintended consequences start to unfold a gun control measure that s led to tens of thousands of additional firearms being purchased a permitting system that s fueled so many gun sales thousands of guns are being sold before background checks have been completed and businesses that the backers of measure 114 swore wouldn t be impacted are now closing their doors for good or looking to relocate several gun stores have already announced they will close in the coming months including gunrunner arms in junction city on its website the store blamed uncertainty around measure 114 and the current backlog for its expected closure with the source of our income being outlawed we will not be able to stay open past the first of the year its website reads at the outdoorsman in ontario owner julie clark is turning away all customers seeking a new gun despite the financial risk of getting stuck with her inventory clark is considering transferring her stock across the border to idaho and setting up shop there at a big expense she said advertisement legal gun owners and federally licensed firearms retailers have already been harmed by measure 114 unlike violent criminals in the state the best thing that could happen at this point would be for one of the federal judges hearing the multiple challenges to grant an injunction barring enforcement while the law is being litigated that would restore some normalcy to gun sales in the state alleviate at least some of the uncertainty firearm retailers are facing and most importantly ensure that oregonians can still exercise their fundamental right to armed self defense

nearly nine months after a bipartisan group of u s house members sent a letter questioning the securities and exchange commission s investigation into cryptocurrencies including the failed ftx exchange the lawmakers are maintaining their position that the agency s approach to regulating crypto is deeply flawed in public comments since ftx s collapse last month the congressmen led by minnesota republican tom emmer have largely called ftx s demise a singular issue that deserves scrutiny they argue the episode only reinforces their point that the sec s regulation of cryptocurrencies is arbitrary and ineffective ftx co ceo ryan salame was a major campaign contributor to the congressional leadership fund the political action committee emmer controlled as the head of the house republican campaign arm in the 2022 election cycle u s rep ted budd a north carolina republican who also signed the letter also received substantial support from salame in his u s senate bid this year the members letter was dated march 16 and objected to the sec s enforcement division taking steps to collect information from crypto companies as the information collection wasn t publicly known to be related to any active investigation the role was better suited to other departments within the commission they wrote citing sources familiar with the situation the progressive news magazine the american prospect first reported that ftx was among those the sec was seeking information from the march letter was addressed to sec chairman gary gensler in addition to emmer and budd it was signed by florida democrat darren soto florida republican byron donalds ohio republican warren davidson new jersey democrat josh gottheimer massachusetts democrat jake auchincloss and new york democrat ritchie torres the members told gensler the sec may be overstepping its jurisdiction by tasking its enforcement division with seeking information from firms that so far are not regulated by the commission and that investigations could have violated the federal paperwork reduction act that requires federal agencies not overwhelm private entities according to the letter it appears there has been a recent trend towards employing the enforcement division s investigative functions to gather information from unregulated cryptocurrency and blockchain industry participants in a manner inconsistent with the commission s standards for initiating investigations the letter said after ftx which had been the third largest crypto exchange declared bankruptcy last month the letter s signers who made public statements condemned ftx ftx failed after founder sam bankman fried improperly used another business he founded the trading house alameda research to hold a large number of ftx s tokens ftx collapse only proves point members say but the central thesis of the march letter that the sec s scattershot enforcement of crypto firms was unpredictable and ineffective was bolstered by the ftx example members have said they denied that the letter sought to shield ftx from federal regulators soto said in a nov 26 series of tweets that he believed the sec should investigate ftx the march letter wasn t about ftx he said but the crypto industry writ large the letter sought clarity on sec positions regarding its document request authority for crypto firms in general he tweeted the letter was not specific to ftx didn t reference ftx nor did our office have any contact with ftx regarding the letter the letter did not stop or slow down any investigations into ftx rep soto also has not received any contributions for ftx a spokesperson for donalds said in a written statement he remains concerned with the sec s approach to regulating digital assets in the absence of congressional legislation and still questioned why the sec used its enforcement division for voluntary information requests the sec has openly engaged in regulation by enforcement with little guidance as to which assets are legally subject to the sec s jurisdiction the spokeperson added the congressman feels that this combination severely hampers the marketplace and is an unsustainable method of governance the spokesperson was adamant that donalds never attempted to influence any of the sec s ongoing investigations emmer said the ftx episode did not undermine the idea of decentralized cryptocurrencies but rather was a failure by bankman fried and federal enforcement ftx a centralized exchange ran counter to the idea of decentralization he said ftx s collapse is not a crypto failure emmer tweeted nov 22 it s a failure with garygensler and sam bankman fried decentralization is the point in a nov 13 tweet davidson also said the fallout showed the sec s enforcement approach was not working at this point it s hard to believe that secgov hasn t engaged in selective enforcement he posted on nov 13 they worked closely with the biggest entities like ftx for years while engaging in endless discovery requests clearly gensler perhaps the sec structure are not up to the task at hand aides to emmer davidson gottheimer and budd did not respond to messages seeking comment representatives for the sec did not respond to a message from states newsroom seeking comment a relatively new phenomenon there is little explicit in federal law about how cryptocurrencies should be monitored gensler has said that cryptocurrencies which can be traded like stocks should be regulated like securities of the nearly 10 000 tokens in the crypto market i believe the vast majority are securities he wrote to treasury secretary janet yellen in october offers and sales of these crypto security tokens are covered by the securities laws campaign cash four of the letter s signers received campaign contributions from people associated with ftx emmer raised 8 700 in his most recent reelection campaign from individuals who listed ftx or ftx us as their employer including 5 800 the maximum allowed by law from salame the co ceo according to federal election commission records emmer s reelection campaign raised a total of 1 9 million from individuals in the 2022 cycle emmer was also the head of house republicans campaign organization which was not subject to the same limits on campaign contributions as his own reelection and that group received 2 75 million from ftx employees according to data from open secrets a nonprofit that tracks campaign spending the bulk of that figure 2 million came from a single contribution salame made in september salame s political action committee american dream federal action also spent 517 000 on television advertising for budd s successful senate campaign salame was the sole funder of american dream federal action according to fec records bankman fried had his own political action committee protect our future which contributed to democratic candidates though it did not support anyone who signed the march letter bankman fried contributed 27 million of the 28 5 million the committee raised in the 2022 cycle according to fec records gottheimer received 11 600 from ftx employees in the 2022 cycle including the maximum 5 800 from bankman fried

down inflation the fed boss reaffirmed statements and suggestions from other central bank representatives in november that the central bank is well positioned to begin trimming the size of interest rate hikes as soon as this month on the other hand he also warned that the fed s monetary policy is likely to remain tight for the time being until there are clear signs that inflation is fading despite some promising developments we have a long way to go in restoring price stability powell said during his speech at the brookings institution he added that decisions related to monetary policy such as interest rate hikes and trimming the fed s bond holdings typically take time to make an impact thus it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down powell said the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting a less forceful interest rate hike this month marks an important shift in the fed s monetary policy after the central bank delivered four straight rate increases of 75 basis points bps to tame the 4 decade high inflation but consumer prices have dropped in the past months from 9 1 in june to 7 7 in october the stock market welcomed powell s comments with the dow jones industrial average djia gaining 2 18 while the tech weighted nasdaq composite rose 4 41 wednesday it could be that a pullback in crm shares could have been much deeper if powell s comments didn t help improve the overall risk sentiment evercore isi head of global policy krishna guha said the jump in stocks was partly a relief rally as investors were concerned that the central bank could take a max hawkish sledgehammer to the recent easing of financial conditions that overhang has now gone before powell s remarks markets had been pricing in around a 65 chance that the fed would slow the pace of its rate hikes to 50 bps in december according to data by cme group after the speech the possibility of a half point hike jumped to 77 hence a combination of the improving risk sentiment surrounding tech stocks and a pullback in crm stock could result in long term investors coming back to salesforce given the company s track record of high revenue growth moreover salesforce guided for 2023 operating cash flow growth of around 16 which could also help attract long term investors salesforce stock trades lower in pre open thursday after the company offered an outlook that reflects a weaker economic environment still improving risk sentiment could

the end of an era will play out at the arqana breeding stock sale which begins in deauville on saturday with the four day auction hosting the dispersal of stock from the head family s famed nursery haras du quesnay the farm which was sold in its entirety earlier this year had belonged to the heads since its acquisition by william the patriarch of the renowned racing family and his sons alec and peter in 1958 quesnay was home to some influential stallions over the subsequent decades including the likes of multiple champions lyphard highest honor and riverman as well as other significant names like anabaa and bering the stud has also produced a lengthy roll call of group 1 winners such as classic scorers astec riverqueen harbour ma biche silvermine and matiara along with the prix de l arc de triomphe victors bon mot and detroit however arguably the stud s most famous graduate falls into both categories the brilliant treve won six group 1s while under the care of trainer criquette head

really like her criquette head said of the le havre filly she s a may foal but she s well made has a very good temperament so she s easy to handle and she has perfect conformation it s difficult to compare her to her sisters as they re born in different years and are by different sires but she s very nice she s been very busy she s been out all day she s the last out of trevise who died foaling her she was a fantastic broodmare reflecting on the poignancy of the dispersal head said we re selling all our stock my brothers and sister don t want to carry on so everything has to go i ve had this problem before a long time ago when papa s friend roland de chambure died and we put everything on the market it s always sad it s sad to see things like that go we have some nice foals and mares so we ll see what the market is like it was strong in england so let s hope people have a little money to spend here last year s sale was topped by the 3 million us 3 393 044 rougir who was signed for by

good entries and there are some lovely looking horses here we re very lucky as well that european form and pedigrees are still very popular around the world in places like the usa australia and japan trade has proved strong across the earlier breeding stock sales at goffs and tattersalls particularly the latter s december sale which grossed a staggering 120 587 750gns 155 363 659 powell said that ensuring the more choice offerings ended up in the arqana catalog rather than elsewhere had taken a lot of work but noted the overall market strength as a positive for all parties there s been a bit of competition but competition is good he said we re not in racing not to compete i think it s healthy the market is strong and we believe a lot of people couldn t buy at those first two sales which

support us gearjunkie may earn a small commission from affiliate links in this article learn more you can t go wrong with a honda but if you re looking for something with classic character nothing says i m a badass with great taste like a vintage honda motorcycle ever since the legendary japanese firm started producing motorcycles back in 1949 honda has been at the forefront of two wheeled innovation the brand is responsible for the foundational styling of many of the modern motorcycles that we know and love but if modern plastics and ridiculously overpowered engines aren t your thing why not look for a vintage honda instead the difference between antique vintage retro before we take you on an odyssey through our favorite vintage honda motorcycles let s define what vintage actually means this word can get bandied about a little too liberally it all comes down to interpretation to a degree but in other industries there are fairly strict ground rules concerning what can bear a vintage label we re going to apply those rules and not just to be pedantic an item labeled antique by dictionary definition and according to customs laws for most national authorities has to be at least 100 years old that alone rules out a lot of motorcycles as of today there are no antique honda motorcycles in existence retro on the other hand is harder to define merriam webster has this to say concerning the word relating to reviving or being the styles and especially the fashions of the past fashionably nostalgic or old fashioned with that in mind something like honda s cb1100rs is what we d call retro it s something modern designed to look like it was old fashioned or from the past we re here for vintage honda motorcycles but vintage isn t exactly easy to define either the word comes from the anglo french vendange which is described as grapes picked during a season the modern english word can mean many things from describing an era denoting a length of time or indicating the age of something in terms of describing vintage motorcycles it should refer to a model that is at least 20 years old and that is recognizably attached to an era like a 70s honda or an 80s suzuki a motorcycle described as vintage should be of a certain age and not a modern representation a 1971 ducati scrambler is vintage while a new ducati scrambler is retro what makes a vintage honda special vintage hondas are great motorcycles to buy for a number of reasons they come in sensual curvy shapes produce a noticeably classic sound and most importantly they re pretty damn reliable even if you do encounter problems there s no shortage of spare parts aftermarket solutions and instructional literature to overcome the issue of course there s also the fact that honda has literally built millions of motorcycles even its most sought after models are readily available and for reasonable prices too 10 vintage honda motorcycles you should own a good old honda might be exactly what you need if you like your motorcycles to feel more analog than digital armed with plenty of soulful character and dressed in the charismatic finery of yesteryear these classics also have more than enough performance and power to wrestle with modern traffic and put a smile on your face below are 10 legendary hondas to get you started fire up ebay ignore your bank balance and find yourself one of these vintage motorcycles for sale honda nt650 hawk gt the honda hawk is a cult bike requiring no introduction it was first launched in 1988 and only managed to survive for 3 years until it was axed in 1991 on the surface it doesn t have the same romance as a late 60s or 70s honda but it has a different brand of quality giving it cult status the hawk was affordable utilitarian and above all an absolute blast to ride it might not look like it but the honda nt650 hawk gt is a blinder of a motorcycle and makes for a popular track day motorcycle these days equipped with a rock steady 647cc four stroke v twin engine the hawk could produce a claimed 58 horsepower and a tidy 31 pound feet of peak torque at the rear wheel honda also gave the hawk a few cool features including an aluminum box frame a separate bolt on rear subframe and a single sided swingarm it became one of the first modern naked street bikes to go on sale it may not be the first motorcycle to spring to mind when you think of vintage honda motorcycles but if you see one up for sale in good condition don t hesitate you can forgive the high mileage on these bikes and if you grab one at the right price you will not regret the purchase they are by no means exotic but there s a good reason why riders hold them in such high esteem they re brilliant at whatever task you set them to honda vf1000r first introduced in the states in 1985 a full year after it made a splash in europe the honda vf1000r might not have been as fast as the kawasaki gpz900r or as maneuverable as the yamaha fj1100 but it came with head turning good looks bucket loads of torque and the honda seal of approval this classic v4 is often overlooked by buyers searching for iconic vintage honda motorcycles admittedly it s not as good as its more touring savvy vf1000f interceptor stablemate but what it lacks in out and out power it makes up for in comfort not all riders will feel comfortable on the vf1000r it s a real pain to steer and turning is a workout if you can lean it into a fast corner without fearing for your life you re obviously superhuman cornering aside for straight line stability at speed no other bikes in the vf1000r s class could come close the vf1000r was capable of reaching top speeds of around 149 mph and its beefy 998cc dohc liquid cooled 90 degree v4 engine could produce an admirable 117 horsepower at 10 000 rpm and 63 7 pound feet of torque at 8 000 rpm that s quite impressive considering it boasted an overall wet weight of 610 pounds yep that makes it a full 50 pounds lighter than the kawasaki gpz900r the vf1000r needs to go fast and go straight which makes it great for highway riding but not ideal if you want to cruise around town honda cx500 honda s cx series lasted from 1978 to 1983 though it might not have enjoyed the longest lifespan the cx500 is still very much alive and kicking on the modern custom scene it has emerged as an unusual and sought after donor machine for all kinds of customization and for very good reason on the surface the cx500 was capable of reaching top speeds of around 149 mph it s a water cooled shaft driven v twin motorcycle wrapped in an unusual and unattractive frame that s what s on the surface in truth the cx500 is incredibly reliable laughably low maintenance and an absolute blast to ride and it doesn t come with the collector s value like old school cbs making the cx500 a very attractive prospect for those searching for an affordable old honda bike the cx500 was powered by a 497cc water cooled longitudinal ohv 80 degree v twin engine similar to the configuration used by moto guzzi good for 48 horsepower unless we re talking about the beastly turbo variant that reportedly increased the power output to a gigantic 82 horsepower either way the cx500 came with a number of interesting features like dual cv carburetors to reduce emissions and a unique electric start system modular rims meant the cx500 was the first production motorcycle to sport tubeless tires of course it also came with honda s world famous reliability and durability as well as an affordable price tag as far as vintage honda motorcycles go it s an oddball but one that will serve you well in any of its six existing 500cc variants honda xl250 some of the best vintage honda motorcycles are their off road offerings they don t come with the same romance level that older road bikes do but honda s off road machinery from the golden age of enduro racing has enormous collector appeal and they re great fun to ride too the xl250 is one of the most easily recognizable honda dirt bikes it came with a four stroke 250cc engine manufactured from 1972 all the way up to 1987 in fact it was the first mass produced four valve motorcycle and the first modern four stroke enduro motorcycle that helped pave the way for the enduro wave that swept the globe after the model s introduction thanks to its dual sport nature this street legal dirt bike became an incredibly popular choice for riders wanting to experience the thrill of riding roads without sacrificing the exploratory nature of a dirt bike the honda xl250 came with a powerful 250cc four stroke engine that could produce 24 horses at the wheel and 16 85 pound feet of torque making quite a potent package for the time the engine was tucked into an insanely narrow chassis only 12 inches at its widest point minus the handlebars of course in total this dirt bike weighed in at a svelte 288 pounds thanks to its peppy engine streamlined chassis and light weight it was a very attractive ride for budding enduro riders unfortunately the xl series was dropped and replaced with the less inspiring nx models honda saw the error of its ways and eventually introduced the xr series which was heavily inspired by the xls but came without the charm honda gl1000 gold wing the honda goldwing is one of the most recognizable motorcycles ever made it s big brash and swollen in every sense but it wasn t always such an overweight monster when the original gl1000 gold wing first rolled onto the scene in 1974 it was in a much more user friendly configuration unveiled at the cologne motorcycle show the gold wing became the blueprint for road touring models eventually evolving into the hulking behemoths that command legions of loyal fans all over the world if you prefer your motorcycles with less heft then the original first generation gl1000 should be your classic honda of choice the heart of the legendary gl1000 is an iconic liquid cooled flat four sohc 998cc engine this special engine boasts a gear driven generator that contra rotates to offset the engine s powerful torque reaction mated to a shaft driven transmission the original gold wing came with an electric starter as well as a reserve kick start option courtesy of a removable kick start lever that could be stored in the bike s dummy gas tank the real gas tank was located under the seat to help improve the bike s center of gravity after all it was a heavy lump weighing in dry at 584 pounds despite the weight the 80 horsepower and 63 pound feet of torque were a success honda sold over 13 000 units in the u s in its debut year making it one of the most successful vintage honda motorcycles ever made honda sport 90 this old honda goes by several names the super 90 s90 or sport 90 it s an instantly recognizable classic that first appeared in 1964 and was produced until 1969 though larger engine models and a number of variants continued being manufactured until long after the s90 was the fastest model in honda s 90cc line up making it a far superior sporty alternative to the ct90 cl90 cd90 and the classic c90 despite that they all shared the same engine though the engine might be the same the riding style and overall shape were remarkably different the s90 was built for speed unlike the rest of the 90cc range the engine is a 90cc air cooled sohc unit with a manual four speed transmission that can be operated with a clutch unlike the semi automatic c90 derivatives according to honda the s90 has a claimed top speed of 64 mph though it is questionable if anyone ever achieved that with a stock 8 horsepower s90 even so the s90 was faster than the rest thanks to its lightweight frame design it featured a pressed steel one piece frame instead of a conventional tubular steel arrangement coupled with narrow handlebars and a slim profile along with the small but potent engine you ve got a recipe for success the s90 is one of many similar sport variants that honda produced but it s arguably one of the most famous honda cmx250 rebel the honda rebel might have enjoyed a much needed update but for the vast majority of its life the humble rebel remained largely unchanged the original cmx250 arrived on the scene back in 1985 and was an obvious game changer from day one using big cruiser styling but powered by a laid back and nonaggressive 250cc engine honda used the rebel to attract an entirely new generation of riders onto two wheels america s youth saw the appeal of a powerful looking cost effective entry level motorcycle that didn t come with intimidating performance specs or any alienating jargon and subculture in essence the modern beginner friendly motorcycle was born and nothing has ever really replaced it since so what made it so special apart from its obvious cruiser inspired aesthetic the rebel cmx250 packed a bulletproof 234cc air cooled parallel twin engine it produced a respectable 16 horsepower and 12 pound feet of torque that roughly translates to a basic no nonsense motorcycle that can hit a top speed of 70 mph if you really push it and you re probably not going to die in the process the engine was mated to a user friendly five speed transmission which was simple and easy to operate that made it ideal for learners it s still an msf learner bike of choice though it s not a style icon the rebel is small durable reliable and fun enough and as an integral part of honda s lineup it s a classic whether you class it as one or not honda cr125m elsinore the early 70s brought a whole new discipline to the world of motorcycling motocross trail riding enduro racing off roading you name it it was happening motorcycles had evolved into more than a simple mode of transport and were fast becoming recreational vehicles and thanks to movies like on any sunday everyone wanted in on the action honda wanted to join the party too unfortunately the best motocross bikes of the day were small displacement two stroke machines and honda had no experience in engineering two stroke motors however they put their heads down and worked on a two stroke of their own the result was a 250cc that was eventually scaled down refined and unleashed on the american public the 1974 cr125m elsinore had arrived the new 125cc version had a bore and stroke of 56mm x 50mm and came with a cool two ring aluminum piston etched ever so slightly to retain oil the engine cases were made from magnesium alloy which helped keep the overall weight down the elsinore s frame was also made from chrome moly tubing for further weight savings and the body was plastic when all was said and done the elsinore could produce a peak power output of just under 17 horsepower and hit speeds up to 60 mph it was fast powerful and incredibly maneuverable thanks to the showa suspension system s exceptional travel and guess what small scramblers are back in fashion making the elsinore one of the most sought after vintage honda motorcycles today honda cb750 the world s first superbike had to make this list for many this isn t just one of the most important vintage honda motorcycles it s one of the most important motorcycles ever the cb750 arrived in 1969 after honda guessed that a large capacity motorcycle modeled on their already successful cb450 unit would be a hit there were plenty of reasons for the world to be excited about the cb750 it would become the first commercially available modern four cylinder motorcycle from a major manufacturer the cb came with more modern features than the public was used to including an electric start flashing turn signals advanced brakes and more and it performed far better than anyone could have dreamed trouncing any competition from europe the engine was a fearsome 736cc air cooled inline four producing 68 horses at 8 500 rpm 44 pound feet at 7 000 rpm and could hit top speeds of 125 mph the specs were mind blowing but the secret to the cb750 s success came down to its user friendliness it wasn t hard to ride everything worked and it was comfortable of course it also looked exceptionally good and was relatively affordable many consider the cb750 to be one of the greatest motorcycles ever made and a fine example of what a vintage honda should be normally that would be enough to catapult it into the number one slot but there s another honda out there that has never gone out of fashion and never failed to impress us honda super cub the greatest motorcycle platform ever made is easily the honda super cub manufactured with displacements ranging from the original 49cc to the more advanced 125cc the honda super cub is responsible for more riders getting on two wheels than any other motorcycle in the world it s the bestselling motorcycle of all time many historians liken the little cub to the ford model t volkswagen beetle or jeep calling it an icon of the 20th century and a design landmark and they re correct the little honda super cub is nothing short of exceptional as far as vintage honda motorcycles go this is the one you want in your garage it looks cool and is always fashionable in a nuclear zombie apocalypse this is the most reliable and indestructible mode of transport at your disposal the original super cub rolled onto the scene in 1958 it came equipped with an air cooled four stroke single cylinder 49cc engine producing 4 5 horsepower at 9 500 rpm and enough torque to carry a water buffalo it reached speeds up to 43 mph if you re going downhill with the wind behind you you could kickstart the cub without putting in much effort changing gear was a clutchless affair with a semi automatic three speed gearbox making it so simple to ride it literally took the terror out of motorcycling the super cub spawned more than six variants all told more than 100 million were produced and sure for many the lowly cub isn t motorcycle y enough to get top honors but in our opinion this little bike turned more people on to two wheels than any other it might not have the status of a bike made by the harley davidson motor company or the feisty continental nature of an old ducati but there s no doubt the honda cub is one of the most important honda motorcycles ever made enjoy these vintage honda motorcycles for years to come plenty of other models could have made this list what about the plucky honda dream or the celebrated africa twin or even the lesser celebrated cafe racer inspired gb500 there are loads of options that could be counted as the best vintage or classic models these 10 are our favorites if you purchase one rest assured they aren t going to go out of style
