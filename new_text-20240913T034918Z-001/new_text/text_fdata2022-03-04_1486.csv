it s difficult to make predictions especially about the future american baseball legend yogi berra once quipped when it comes to predicting where the australian economy is heading the task is made even trickier in the face of war in europe and uncertainty about the global energy and other markets this week there was some good news australia s economic growth gdp bounced back strongly in the last quarter of 2021 up 3 4 according to australian bureau of statistics figures this was a turnaround from the 1 9 decline in gdp in the september quarter australian quarterly gross domestic product it is often noted however that gdp is an imperfect measure it doesn t capture things such as unpaid work it is also backward looking the figures tell us what happened at the end of last year at a time when what we would really like to know is what is going to happen this year and beyond that said they provide useful clues splurge based recovery the 3 4 growth was generated almost entirely by consumer spending 3 2 percentage points with the rest due to changes in inventories and trade government spending made no contribution investment both private and public was actually a drag knocking 0 3 and 0 1 percentage points off growth this isn t all that surprising after months of lockdowns in much of australia people wanted to spend in the september quarter household savings soared to 19 8 of income in the december quarter they fell to 13 6 as people splurged on things they couldn t spend on while they had been locked down household final consumption expenditure spending on accommodation and food services jumped 26 1 personal and other services such as haircuts and beauty treatments grew 15 4 air transport expenditure rose a massive 56 5 though as economists say it was was strong growth off a low base in other words many people couldn t get a haircut or go to a restaurant or fly in the third quarter of 2021 in the fourth quarter they could and did this is reinforced by the fact the strongest ouput growth 6 7 was in new south wales where the lockdown arguably bit the most mid year state final demand december quarter of course omicron hit hard in mid december but too late to have a big impact on the quarterly figures we will see more of omicron s impact in the numbers for the march quarter due to be released after the may election on the plus side households still have a large stock of savings compared with pre pandemic levels the 424 billion consumer war chest treasurer josh frydenberg has rightly been talking up puts us in a good position to spend building a sustained recovery household saving ratio can australia s spending led recovery continue in 2022 perhaps but there are reasons to be concerned the mechanical point is that the gdp figures for the december quarter are only impressive when you fail to remember they were bouncing back from a decline of 1 9 in the september quarter so called negative growth read more wednesday s gdp numbers are impressive but they are for the december quarter when we were bouncing back from delta a less mechanical concern is that the world is now awash with uncertainty the largest european conflict since the second world war threatens to upend everything from peace and security to global supply chains and financial markets the reserve bank governor referred to a major new source of uncertainty after his board meeting on tuesday domestically we still don t know whether inflation is just returning to regular programming or getting away from us what s ahead like many economists i favour the former interpretation anyone who tells you they know for sure is delusional aggressive wages claims if successful could be the genesis of a wage price spiral sending inflation systemically higher but we don t know the reserve bank is going to raise interest rates sooner rather than later it could be mid year or delayed many months but eventually rates will climb to align with the so called neutral rate of interest the level that keeps the economy on an even keel with unemployment low and inflation stable read more why there s no magic jobless rate to increase australians wages there is considerable uncertainty about what that rate is in the 1990s and early 2000s the reserve bank thought it was between 3 and 4 now it s hard to dispute it is lower but not as low as 0 1 where rates are now either way it suggests meaningful rate rises are coming all of these factors will feed into future rate rises which will dent spending by australia s highly leveraged households in short getting sustainable gdp growth back to the 3 plus it used to be will require more than just a consumer spending binge it will require the hard work of productivity growth the budget looms in 2021 for the first time the federal budget set out four years of forecasts instead of two years of forecasts and two years of projections it has an important implication it means this year s budget will need to take a more formal and rigorous view about the next four years in particular about the international environment in which australia sits the budget is due in less than four weeks the big question is what will be needed to drive the economy in the years ahead it will require more than a rebound in restaurant meals and haircuts
ukraine s transmission system operator gtsou said thursday natural gas exports from the country would be halted to conserve domestic supplies as fighting with russia raged on casting another specter over europe s energy markets the decision does not impact international transit meaning russian gas supplies moving through ukraine toward europe would be allowed to continue market participants were instructed not to export gas from ukraine s territory including from storage inventories starting with the march 4 friday gas day the move was not expected to have an impact on european supplies as volumes from ukraine are not a significant gas source for the continent more uncertainty the emergency declaration however created yet another element of uncertainty for a global gas market fixated on the war in ukraine the conflict continued to pose risks for european supplies especially if russian energy exports are sanctioned or key ukrainian infrastructure is damaged gtsou said thursday a pipeline in the luhansk region was damaged forcing staff to cut off flows the operator said it would resume operations as soon as possible but stressed fighting was occurring in the area gtsou also said wednesday an air strike damaged two strings of gas line in the kharkiv region the operator s administrative buildings were also hit by artillery shelling on wednesday and the ukraininan energy exchange was reportedly hit by a bomb on thursday the hostilities haven t impacted major transit lines but gtsou said it had been forced to shut down 14 gas distribution systems across the country russia s aggression against ukraine has led to extraordinary and unprecedented conditions and restrictions when all energy companies must focus on maintaining the natural gas supply for ukraine and ukrainians gtsou said thursday after it halted exports amid a glut of natural gas two years ago european traders took advantage of ukraine s vast storage capacity to ensure inventories on the rest of the continent did not overfill and send prices spiraling ukraine has the largest gas storage capacity in europe with space for nearly 31 billion cubic meters the country also imports natural gas from europe via reverse flows as it has looked to cut its dependency on russian gas in recent years gas analytics head tom marzec manser of independent commodity intelligence services said ukraine s decision to halt exports isn t likely to have a material impact on european supplies traders he told ngi have not recently been using ukrainian storage volumes to move gas back toward the european union eu europe relies on russia for about one third of its gas supplies and a portion of that gas moves through ukraine russian spot deliveries to the continent have been weak in recent months particularly through ukraine but ramped up with the start of fighting it s true that significant storage stocks in the country were used by european traders however most of these stocks have already been used either as exports to europe or more likely used locally in the ukrainian market itself wood mackenzie analyst graham freedman told ngi ukraine storage reserves are currently very close to the five year average so i suspect that the amount of gas held by european traders in ukraine is negligible low gas inventories according to ngi data ukrainian storage inventories were at 17 of capacity this week freedman said ukraine has been importing gas from europe since the beginning of february but the country is not likely in a position to export any volumes to europe until this summer european inventories are short themselves which has cast a light on the continent s dependence on russia for supplies that s prompted other countries such as the united states to step up liquefied natural gas deliveries to europe as prices have jumped sharply and attracted more cargoes since late last year while russian flows to europe have been strong since the attack began last week the market has largely ignored everything but the war s ongoing threat to supplies or the possibility of additional sanctions that could upend the energy market further russia s invasion of ukraine continues to overshadow all other drivers across the european energy complex schneider electric analyst rauhan nazir said in a note to clients thursday risks around russian gas exports to eu markets continue to provide strong upside potential for forward gas and power prices with gas flows risk of more direct sanctions and negotiations on a possible ceasefire remaining the top drivers to watch volatility continued on thursday the title transfer facility followed brent crude lower and broke a two day rally there were wild swings however during trading as the prompt ttf contract hit a record intraday high of nearly 200 euros mwh or roughly 65 mmbtu the contract ultimately went on to shed about 2 to finish near 52 another volatile stretch was likely friday russia was said to have taken control of kherson in the south of ukraine and was reportedly gaining ground in other parts of the region as attacks intensified russian president vladimir putin also reportedly told french president emmanuel macron in a phone call that russia would achieve its goal in ukraine no matter what meanwhile another round of talks between russia and ukraine achieved little progress thursday

the fallout from tit for tat aviation sanctions over russia s invasion of ukraine is starting to have an impact on the air cargo and airline sectors with russian airspace now off limits to most western carriers finnair said thursday it is considering additional furloughs of up to 90 days after having to reduce flight activity because its aircraft can no longer land in or overfly russia from 90 to 200 pilots and 150 to 450 cabin crew employees could be impacted starting in april final determinations depend on how the situation unfolds and what substitute measures can be implemented employees working at finnair stations in other nations could also face temporary layoffs i think this persists vladimir putin can t start this and not finish it you re going to see a sustained period of higher fuel prices and lower economic growth around the world because of that so we re expecting some pretty rough headwinds for airlines everywhere because the consumer is going to get hit in the pocketbook and they ll have less money to spend on discretionary flying said george ferguson senior airline and aerospace analyst at bloomberg intelligence in an interview russia barred finnish aircraft from its airspace until may 28 after the country along with other nordic and baltic countries canada the european union the united kingdom and the united states blocked russian aircraft from their airports or airspace finnair has canceled all flights to russia and flights to china and south korea until sunday with russian airspace closed there will be fewer flights by finnair and unfortunately less work available for our employees said chief operations officer jaakko schildt in a statement a large share of our staff has been on long furloughs during the pandemic so the need for further furloughs feels especially harsh and we are sorry for this after initially canceling flights to tokyo on tuesday finnair said it will resume operations four times per week from helsinki as of next wednesday because japan is one of its most important markets japan is also an important cargo market and air connections are needed to keep cargo moving said chief commercial officer ole orvér passenger and cargo traffic between asia and europe plays an important role in finnair s network before the pandemic more than half of finnair s revenue came from this market many asian countries have restricted travel since the covid outbreak but finnair has operated many of its asian routes supported by the strong cargo demand the company even removed seats from an airbus a350 to create space for light cargo in the cabin detouring around russia can add about two hours for all cargo carriers connecting asia and europe but the location of finland and sweden adds considerably more time for finnair than with direct routes over russia between helsinki and tokyo flying around adds five hours of time according to eurocontrol for finnair more circuitous routes can add several hours to the flight time and higher prices for jet fuel combined with the longer routing makes it difficult to break even the russia ukraine war has pushed the price of jet fuel past 111 per barrel up 4 from a month ago and 57 from a year ago according to the latest data friday from the international air transport association finnair continues to fly to bangkok and phuket thailand delhi and singapore with a longer routing that avoids russian airspace thailand is also served from stockholm officials say they are evaluating an alternative network plan for china and south korea in case the russian airspace closure is prolonged united airlines nasdaq ual is temporarily suspending routes to delhi and mumbai india from newark new jersey and other u s hubs until it can devise viable alternative routes according to the points guy website american airlines nasdaq aal also competes on the new york delhi route but has never crossed russian airspace instead its planes refuel in bangor maine whether united is considering a similar option is not known the closure of the russian and ukrainian passenger markets represents less than 2 of lufthansa s dxe lha summer capacity and only a small portion of passenger flights to china korea and japan will have to detour ceo carsten spohr told analysts on an earnings call thursday drag on cargo the aviation sanctions are negatively impacting air cargo capacity which is still struggling to catch up from pandemic related cutbacks by passenger airlines that provide ride along space for goods in several ways the use of less direct flights means aircraft may have to carry more fuel which reduces the available payload weight for cargo spohr however said it makes more sense for a cargo aircraft to make an intermediate stop for fuel than to leave cargo behind the cancellation of passenger flights eliminates belly space for freight and volga dnepr a major russian cargo airline operator is no longer available for hire by western companies freight rates from frankfurt to china are rising according to the freightos index on sonar volga dnepr operates a fleet of super size freighters with ramps that can accommodate unusual types of cargo such as subway cars as well as large shipments of general cargo its airbridgecargo subsidiary has 17 boeing 747 jumbo jet freighters and a 777 that now can t fly to three dozen countries new european union and u s export controls for dual use technology will prevent the company from getting parts and maintenance support needed to keep the planes airworthy plus sanctions cutting russian banks from the swift international messaging system will make it difficult for customers around the world to make payments for charter flights or partial loads effectively removing the airline group from the market ait worldwide a chicago based third party logistics provider deactivated russian based carriers in its system on friday days before the u s airspace ban greg weigel chief business officer at ait worldwide told freightwaves in an email ukraine based antonov airlines is operating a few of its giant an 124 freighters the same type in volga dnepr airlines s fleet outside the war zone other aircraft in its fleet are trapped in kyiv air cargo trucking services might also be affected ukrainians formed a large part of the trucking force in europe and many have decided to go back to their home country said niall van de wouw managing director of clive data services an air cargo benchmarking and analytics firm experts say the sanctions will eventually grind down russia s commercial air fleet which is heavily weighted toward boeing and airbus boeing said it is suspending parts maintenance and technical support for russian airlines and stopped operations at its moscow training center in response to the invasion of ukraine and airbus followed suit wednesday saying it would stop support to companies such as aeroflot skynews in london reported lufthansa will not only feel the impact of lost revenue from flight cancellations and higher fuel prices but also the loss of maintenance services performed by lufthansa technik for russian airlines spohr said some of the extra cost to reroute around russia will be offset by not having to pay overflight fees to cross siberia a russian airspace retaliation against the u s would force airlines such as atlas air nasdaq aaww fedex nyse fdx and ups nyse ups to take a more southerly route for trans pacific destinations adding 30 to 45 minutes per flight neel jones shah global head of airfreight at flexport a logistics company said although airfreight demand and rates out of asia have softened because covid crackdowns in china have temporarily slowed factory production freight forwarders say rates are quickly climbing again because of flight cancellations and fears they could last with jet fuel prices at their highest level since 2015 many airlines were already adding fuel surcharges to their cargo invoices before the outbreak of hostilities the freightos air index shows china europe rates climbed more than 80 last week to 11 36 per kilogram meanwhile a few carriers are starting to introduce a war surcharge according to european 3pls dsv and hellman worldwide logistics some airlines are considering whether to implement a war surcharge on freight shipments weigel said most logistics specialists contacted by freightwaves said they have yet to see the fees and bloomberg s ferguson said cargo airlines are more likely to just roll it into the rate because they have pricing power related news biden bans

investors were spooked by the government s plan to share certain covid treatment technologies with international health organizations what happened thursday was not generally a memorable day for coronavirus stocks and not only because the pandemic seems to be receding a pronouncement by federal government officials pushed down the prices of the most prominent ones including moderna mrna 1 22 and germany s biontech bntx 1 63 the share prices of the two lost over 4 and slightly more than 3 respectively on the day so what in remarks quoted widely by the media thursday morning dr anthony fauci said that certain technologies currently being developed by the government s national institutes of health nih will be licensed to the world health organization who and the united nations affiliated medicines patent pool those two organizations will be able to utilize the technologies to help develop vaccines and drugs that combat covid fauci is the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and in many ways is the face of the government s pandemic response the precise technologies that would be transferred under this plan have not yet been finalized according to fauci it doesn t seem as if the scheme will include the processes and technologies devised by private healthcare companies like moderna and biontech both of which have developed alone or in partnership coronavirus vaccines currently in widespread use an article on the matter published in the washington post cited three people familiar with the matter stressing that only federal resources would be utilized now what investors might not have bought the assertion that no technologies used by private companies will be transferred under the plan the government s efforts and those of for profit enterprises have merged at times this is particularly the case with moderna which harnessed nih developed technology to devise its mrna based vaccine through its words and actions it s clear that the u s government recognizes the value of the contribution that such companies made so it s likely to take pains to keep hands off the most sensitive private sector vaccine and drug technology as such this negative knee jerk reaction by moderna and biontech shareholders feels unjustified

shalanda young acting office of management and budget director speaks during a senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee confirmation hearing in washington d c on february 1 al drago bloomberg getty images the white house has asked lawmakers to approve 10 billion in lethal and humanitarian aid for ukraine as part of a 32 5 billion emergency funding request sent to capitol hill as russia continues its advance on ukraine the request follows weeks of discussions between white house officials and lawmaker about the shape of any potential emergency request which was expected to focus heavily on covid 19 needs but the escalating russian invasion has dramatically increased the size of the request for ukraine specifically lawmakers are in the midst of negotiations over a long term funding deal and face a march 11 deadline to reach an agreement the ukraine funds are expected to be attached to any final deal but the process remains fluid this request identifies an immediate need for 10 0 billion in additional humanitarian security and economic assistance for ukraine and central european partners due to russia s unjustified and unprovoked invasion the formal request sent wednesday from acting office of management and budget director shalanda young to congressional leadership says young suggested the initial 10 billion request for ukraine would address immediate needs and more funding could be needed given the rapidly evolving situation in ukraine i anticipate that additional needs may arise over time this funding request is based on the administration s best information on resource requirements at this time and we will remain in touch with the congress in the coming weeks and months as we assess resource requirements beyond these immediate needs she said more on the funding request the detailed request provides 4 8 billion to the department of defense including 1 8 billion for support in the region as us military units support the us european command and nato response force 1 3 billion for cybersecurity and other defense support and 1 8 billion for replenishment of dod stocks it also calls for 5 billion for the department of state and us agency for international development usaid including 2 8 billion in humanitarian assistance like food and other support 500 million in military assistance through the foreign military financing program and 1 8 billion in economic assistance to help support continuity of government and the resilience of the ukrainian people as well as emergent needs in the region the request also provides 21 million for the department of commerce to bolster export controls 30 million for the department of energy to provide technical assistance for electric grid integration 59 million for the department of justice to support a newly announced task force kleptocapture to enforce sanctions on russia and other funding for the multinational task force and 91 million for the department of treasury for sanctions support and irs criminal investigations among other expenditures
it s difficult to make predictions especially about the future american baseball legend yogi berra once quipped when it comes to predicting where the australian economy is heading the task is made even trickier in the face of war in europe and uncertainty about the global energy and other markets this week there was some good news australia s economic growth gdp bounced back strongly in the last quarter of 2021 up 3 4 according to australian bureau of statistics figures this was a turnaround from the 1 9 decline in gdp in the september quarter australian quarterly gross domestic product it is often noted however that gdp is an imperfect measure it doesn t capture things such as unpaid work it is also backward looking the figures tell us what happened at the end of last year at a time when what we would really like to know is what is going to happen this year and beyond that said they provide useful clues splurge based recovery the 3 4 growth was generated almost entirely by consumer spending 3 2 percentage points with the rest due to changes in inventories and trade government spending made no contribution investment both private and public was actually a drag knocking 0 3 and 0 1 percentage points off growth this isn t all that surprising after months of lockdowns in much of australia people wanted to spend in the september quarter household savings soared to 19 8 of income in the december quarter they fell to 13 6 as people splurged on things they couldn t spend on while they had been locked down household final consumption expenditure spending on accommodation and food services jumped 26 1 personal and other services such as haircuts and beauty treatments grew 15 4 air transport expenditure rose a massive 56 5 though as economists say it was was strong growth off a low base in other words many people couldn t get a haircut or go to a restaurant or fly in the third quarter of 2021 in the fourth quarter they could and did this is reinforced by the fact the strongest ouput growth 6 7 was in new south wales where the lockdown arguably bit the most mid year state final demand december quarter of course omicron hit hard in mid december but too late to have a big impact on the quarterly figures we will see more of omicron s impact in the numbers for the march quarter due to be released after the may election on the plus side households still have a large stock of savings compared with pre pandemic levels the 424 billion consumer war chest treasurer josh frydenberg has rightly been talking up puts us in a good position to spend building a sustained recovery household saving ratio can australia s spending led recovery continue in 2022 perhaps but there are reasons to be concerned the mechanical point is that the gdp figures for the december quarter are only impressive when you fail to remember they were bouncing back from a decline of 1 9 in the september quarter so called negative growth read more wednesday s gdp numbers are impressive but they are for the december quarter when we were bouncing back from delta a less mechanical concern is that the world is now awash with uncertainty the largest european conflict since the second world war threatens to upend everything from peace and security to global supply chains and financial markets the reserve bank governor referred to a major new source of uncertainty after his board meeting on tuesday domestically we still don t know whether inflation is just returning to regular programming or getting away from us what s ahead like many economists i favour the former interpretation anyone who tells you they know for sure is delusional aggressive wages claims if successful could be the genesis of a wage price spiral sending inflation systemically higher but we don t know the reserve bank is going to raise interest rates sooner rather than later it could be mid year or delayed many months but eventually rates will climb to align with the so called neutral rate of interest the level that keeps the economy on an even keel with unemployment low and inflation stable read more why there s no magic jobless rate to increase australians wages there is considerable uncertainty about what that rate is in the 1990s and early 2000s the reserve bank thought it was between 3 and 4 now it s hard to dispute it is lower but not as low as 0 1 where rates are now either way it suggests meaningful rate rises are coming all of these factors will feed into future rate rises which will dent spending by australia s highly leveraged households in short getting sustainable gdp growth back to the 3 plus it used to be will require more than just a consumer spending binge it will require the hard work of productivity growth the budget looms in 2021 for the first time the federal budget set out four years of forecasts instead of two years of forecasts and two years of projections it has an important implication it means this year s budget will need to take a more formal and rigorous view about the next four years in particular about the international environment in which australia sits the budget is due in less than four weeks the big question is what will be needed to drive the economy in the years ahead it will require more than a rebound in restaurant meals and haircuts author richard holden professor of economics unsw sydney
ukraine s transmission system operator gtsou said thursday natural gas exports from the country would be halted to conserve domestic supplies as fighting with russia raged on casting another specter over europe s energy markets the decision does not impact international transit meaning russian gas supplies moving through ukraine toward europe would be allowed to continue market participants were instructed not to export gas from ukraine s territory including from storage inventories starting with the march 4 friday gas day the move was not expected to have an impact on european supplies as volumes from ukraine are not a significant gas source for the continent more uncertainty the emergency declaration however created yet another element of uncertainty for a global gas market fixated on the war in ukraine the conflict continued to pose risks for european supplies especially if russian energy exports are sanctioned or key ukrainian infrastructure is damaged gtsou said thursday a pipeline in the luhansk region was damaged forcing staff to cut off flows the operator said it would resume operations as soon as possible but stressed fighting was occurring in the area gtsou also said wednesday an air strike damaged two strings of gas line in the kharkiv region the operator s administrative buildings were also hit by artillery shelling on wednesday and the ukraininan energy exchange was reportedly hit by a bomb on thursday the hostilities haven t impacted major transit lines but gtsou said it had been forced to shut down 14 gas distribution systems across the country russia s aggression against ukraine has led to extraordinary and unprecedented conditions and restrictions when all energy companies must focus on maintaining the natural gas supply for ukraine and ukrainians gtsou said thursday after it halted exports amid a glut of natural gas two years ago european traders took advantage of ukraine s vast storage capacity to ensure inventories on the rest of the continent did not overfill and send prices spiraling ukraine has the largest gas storage capacity in europe with space for nearly 31 billion cubic meters the country also imports natural gas from europe via reverse flows as it has looked to cut its dependency on russian gas in recent years gas analytics head tom marzec manser of independent commodity intelligence services said ukraine s decision to halt exports isn t likely to have a material impact on european supplies traders he told ngi have not recently been using ukrainian storage volumes to move gas back toward the european union eu europe relies on russia for about one third of its gas supplies and a portion of that gas moves through ukraine russian spot deliveries to the continent have been weak in recent months particularly through ukraine but ramped up with the start of fighting it s true that significant storage stocks in the country were used by european traders however most of these stocks have already been used either as exports to europe or more likely used locally in the ukrainian market itself wood mackenzie analyst graham freedman told ngi ukraine storage reserves are currently very close to the five year average so i suspect that the amount of gas held by european traders in ukraine is negligible low gas inventories according to ngi data ukrainian storage inventories were at 17 of capacity this week freedman said ukraine has been importing gas from europe since the beginning of february but the country is not likely in a position to export any volumes to europe until this summer european inventories are short themselves which has cast a light on the continent s dependence on russia for supplies that s prompted other countries such as the united states to step up liquefied natural gas deliveries to europe as prices have jumped sharply and attracted more cargoes since late last year while russian flows to europe have been strong since the attack began last week the market has largely ignored everything but the war s ongoing threat to supplies or the possibility of additional sanctions that could upend the energy market further russia s invasion of ukraine continues to overshadow all other drivers across the european energy complex schneider electric analyst rauhan nazir said in a note to clients thursday risks around russian gas exports to eu markets continue to provide strong upside potential for forward gas and power prices with gas flows risk of more direct sanctions and negotiations on a possible ceasefire remaining the top drivers to watch volatility continued on thursday the title transfer facility followed brent crude lower and broke a two day rally there were wild swings however during trading as the prompt ttf contract hit a record intraday high of nearly 200 euros mwh or roughly 65 mmbtu the contract ultimately went on to shed about 2 to finish near 52 another volatile stretch was likely friday russia was said to have taken control of kherson in the south of ukraine and was reportedly gaining ground in other parts of the region as attacks intensified russian president vladimir putin also reportedly told french president emmanuel macron in a phone call that russia would achieve its goal in ukraine no matter what meanwhile another round of talks between russia and ukraine achieved little progress thursday
rep mike waltz r fl said stinger missiles from the united states did not start arriving in ukraine until a week ago when russia invaded ukraine despite ukraine asking for them months ago the stingers didn t start arriving until about a week ago they should have had them they should have had them on day one those things should have been shooting up from kharkiv from kyiv from the border he told breitbart news in an exclusive interview on wednesday waltz said the ukrainians he met with in december while in the country were incredibly frustrated that they were not receiving the air defense systems as russian troops were building up at the border the ukrainians that i met with were incredibly frustrated in december that they didn t they weren t getting what they asked for he said how much more effective would they be right now if they had more javelins more body armor more stingers a cnn report from november 23 said some in the biden administration were concerned that sending stingers would be seen by russia as a major escalation cnn then reported on january 10 that the biden administration had quietly authorized an additional 200 million in security assistance to ukraine that consisted of small arms and ammunition secure radios medical equipment spare parts and other equipment but no stingers a source told cnn that it was not a game changer and would not be enough to serve as a major impediment to a russian invasion and said the ukrainians have made clear to the u s that they want more security assistance beyond what the u s had already provided politico nightly reported on january 11 that the u s military services are wary of seeing their equipment shipped off to eastern europe after all replacing transferred stinger missiles and other material takes time thus leaving them with a temporary weapons gap the outlet reported waltz a green beret and member of the florida national guard met with ukrainians in december as he visited florida national guard troops deployed to ukraine to train ukrainian forces at the time he said some of those forces are back home and others are in poland waltz said he has lingering questions over the biden administration s most recent announcement of sending 350 million in military equipment to ukraine where did 350 million dollars come from why not 250 million why not 500 million why that number was that a needs based assessment if you look at the breakdown it s really not enough it s about enough to equip a battalion he said i don t think what we re providing is what the ukrainians need it s nowhere near what they need even if you start adding up the other allied contributions it s nowhere near he said he said he has been personally reassured by defense secretary lloyd austin that the latest tranche of aid is arriving in ukrainian s hands right now waltz who received a briefing from a senior u s defense official along with other lawmakers on wednesday said the war in ukraine is already turning into an insurgency the main thing you need is a demonstrated will to fight and zelensky has galvanized his population and the russians have made a strategic mistake in not being able to shut down the commercial internet every day that is on television the europeans have been shamed into doing more he said i think he has done far more than what biden has taken credit in terms of unifying nato galvanizing the world and unifying his own people he said he said the ukrainian military was already preparing for an insurgency as far back as december shifting from door kicking missions to guerrilla warfare he also said the russians are appearing to adjust their tactics too going from precision strikes meant to keep their infrastructure intact to siege warfare and leveling cities to break the will of the ukrainian people so i think this is going to grind into a protracted war and therefore logistics is what matters the most he said he said normally a soviet brigade will deploy with about three to four weeks of supplies so if the war goes beyond that russian president vladimir putin will have to shift russia s industrial base to support the war effort if the insurgency can cut off the logistics and supply lines which will be very vulnerable in spring because it ll be totally confined to the roads then that s how they ll have a fighting chance he said logistics is what wins wars he said he is hearing that part of the reason the russian military has not been able to establish air dominance is due to not replenishing their stocks from their involvement in syria that s part of the reason they haven t been able to establish air dominance literally not enough bombs missiles spare parts for their planes which i think is a really important dynamic we just assumed that they ve got unlimited amount of stuff but high end precision stuff they don t have nearly as much as you think he said he also said zelensky might want to think about relocating to lviv in the west on one hand i admire zelensky in standing strong and all his great quotes but on the other hand over the long term he has to live he has to survive he has to keep his government intact and i can certainly see a scenario where he displaces to lviv stays inside ukraine he said for the united states that is much cleaner and easier for us to support the ongoing government than if that government

australian crypto exchanges will be required to meet stringent tests for capital adequacy and responsible persons as part of a new crypto regulation set to be introduced later this year the new regulation aimed to protect consumers will also include auditing rules control frameworks and product disclosure requirements according to senator andrew bragg i am very conscious of the ongoing need for dynamism in this space and therefore i do not want to raise the bar so high that new entrants cannot breathe mr bragg told the apac blockchain conference in sydney on wednesday however the idea of a 2 company running billions of dollars in au equivalent trades each year is a real risk to consumers and the economy overall i do not want to see the crypto markets become the next 2 company which hits consumers when they go to the wall mr bragg previously chaired the senate select committee on australia as a technology and financial centre which called for the introduction of a comprehensive crypto framework in october last year in response treasurer josh frydenberg outlined the government s plan to introduce a licensing framework for digital currency exchanges as well as a custody regime for businesses that hold crypto assets on behalf of customers these are key economic reforms which will drive more choice and lower prices for australians the biggest reforms to payments in 25 years said mr bragg cryptocurrency is not fringe or fanciful this is a sector that will employ hardworking australians put food on the table and create huge opportunities for our economy mr bragg said that the collapse of mycryptowallet in december and the movement of crypto companies overseas showed the need to act fast the legal principles which apply to financial markets can and will apply to digital markets it is clear that there is strong industry support for heavily beefed up requirements for an australian crypto market licence he said while the government has committed to delivering the new regulation by the end of this year mr bragg suggested that the timeline should be brought forward to mid year as a result of consumer protection needs and industry consensus if we get this right we ll find aussie crypto exposure running through businesses domiciled in new south wales not new york mr bragg said the government s cyber security industry advisory committee this week said that stronger crypto regulation must strike a balance between innovation protection and oversight industry advisory committee chair and telstra ceo andrew penn said that the regulation needed to be flexible enough to promote innovation while also being strong enough to protect legitimate use of crypto it is essential that forward looking regulatory settings are put in place to support crypto driven economic growth said mr penn as a new financial frontier the iac is also recommending more secure settings for australia s decentralised financial future both at an exchange level for australian organisations and a customer security level there is a role for government and industry to work together to do this mr penn also said that there was an urgent need to provide more education to the three million australians who are now trading crypto australians can and should be able to embrace the digital economy and access the benefits offered by cryptocurrencies with confidence he said

by nadia ramlagan north carolina news service stock photo critics of north carolina s police body camera law want changes to the process courts use to release footage to the public under a 2016 law footage from cameras worn by north carolina police officers can only be released through court order but critics say the process the courts use to determine whether footage should be released is discretionary and often results in drastically different outcomes groups such as emancipate nc say the problem is highlighted by the recent decisions of a superior court judge to deny an application for general release of footage during a 2020 no knock raid while approving the release of body camera footage of the shooting of daniel turcios by raleigh police durham civil rights attorney abraham rubert schewel of tin fulton walker owen pllc explained that the current statue gives judges wide discretion part of the complexity said rubert schewel is that courts across the state and court systems across the state have very different procedural mechanisms for how they handle body camera petitions and release of footage in general last fall state lawmakers passed legislation that bars law enforcement agencies from sharing body camera footage with family members who now must petition a court for access to footage rubert schewel said the threshold of whether the recorded scene is a critical incident is often used to rule against releasing footage he pointed out that a critical incident typically means someone was seriously injured died or was shot but notes it s not a requirement of the state s body camera release statute i think it s important for the public to know that there is no critical incident standard written into the statute said rubert schewel that is not part of the statute that is a standard that the city or law enforcement has put into place schewel said access to body camera footage is critical for the public to be able to weigh in on what types of police actions are considered acceptable he added that most people have a limited understanding of how police operate in certain cases an example of this is no knock raids or raids of people s homes said rubert schewel this occurs somewhat frequently in north carolina and i think that the public really has very little to no conception of this or how it works unless it s actually happened to you according to federal data nearly half of police departments in the country use body worn cameras comments

chicago business wire today a group of residents filed a class action lawsuit against natural gas provider peoples gas for neglecting to maintain wells that injected natural gas into underground storage in central illinois and causing natural gas to leak into the local aquifer the aquifer is one of illinois most important groundwater resources serving as the primary source of drinking water for more than 500 000 people in 15 illinois counties and providing hundreds of millions of gallons of water per day to communities as well as agriculture industry and rural wells according to the plaintiffs peoples gas neglect caused large amounts of natural gas and other combustible gases and hazardous chemicals to surge into the mahomet aquifer the sole source of water for east central illinois from an underground natural gas storage facility it operates in champaign county illinois rendering the water hazardous and in some cases flammable while corrosion of the wells had been occurring undetected for decades a notable contamination event occurred in 2015 when the well corrosion reached the point of blow out resulting in a large amount of natural gas pushing into the aquifer contaminating drinking water according to the suit it was a year later in 2016 by the time peoples gas noticed the gas bubbles percolating in the water yet took no immediate meaningful action according to the suit peoples gas a subsidiary of wec energy group nyse wec failed to perform epa required routine testing that would have detected the problems and prevented the gas leak according to the complaint the last test before the blow out was conducted more than 27 years ago when the tests revealed severe deterioration of the steel piping system with the metal actively degrading in the well peoples gas had every reason to expect danger was looming said beth fegan founding partner of feganscott you can t neglect evidence of a gas leak for 27 years and claim you re not responsible yet that is exactly what peoples gas has done in individual lawsuits filed in champaign county prompting a state court to deny peoples gas attempts to dismiss those lawsuits declining to adopt peoples gas arguments the state court summarized peoples gas position if pumped methane non potable saltwater or sarin nerve gas into its storage reservoir causing it to come through the geological strata to ultimately come out of that plaintiff s faucet that is just tough luck eisenmann v the people s gas light and coke co no 2018 l 108 champaign co ill aug 28 2020 order as a result of people s gas failure to take responsibility and its actions that run counter to prior agreements to protect area groundwater the class action lawsuit seeks to hold the company accountable for all area residents although peoples gas stores natural gas beneath the mahomet aquifer the gas itself is purely for storage or for use by chicagoans in the winter months meaning rural mahomet and fisher illinois residents face life altering consequences due to gas and fuel that they don t benefit from according to the suit the suit also claims that peoples gas intentionally misled the public by attempting to cover up the gas leak and the risks it creates for the public while also engaging in multiple counts of mail and wire fraud to collect a profit while residents suffered from the contaminated water according to the complaint peoples did periodically file incident reports with the u s department of pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration but routinely misrepresented the severity of the issues we live in one of the most developed countries in the world and these residents are fighting for one of the most basics human rights access to potable drinking water said james spiros founding partner of spiros law what is most galling is that peoples made a mindful decision to skimp on testing and maintenance knowing the impact that would have on families across illinois residents

spread the love the zimbabwe investment and development agency zida expressed reservations over the eight percent management fees from gross revenue proposed by kuvimba mining house kmh a company selected to revive the zimbabwe iron and steel company zisco business weekly has established the government selected kuvimba to revive zisco once africa s largest steel mills after zida recommended three investors from six that had initially shown interest in the kwekwe based integrated steel works kuvimba which is owned 65 percent by the government has proposed to enter into a three year management contract with zisco and inject us 1 3 billion into the business to revive mining and steel processing operations according to a due diligence report submitted to government in november 2021 the contract zida described as too rich would be for three years after which zisco may choose to extend or assume full responsibility of operations it is targeting to reach annual output of one million tonnes of steel in three years from the date of signing the contracts the cabinet selected kuvimba among three shortlisted potential investors paving way for negotiations and signing of binding agreements industry and commerce minister dr sekai nzenza said negotiations for binding contracts would commence soon kuvimba proposed a management fee of 8 percent but zida which conducted a due diligence on zisco s potential investors said a flat management fee seems loosely structured and may be lopsided to the advantage of kuvimba kuvimba owns various mining assets in zimbabwe including gold platinum nickel and chrome eight percent management appears too rich there is need for revenue split to be equitable we would propose that the management fees be structured differently zida said a lower base management fee of say 5 percent plus an incentive above an agreed irr hurdle of say 15 percent would align parties interests we are happy to elaborate and debate this matter said zida in its november 22 due diligence report zisco stopped operations in 2008 due to mismanagement and lack of funding to retool since then the government engaged various potential investors in a bid to re open the company but with limited success kuvimba won the tender ahead of other two final bidders who had expressed interest in zisco which used to employ 5 000 people however zida said kuvimba was already involved in mining in the country and expert knowledge in the extractive sector giving an edge over other potential bidder zida said kuvimba has managed to revive distressed companies such as shamva gold mine freda rebecca sandawana and jena funding will be through debt and quasi equity facility said zida adding kuvimba has existing relationships with funders and mobilization will be easier who else was in the race pai international incorporated in england and wales submitted its unaudited financial results for the period ended 30 november 2020 showing an asset base of 27 000 pounds it proposed to partner with aeepl anglo american cms blue international and other local firms anglo american would undertake mining operations with aeepl being a technical partner for steel manufacturing pai and its partners would work with the zisco and take joint decisions on the revival of the company pai had also proposed share ownership and options schemes to incentivise workers in addition it had proposed technical partners to be off takers of the steel products so share agreements would be part of the strategy of financing the operations further it proposed to attract financing through an initial public offering on the johannesburg stock exchange where it hoped to attract enough financial resources to further develop the company s operations zida recommended that pai was a small company which was established in 2019 and had not been involved in any mining venture on its proposal to extinguish the debt through offering shares to the public in a new stock issuance zida noted that pai did not guarantee that the company would garner positive attention since companies that offer ipo lacked a proven record of operating publicly epikaizo and sebeuzani epikaizo and sebeuzani submitted a joint proposal where the former would mobilise funds from the united states in the form of us treasury bonds to the tune of us 3 billion while the later would coordinate technical partners for the project the directors for the joint venture company are engineers m chivaura and t revanewako who once worked for zisco and dr r chamba the joint venture indicated it would mobilise us 3 billion through us treasury bonds upon submission of an evaluation report on zisco the company sought to determine the value of zisco assets from a valuation exercise and geological reports to raise capital if the outcome was favourable it would engage technical partners with expertise in mining and steel production government shareholding would be negotiated taking into consideration the equity brought by other parties to the project its technical partner in the bid was sms group a germany family owned business established in 1817 and has branches in 90 countries including in south africa sms has more than 100 years of experience in ferrous and nonferrous plant technology the resuscitation strategy sought to do away with blast furnace operations and

the greatest ever social media spat took place before the first tweet was sent and was conducted via fax which was like email but with the satisfyingly tangible tear of a fresh missive just arrived from across the planet it was early 1993 and julie burchill then of the modern review was locked in a war with camille paglia then of any us talk show you cared to tune into the conflict began with a disobliging review burchill filed of paglia s sexual personae before shifting to the xerox front where paglia made the mistake of questioning her interlocutor s working class credentials burchill brought hostilities to an abrupt close with her final communiqué which read in toto dear professor paglia fuck off you crazy old dyke always julie burchill since i was a teenager i ve been obsessed with that always it just makes it doesn t it adolescence is the best time to be introduced to burchill famously karen grant the teenage termagant of brookside idolised her but like the merseyside soap burchill hit the buffers in the 1990s that drearily good blanche hudson of a decade to the 1980s self obsessed and deliciously evil baby jane since then she s had perches on the guardian where i discovered her the times and most recently the telegraph from which she was dropped for tweeting her surprise that the sussexes didn t name their daughter georgina floydina it wasn t her best material the real indignity was that her heave ho prompted one of those seo chasing online explainers that the sun is now better known for than page three who is julie burchill and why was she sacked from the telegraph who is julie burchill you mean the gobby provocateur once paid oodles of fleet street dosh to be britain s most reviled insult chucker the helium voiced troll rated hated and imitated for her dazzling verbal aggression and her facility for offending both suburban tastes and liberal pieties how sharper than a serpent s tooth it is to have a forgetful public most popular robin ashenden the sacking of frank skinner is a loss to british comedy welcome to the woke trials is burchill s take on the twin factors that make a career like hers impossible today identity politics and cancel culture it originates in a 2013 observer column defending her mate suzanne moore from a twitter pile on by trans activists a polemic so incendiary the phrase a bunch of dicks in chick s clothing was used among others that a government minister called for her to be sacked as a result burchill writes she was sent into the professional wilderness she traces the great awokening to the summer of 2020 a conflagration of sensibilities as one cultural artefact after another went up in flames lest it offend some petulant cry bully this places the hinge moment in the wake of the murder of george floyd but apart from a chapter touching on race the vanity of the bonfires that burchill rails against is mostly that related to the gender identity movement or as burchill characterises it the small well financed extremely loud trans lobby who have never seen a drama that wasn t about them even if it was the killing of a black man in minneapolis about half the book is given over to documenting the various excesses of this movement which burchill sees as part of a broader war on women by men who want to imitate them men who want to sleep with them and men who want to kill them this leads her into broadsides against both male feminists once men have said they re feminists they feel free to behave in whatever scummy manner they see fit towards women and younger sex positive women when you get your tits out for public consumption the only thing you re empowering are erections amid the gratuitous swipes at the woke there are spurts of insight into the purported impact of porn including a grim statistic placing the average life expectancy of an american adult actress at 37 and burchill s assessment that woke men have promoted the idea of white privilege being more oppressive than male privilege because it deflects the conversation from where power truly lies veering between joyful venom and earthy cynicism welcome to the woke trials is a slangy exclamation mark laden indictment of identity politics a toe to the testes feminist polemic that prefers to cudgel rather than convince the intellectual terror running through higher education has made scholars such as kathleen stock the reasonable faces of feminism in britain burchill s feminism is neither reasonable nor scholarly but if it s reasonable and scholarly you re after pick up literary review not a julie burchill book a blooming good offer subscribe to the spectator this spring and get 3 months for just 3 claim offer yet welcome to the woke trials is an odd julie burchill book it s cruel belligerent and overly certain but it reads especially in her conviction that women s progress has been yanked into reverse like something more than pay day provocation it reads like she means it a controversialist in an age when controversy is ubiquitous julie burchill has found a surprising new way to vex her critics she s turned sincere

investors were spooked by the government s plan to share certain covid treatment technologies with international health organizations what happened thursday was not generally a memorable day for coronavirus stocks and not only because the pandemic seems to be receding a pronouncement by federal government officials pushed down the prices of the most prominent ones including moderna mrna 1 22 and germany s biontech bntx 1 63 the share prices of the two lost over 4 and slightly more than 3 respectively on the day so what in remarks quoted widely by the media thursday morning dr anthony fauci said that certain technologies currently being developed by the government s national institutes of health nih will be licensed to the world health organization who and the united nations affiliated medicines patent pool those two organizations will be able to utilize the technologies to help develop vaccines and drugs that combat covid fauci is the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and in many ways is the face of the government s pandemic response the precise technologies that would be transferred under this plan have not yet been finalized according to fauci it doesn t seem as if the scheme will include the processes and technologies devised by private healthcare companies like moderna and biontech both of which have developed alone or in partnership coronavirus vaccines currently in widespread use an article on the matter published in the washington post cited three people familiar with the matter stressing that only federal resources would be utilized now what investors might not have bought the assertion that no technologies used by private companies will be transferred under the plan the government s efforts and those of for profit enterprises have merged at times this is particularly the case with moderna which harnessed nih developed technology to devise its mrna based vaccine through its words and actions it s clear that the u s government recognizes the value of the contribution that such companies made so it s likely to take pains to keep hands off the most sensitive private sector vaccine and drug technology as such this negative knee jerk reaction by moderna and biontech shareholders feels unjustified

are back in the red again on thursday as we await further talks between delegations from ukraine and russia commented craig erlam senior market analyst uk and emea oanda wednesday s rebound was predictably short lived against the backdrop of reports of intensifying attacks by russian troops as they close in on cities across the country erlam noted that the sanctions that have been leveled at russia since the invasion started have been far more severe than many expected and we re learning more about their devastating impact with every passing day while there is some hope that talks between the two countries can yield a breakthrough it s tough to see where a compromise can be found or whether russia is even interested in one noted erlam it was involved in talks before it crossed the border and it s clear now that there was no intention to find a diplomatic solution he said on the economic front the institute of supply management s ism february non manufacturing pmi proved disappointing highlighting prevalent supply chain issues the ism non manufacturing pmi came in at 56 5 in february against a forecast of 61 1 this weaker than expected reading shows the economy is

federal reserve will be whether this weakness continues and how much of an impact the ongoing situation in ukraine will have on the economy going forward high levels of inflation and the ongoing conflict in ukraine could cause economic weakness and cause the fed to adopt less of a hawkish stance as we head through 2022 he noted interest rates are going to rise from their current low levels but the question remains how quickly they will rise and what level they will get to until investors feel they have clarity on those questions markets will continue to remain volatile 11 08am proactive

griddynamics com follow us on facebook twitter and linkedin non gaap financial measures to supplement the financial measures presented in grid dynamics press release in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap the company also presents non gaap measures of financial performance a non gaap financial measure refers to a numerical measure of grid dynamics historical or future financial performance or financial position that is included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap grid dynamics provides certain non gaap measures as additional information relating to its operating results as a complement to results provided in accordance with gaap the non gaap financial information presented herein should be considered in conjunction with and not as a substitute for or superior to the financial information presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered a measure of liquidity and profitability grid dynamics has included these non gaap financial measures because they are financial measures used by grid dynamics management to evaluate grid dynamics core operating performance and trends to make strategic decisions regarding the allocation of capital and new investments and are among the factors analyzed in making performance based compensation decisions for key personnel grid dynamics believes the use of non gaap financial measures as a supplement to gaap measures is useful to investors in that they eliminate items that are either not part of core operations or do not require a cash outlay such as stock based compensation expense grid dynamics believes these non gaap measures provide investors and other users of its financial information consistency and comparability with its past financial performance and facilitate period to period comparisons of operations grid dynamics believes these non gaap measures are useful in evaluating its operating performance compared to that of other companies in its industry as they generally eliminate the effects of certain items that may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance there are significant limitations associated with the use of non gaap financial measures further these measures may differ from the non gaap information even where similarly titled used by other companies and therefore should not be used to compare our performance to that of other companies grid dynamics compensates for these limitations by providing investors and other users of its financial information a reconciliation of non gaap measures to the related gaap financial measures grid dynamics encourages investors and others to review its financial information in its entirety not to rely on any single financial measure and to view its non gaap measures in conjunction with gaap financial measures please see the reconciliation of non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures attached to this release forward looking statements this communication contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section 27a of the securities act of 1933 and section 21e of the securities exchange act of 1934 that are not historical facts and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results of grid dynamics to differ materially from those expected and projected these forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology including the words believes estimates anticipates expects intends plans may will potential projects predicts continue or should or in each case their negative or other variations or comparable terminology these forward looking statements include without limitation the quotations of management the section titled financial outlook and statements concerning grid dynamics s expectations with respect to future performance particularly in light of the covid 19 pandemic and the russian invasion of ukraine these forward looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from the expected results most of these factors are outside grid dynamics s control and are difficult to predict factors that may cause such differences include but are not limited to i grid dynamics has a relatively short operating history and operates in a rapidly evolving industry which makes it difficult to evaluate future prospects and may increase the risk that it will not continue to be successful and may adversely impact our stock price ii grid dynamics may be unable to effectively manage its growth or achieve anticipated growth which could place significant strain on grid dynamics management personnel systems and resources iii grid dynamics revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of clients and industries that are affected by seasonal trends and any decrease in demand for outsourced services in these industries may reduce grid dynamics revenues and adversely affect grid dynamics business financial condition and results of operations iv the impact of the covid 19 pandemic and the russian invasion of ukraine has and may continue to materially adversely affect our stock price business operations and overall financial performance v grid dynamics revenues are highly dependent on clients primarily located in the united states and any economic downturn in the united states or in other parts of the world including europe or disruptions in the credit markets

moscow russia and amsterdam the netherlands accesswire march 3 2022 yandex nasdaq yndx moex yndx a netherlands registered company and one of europe s largest internet businesses as well as the leading search and ride hailing provider in russia today provided an update on the impact of current geopolitical developments on the company in recent days a number of governments including those of the united states united kingdom and european union have adopted new sanctions on specified persons and entities in russia including the central bank of russia and new export controls affecting specific sensitive technologies none of yandex n v any of our subsidiaries any of the members of our board of directors or management or any of our principal shareholders is a target of these sanctions we are currently analyzing the new export controls and working closely with our vendors none of the yandex group companies operates in the defense aerospace or maritime sectors that have been specifically targeted we understand however that a number of companies based in the u s u k e u and elsewhere have indicated that that they are currently suspending supplies and services to customers in russia we believe that our current data center capacity and other technology critical to operations will allow us to continue to operate in the ordinary course for at least the next 12 to 18 months in the event of any prolonged suspension of supplies of hardware software or other technology used in our business or offerings if we are unable to secure alternative sources our operations could be materially adversely affected over time in addition we understand that many suppliers have announced intentions to suspend the sale of consumer goods to russia and several major shipping companies have ceased shipments to russia such actions if prolonged would result in a reduction of the number and selection of goods we are able to offer through yandex market as of february 28 2022 yandex had usd and euro denominated cash balances of approximately 615 million of which a usd equivalent of approximately 370 million is located outside of russia and approximately rub 47 billion of ruble cash and cash equivalents as of february 28 2022 we do not currently expect the blocking of certain financial institutions in russia from the swift system to affect our day to day operations any prolonged economic downturn in russia as a result of sanctions depreciation of the ruble or negative consumer sentiment could have a material adverse effect on our results we are aware of press speculation regarding the possibility that the russian government would take steps to effect changes of control of companies or assets in russia in response to the sanctions that have been imposed although we are not aware of any plans in this regard the majority of our operations and assets are located in russia and therefore any such action would have a material adverse impact on the value of the yandex group as a whole our parent company is registered in the netherlands and has a number of direct and indirect subsidiaries located in countries outside of russia our parent company and its direct and indirect foreign subsidiaries currently hold a usd equivalent of approximately 370 million in cash as well as other assets and operations outside of russia see also the section headed risk factors in our annual report

under the terms of our 0 75 convertible notes due 2025 in the event of a suspension of trading of our class a shares on nasdaq of more than five trading days the holders of those notes would have the right to require us to redeem their notes at par plus accrued interest the current principal amount outstanding is 1 25 billion in the event that such redemption right was triggered we would be required to issue a notice within five calendar days informing the holders of the notes of their redemption rights the yandex group as a whole does not currently have sufficient resources to redeem the notes in full in the event that we were prevented from distributing additional funds from our russian subsidiaries to our dutch parent company yandex would not have sufficient resources to redeem a majority of the notes even if we are able to satisfy our redemption obligations under the notes in full if we are not able to secure additional financing a requirement to redeem a material portion of the notes would have a material adverse effect on our short term financial position and liquidity and may affect our ability to meet our other obligations we are currently conducting contingency planning to determine what steps we would take in this regard and what other sources of financing would be available to us in the event that this redemption right is triggered there are currently no regulatory restrictions on the ability of u s u k or eu persons to acquire and trade in yandex s securities and non u s persons are not exposed to any u s secondary sanctions risks in connection with such transactions as of today we continue providing continuous services to our users and partners as usual although we can provide no assurance that the current geopolitical situation and the

share dialogue about the future is a series of discussions with leading thinkers regarding the future of belarus and transformative steps that can be taken today the dialogue on the future of the economy was attended by kateryna bornukova academic director of beroc tatsiana marinich imaguru ceo co founder coordination council representative for business and innovation economy aleś alachnovič vice president of case belarus adviser to svetlana tikhanovskaya on economic issues the organizers and were vadim mojeiko belarusian institute for strategic studies biss anton ruliou belarus in focus press club belarus the immediate future new taxes emigration and sanctions fears instead of hopes the most significant damage inflicted on the belarusian economy by the events of the past year is the erosion of trust kateryna bornukova notes that neither people nor business look to the future with hope this means both a decrease in investment and slower growth in consumption relative to incomes which could cut overall economic growth in half tatsiana marinich agrees that business confidence is low in private enterprises of all sizes sanctions and the end of the export boom aleś alachnovič points out that the belarusian economy grew by 3 over eight months in 2021 grew by 3 but this was purely due to exports domestic demand continues to decline however export growth was driven by cyclical pricing fluctuations in commodities markets for petroleum products agrochemicals and wood rather than by increasing volumes of trade kateryna bornukova predicts that as world prices stabilize sanctions take effect and futures contracts for potash expire the progress made during the export boom will reverse during winter 2021 to spring 2022 emigration tatsiana marinich is sure that if current conditions continue businesses will continue to relocate outside belarus leading to an outflow of the people who are able to create new businesses if they do business in belarus they can do it in any country according to imaguru more than 20 000 it specialists have already left the country including 58 of start up founders those who remain do so because of logistical obstacles ranging from family ties to finance rather than because of confidence in belarus economic future interest in business development abroad will continue to grow as well as demand for relocation services based on forecasts from the world bank aleś alachnovič believes that if the belarusian economy grows as predicted by 0 6 over three years then the equivalent statistic for poland will be around 14 tax increases and a hostile attitude to business the era of private sector liberalization is over says kateryna bornukova in the new age of hostility to business those entrepreneurs who do not leave entirely will suspend investment and pay less attention to development tatsiana marinich is certain that by killing the it sector the belarusian regime has deprived itself of its future the it sector has historically grown at double digit rates compared to the sclerotic pace of the belarusian economy as a whole these developments helped to reduce social inequality by creating new jobs and stimulating the wider economy with the income of it specialists kateryna bornukova notes that the business community is now threatened with higher taxes the primary burden of which will ultimately fall on consumers the export oriented it industry may be less directly affected but reneging on the promise of 50 years of tax stability for the high technology park will further undermine trust predicts tatsiana marinich meanwhile aleś alachnovič draws attention to simultaneous plans reduce social support proposals include reducing maternity leave by a third an increase in the retirement age and a tax on the first step of the property ladder besides a purely fiscal motivation aleś sees in this a desire to punish individual entrepreneurs and it specialists for unwelcome civic activity the future economy human capital a new system of social support kateryna bornukova believes that before starting to rebuild the economy it is necessary to first rationalise the social security system including support for the unemployed subsidised housing and community services unlike the present system where people with large apartments eventually receive more subsidies any reform should be efficiently progressive some unpopular measures are inevitable but it is important that they be strategically justified for example raising the retirement age should be accompanied by the introduction of a funded pension system curbing the public sector tatsiana marinich believes it is necessary to minimize the role of the state in the administration of the economy currently there is excessive interference both at macro and micro economic levels kateryna bornukova agrees and regards the inefficient presence of the state as the biggest problem for the economy not only in business but also in education healthcare and the research and development sector even if there are coherent arguments for a state presence in industrial giants there are no good reasons for a shoe or confectionery factory to be state run aleś alachnovič agrees it is possible to conduct a transparent open privatization of small enterprises the state does not need canteens and hairdressers the hundreds of large state enterprises can also be restructured to survive open competition by highly qualified and highly paid managers developing human capital tatsiana marinich believes that belarus can drive growth and make a name for itself in the knowledge economy by the development of human capital and supporting the talented the goal of the new economy is not to directly increase gdp but to expand the development opportunities for each person accordingly aleś alachnovič believes that the state should focus on financing such things as education and medicine including private hospitals and universities it is necessary to reform taxes to incentivise young people not to leave and older people to defer retirement and grow their pension savings kateryna bornukova cites the example of israel where everything from the education system to the army is aimed at developing initiative self belief and civic cooperation it is common for comrades to leave the military and found a business which is fundamentally incompatible with in service hazing and suppressing the initiative of students tatsiana marinich refers to estonia where the entrepreneurial development and financial literacy begins in kindergarten children play at being in business however the main breeding ground for start ups is not the army or kindergartens it is university campuses in the new belarus it will be necessary to develop business education cooperation with leading universities retrain the labour force and develop infrastructure for lifelong learning from online projects to university courses for example imaguru is launching a pilot entrepreneurship program with ysu tax and administration aleś alachnovič considers it essential to reform tax administration and introduce a temporary moratorium on business inspections tatsiana marinich supports these measures and calls for changes in tax structure and administration simplifying regulatory procedures the example of the htp shows that in such conditions there are excellent opportunities for the emergence of new businesses and the growth of existing ones however initiatives like the htp should not perform management functions the roadmap for the development of innovative business developed by imaguru involves the creation of funds and hubs throughout the country with financial and non financial support for start ups building a digital society as mentioned previously estonia is a good example of how a state should build digital infrastructure for the people when databases are integrated services are easily accessible and people do not have to shuttle between government offices with reams of paper belarus can build on this experience and build a decentralized digital society with e democracy in such a society tatsiana marinich sees the role of the state not as a censor and controller but as a platform for the provision of services why it won t be like in the 1990s and how to finance reform aleś alachnovič believes belarus is the best prepared of all post soviet countries for structural reforms we will be almost the last to do this and we have examples to learn from both good and bad reformers from neighbouring countries can be asked to advise us unlike the 1990s 50 of the belarusian economy is generated by the private sector and many belarusians have studied or worked abroad many reform plans have already been prepared by beroc ipm case belarus the bank of ideas and the belarusian association of research centres kateryna bornukova stresses that the reforms that we need today are not the reforms that we experienced in the 1990s we already have a dynamic private sector reforms must be aimed at infrastructure to support entrepreneurship create a financial market and develop competitive neutrality of all forms of ownership in aleś alachnovič s opinion financing reform is only a question of efficient budget management and appropriate distribution of state spending he cites the already announced eu economic support plan for democratic belarus 3 billion euros 6 of belarus gdp as well as the eastern partnership support initiative in which belarus is currently the least active of all participants belarus will also benefit from a reduced external debt burden since a new government without lukashenka would command a better credit rating and therefore lower debt refinancing rates expenditure can be reduced by ceasing to maintain an army of ideologues while the launch of local self government will enable the people to determine what infrastructure they need the state will not be able to siphon funds away to build ice palaces the new belarus how economists imagine it kateryna bornukova parents no longer think about what foreign language their teenage child needs to learn in order to leave there are opportunities to develop professionally at home there is no domestic idiocy at every turn and dream jobs exist in more than one industry tatsiana marinich in a café you can hear different languages belarusian russian and foreign languages new ideas are discussed by people with different backgrounds experiences languages and mentalities belarus is integrated into the global community aleś alachnovič a normal democratic country where laws apply equally to all people know that the state will support them in times of crises such as the pandemic thanks to remote work and e government people can be comfortable in the regions men have stopped dying in such numbers before retirement age belarus is protected not by american or russian military bases but like switzerland by integration into international business bsu students go on exchange to harvard or stanford and then can return home to work in government agencies or run their own business author vadim mojeiko

following russia s invasion of ukraine many self proclaimed ukrainians have asked for donations on social media we verify how to know which ones are untrustworthy russian president vladimir putin launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform and created an account to seek out emergency funds but like a generic profile picture the account s age makes it more suspicious when considering the rest of these five tips as an additional tip an older account might also have giveaways to its inauthenticity if an account has a history of posting videos located somewhere other than ukraine and the account s owner has never talked about being from ukraine or visiting ukraine then it makes it less likely that the person is actually from ukraine if they later seek out donations 3 do the videos posted to the account show real clips from ukraine if a person isn t actually in ukraine they won t be able to record their own video of the invasion one strategy such a person might use is to post video of other events in the place of real footage the first video posted by sofiapalmroos111 depicts an explosion near an apartment building tagged war and ukraine but a yandex reverse image search of a screenshot from that video reveals that it s an image flipped video of a gas station explosion in novosibirsk russia from 2021 the video can be found on an instagram post from june 15 2021 with its location tagged to novosibirsk russian media such as the moscow times and the state run ria novosti news agency reported that a fuel pump at a gas station within the city had exploded on june 14 2021 other angles of the same explosion can be found in a number of youtube videos this video is particularly deceptive because it is of an incident that got little press coverage in mainstream english speaking media most of the people who would have seen the video on tiktok would not have ever seen the original video before it was tagged as part of russia s attack on ukraine 4 have the videos on the account been posted elsewhere by someone else before another way a person from outside of ukraine might pretend to be from the country is to take authentic videos from other accounts and post them like they recorded the video themselves while a real ukrainian person seeking help may post videos from other people they are unlikely to pass it off as their own video the second video posted by sofiapalmroos111 is of a group of helicopters flying across the sky with the caption russian army attacking my country the video is really from kyiv ukraine s capital but it s not from russia s ongoing invasion that video was first posted online on aug 19 2021 by a russian speaking person on facebook who said the video was of helicopters over kyiv at that time ukraine s military was participating in daily rehearsals for a parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ukraine s independence scheduled for aug 24 2021 photos and news coverage of the final week of rehearsals could be found in the kyiv post the american government run radio free europe and the pacific press agency while this video is of something that occurred months before russia s invasion it s equally possible for fake accounts to take a video someone else posted the day before or even earlier that day and pass it off as their own if you think you may have seen the video before it s a good idea to see if you might be able to find it again 5 does the account make spelling mistakes it shouldn t make english isn t the first language of a person from ukraine so an account isn t suspicious just because it makes spelling mistakes or has poor grammar but some spelling mistakes put an account s credibility more in question than others the bio for the sofiapalmroos111 account states that the account owner is from kiov instead of kyiv that mistake stands out because based on the ukraine government s official transliteration of the ukrainian alphabet to the roman alphabet used for english ukraine s capital city київ should be spelled kyiv 6 does the account ask for donations through paypal or venmo does paypal work in ukraine what about venmo be wary of accounts asking for money through paypal or venmo the only paypal feature available to ukrainians is the ability to send or spend money ukrainians on paypal cannot receive money from others individuals have different money transfer options than businesses but monito a comparison service for international money transfers lists wise paysend moneygram and other services as ways americans can send money to ukraine monito explains that individuals can t use venmo to send money to ukraine either venmo requires both users in a transaction to have a u s bank account restricting its use internationally what are some credible places to donate to the official twitter account of the ukraine government posted a pair of donation links for helping ukraine s military the first is for a national bank of ukraine fund to support the country s armed forces and the second is a link to a fund for the charity come back alive which provides support for soldiers involved in the war the national bank of ukraine only takes donations through card payments while the come back alive fund accepts both card payments and bitcoin payments the red cross is also active in ukraine and has shared its own donation links for supporting its work in ukraine laurie styron executive director of charitywatch

china is able to maintain its own cycle of monetary easing and will inject momentum into the world economy amid fears of tighter global financial conditions experts said on thursday the people s bank of china the country s central bank may still cut interest rates this month even as the united states federal reserve said on wednesday it was planning tightening measures in march wang qian vanguard s asia pacific chief economist said that while most of the world starts to tamp down on economic stimulus to tame inflation china is poised to add fuel to its economy which will partially offset the impact on global markets of tightening in developed economies wang said she expects the central bank to front load accommodative measures to ensure that policy effects will be felt later this year and offset the impact of the property sector slowdown covid 19 cases and external uncertainties the comments came after geopolitical tensions and tightening plans of major central banks converged which could weaken global financial markets and undermine global economic recovery us federal reserve chairman jerome powell told the us congress on wednesday that he plans to propose a 25 basis point interest rate hike this month while noting that geopolitical tensions may have highly uncertain impacts on the us economy despite the fed s looming rate hike china s central bank may cut the policy interest rates of medium term lending facilities very soon perhaps this month said wu chaoming deputy dean of chasing securities chasing institute the domestic economic situation rather than other central bank actions dominates china s monetary policy setting thanks to the country s vast economy and a strong chinese yuan which has increasingly gained the status of a safe haven asset wu said the central parity of the onshore yuan saw its biggest jump in seven months of 335 basis points to 6 3016 against the dollar on thursday sending the year to date gain against the greenback to 741 basis points according to the china foreign exchange trade system a moderately accommodative monetary environment in china will not only help consolidate an incipient stabilization of the domestic economy but also help prop up the global economy by boosting china s demand for external goods and services wu said david blair vice president and senior economist at the center for china and globalization said the central bank has been responsible in its reactions to the covid 19 pandemic by avoiding excessive stimuli from driving up debt levels which has also helped maintain global financial stability having seen financial risks tapering off with the macro leverage ratio dropping to 272 5 percent by the end of last year china is confident of safeguarding the bottom line of avoiding systemic financial risks the central bank said on thursday
the claim a weatherman admitted the military is spraying chemtrails some social media users claim a meteorologist confirmed the existence of chemtrails during a weather broadcast aired over a decade ago weatherman admits military is spraying chemtrails reads text above a news clip posted jan 12 on facebook spraying chemtrails alludes to a conspiracy theory that the u s government secretly adds chemicals to the atmosphere for mass sterilization mind control or weather control the facebook video accumulated more than 8 000 views within a month it was taken from a longer news clip from a cbs affiliate in medford oregon featuring chief meteorologist kevin lollis the clip has been circulating online since at least april 2010 despite citing a news source the facebook post s claim is wrong follow us on facebook like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks lollis didn t mention the military spraying chemtrails at any point during the video he mentions a radar countermeasure used during military exercises as independent fact checking organizations have reported usa today reached out to the facebook user who posted the video for comment weatherman mentioned military maneuver at the beginning of the video lollis says there is a bit of an unusual situation in parts of southern oregon and northern california pointing to a radar that appears to show precipitation he says a military aircraft flying through the region is dropping chaff chaff is a defensive mechanism used by military aircraft to confuse radar seeking missiles in the air according to an air force fact sheet published by the environmental protection agency when a plane ejects chaff the fibers made of glass silicate with an aluminum coating create a radar reflective cloud that simulates aircraft and creates false targets fact check false claim of us biolabs in ukraine tied to russian disinformation campaign when asked for details about the purported military exercise referenced in the newscast air force spokeswoman ann stefanek told usa today in an email that the service branch does not maintain information pertaining to exercises held over a decade ago chaff is often released during military training exercises as documented by images published on stock photo websites like alamy the defensive measure along with flares is crucial for older aircraft that constitute the majority of the military s inventory defense news reported in 2018 however chaff can interfere with air traffic and weather tracking radars according to a 1998 report from the government accountability office fact check tiktok video first posted in 2015 doesn t show russian soldiers parachuting into ukraine in 2018 national weather service radars picked up chaff dropped from a c 130 near evansville indiana abc news reported at the time in a similar event local weather radars picked up chaff released during a 2013 training exercise near huntsville alabama the national weather association reported the government accountability office report says that to avoid interference with radars military facilities must obtain clearance before using chaff during exercises there are also restrictions on what kind of chaff can be used where it can be used and the altitudes at which it can be released chaff particles aren t a concern for public health as their chemical composition is essentially identical to soil according to the air force fact sheet chemtrails conspiracy theory previously debunked the theory that the government is releasing chemicals into the environment to control the population is unfounded according to several government agencies and independent fact checking organizations the theory claims some planes condensation trails are filled with chemicals because they are longer brighter and don t disappear as quickly as regular contrails smithsonian magazine reported contrails are ice particles resulting from water vapor emitted by an airplane as it burns fuel according to the epa some contrails look different depending on altitude temperature and humidity fact check image shows old russian plane crash not related to ukraine invasion the chemtrails conspiracy theory has been debunked in its fact sheet the air force described the theory as a hoax that s been around since 1996 the air force is not conducting any weather modification experiments or programs and has no plans to do so in the future the service branch wrote the epa says on its website that it s not aware of any deliberate actions to release chemical or biological agents into the atmosphere independent fact checking organizations like reuters and politifact have debunked claims that photos of routine military exercises are evidence of chemtrails our

following russia s invasion of ukraine many self proclaimed ukrainians have asked for donations on social media we verify how to know which ones are untrustworthy russian president vladimir putin launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform and created an account to seek out emergency funds but like a generic profile picture the account s age makes it more suspicious when considering the rest of these five tips as an additional tip an older account might also have giveaways to its inauthenticity if an account has a history of posting videos located somewhere other than ukraine and the account s owner has never talked about being from ukraine or visiting ukraine then it makes it less likely that the person is actually from ukraine if they later seek out donations 3 do the videos posted to the account show real clips from ukraine if a person isn t actually in ukraine they won t be able to record their own video of the invasion one strategy such a person might use is to post video of other events in the place of real footage the first video posted by sofiapalmroos111 depicts an explosion near an apartment building tagged war and ukraine but a yandex reverse image search of a screenshot from that video reveals that it s an image flipped video of a gas station explosion in novosibirsk russia from 2021 the video can be found on an instagram post from june 15 2021 with its location tagged to novosibirsk russian media such as the moscow times and the state run ria novosti news agency reported that a fuel pump at a gas station within the city had exploded on june 14 2021 other angles of the same explosion can be found in a number of youtube videos this video is particularly deceptive because it is of an incident that got little press coverage in mainstream english speaking media most of the people who would have seen the video on tiktok would not have ever seen the original video before it was tagged as part of russia s attack on ukraine 4 have the videos on the account been posted elsewhere by someone else before another way a person from outside of ukraine might pretend to be from the country is to take authentic videos from other accounts and post them like they recorded the video themselves while a real ukrainian person seeking help may post videos from other people they are unlikely to pass it off as their own video the second video posted by sofiapalmroos111 is of a group of helicopters flying across the sky with the caption russian army attacking my country the video is really from kyiv ukraine s capital but it s not from russia s ongoing invasion that video was first posted online on aug 19 2021 by a russian speaking person on facebook who said the video was of helicopters over kyiv at that time ukraine s military was participating in daily rehearsals for a parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ukraine s independence scheduled for aug 24 2021 photos and news coverage of the final week of rehearsals could be found in the kyiv post the american government run radio free europe and the pacific press agency while this video is of something that occurred months before russia s invasion it s equally possible for fake accounts to take a video someone else posted the day before or even earlier that day and pass it off as their own if you think you may have seen the video before it s a good idea to see if you might be able to find it again 5 does the account make spelling mistakes it shouldn t make english isn t the first language of a person from ukraine so an account isn t suspicious just because it makes spelling mistakes or has poor grammar but some spelling mistakes put an account s credibility more in question than others the bio for the sofiapalmroos111 account states that the account owner is from kiov instead of kyiv that mistake stands out because based on the ukraine government s official transliteration of the ukrainian alphabet to the roman alphabet used for english ukraine s capital city київ should be spelled kyiv 6 does the account ask for donations through paypal or venmo does paypal work in ukraine what about venmo be wary of accounts asking for money through paypal or venmo the only paypal feature available to ukrainians is the ability to send or spend money ukrainians on paypal cannot receive money from others individuals have different money transfer options than businesses but monito a comparison service for international money transfers lists wise paysend moneygram and other services as ways americans can send money to ukraine monito explains that individuals can t use venmo to send money to ukraine either venmo requires both users in a transaction to have a u s bank account restricting its use internationally what are some credible places to donate to the official twitter account of the ukraine government posted a pair of donation links for helping ukraine s military the first is for a national bank of ukraine fund to support the country s armed forces and the second is a link to a fund for the charity come back alive which provides support for soldiers involved in the war the national bank of ukraine only takes donations through card payments while the come back alive fund accepts both card payments and bitcoin payments the red cross is also active in ukraine and has shared its own donation links for supporting its work in ukraine laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says charity organizations are typically better to donate to than crowdfunding campaigns or individuals because they make sure no one person gets all of the aid for themselves
investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tipsdidi stock is slowly moving toward a value of zero as its chances peter out slowly but surely there is this story originally appeared on investorplace investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips there really isn t any good news in relation to didi global nyse didi stock bottom fishers could concoct some sort of bullish thesis about the beaten down chinese ride share stock in an effort to convince investors to get on board that might convince a little bit of capital to rush into the shares but at the end of the day it s best to just avoid didi source zhu difeng shutterstock com investing in the stock of companies that have tons of trouble and limited upside is a weak strategy in general and that s essentially what any investors would be doing here so in order to convince readers who are on the fence i ll outline a few reasons that compellingly persuaded my thinking didi stock never had a chance go against the might of the chinese government at your own discretion that s the lesson didi teaches i honestly believe that there s a near zero chance of success for any individual firm to do anything other than toe the line in relation to ccp diktats didi is a great example it had long planned its initial public offering ipo which was set to go through in june of 2021 everything looked great the company lined up investors who were behind the project and what didi represented the ipo was literally days ahead then out of the blue didi received notification from china s cyber security watchdog stating that it should delay its ipo didi had a choice delay the ipo and watch investors walk or go ahead and tempt fate and list the ipo risking a potentially swift and strong reaction by the chinese government we know that didi chose the latter everything went great for about 24 hours didi undertook its ipo which went from 14 to 18 quickly then things went belly up crackdown on july 2 just days after the ipo launched didi announced that china s cyberspace administration office was subjecting didi to a security review the watchdog announced that the didi app was being taken down from app stores in china on july 4 the cyberspace administration office alleged that didi had been collecting personal information in violation of china s laws a few days after that on july 9 the cyberspace administration office ordered didi to take down 25 additional apps on similar charges of user privacy data breaches and that s pretty much been the story of didi its share prices have marched steadily downward in step with bad news after bad news delisting announced more such bad news came when didi then announced that it was delisting from the new york stock exchange in early december as a consequence investors who purchased american depositary shares will have their shares converted to equivalent shares on the hong kong stock exchange that isn t a great solution for shareholders who have little experience with the entirely separate exchange it was a strange turn of events but it also provided a concrete example of a fear that china based firms might actually delist from u s exchanges so investors have all that to contend with if for some reason they are considering investing in didi stock a company that lost 4 7 billion in the third quarter what to do with didi stock there isn t much to say i don t think there s any room for optimism there it s difficult to imagine individual u s investors convincing themselves that it makes sense to pursue didi the business case is straightforward and also bad didi loses a lot of money according to its unaudited earnings report perhaps if it ever gets audited it proves to be even worse it doesn t matter anyway the company is pretty much done at this point maybe institutional investors will have an easier time navigating the hong kong stock exchange but even then there s not much to like about didi on the date of publication alex sirois did not have either directly or indirectly any positions in the securities mentioned in this article the opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to the investorplace com publishing guidelines more from investorplace the post rehashing the reasons didi stock was dead long ago appeared first on investorplace

it s difficult to make predictions especially about the future american baseball legend yogi berra once quipped when it comes to predicting where the australian economy is heading the task is made even trickier in the face of war in europe and uncertainty about the global energy and other markets this week there was some good news australia s economic growth gdp bounced back strongly in the last quarter of 2021 up 3 4 according to australian bureau of statistics figures this was a turnaround from the 1 9 decline in gdp in the september quarter australian quarterly gross domestic product

in the same country that s been ripped open by controversy over a new generation of massive open pit coal mines the husband and wife duo of john smith and laura laing trail their cattle to pasture the way ranchers always have by horseback advertisement read also why it s important for you to get fit so much of farming is so physically demanding even the easy jobs take enough running around to require physical stamina they could use atvs but the horses generate less noise and keep the animals stress levels lower that matters to smith and laing besides there are certain pastures that are exclusively accessible by horseback anyone farming almost anywhere else in the country might object that outdated technology like horses can t possibly make economic sense the couple are unphased to them the animal welfare and handling protocols they employ are crucial to their business it s like that for their environmental thinking too and for their production and marketing systems as well at plateau cattle company everywhere look you see respect for the value of traditional strategies brought up to date with modern science and business smarts smith and laing are the third generation on the ranch started by john s grandfather john smith hay a scottish immigrant who would go on to earn a global reputation exporting herefords to africa europe russia and hawaii today smith and laing manage anywhere from 500 to 600 head of black angus breeding cows 100 to 125 replacement breeding heifers and approximately 30 to 35 black angus bulls their breeding sires are all selected from the tt leptin gene a marker of lower input higher gain animals that for pcc have proven great results through to their calf crop tail hair samples from their bulls and replacement breeding females are analyzed at quantum genetix in saskatoon sask to guarantee the tt gene stock we see a gain in performance that is proving through to our feedlot and finishing buyers says smith of their sold cattle advertisement they have also spent the last six years slowly shifting calving dates today they calve in the first week of april as opposed to february and march when the low thermometer causes more stress on the animals and a greater physical toll on the ranch team we are striving to mimic mother nature as best as possible to avoid cold stress and lower assisted births due to weather says smith they ve been fine we didn t make a radical six week shift overnight we ve been going by two week increments their cows graze in a few locations waldron ranch the mount livingstone range and at their home place with additional adjoining pastures rented from their neighbours at waldron see page 23 smith currently serves as a director as did his father and grandfather the latter of whom was one of the co founders of the grazing co operative their grazing strategy on their own land also has deep roots it s a simple yet effective 50 50 rule take half leave half a unique feature of ranching in the mountains is the wildlife that freely moves through the region smith and laing have seen just about everything from grizzly bears and wolves to cougar lynx moose and even elusive wolverines each year they plan for a certain amount of animal loss due to predation as do other ranchers while there is compensation available for animal loss due to wildlife attacks it s a near impossible process to capture this relevant kill data smith says a rancher must find the carcass within hours document it with pictures then have officials assess it all in a timely manner frankly it s dangerous smith adds you run into the wrong grizzly you could end up on the ground beside your cow advertisement to keep a better eye on their animals and their movement the couple has investigated ceres tag a gps tracker for cattle while enticing the costs are prohibitive for their operation for the time being they will settle for drone technology to fill in the gaps this can be useful for not only going into an area where there may be one or more predators but also to get a good picture of where the animals are without causing undue stress in fact a skilled operator can actually direct the herd with a drone it s handy that they don t like it says smith of the cows reaction to the aerial tech you think gee it ll take three hours to get them out of an area or 10 minutes to fly around and get low enough to bother them we ve moved cows out of difficult terrains towards us with the drone when it comes to gathering it saves a lot of time in the saddle they re also investigating the possibility of geofencing for greater tracking to bolster their low stress environment the couple are certified with just about every label a ranch could have including an approved rearing process recognized by the european union a designation not all western canadian ranchers have as well they are part of canada s vbp program a greener world and the mcdonald s sustainable beef program the couple also sell direct as laing sees it there is no downside to having multiple affiliations in a business with such tight margins we are assessed every year which makes us better says laing people say it doesn t pay but opening yourself to every market helps it also helps to tell your story advertisement one of the biggest stories laing is telling these days though is that she and smith care for the land that may sound counterintuitive but recent developments in alberta s energy sector have greatly affected their lives and the lives of neighbouring ranchers since 2019 that was when the united conservative party rescinded a provincial law put into place by former premier peter lougheed in 1976 banning open pit coal mining in the mountains you could imagine the surprise when before it was even announced to albertans laing and smith received a call from an australian mining company that didn t come until the phone rang in the middle of calving says laing john s father was ill covid was happening we were dealing with all that and we hadn t been consulted the retracted law meant that exploration and possible development could begin on certain lands ranchers rushed to document their concerns about impacts to the watershed air and selenium contamination are massive concerns too and there have been some victories the overwhelming amount of feedback to the provincial government delayed its initial reports and permits have been cancelled but still there are concerns and meanwhile legal costs rise and paperwork pulls laing away from the ranch on a ranch dedicated to sustainability and co existing with nature she describes the fracas as a non stop headache it s been full time from the beginning she says adding that she is not compensated for the work at the height of it it s 40 hours per week evenings and weekends the couple openly balk at the notion they are anti resource but it s been the label they are hit with in these talks they wish government could understand the critical importance of not only the grasslands but the water too we are super concerned laing says flatly this isn t a nimby not in my backyard issue we re albertans we re concerned about this happening in any sensitive landscape advertisement a portion of the oldman watershed runs through their forestry allotment with tributaries on their home ranch and it sustains communities and agriculture downstream of them east to the hudson s bay where it finally drains estimates from independently commissioned studies suggested the proposed projects could use up to 40 per cent of the oldman s water in prime months of june and july and air toxicology research reports predicted dire results for their livestock and forages should surface coal mining occur i don t know where we would get that additional water laing says the fight means they ve had less time for one another extended family and friends they ve had virtually zero spare time and of course the rest of life and ranching has continued to come at them it s definitely a strain dealing with crisis after crisis laing admits there s really no time for the enjoyment side it s difficult on our mental health our relationship but we re strong and we support each other and we re getting through with each other it s important to choose the best partners and community they say they have been blown away by the phenomenal people supporting them in this including many in calgary s business community the ranching industry and just everyday albertans it s created an opportunity to show how we are land stewards laing says if ever there has been a time to get back to the basics of land stewardship protecting watersheds and native grasses it s now
following russia s invasion of ukraine many self proclaimed ukrainians have asked for donations on social media we verify how to know which ones are untrustworthy russian president vladimir putin launched a military invasion of ukraine just before dawn on feb 24 since then tiktok has been full of videos and livestreams asking for donations for ukraine in most of these videos people ask viewers to donate to a charity but some of the videos and livestreams are of people claiming to be from ukraine asking for personal donations to help themselves or their families it can be difficult to know if a stranger asking for money over social media is who they say they are we ve put together some tips to help you figure out if an account is legit using one account soliciting for personal donations as an example the account sofiapalmroos111 has posted two videos since russia s invasion of ukraine began one of those videos is tagged donateme and the account itself lists a paypal username in its bio and claims to be a ukraine girl living in kiov editor s note we have a list of some legitimate organizations soliciting donations at the end of this article the sources laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says you should generally avoid donating to crowdfunding campaigns or individuals in most cases regarding a crisis like this the only exception to that might be if you personally know someone in the region or you have someone who can vouch for that person styron said in that case the crowdfunding site can be a very convenient easy way to get resources to someone in the region if you don t know the person it s really not the best way to give you re really kind of taking a big risk if you still want to donate directly to individuals you should at least take precautions to make it less likely you re scammed here are six things to be on the lookout for when figuring out if an account is real 1 is the profile picture generic one of the first things you should do is a reverse image search of the account s profile picture you can do a reverse image search by saving an image opening up google images or another search engine s image search clicking the search by image icon and uploading the image into the search bar if that search reveals the picture is actually another person s profile photo or is a stock image then it s likely the person running the account isn t who they say they are in the case of sofiapalmroos111 a reverse image search on google doesn t return any results but that doesn t necessarily mean the photo is unique a reverse image search of the image on the russian search engine yandex reveals that the photo is used for profiles on a number of russian social media websites often alongside different names none of those accounts use the name sofia palmroos which is the name the tiktok account uses a common profile picture or a stock photo profile picture doesn t necessarily mean an account isn t from ukraine or that it s fake a real ukrainian person might want to hide their identity for safety reasons or this might be the one account that actually belongs to the person in the photo but in conjunction with other red flags profile pictures can be the first indicator that a profile might be untrustworthy 2 is the account brand new an account s age is easy to check and can suggest someone might simply be looking to take advantage of a real world tragedy to benefit themselves a newly created account immediately looking for donations from others upon its creation is far less credible than an account that has been around and posting videos long before seeking help from others the sofiapalmroos111 account for example never posted a video until after russia s invasion of ukraine began once again this alone doesn t mean the owner of the account is from somewhere other than ukraine the account could belong to a ukrainian person who didn t use tiktok before heard about the donation drives on the platform and created an account to seek out emergency funds but like a generic profile picture the account s age makes it more suspicious when considering the rest of these five tips as an additional tip an older account might also have giveaways to its inauthenticity if an account has a history of posting videos located somewhere other than ukraine and the account s owner has never talked about being from ukraine or visiting ukraine then it makes it less likely that the person is actually from ukraine if they later seek out donations 3 do the videos posted to the account show real clips from ukraine if a person isn t actually in ukraine they won t be able to record their own video of the invasion one strategy such a person might use is to post video of other events in the place of real footage the first video posted by sofiapalmroos111 depicts an explosion near an apartment building tagged war and ukraine but a yandex reverse image search of a screenshot from that video reveals that it s an image flipped video of a gas station explosion in novosibirsk russia from 2021 the video can be found on an instagram post from june 15 2021 with its location tagged to novosibirsk russian media such as the moscow times and the state run ria novosti news agency reported that a fuel pump at a gas station within the city had exploded on june 14 2021 other angles of the same explosion can be found in a number of youtube videos this video is particularly deceptive because it is of an incident that got little press coverage in mainstream english speaking media most of the people who would have seen the video on tiktok would not have ever seen the original video before it was tagged as part of russia s attack on ukraine 4 have the videos on the account been posted elsewhere by someone else before another way a person from outside of ukraine might pretend to be from the country is to take authentic videos from other accounts and post them like they recorded the video themselves while a real ukrainian person seeking help may post videos from other people they are unlikely to pass it off as their own video the second video posted by sofiapalmroos111 is of a group of helicopters flying across the sky with the caption russian army attacking my country the video is really from kyiv ukraine s capital but it s not from russia s ongoing invasion that video was first posted online on aug 19 2021 by a russian speaking person on facebook who said the video was of helicopters over kyiv at that time ukraine s military was participating in daily rehearsals for a parade to celebrate the 30th anniversary of ukraine s independence scheduled for aug 24 2021 photos and news coverage of the final week of rehearsals could be found in the kyiv post the american government run radio free europe and the pacific press agency while this video is of something that occurred months before russia s invasion it s equally possible for fake accounts to take a video someone else posted the day before or even earlier that day and pass it off as their own if you think you may have seen the video before it s a good idea to see if you might be able to find it again 5 does the account make spelling mistakes it shouldn t make english isn t the first language of a person from ukraine so an account isn t suspicious just because it makes spelling mistakes or has poor grammar but some spelling mistakes put an account s credibility more in question than others the bio for the sofiapalmroos111 account states that the account owner is from kiov instead of kyiv that mistake stands out because based on the ukraine government s official transliteration of the ukrainian alphabet to the roman alphabet used for english ukraine s capital city київ should be spelled kyiv 6 does the account ask for donations through paypal or venmo does paypal work in ukraine what about venmo be wary of accounts asking for money through paypal or venmo the only paypal feature available to ukrainians is the ability to send or spend money ukrainians on paypal cannot receive money from others individuals have different money transfer options than businesses but monito a comparison service for international money transfers lists wise paysend moneygram and other services as ways americans can send money to ukraine monito explains that individuals can t use venmo to send money to ukraine either venmo requires both users in a transaction to have a u s bank account restricting its use internationally what are some credible places to donate to the official twitter account of the ukraine government posted a pair of donation links for helping ukraine s military the first is for a national bank of ukraine fund to support the country s armed forces and the second is a link to a fund for the charity come back alive which provides support for soldiers involved in the war the national bank of ukraine only takes donations through card payments while the come back alive fund accepts both card payments and bitcoin payments the red cross is also active in ukraine and has shared its own donation links for supporting its work in ukraine laurie styron executive director of charitywatch says charity organizations are typically better to donate to than crowdfunding campaigns or individuals because they make sure no one person gets all of the aid for themselves

it s difficult to make predictions especially about the future american baseball legend yogi berra once quipped when it comes to predicting where the australian economy is heading the task is made even trickier in the face of war in europe and uncertainty about the global energy and other markets this week there was some good news australia s economic growth gdp bounced back strongly in the last quarter of 2021 up 3 4 according to australian bureau of statistics figures this was a turnaround from the 1 9 decline in gdp in the september quarter australian quarterly gross domestic product

italian cuisine down to the individual ingredients is as diverse as the many city states and regions that came together to form the italian republic italy hit the powerball when it comes to climate and its people have long known how to cultivate and create the best food from what nature gives them for example in the southern regions and islands of italy the hot dry climate and well draining clay like soils fostered growth of durum wheat which was then used to produce durum wheat pasta italy s finest dried pasta makers are still located in these regions like molise puglia and campania of course pasta making is not isolated to the south the northern region of emilia romagna is known for its fresh egg pasta using regular flour and other various regions are known for making pasta with only flour and water in stores pasta is sold either fresh made with flour and egg or sometimes only water and flour or dried made with durum wheat semolina coming from a home where pasta was not even part of a monthly meal when i first moved to italy as a student i viewed all pasta as well pasta you had it fresh when you had time or a nonna was making it for you dried was the standard and it was mostly spaghetti i did not consider the possibility that the varieties in shape texture and ingredients were intentional not frivolous i was oblivious to the fact that the pasta and sauce i was eating were paired together for a reason it took time purpose and buying and cooking my own food to learn that each type of pasta has particular attributes that lend themselves to particular types of sauce fresh egg extruded bronze cut and ridged pastas have a rough texture which helps sauces stick to them tubular cupped and twisted shapes better trap pieces of meat vegetables or sauce smooth tubular pastas are best baked and sometimes tradition dictates the pairing like in spaghetti or rigatoni alla carbonara in rome to help you decide which pasta shape you d like to pair with your favorite sauces we ve compiled a short cheat sheet of our 29 favorite shapes including their regions of origin well those that are undisputed that is keep in mind that these are suggestions not rules if you would like to delve even more into pasta shapes and sauce pairings i highly recommend checking out the books the geometry of pasta by caz hildebrand and jacob kenedy an a z of pasta stories shapes sauces recipes by rachel roddy and sauces shapes pasta the italian way by oretta zanini de vita and maureen b fant angel hair aka capelli d angelo is a very thin long dried pasta shape sold in nests in italy it is used to prepare dishes for small children to get them used to solid foods broken into broths or simply dressed with butter sage and parmesan or smoked ricotta it can also be used for light vegetable driven summer dishes bigoli from the venetian dialect bigat which means worm are long extruded fresh pasta made from water and flour originally from padua in the veneto region because the pasta is extruded it has a rough texture which makes it perfect for thick sauces and ragus bigoli al ragu simone padovani awakening alamy stock photo bucatini referring to the hole or buco in the middle are a slightly thicker form of spaghetti with a hole in the center originally from naples this extruded pasta can be found on menus in rome paired with one of rome s classic pasta sauces amatriciana calamarata from its resemblance to a slice of calamari are an extruded pasta that can be ridged or smooth from the campania region and it s also very popular in and around naples this pasta is eaten with all types of sauces but particularly fish based sauces such as its namesake neapolitan dish calamarata which uses calamari cut the same width as the pasta calamarata pasta served with mixed seafood michael gross bloomberg via getty images cavatappi italian for corkscrew aka cellentani are a ridged tubular spiral pasta that can be considered the big brother to some versions of elbow macaroni similar to the hollow fusilli this pasta goes well in sauces with small pieces of vegetables or meat the hole of the spiral is big enough for sauce to get into while it also coats the ridges and any pieces of vegetable or meat get trapped in the spiral cavatappi are also worth a try in mac and cheese cavatelli from the word incavata which refers to the indentation in the shape are a small shell like pasta originally from the molise region in southern italy but is now eaten in many other regions along with lasagne it is said to be one of the oldest shapes of fresh pasta made with durum wheat flour water and a pinch of salt cavatelli are formed in the same dragging manner that orecchiette is formed stopping short of turning it on the thumb to create the dome unlike orecchiette however these are traditionally made by hand and not with a knife the rough surface formed by dragging and the indentation help make this shape a wonderful vessel for broccoli rabe meat sauces and tomato sauces conchiglie italian for shells the easily recognized shell shaped pasta come from the campania region this pasta is found in three shapes the small size conchigliette which is commonly used in soups the standard size which works well with thick sauces and the large size conchiglioni which is typically stuffed and baked in the oven all shapes are smooth on the inside and ridged on the outside however some pasta makers produce them without ridges on the outside baked shells may be filled with spinach and ricotta or ragu and béchamel and the smaller shells are perfect with any sauce that can hide inside the shell like pestos chunky sauces in cooler months and light vegetable driven pastas in warmer months farfalle italian for butterflies aka bowtie pasta were originally produced in northern italy regions of lombardy and the emilia romagna as early as the 16th century and are now eaten all over the country they re made fresh with egg or with durum wheat semolina as a dried pasta farfalle are usually paired with light simple sauces such as thinly sliced sautéed vegetables pumpkin and amaretti when it s cooler out or with cherry tomatoes and mozzarella in the summer fettuccine tagliatelle and pappardelle are all flat fresh egg pastas of varying widths fettuccine are between 3 and 5 millimeters wide tagliatelle are between 7 and 8 millimeters wide and pappardelle are between 1 3 and 3 centimeters wide though all three are eaten all over italy tagliatelle and fettuccine are most often associated with emilia romagna and pappardelle with tuscany the rough surface of the fresh egg pasta make these shapes wonderful for any condiment that coats the pasta roasted tomatoes sautéed porcini mushrooms sautéed leafy greens and roasted pumpkin or the traditional bolognese duck or wild boar ragus in winter fusilli take their name from fuso the spindle used to form the spiral in many places in southern italy the pasta is still hand formed this way but there also exist extruded fusilli which are the flat sided spiral shape we are most familiar with in the us which you will find with a tighter or looser twist depending on the pasta maker fusilli also come in a version that is hollow like bucatini and resembles a spring this version is either long or short and has a tighter or looser spiral again depending on the pasta maker the handmade type likes to be in sauce pesto alla trapanese made from cherry tomatoes red garlic basil almonds and pecorino cheese is a great example the short extruded forms go well in cold pasta dishes as well as saucy or cheesy or both dishes and dishes with vegetables or meat pieces that will get stuck in between the spirals along with the sauce the longer versions go well with simpler sauces such as the aforementioned pesto gnocchi which may be from the italian word nocchio meaning wood knot or from nocca meaning knuckle exist in several forms but we re focusing on the most popular form which is made with potatoes most sources cite the italian renaissance as when the first recipes were published for a version of gnocchi with breadcrumbs flour water and egg the version we are most familiar with today dumplings made simply with grated boiled potato and flour was made popular in italy in 1891 when the recipe was published by italian businessman and writer pellegrino artusi it takes the right potatoes floury and the magic touch to make feather light gnocchi which go well with just about any sauce especially cheesy ones they are best served hot don t even try to eat these in a cold dish lasagne wide sheets of pasta typically layered with meat and cheese have been documented on the italian peninsula as early as 4th century b c in both dried and fresh forms this egg pasta is eaten in various ways throughout the country baked with meat and cheese then served in broth or with a tomato based ragu among others the most well known version outside of italy is the one with layers of pasta béchamel and ragu there are no rules about what you can layer with your pasta be it vegetables or meat just make sure you remove any excess moisture from the ingredients before cooking or your dish will end up watery linguine italian for little tongues are a long thin slightly convex extruded pasta similar to flattened spaghetti from the liguria region the typical condiment to accompany linguine is pesto with green beans and potatoes but of course with its rough texture it is the perfect shape for any saucy pasta especially with large pieces of vegetables or seafood like a clam sauce or both maccheroni means different things to different people in one place maccheroni means ridged tubular spirals in another they re thin straight short noodles that come from that blue kraft box in yet another they re a ridged elbow pasta take your pick one thing these extruded pastas all have in common is that they re perfect for lighter cold pasta dishes or of course your best mac and cheese recipe manicotti italian for sleeves are the italian american version of cannelloni there are few differences between the two manicotti are ridged and slightly larger than the smooth thinner cannelloni shell manicotti were traditionally made with crepes as are cannelloni made with crespelle in some areas of italy both egg pastas are prepared in the same way by stuffing them with whatever your heart desires they re commonly filled with ricotta and cheese covered in tomato sauce or ragu and baked though you can really find them in pasta shops and restaurants filled with just about anything maltagliati from the two words mal and tagliati which mean poorly cut are irregular shapes of pasta cut from sheets of fresh egg pasta like tagliatelle or pappardelle a task the kids can handle with a pastry wheel the pieces are boiled the same as other pasta and can be served with creamier sauces such as codfish and chickpea cream or even with sauces as substantial as a ragu maltagliati in a tomato and meat sauce zoonar gmbh alamy stock photo orecchiette from their resemblance to small ears or orecchie are a type of pasta from puglia made by dragging a small piece of pasta with a butter knife then flipping it inside out with your thumb this creates an indentation on one side and ridges on the other both of which help sauce stick to it they can be found across puglia in three sizes the smallest size is perfect for ragu the middle size almost 2 centimeters across pairs well with its traditional accompaniment of broccoli rabe and sausage but are equally delicious with any vegetable driven sauce that doesn t drown the pasta and the largest size is generally stuffed and baked in the oven paccheri from the neapolitan word paccharia which means slaps a reference to the slapping sound they may make when eaten or mixed with sauce are a tubular pasta ridged or smooth that are similar to larger diameter rigatoni and come from naples this extruded pasta is perfect with thick sauces studded with seafood vegetables or meat the sauce clings to the rough external surface and the large pieces get trapped inside don t waste this on a sauce that isn t chunky you ll miss all the fun ravioli refers to the family of fresh stuffed pasta of different shapes depending on the region of origin we could actually do an entirely separate list for all the different types of ravioli what distinguishes one from the other is the dimension shape and how they are closed they can be filled with cheese ricotta and spinach meat as in the case of tortellini or vegetables and served in broth a condiment as simple as melted butter or tomato sauce or as rich as ragu rigatoni and penne rigate from rigato which means ridged are extruded tubular pastas of different diameters the former is cut straight giving it a cylindrical shape while the latter is cut diagonally giving it an oblique shape the ridges like roughness on the fresh pastas help sauces adhere these shapes are perfect for pestos or sauces with pieces of vegetables or meat that you can stack on your fork in one bite they also lend themselves well to cold summery pasta dishes rotini

it s difficult to make predictions especially about the future american baseball legend yogi berra once quipped when it comes to predicting where the australian economy is heading the task is made even trickier in the face of war in europe and uncertainty about the global energy and other markets this week there was some good news australia s economic growth gdp bounced back strongly in the last quarter of 2021 up 3 4 according to australian bureau of statistics figures this was a turnaround from the 1 9 decline in gdp in the september quarter australian quarterly gross domestic product it is often noted however that gdp is an imperfect measure it doesn t capture things such as unpaid work it is also backward looking the figures tell us what happened at the end of last year at a time when what we would really like to know is what is going to happen this year and beyond that said they provide useful clues splurge based recovery the 3 4 growth was generated almost entirely by consumer spending 3 2 percentage points with the rest due to changes in inventories and trade government spending made no contribution investment both private and public was actually a drag knocking 0 3 and 0 1 percentage points off growth this isn t all that surprising after months of lockdowns in much of australia people wanted to spend in the september quarter household savings soared to 19 8 of income in the december quarter they fell to 13 6 as people splurged on things they couldn t spend on while they had been locked down household final consumption expenditure spending on accommodation and food services jumped 26 1 personal and other services such as haircuts and beauty treatments grew 15 4 air transport expenditure rose a massive 56 5 though as economists say it was was strong growth off a low base in other words many people couldn t get a haircut or go to a restaurant or fly in the third quarter of 2021 in the fourth quarter they could and did this is reinforced by the fact the strongest ouput growth 6 7 was in new south wales where the lockdown arguably bit the most mid year state final demand december quarter of course omicron hit hard in mid december but too late to have a big impact on the quarterly figures we will see more of omicron s impact in the numbers for the march quarter due to be released after the may election on the plus side households still have a large stock of savings compared with pre pandemic levels the 424 billion consumer war chest treasurer josh frydenberg has rightly been talking up puts us in a good position to spend building a sustained recovery household saving ratio can australia s spending led recovery continue in 2022 perhaps but there are reasons to be concerned the mechanical point is that the gdp figures for the december quarter are only impressive when you fail to remember they were bouncing back from a decline of 1 9 in the september quarter so called negative growth read more wednesday s gdp numbers are impressive but they are for the december quarter when we were bouncing back from delta a less mechanical concern is that the world is now awash with uncertainty the largest european conflict since the second world war threatens to upend everything from peace and security to global supply chains and financial markets the reserve bank governor referred to a major new source of uncertainty after his board meeting on tuesday domestically we still don t know whether inflation is just returning to regular programming or getting away from us what s ahead like many economists i favour the former interpretation anyone who tells you they know for sure is delusional aggressive wages claims if successful could be the genesis of a wage price spiral sending inflation systemically higher but we don t know the reserve bank is going to raise interest rates sooner rather than later it could be mid year or delayed many months but eventually rates will climb to align with the so called neutral rate of interest the level that keeps the economy on an even keel with unemployment low and inflation stable read more why there s no magic jobless rate to increase australians wages there is considerable uncertainty about what that rate is in the 1990s and early 2000s the reserve bank thought it was between 3 and 4 now it s hard to dispute it is lower but not as low as 0 1 where rates are now either way it suggests meaningful rate rises are coming all of these factors will feed into future rate rises which will dent spending by australia s highly leveraged households in short getting sustainable gdp growth back to the 3 plus it used to be will require more than just a consumer spending binge it will require the hard work of productivity growth the budget looms in 2021 for the first time the federal budget set out four years of forecasts instead of two years of forecasts and two years of projections it has an important implication it means this year s budget will need to take a more formal and rigorous view about the next four years in particular about the international environment in which australia sits the budget is due in less than four weeks the big question is what will be needed to drive the economy in the years ahead it will require more than a rebound in restaurant meals and haircuts author richard holden professor of economics unsw sydney
