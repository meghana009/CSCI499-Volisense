chief executive officer and president thank you cameron and thank you all for joining us on the call today i am pleased to report we finished the year on an exceptional note with revenue and ebitda beating guidance at the beginning of 21 i outlined a growth strategy for our saas business and additional areas of investment needed to scale the organization looking back i am really proud of the thrive organization and the way we executed and implemented those investments into product into engineering and improving the product and the impact can be seen in the results let s take a minute and just jump into the headlines we grew total saas revenues for the fourth quarter by 36 and for the full year 32 for context we grew revenue in the saas segment 1 in 20 so from 1 we jumped to 36 so really strong performance there saas ending clients for the year 46 000 so we ended the year with 46 000 saas customers up 5 so there has been a lot of discussion about whether or not we can grow our subs because we made such huge progress on arpu this last year i think in the year ahead you are really going to see balance between arpu growth and subscriber growth and the fact that we expect that kind of 5 subscriber growth will accelerate to double digits in the year ahead in a minute here paul will walk you through the detailed numbers but i would like to highlight some of the progress that we ve made on some of our strategic priorities since the beginning i ve been talking about this was the decade of smb saas but last decade was enterprises moving to the cloud and this decade would be the decade of mom and pop and small businesses running their business on mobile devices by the end of this decade that will be just standard fare and at the beginning of the decade for the most part none of them were doing it so it will be a massive transition and that move will actually be bigger than when enterprises went to the cloud because there are so many more small businesses and we have positioned thryv over the last seven years in pole position to lead that gigantic transition so this is a unstoppable mega trend that you are playing by investing in thryv just from a macro basis what we are seeing now is we are seeing small businesses that have been experimenting with perhaps a point solution or two or three become frustrated with logging in and out of all these things the fact that the data doesn t share they don t talk to each other they got sticky notes everywhere they have a hard time including their employees to use these tools and they are looking to move up market to something that s a more complete end to end client experience an end to end solution and that s where thryv sits in that aspirational spot so as people sort of try a few of these little point solutions little freemium tools little odds and ends and they realize that this is the way to go i want to modernize they sort of find their way moving up market into a thryv thryv is quite a bit more expensive than a lot of those little point solutions are out there but it does so much more it s a more powerful tool so increasingly i am talking to customers just in the last couple of days i have been doing calls into australia speaking to customers in melbourne and sydney about their experience with thryv so far yesterday i spoke to a client who had been a pretty big mailchimp user and she has upgraded now from mailchimp to thryv and she has got so much more capability to do social posting to set up automated messages to go out to our customers to responding to her customers through the chat feature and she says really pleased with the power of thryv and she knows it does even more things that she hasn t accessed yet but she is excited about the completeness of the solution she doesn t need to keep buying other software and she had a pretty rigorous look to figure out what to use and concluded to go with thryv so hearing that story more and more in the weekly customer conversations that i have hearing people really beginning to take two or three point solutions and get them and go to thryv and i end up saving money when they make the transition and they get a lot more power and a lot more capability so thryv is an aspirational brand it s nowhere near as expensive as an enterprise tool like salesforce it s not even as expensive as a mid enterprise tool like hubspot it s more of a small business tool but it s a complete powerful tool and it s making a big difference for a lot of small businesses so by investing with us you are playing in that macro trend that small businesses are going to want to go with almost like a salesforce com type of thing that a big company would do they are going to want to do that more complete solution that they can share with their staff and they can all communicate on that one tool they can have a centralized inbox where all their messages flow in and it simplifies and organizes their lives where they can do estimates invoices billing payments they can use thryvpay save on transaction fees they can manage social media they can even deal with ratings and reviews and they can nurture their customers and keep in touch with them and remind them to come back all in one very simple tool so we have been recognized this year for a lot of innovation the google my business helping smbs get found online we have got a very deep integration there so even though it s software it s not advertising because it s so seo friendly it works so well as google my business it s actually helping our customers get more leads get more customers which is an unexpected benefit not necessarily the way we position it we have launched the verticalized platforms with enhanced crm so thryvhome thryvlegal thryvhealth we are beginning to really customize products that once you come in and you tell us you are a roofer you tell us you are a plumber you tell us you are a lawyer we begin to configure everything very quickly around what you are so it feels very bespoke for you and that s really helped with client satisfaction and you can see it in the engagement right through the numbers amazing we have launched a lot of free online tools to just help businesses with lots of simple things creating invoices different just different simple things and that s been a theater full driving new customers to our website driving new leads in sort of a free content marketing play it s very powerful we have really focused also on faster implementation and getting people to value very quickly that has been challenging but amazing results that our team have done and that s just shortening up the time from when you realize you want to do this when you are getting value from the software and we are seeing that in higher engagement and lower churn right through we have got some external recognition this year g2crowd capterra and the appealie awards recognized the thryv product as number one in a number of categories were placed very highly really external recognition about what a consumer grade easy to adopt easy to use tool this is our fast time to value is how good value for money is and i would invite any of the listeners here to go to these review sites and read the reviews on thryv they are outstanding and we have made such incredible progress here in this process thryvpay did north of 60 million in payment volume and has now become the most popular choice of all the payment tools that are available and we are sort of switcher and we operate with everybody we interoperate with everybody so you can bring whatever tool you are using when you come on to thryv but lots of people then switch to thryvpay along the way to save on fees to recapture convenience fees from customers and because it has a lot of small business friendly elements to it that allow you to set up the current payments and appointments and classes and lots of things that we ve custom built for the clients that we actually serve so interestingly 70 of our clients coming in now are new to the company and i know we talk a lot about hunting in the zoo working with our standing base and that s still producing about a third of all of our customers but there is a subtle nuance here and that s because we have made so much progress with client satisfaction engagement and usage we are now getting loads of referrals from those clients so they are actually bringing up there their business advisor and saying i want you to talk to my friend he needs help like this and so that s really driving that that sort of referral is driving a lot of the growth that we are seeing a third or so of our customers are coming from our new channels the actual inbound marketing and some of those other new areas that we have spoken some about and as i mentioned earlier we are seeing subscriber growth accelerate now as we sort of outrun the lower priced offerings we had a few years ago retention we are seeing right now season churn is 1 5 1 5 season churn so that if we are really proud of that we think that s sort of world s best when you are dealing with very small businesses our season net dollar retention is now 94 which is strongly better than the prior year and we are continuing to see progress there it s not a straight line because of different anomalies in the customer set but we have been asked many times do you think you can get to 100 net dollar retention and we really do we don t think it s a one quarter or two quarter journey we think it will take a little while because we are dealing with very small businesses but we have lots of additional product offerings coming on our product roadmap that will continue to propel that net dollar retention and customer arpu increases so we are highly confident that this is a hundred cents on the dollar type of churn i d like to just talk about engagement for a minute time in the app year on year is up user frequency is up clients using multiple features is up at crm inbox scheduler social post sales module are all up app downloads and installs have doubled i d like to turn now to an update on our sensis acquisition we now call this thryv australia the focus with sensis in this first half the year or so was to really focus on client engagement getting customers betted down getting them using the product getting them happy with the product and we have hundreds and hundreds of customers that are dishing out referrals now and happy about the onboarding experience and the difference that we are making in their business i think it bodes well it kind of gives us a broad clean foundation to really accelerate growth and i think one of the things you will see if you watch 22 is you ll see the sensis acquisition really come on stream as a source of subscriber ads and revenue growth so really excited about that finally i d like to talk about a small acquisition that we made recently we acquired a company called vivial holdings vivial is a marketing services company that publishes directories it was sort of the last bit of the telephone company yellow pages ecosystem that we needed to fill in that we needed to cover and it brings us hawaii alaska rochester cincinnati some markets that the fire companies that we acquired did not cover while we do have some customers in those areas we didn t have much customer density there so this brings us 25 000 digital clients that we can now penetrate with our saas offering it sort of expands the zoo if you will we pay 21 million we used available cash to fund the acquisition we didn t borrow or go out and do anything big here very simple deal and in terms of the discipline that we always talk about when we make this type of acquisition we have said that we would be approximately two times ebitda on a post synergy basis and this one is true to that as well as i mentioned it just closed in january so integration process is getting cranked up and underway we are getting everything set up so that they can begin to offer the thryv solution to their customer base and that will actually begin to flatter our numbers as this year unfolds so really excited about the progress that we are making in the business this vivial acquisition synergistically fits perfectly onto the thryv platform here in the us so i am really really pleased about that and anxious to turn this over to paul rouse let me give you a run through the financials paul paul rouse chief financial officer thank you joe let s turn to our fourth quarter and full year 2021 financial results i will first cover our u s business segment starting with saas fourth quarter u s saas revenue was 47 1 million an increase of 35 year over year for the full year saas revenue was 170 5 million an increase of 31 year over year and ahead of our guidance when adding the contribution of revenue from thryv international saas revenue increased 36 year over year in the quarter and 32 year over year for the full year fourth quarter u s saas ebitda loss was 6 7 million and within our expected guidance range for the full year u s saas ebitda loss was 14 million representing a negative ebitda margin of 8 total saas arpu was 351 for the fourth quarter an increase of 20 year over year total saas clients ended at 46 000 for the fourth quarter an increase of 5 year over year fourth quarter seasoned saas churn was 1 5 a 60 basis point improvement year over year and a 20 basis point improvement sequentially seasoned net dollar retention reached 94 for the quarter a 400 basis point improvement year over year as a reminder seasoned churn and seasoned net dollar retention represents clients that have been with us for over one year moving over to u s marketing services fourth quarter revenue was 153 5 million as we discussed on prior calls there is lumpiness in the print publication schedule we expected lower revenues associated with fewer print publications for the full year u s marketing services revenue was 797 5 million a decrease of 19 year over year and ahead of our guidance fourth quarter u s marketing services ebitda margin was 26 5 for the full year u s marketing services ebitda margin was 40 representing a 330 basis point improvement when compared to our prior year that improvement in margin is due to a shift in higher margin offerings within our marketing services product mix fourth quarter u s marketing services billings were 181 million a decrease of 22 year over year and consistent with previous quarters full year u s marketing services billings were 797 million a decrease of 21 year over year as is consistent with previous calls we are providing billings an additional operational metric to give our investors better insight into our operational performance the billings data will show a very consistent and steady decline in our marketing services segment which is shown to be lumpier on an accounting basis given the 15 month lifecycle of our print directories this is provided in our fourth quarter investor supplement available on our investor relations website moving on to thryv international fourth quarter thryv international revenue was aud60 million and ahead of our guidance on a reported basis given the effect of fx rates thryv international revenue was 43 8 million thryv international fourth quarter ebitda margin was 28 5 for the full year thryv international ebitda margin was 31 8 on a pro forma basis and backing out acquisition accounting adjustments ebitda margins would have been 38 for 2021 turning now to profitability for the consolidated business fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 66 1 for the consolidated business a 160 basis point improvement year over year for the full year adjusted gross margin was 68 2 a 130 basis point improvement year over year fourth quarter adjusted ebitda was 46 5 million representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 19 for the full year adjusted ebitda was 350 5 million representing an adjusted ebitda margin of 31 finally on capital allocation we repaid 17 5 million of our new term loan in the fourth quarter which brings our cumulative new term loan repayment to 158 million since the refinance associated with our sensis holdings acquisition in march our leverage ratio for the fourth quarter in accordance with our credit facility is 1 4 times our net debt to ebitda in addition to the progress we made on our long term debt we have made significant progress in reducing our pension liability over the course of 2021 our pension liability has been reduced by 51 million and our funded status improved 600 basis points to 76 we will continue to evaluate our net pension obligations each quarter let s talk about guidance for 2022 as an update we will continue to report each segment saas marketing services and thryv international however going forward we will provide outlook for total saas and total marketing services which includes both domestic and international operations this should be helpful in modeling the business ok now let s talk about our outlook for 2022 for the full year 2022 we expect total saas revenue in the range of 206 million to 208 million representing growth of 20 to 22 year over year and an ebitda loss in the range of 21 million to 25 million for the full year 2022 we expect total marketing services revenue in the range of 870 million to 890 million and ebitda in the range of 305 million to 312 million representing an ebitda margin of 35 we expect australia to contribute approximately 160 million to 165 million in revenue and expect an average fx rate for australia of aud0 73 to the u s dollar as joe alluded to earlier we closed the vivial transaction in january we expect vivial to contribute approximately 70 million to 75 million on a full year basis and will represent a headwind of approximately 200 basis points to total marketing services ebitda in 2022 consistent with previous calls we will provide quarterly ranges for marketing services revenue for the remainder of the year which can be found in our fourth quarter investor supplement materials on our website we provide these figures because sales canvas process allows for strong visibility into future revenues and because print publication timing is not generally consistent quarter to quarter now i will turn the call back over to joe joe walsh chief executive officer and president thank you paul so as you can see we are really proud of 21 we made a lot of key investments that paid off beautifully during 21 and that growth carries through to 22 and will benefit mightily from the stance that our board is authorized to be more on a growth footing as we go into 22 i think we can deliver durable saas growth the investments in engineering product international expansion and go to market are driving growth on more and more vectors were hitting on more and more cylinders as we move forward here and i think we are doing a really good job of balancing the tension between delivering profitability and staying on top of this unstoppable trend that i have been describing today we are very familiar with the kind of the rule of 40 and you will know that this business in the second quarter of 2020 was delivering in the team s ebitda margins so it s really a fairly recent choice that we ve made the step on the gas and accelerate that investment so our path back to profitability is crystal clear we can just sort of let up a little bit on how fast we are investing in that international expansion and some of the engineering things that we are doing and return to profitability and delivering 20 of the ebitda line and 20 growth is not out of reach at all for us we have chosen to really stay on top of this because we see this unstoppable trend that we really feel that we can ride so the path to profitability is crystal clear for the company we got an investor day coming up in early april registration materials are on our website this event will be focused on the long term we are going to be looking at the decade of smb saas talking about how thryv will lead small businesses in the u s and around the world on to the thryv platform and then add interconnectivity with lots of other tools and functions that are out there so that you can really live in your thryv and run a small business reach in your pocket manage your business from your pocket and we think that that is where the marketplace is going and we are out in front of it we are in pole position to lead that we are also going to talk about our marketing services business and how it evolves over the balance of the decade and how the interplay between the two companies work make no mistake these two businesses belong together they are benefiting mightily by being together so we will talk about that and lay out our strategy and our thinking so with that let me turn it back to the operator questions answers operator thank you your first question today comes from the line of arjun bhatia with william blair your line is now open arjun bhatia william blair analyst perfect thank you for taking my questions joe you mentioned and i saw the slide deck in the presentation about all the awards you received for your saas platform in 2021 there is g2 capterra many others i am curious what role you are seeing that playing in just building brand awareness for thryv saas solutions and then for the new customers that you are attracting to the platform do you have a sense for how much of that is competitive consolidation meaning they are using a saas solution already and they want a more full platform that they are getting with thryv versus a greenfield opportunity where customers are adopting real software solutions for the first time joe walsh chief executive officer and president thanks arjun it s kind of a mix i am starting with the second part of your question we are still every day bringing a lot of unclouded into the cloud for the first time these tend to be a lot of our service based customers maybe people who are very skilled at their craft or their industry but didn t have super high educational attainment and maybe weren t thinking about modernizing and our business advisor working with them on their advertising their marketing services stuff has been suggesting that they solve some of their business problems using thryv software perhaps for a couple of years and they are moving over and so a lot of times we are introducing people to the potential of what s possible in the cloud and i would say that s still the majority of customer acquisition but increasingly we are finding people who have started to use the point solutions particularly the ones that come in through our websites your first question was does winning these awards help us at all and what we are seeing as a company is very strong growth in our organic traffic coming into our websites and that s people hearing about us in the market that s people may be looking at the reviews that s people that are beginning to source something like this and it s nice because it s you are not out advertising to get them they are just sort of coming to you organically which is really nice one other area i just want to highlight that i don t know that a lot of our investors have thought about but because we sometimes talk about serving our standing accounts as hunting in the zoo calling on our friends there is one piece that is just really impressive to me that just keeps growing and that s the amount of new business that s coming from that base meaning they are referring their friends to us so the guy is out on his saturday morning golf group and his buddies complaining about how difficult social media is and how he is struggling to try to figure out digital or electronic payments or whatever and they are strolling down the fairway and the guy says well i am using thryv i should introduce you to my business advisor who could help you with that and we are getting about a third of all of our business coming in it s coming in from that referral out of that base and it s growing it s growing really nicely so i think just to sum up the answer to your question the awards are just a telltale piece of the reputation that s growing around thryv and i think you asked how many people are coming from other software solutions that was a tiny tiny trickle a year ago we are seeing it a little bit more now where people have maybe experimented with a point solution and are now moving up to a more complete kind of small business enterprisewide thing sort of like a little salesforce com for a small business where they are able to do a lot of things under one login and they can share login credentials or provide a login credential to their staff and they can all communicate and see the same details about their customers so yes i think the awards are helping arjun bhatia william blair analyst awesome that s very helpful and then just one follow up for me on the saas guidance it seems like the numbers imply there is going to be a pickup in net revenue added in the in the back half of the year at least in the last three quarters of the year i am curious is that are you seeing international in australia and vivial start to layer in the back half of the year are there other drivers that we should be thinking about that will come after q1 in the saas business that we should consider when we are thinking about how the year unfolds joe walsh chief executive officer and president yes you are leading the witness that s exactly you got it exactly right australia is really beginning to hit thryv we were very careful to make sure that we got high engagement and happy good users established there last year and we are beginning to really accelerate now the growth there and we are hunting at a very big zoo it s a large customer base there we have the company that we bought sensis was more than 100 years old an iconic brand and the trusted company within that market so it allowed us to become big and important there right away so we wanted to really tread lightly and be absolutely sure that everything worked and worked well in that market and so yes we anticipate that accelerating through the year we are seeing it as we speak and i was looking at this morning sales report from the overnight there australia another really good day yesterday it s accelerating nicely that s one piece vivial we only just acquired so if any benefit we get from that will be in the second half as we get everything wired up get everybody trained and get going on that so that will be a list in the second half and you are i think aware that we have been building a franchise multi location product hub for franchise and we ve been building out that functionality and for two years we couldn t go to franchise shows and that s really the heart and soul of the franchise business is going to these big franchise shows and conferences there was one weekend before last in san diego and we were there and we were there with a booth and we were there in spades with meeting lots of people and if that business is really beginning to develop now that it s come back online in person and we have got a pretty big reputation within franchise i just on monday was checking in with a 48 location franchise company that joined us last year and he has got very clear plans to grow his franchise operation to 100 locations over the next couple of years and after an exhaustive search they looked at a dozen different platforms they selected thryv as their sort of operating system that they are going to use and this guy couldn t be any more happy with the onboarding process and the services he has been getting and he and i discussed a couple of things that he has got suggestions that we are working on for him and he was really happy with how that s going and what s exciting about that is that these franchises typically sign up for three year contracts with us and they escalate on their own i mean talk about nvr i mean this guy he realizes his plans is going to more than double the size of his relationship with us over that period of time so that s been a big part so in terms of kind of growth vectors you threw out a couple of them that still and those are going really really well and we have also been innovating our local sales channel we have extended the life of our print directories out a little further which has created even more selling time for our local sales force we have been introducing some other innovations in how we sell and how we work so that productivity on a per ba basis per business advisor basis has been steadily rising so as we implement the balance of that plan we see that continuing to accelerate through the year so really i wish everything would happen instantly but it kind of takes time when you are developing some of these things and we see them continuing to grow through the year so thanks for that question arjun bhatia william blair analyst perfect thank you joe and great job on the quarter joe walsh chief executive officer and president thank you operator your next question comes from the line of scott berg with needham your line is now open scott berg needham and company analyst hi everyone congrats on the good quarter i guess two questions for me let s start off with the year ahead here joe talked about your saas subscriber growth of 5 in the fourth quarter and you expect it to increase to a double digit level here in calendar 22 how much of that kind of increase or shift do you think is related from some of the smaller marketing excuse me smaller saas customers that churn starting to kind of peak and get in the background versus your increase in sales and marketing efforts over the last year just driving that net new customer increase higher joe walsh chief executive officer and president i think there is some of each i mean as many of you are aware we now several years ago at this point experimented with a lighter version of thryv offering at a lower price point with a kind of sign up by yourself motion online and it did bring us a bunch of customers but it also brought us unengaged customers and churn we didn t want and we just really came to the conclusion that s not where we want to be in the market it would be like selling an iphone for 200 we just didn t want to do that this is an aspirational product it s by far the highest quality product in the market it s the iphone pro in the market it s a really really high end high quality product so we decided to just nip that in the bud after that experiment and we took it out and sent out now for quite a while but the bulge of customers that have brought us took a while to kind of churn off and we have been in the prior couple of years kind of running on a treadmill where we would add a 349 subscriber and lose three of the 99 month guys and we were probably a little bit ahead on money but it looked like we were going backward in terms of subscribers and so that s mostly done now and so part of what you are seeing in the subscriber acceleration is just we are not running on that treadmill anymore i am not saying there aren t a handful still rolling off but for the most part that s out of the numbers so that s a piece of it and that s a piece of why in the second half of the year you saw it getting stronger and stronger and then the other piece is as you say we have been building a more robust dedicated sales motion around this product and i know i said it a minute ago but i want to get props to our very large local sales force they have really innovated and really figured out how to increase productivity on a per business advisor basis very steadily i mean year over year almost quarter over quarter they have been expanding their sales throughput and that s continuing to happen and the innovation in the marketing services business we have extended the life of our print directories they used to be 15 month publications they are now 18 month publications and that extra time gives a lot of open real estate we call it kind of opportunity zones for our reps to really focus more on the saas products so between that and the other innovations that they have done we are getting more productivity there so we are quite confident that you will see a desirable blend of subscriber growth and arpu expansion this year we were asked more times than i can count last year what we see that you are expanding arpu what we see your revenues growing very nicely but we are worried that it s coming from the same size base and you can t sustain that and we of course realized that and are working very hard here in the u s to grow our subscriber base in addition to that we are expanding internationally we are obviously in australia we just entered canada and we have designs on additional markets and where there is a lot of investment going into building international because those markets need thryv as well scott berg needham and company analyst super helpful there joe and then from a follow up question perspective is on thryvpay i believe you ve had the product in the market a little bit more than a year now how should we think about the traction in the product obviously more customers are using it than when it first got launched but if we think about i don t know ticket sizes or frequency of use on a per customer basis any other details are on some of the maybe underlying trends or traction in that solution that you are seeing that might be helpful to us thank you joe walsh chief executive officer and president sure yes it s continuing to just melt up in a relatively steady way as we i think talked about before it s not these are not like buy a pack of gums and some cigarettes kind of transactions these are more kind of 400 a month transactions on average so these are people get getting a deposit for a kitchen remodel and they are running 1 500 or 2 000 through it or a plumber coming out to pop a new hot water heater in for you and you paying over thryvpay it s that kind of stuff these are good sized transactions and we are seeing the number of transactions steadily and slowly rise and we are seeing the number of merchants signed up and actively using it steadily rise the one area that has been a little more treacherous and we have gone a little more slowly with thryvpay premium meaning you can go get thryvpay in the app store either google play or iphone app store and download it and sign up and begin to use it we have had to go really slowly and really carefully there just to avoid any kind of fraud or any kind of problems and that s been we kind of thought before we started into it that we would be able to really ramp that quickly and we have decided and we have ended up realizing that it needs to ramp a little more slowly but it is ramping and in rough terms the volume that we saw in 21 coming over the transom on thryvpay in very broad strokes will double at least going into 22 just based on the trends that we are seeing and the gradual but steady uptake of thryvpay premium which we think is a little bit of a trojan horse help us meet new customers that will eventually buy the broader thryv solutions so thryvpay is a big big positive for us and something that we are really excited about we don t make very much on the revenue i don t want to get too excited that if there is a 100 million plus on revenue what does that pencil out to we are really doing it as a convenience for our customers as a lock in when your software is paying you you don t tend to churn you just don t so but thryvpay is a big strength for us scott berg needham and company analyst great thanks for taking my questions congrats again joe walsh chief executive officer and president thank you operator your next question comes from the line of daniel moore with cjs securities your line is now open daniel moore cjs securities analyst good morning joe and paul and thanks for the detail and taking the questions maybe digging into the saas growth guide a little bit for 22 i think you mentioned double digit client growth maybe just talk a little bit more about your expectations both for arpu growth and client growth and what s embedded on the saas side in australia if it s somewhere in the deck and i missed it i apologize but just trying to tease that out a little bit more thanks joe walsh chief executive officer and president yes i don t want people to think australia is the same size as the united states it s more like the same size as texas i mean it s going to be an important growth driver for us this year but it s not like a whole another u s coming on stream or something like that so they are growing they are growing nicely and they are going to really flatter our growth because their comp for last year is so small so it will be very important back to your question about how we see arpu and sub growth working together there is a lot of momentum and a lot of rise in the arpu growth is going to continue to rise i think i have mentioned before if you look at like a hubspot that s above us in the market they get about 11 000 per subscriber per year we are at four there is a long gap between there we have a roadmap with additional products coming we have an investor day coming up in april we are going to share some of that that we believe will continue to propel arpu up and our current offering even before we add anything we see customers coming in at the entry level is kind of a good better best construct here and they often pretty quickly upgrade themselves to higher levels of thryv there are so many thryv s add ons that we are able to offer them and we see people self upgrading to those add ons which is pretty exciting and then of course we have a monetization team who is actually teaching coaching showing people how to use more aspects of the software and they tend to take a lot of orders to upgrades too so the general upgrade motion and momentum is very much underway and building and the big arpu gains that you saw over the last most recent periods part of that came from burning off those lower value ones i mentioned in the earlier part of the call maybe a 99 customer going away replaced by a 349 that s going to move your arpu up as i mentioned that trend is mostly behind us now we are looking at more just genuine people upgrading as you see us integrate these acquisitions the sensis acquisition the vivial acquisition they had various digital product offerings some of which we have been mapping over to our products and we will be doing some migration bringing some of those customers over and depending on how all this plays out still early days but that could end up adding a few subscribers that are less than the full rate card as we are trying to kind of offer them the migration and kind of finding a way to map them over and so arpu may not just go straight up on a rocket ship straight line if we add a little burst of some lower value ones or something but these are not we are never ever going to offer the product like we did have a stripped down lower price version to be more just finite groups of people as we are integrating these products together so i wouldn t be surprised if arpu doesn t go in a perfect straight line it might be a little bit bumpy as we saw some of these customers but i think overall for the year you will see a nice kind of two horse race thereof subscriber growth into the double digits and arpu continuing to move forward so that it will drive up to that 20 plus growth that we are guiding to daniel moore cjs securities analyst very helpful and i think you partially answered my next which was just in terms of globally thinking about saas pricing do you see opportunities to take pricing given that big gap between yourselves and hubspot to the world or is it more likely to come through additional functionality as we move forward joe walsh chief executive officer and president i think it s more additional functionality and add on sales i will concede to you as our investors here there is a little bit of unbundling going on right when we started we sort of put the kitchen sink and made that sale and as time is going by there is sort of a very subtle unbundling going on and that unbundling has the effect of driving arpu and driving rate even though the basic prices of the thryv offerings 199 349 and 499 have been the same for quite a while we haven t been imputing a rate up into that one of the things we are really proud of is we think we have world s best churn when you look at feeling in the very small business sector we don t have any big companies at all in our base this is all very small businesses and our season churn is 1 5 which we have never seen anything like this we have looked and talked to everybody we possibly can and that s been our focus is just not just serving but literally thrilling one customer at a time and they become now sources referrals and are a big source of the melting up growth that we are seeing so we aren t anxious to take the base prices and just start jacking them up which is not to say we never would we just i mentioned before we are an aspirational brand in the market we are quite a bit more expensive than a lot of these other point solutions and the point solution providers sort of exaggerate the capabilities what they have a lot of time and try to make it sound like it was just like we do advise even though maybe they do 120 out there or 220 so that drives that and so we are conscious that it s competitive market and in such a with so much liquidity in the market you have got a lot of money out there financing all kinds of deals we want to ensure that we remain really competitive so we have decided at least up until now not to raise the base rates but there is very strong rate coming through that unbundling and the sort of the up sell motion that you see daniel moore cjs securities analyst really helpful last just a quick clarification that i was listening and typing but vivial 70 million 75 million of revenue did i hear that correctly and what was the projected ebitda for 2022 and those are not included in your marketing services in ebitda guidance i assume just want to verify that thank you joe walsh chief executive officer and president yeah well as we have said we paid 21 million for it we have been honest about that it s only about that and we told you that we like to bring these acquisitions in on a two times post synergy basis so for 2022 you don t get a full year of the deal because we bought it at the end of january so it s sort of like 0 11 so it s not a perfect math otherwise you could take kind of 0 10 or 0 105 divided into year 21 and you would be all done it s more like kind of 0 08 or 0 09 that it will be for the year because it s just a sort of a partial year but and yes you had the revenue right we think it will bring up i forget the precise number but right around there 70 million 75 million in revenue this year daniel moore cjs securities analyst all right that s helpful i will follow up with any others thank you joe walsh chief executive officer and president ok thanks operator your next question comes from a line of zach cummings with b riley securities your line is now open zach cummings b riley financial analyst hi good morning paul and joe thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the solid end of the year joe can you talk a little bit more about some of the plans saas investments that you are making this year i mean obviously you are continuing to still lean into the momentum that you are seeing on that side of the business joe walsh chief executive officer and president yes one of the things that you will notice if you really study the numbers is a little front loaded the way we made the investments we are really putting a lot into engineering and products and trying to get some of these things done quickly and early some of the integrations that we have come up with that makes the product much easier to adopt and use you meet a customer and he says well i am on this point solution and you are able to say oh no problem we integrate with that it s really really makes the conversation flow from there because i don t know if you know this but small businesses hate data entry they don t do data entry so when they hear that the two tools just connect to an api and integrate it makes adaption snaps so that s been really good so it is a little front loaded we also i am not going to make any secret of it we are working hard at international expansion at the moment and so there is some engineering things that we need to do there is gdpr compliance that we need to do there is a lot of things that we are working on that we kind of front loaded a little bit into the year so i think most of you are aware that this is a fully scaled already profitable saas company we have just made a recent choice to step up investment that s pushed it into a small ebitda loss which is no big work because we are making 300 million plus on the other side of the house it s just the choice so we have to have even if you look at this year by the time you get to the back half of the year losses in the final quarter will be very small because we kind of front loaded it so basically those are the areas products and engineering international a little bit on go to market there were some things we need to set up and to do that we kind of pulled it in the front part of the year so we get the benefit of the whole year that s your answer zach cummings b riley financial analyst understood that s helpful and nice to see the strong saas guidance especially in the current market environment comping a pretty tough year from 2021 but just given the current environment with some of the inflation numbers have you seen this impacting any of your customers in terms of sentiment or willingness to spend in the current environment joe walsh chief executive officer and president look sales are very good at the moment i have just first thing i do every morning is i get up and look at the volumes from the prior day which i get early in the morning and i have already gone through them today and we had another really great day yesterday so we are building momentum beautifully but i talk to customers every week it s a part of my week every week just have a free flowing chat with our customers and i never stopped most of my other executives do the same thing just trying to stay really close to our customers and we spend time talking to our business advisors about what they are hearing and what they are seeing we are not getting this from reports which is the reason of live conversations we are having with people and i hear gas prices being brought up by a lot of people that have trucks on the road because they are sort of freaking out that rates are going up and one only needs to turn on the news and see that they are going to stay up for a while and so that s got people just grousing and uncomfortable supply chain issues have caused a lot of the contractors just try to get a sub zero refrigerator right now it s like 11 months late or something like that or any kind of other no fancy or custom things it s just really tough to get things to supply chain and that s something that we constantly hear the great resignation we hear a lot about people have a tough time right now keeping their staff and are having a tough time attracting employees and so we hear a lot about that well we don t hear curiously is people complaining that they don t have enough work they are getting jobs or getting calls or getting sales it s more fulfilling it that s the hard part they feel a bit of a squeeze so i would say in my little survey which is ever ongoing talking to these local businesses small business sentiment is medium at the moment not terrible but it s certainly not great it s not as good as it was at points over the last year and we took all that into account when we guided the way we got it we want to we take very very seriously the promises that we make to our investors this is not my first public company experience or paul had spend a lot of time making sure that we can fully deliver on the commitments that we make so yeah we took all that into account when we set dimes where we did zach cummings b riley financial analyst understood it s helpful and paul for my last question in terms of capital allocation how are you thinking about free cash flow generation and potentially using that excess cash for either debt pay down versus additional m a paul rouse chief financial officer we get this question just about every call right now we are focused on paying down the debt as rapidly as possible if we happen to come across another vivial where it s very attractive but we consider that absolutely but at the moment we are going to be focused on debt repayment zach cummings b riley financial analyst understood that s helpful color thanks for taking my questions and best of luck in the quarter head joe walsh chief executive officer and president if you don t mind i would like to just expand on that just a little bit i think might be helpful for the broader audience i want to be clear that acquisitions are not our plans we feel like we can accomplish the entire mission here without acquisitions we have an organic plan to grow around the world and build our saas business i would describe acquisition for us as more opportunistic if we can get them in call strike zones which costs cheap by the way if we can get them in strike zones then we do it and we had actually been talking with vivial about this combination for six years six years and they just finally decided that it made sense to do it at a price that we could do it so we have such conversations going on all the time we are pretty active out there but i just want to be clear don t take this away that there was a roll up or that they are going to just make one acquisition after the next it s been a year since we made an acquisition sensis and it might be a year or more before we make another one we are not spending all of our time looking at deals we are planning to grow our business organically we have the engineering talent to develop our software the way we want and we feel confident that we can expand and we have figured out how to do that without acquisition so if you hear us talking about an acquisition it will be because it hit our very disciplined strike zone operator your last question today comes from the line of shrenik kothari with baird your line is now open shrenik kothari baird analyst hey good morning joe and paul this is shrenik on for rob great quarter and exciting shift toward subscriber growth versus just arpu as the growth lever i think you have said 70 of your clients coming in are new company and an inbound marketing partner etc and new channels contributing about one third if i caught that right up nicely from about 15 or so sometime back if i recall that right so if we can speak to the mix of that growth as a percentage and a little more granularity in terms of partners we sell those franchisee channels inbound marketing and referrals that would be great joe walsh chief executive officer and president yeah i don t know that i have lots of really specific details for you i don t know paul if you or cameron any other guys there have that and i can speak actually to what we are doing but i don t know that i can parse that into specific little pieces for you i don t have it really our franchise motion is building beautifully and they have already signed up in 22 more than they did in 21 i mean they are they are rocket and as i have said we kind of finally let them out of their home offices get out and see people and it s made a really really big difference and yes our partner and affiliate network is building and we are seeing that we have a lot of optimism about that and i have talked about this before our inbound motion is just really boring sorry and bouncing if you are listening it s just one foot in front of the other every quarter we add a few more leads to the top of the funnel every quarter we add a few more sdrs and people talk to them and every quarter we close a few more it s really really boring we are just one step at a time and you might say well joe why don t you go faster and that s because it would get inefficient really quickly if we went faster we kind of cannot run our supply line we cannot run the rate at which we are growing organic traffic because you have a really strong mix of organic traffic into the lead flow or your cost of acquisition to lifetime value start getting out of whack and that s the reason we just don t go straight up with this thing because we would be like a lot of other software companies that we have seen that every new dollar revenue costs them the dollar which seems like madness so we are allowing that to bubble up at a rate that we feel comfortable with and i would say the blend between those three things it s really a nice blend and each has slightly different economics but overall they fit beautifully into our plans shrenik kothari baird analyst got it thanks a lot joe really helpful and then one quick one for paul maybe i think you have talked about the strategic investment and go to market in the deck and the call so in the context of the medium term ebitda margin target just set out looks like low mid teens what timeline should we be thinking of as of now just your color there paul rouse chief financial officer i am sorry you want more clarity on what the shrenik kothari baird analyst on the timelines around the medium term ebitda margin target that you set out in the analyst day like just some rough ballpark timelines joe walsh chief executive officer and president i think paul drilling in on the saas piece of it when we are going to allow it to pop back to profitability and i will let you talk them out trample on you but i just want to be clear to the group here it s just a choice that we make we sit in the room with our board and we decide what we want to invest if we were to decide that we wanted ebitda profitability within a quarter or two quarters we could be back delivering in the teens ebitda margin this is the underlying software business is currently fully scaled and fully profitable we are just taking advantage of the fact that we make so much money on the marketing services side and we have a lot of flexibility in our capital allocation and debt structure to choose to take 25 million or 26 million and put it on international expansion and faster growth process we are not diluting our shareholders by raising new equity we are not doing round a round b round c we are not doing any of that stuff this is just us deciding just to benefit from these two attached businesses and if for any reason we decided that what we it s very important that we run this at a breakeven or a profit we can just slow down a little bit how fast we are pushing the international envelopes or how fast we are pushing the product roadmap and allow that profitability to come through so i want to be clear it s a choice right now we haven t constructed a plan that says we are going to we are going to switch to more of a profit footing we are kind of taking it one year at a time with our board and our board was really very very happy with what we were able to do last year they gave us a very modest little investment and we turn that into an roi return on investment that was extraordinary to the point during the year that we are going well could you invest more and we put a little bit more in and that was the backdrop for 22 was we were keeping losses at about the same level as last year as a percentage comes with a little bit more as absolute dollars because the company is bigger but i just want to be clear this is not a money losing business that we could find a way to get a tourniquet on these are considered investments one at a time that we are making on a profitable business so paul i didn t mean to trample on your answer but if you have more to add you can i just i wanted to make sure we are clear about that shrenik kothari baird analyst thanks joe that definitely makes sense appreciate the color and you had a great quarter again thanks joe walsh chief executive officer and president thank you operator this concludes our q a as well as our conference for today thank you all for attending joe walsh chief executive officer and president i am just going to make yes i was just going to make a wrap up comment or two and then we will break away here so we believe that this is the decade of smb saas we think that last decade enterprises move to the cloud and small businesses kept doing things the way they had in the past this decade we think smbs will move to the cloud by the balance by the end of the decade we think it will be standard operating procedure to reach into your pocket punch a button see your thryv pop up and look at the details of the customer you are about to meet with the documents have been shared what their last payment was what they bought last time who the decision makers are it will all be right there touch a button in your pocket and we think that that s where the market is going and we are working to keep up with that adoption curve we think it s an unstoppable trend that it s going to happen with or without thryv we happen to be leading it or in pole position to capitalize on it but the choice that our board has made is to step up investment a little bit is to stay on the front edge of that wave and we think that s a good decision we are excited about it we think that there is durable growth available for this company for more than a decade looking out just in the market adoption of tools that we offer we see a clear path back to profitability anytime we make that choice so thank you very much everybody for listening to the call operator duration 68 minutes call participants cameron lazard investor relations joe walsh chief

advertisement article continues below this ad connectifact rating false local news outlets quickly picked up on the allegations made against blumenthal last month in the washington free beacon including hearst connecticut reporter julia bergman who wrote about the senator s rebuke of the claims during a campaign stop in guilford last month levy s campaign however took those existing claims a step further by stating in an email to her supporters that the senate ethics committee had launched an investigation into blumenthal s financial disclosures however that is not true the source for levy s claim appears to be another report published feb 28 by the free beacon which was linked to in the greenwich businesswoman s campaign email the very first sentence of that article however begins a watchdog group is calling for an ethics investigation advertisement article continues below this ad the group referenced in the article the foundation for accountability and civic trust is a right

into that complaint as part of a preliminary inquiry to determine whether there s any basis for the alleged violation and whether it falls into the committee s jurisdiction that inquiry does not qualify as an investigation however as staff are required to look into every complaint no matter how frivolous once staff complete their initial inquiry the committee itself must vote to dismiss the

monthly reports from the u s department of agriculture are normally the main event for grain traders on the day of issue but war in ukraine and volatile wheat and oil prices put the agency s numbers on the back burner on wednesday market participants have been trying to figure out what the loss of grain exports out of ukraine and russia will mean in the short and long term and it was uncertain what usda would do with those numbers this month if anything usda cut 12 or 7 million tonnes total from ukraine and russia wheat exports in the current 2021 22 year reducing their combined export share to a still massive 26 from 29 most of those losses went into the countries respective stocks stocks to use among global wheat exporters had been set for an all time low of 12 7 but the black sea adjustments put that supply versus demand ratio at 14 that is down from last year s 15 and the second lowest all time after 13 in 2007 08 the last time wheat prices were as high as current levels india and australia picked up some of those lost exports but overall global exports were pegged down from last month however they are still above the predictions from a few months ago when grain prices were near recent minimums demonstrating how steep prices have not exactly killed off demand particularly versus initial expectations usda took ukraine corn exports down by 6 million tonnes 18 and added nearly 2 million worth of business to the united states but shipment predictions for argentina and brazil were left unchanged u s corn export sales for 2021 22 are not necessarily behind the needed pace for the export bump but they cannot falter in the coming months and could use a boost they have been a bit lighter than normal in recent weeks which may not be too bad considering the high prices usda s global 2021 22 corn stocks to use was unchanged from last month in wednesday s update still at eight year lows and down slightly from last year however that same ratio for soybeans shrank a bit further keeping both the projection for eight year lows and the pressure on the upcoming u s crop that is despite a huge demand reduction from top buyer china which usda sees importing 94 million tonnes of soybeans this year versus 97 million last month and 100 million in january the agency s brazil crop peg landed below trade ideas at 127 million tonnes versus 134 million in february and 139 million in january aside from sharp losses out of top supplier brazil china s lower soybean demand goes along with its recent idea of notably cutting soybean and meal use going forward but chinese buyers are clearly concerned enough to have aggressively booked new crop u s soybeans in recent weeks instead of waiting for their normal buying period july and august when prices could potentially be lower usda reduced combined brazil argentina and paraguay soybean exports by about 6 6 million tonnes 6 7 and u s exporters were assigned just over 1 million tonnes worth of business a 2 increase many analysts had expected such a change to u s exports last month and recent sales have been abnormally strong u s soy ending stocks for 2021 22 came in at 285 million bushels the lowest estimate since september and down from 325 million last month that is above last year s 257 million but it reduces wiggle room for the next u s harvest where soybeans may be fiercely competing with corn for acres karen braun is a market analyst for reuters views expressed above are her own source reuters editing by matthew lewis

there are various factors that contribute to the savouriness of a dish for me it is the palate of the chef ciao terrazza s chef de cuisine dario busnelli definitely has that quality the half thai half italian chef whose career profile includes michelin star restaurants in europe and 5 star dining establishments in thailand and the united states was appointed to direct the kitchen of the open air italian trattoria at the mandarin oriental bangkok in 2020 busnelli was brought up in italy by his aunt years of accompanying her in the ever animated milanese family kitchen has shaped his passion for cooking it has also inspired him to often depict the culinary comfort from his childhood through his dishes however what i found fascinating during my dinner at ciao terrazza last week was his keenness to explore italian cooking heritage and experiment with new techniques in order to offer diners a greater experience obviously that requires not only good inspiration but also a trustworthy palate busnelli s cooking at ciao blends upscale trattoria cuisine with home style touches the champagne risotto mantecato with crustacean ristretto mazara red prawn burrata and lemon zest following lombard culinary tradition dishes are prepared with lots of butter instead of olive oil and an abundance of meat dairy products and pasta however as lombardy s capital city milan is the wealthiest in italy fine seafood imported from sicily is also common in meals homemade agnolotti pasta with wild mushroom and truffle mascarpone slow braised veal ossobuco with saffron risotto and gremolata fishmonger s seafood risotto and grain fed rib eye tagliata with green pepper sauce are some of ciao s bestsellers yet during my visit seven special dishes were introduced all proved a good reason for one to become a repeat guest a lovely plate of passion fruit and citrus marinated kingfish crudo with fennel crudite and kaviari caviar 1 190 baht is the chef s rendition of sicilian ceviche neat raw slices of the supple meat hamachi yellowtail kingfish were cured in a fresh mixture of orange lime lemon and passion fruit juice and then dressed with paper thin ribbons of fennel a dollop of french caviar and a sprinkle of green herb oil that provided a contrast to the fruity citrus taste the butter fried frittino di mare with basil mayo classic frittino di mare 720 baht was a scrumptious platter of atlantic sea bream fillets argentinian wild red prawns and calamari lightly battered and deep fried the tuscan way in butter the seafood which retained its crispiness was complemented by a thick and creamy basil mayo another starter polpo 890 baht was also a crowd pleaser it featured pleasingly gummy cubes of slow cooked giant octopus tossed with saffron potato needle beans and thyme poached cannellini in a lemon parsley fragrant arneis dressing chef busnelli is a true master of risotto dishes other than the popular saffron risotto and fisherman risotto his newly added creation of champagne risotto mantecato with crustacean ristretto mazara red prawn burrata and lemon zest 1 390 baht was said to have recently made the bestselling list the slow cooked giant octopus with saffron potato needle beans and thyme poached cannellini in arneis dressing the risotto rice was cooked in reduced crustacean stock with lots of prosecco wine the starch from the rice contributes to the creaminess of the dish while the bisque like stock lent it a rich flavour piquancy highlighted also was the honey sweet red prawn from the southwestern coast of sicily the prawn is best served raw and should never be cooked for more than just a few seconds still busnelli cured them with citrus dressing to give the translucent crustaceans a slight degree of being cooked helping to add multi layers of tastes to the dish were luscious whipped burrata cream and dill florets for busnelli no one makes a more delicious lasagna than his aunt but he s been trying to beat that following her recipe and technique his version of zia pina s aunt pina baked lasagna with shank ragout and aged parmesan cheese fondue 680 baht comes with a touch of specially concocted high hills herb pesto forty egg yolks were used per kilogramme of flour to make the pasta sheets the bolognese ragout was prepared with freshly minced beef or pork slow cooked with tomatoes onion celery carrots thyme and rosemary while the white bechamel sauce was given a lovely hint of nutmeg chef busnelli gave a ligurian flaire to the family recipe by garnishing the dish with herb pesto a unification of parsley cep mushrooms and basil the pesto lent to the heavenly meaty cheesy dish a nice herbal complement the special menu also has tuscan fishmonger s seafood casserole 1 980 baht bathed in the soothing seafood soup similar to bouillabaisse but minus the saffron were manila clams dutch mussels tiger prawn mediterranean sea bass and octopus our dinner wrapped up with the trattoria s much loved port wine cured apple strudel also common in northern italy with caramelised walnut and fresh berries on a bed of crema inglese vanilla custard accompanied by a silky smooth cinnamon gelato 390 baht being a riverside alfresco trattoria ciao terrazza operates seasonally during the cooler months currently the last day it is to open is march 31 it will open again in november when the wintry air officially arrives in the city hence fans of italian food better hurry and book a table marinated kingfish crudo with fennel crudite and kaviari caviar the tuscan fishmonger s seafood casserole ciao terrazza s chef de cuisine dario busnelli

and novel u s and allied and partner country export controls to ensure compliance one will need to determine at a minimum i which items of interest are identified on the ear s commerce control list as controlled for anti terrorism reasons and ii which foreign made items are produced using technology software or equipment that is subject to the ear a simplistic imprecise but nonetheless helpful way of thinking about the new controls is the following if the item at issue is of a type described on the commerce control list whether u s or foreign produced then it generally cannot be shipped from anywhere to anyone in russia or belarus for any reason without a license or other authorization if the item at issue is of a type not described on the commerce control list i e an ear99 item whether u s or foreign produced then it generally can be shipped to russia or belarus so long as it would not be for a military end use a military end user or involving an entity on the entity list the purpose of the new controls is to protect u s national security and foreign policy interests by restricting russia s access to items that it needs to project power and fulfill its strategic ambitions the rule does this by leveraging the global dominance of u s origin software technology and equipment including tooling to largely block the export and reexport of u s and foreign produced items that are essential inputs for sectors important to the russia and belarusian economies primarily their defense aerospace and maritime sectors the related purpose of the parallel controls against belarus is to restrict its access to items it needs to support its military capabilities and preventing such items from being diverted through belarus to russia the rules reflect an extraordinary amount of export control cooperation and coordination among close allies and partner countries that has not been seen since the end of the cold war in particular the allies and partner countries have agreed to a common licensing policy of denial for exports of controlled items to russia and belarus until these rules the standard had been one of national discretion which allows each country to make its own licensing decisions without a need to coordinate with other countries the allies and partner countries have each agreed to impose their own unilateral controls on items that only the united states has historically controlled namely anti terrorism controlled items until these rules allies and partner countries have been reluctant to or did not have the legal authority to impose controls on items that were not identified in one of the four primary multilateral export control regimes the rules extraterritorial controls on foreign produced items do not apply if the items are produced in countries that commit to imposing substantially similar controls to those of the united states this creates an incentive for other countries to cooperate reduces the negative impacts of unilateral controls on u s industry and reduces the incentive to design out u s origin content or items produced with u s technology or tools indeed the rules create a whole new paradigm structure and purpose for coordinated export controls that is traditional multilateral export controls since the end of the cold war have been focused on regulating weapons of mass destruction conventional weapons and the bespoke and dual use commodities software and technologies necessary for their development production or use in contrast these rules have a much broader purpose which is the plurilateral1 control over exports to specific end users and the types of items important to a country s strategic economic and military objectives in particular the white house stated that these actions will ensure that the military as well as the aerospace maritime and high technology sectors do not obtain u s technology goods and technology that can be used to support russian technical maintenance and innovation export controls are being used as and to enhance economic sanctions tools topics covered in this alert this alert describes new controls on u s origin items and other items subject to the ear new policies of denial for items that require a license the limited licensing carve out for mass market items the three new ways in which a foreign produced item is subject to the ear the expanded scope of the russia and belarus specific military end use and military end user rules the limited availability of license exceptions deemed export rule issues new controls pertaining to the occupied donetsk and luhansk regions the new entities added to the entity list new controls on oil and gas related exports the rules savings clauses this alert concludes with comments on some steps a company could take to help ensure compliance with the new rules to the extent it chooses to continue to do business involving russia or belarus this alert is not a substitute for legal advice on specific transactions particularly given the rules novelty complexity and likely evolution this alert also does not describe export controls and sanctions in place before the new rules the quickly expanding u s and non u s sanctions or non u s export controls i new controls on u s origin items and other items subject to the ear the russia and belarus sanctions with one limited exception pertaining to mass market items the new rules impose controls on exports and reexports to and transfers in russia and belarus on all the remaining types of commodities software and technologies in commerce control list categories 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9 that did not previously require a license to export or reexport to or transfer within russia or belarus these are u s origin items and foreign made items shipped from the united states controlled unilaterally for anti terrorism reasons only they include basic microelectronics category 3 computers category 4 telecommunications items category 5 part 1 encryption items category 5 part 2 sensors and lasers category 6 navigation equipment and avionics category 7 marine equipment category 8 and civil aircraft components category 9 the new controls also apply to software and technology for such items these items are identified on the commerce control list with export control classification numbers eccns that have a 9 in their middle for example eccn 3a991 describes basic semiconductors 5a991 describes basic telecommunications items 8a992 describes vessels and related engines and components 9a991 describes civil aircraft civil aircraft engines and civil aircraft components bis wrote that although such items generally are controlled at a lower level under the ear they are still necessary for the functioning of aircraft vessels and electronic items allies and partner countries have committed to using their unilateral domestic export control and sanctions authorities to impose controls over similar items exported from their countries for the same purpose bis did not explain why it did not apply the same controls to the otherwise uncontrolled items in categories 0 1 and 2 one possible answer is that bis and its counterparts in allied countries did not want to impose for humanitarian reasons controls on the protective personal equipment vaccines medical products and food testing items that are controlled for anti terrorism reasons only in commerce control list category 1 with respect to the other and very few items controlled for only anti terrorism reasons in categories 0 1 and 2 they are basically limited to ring magnets low grade ball bearings pipes tubes pumps portable electric generators machine tools and control units processing equipment common composite materials hydraulic fluids and fertilizer bis and the allies probably decided that such items do not fit within the broader policy objectives of imposing new controls on items necessary for the functioning of aircraft vessels and electronic items in russia or belarus the march 2 rule also imposes controls on the export and reexport to and transfer within belarus of items on the commerce control list controlled for nuclear non proliferation np reasons this and related country group changes are regulatory housekeeping to account for belarus being a member of the nuclear suppliers group and the broader objective of imposing controls and denial policies on all items described in a multilateral regime s control list these new controls will not apply to the export reexport or transfer of ear99 items unless a proscribed person or end user such as a company on the entity list or a military end user or a prohibited end use such as one related to weapons of mass destruction or military end use is involved ear99 items are those that are not described on the commerce control list the apparent purpose of not imposing controls on ear99 items generally is to limit the impact of the new rules on consumer items that civilians purchase and use that is a rough surrogate for items commonly purchased at retail outlets for civilian applications are the items not identified on an export control list ii new policies of denial for items that require a license under old or new export controls for items that have previously required a license for exports or reexports to or transfers within russia or belarus and for all items that have new license requirements involving russia or belarus the license policy is now one of denial with limited exceptions a policy of denial is slightly more restrictive than a policy of presumptive denial which can be overcome in rare circumstances if there is a reason consistent with u s policy it is also much more restrictive than a case by case policy which depends upon the facts of each application the choice of a policy of denial standard rather than the more traditional presumption of denial standard was presumably made in part to align with the eu and other countries articulation of their licensing policies and to reinforce the unique seriousness of the issues pertaining to russia s further invasion of ukraine and belarus enabling of it the exceptions to the denial policy pertain to exports reexports and transfers of items related to safety of flight maritime safety or civil nuclear safety to meet humanitarian needs in support of government space cooperation for companies headquartered in country groups a 5 or a 6 to support civil telecommunications infrastructure or involving government to government activities the policy for such applications will be one of case by case review for example if the proposed transaction would benefit the russian or belarus governments or defense sectors or would present a risk of diversion to russia from belarus then the license will be denied if not then it might be approved depending upon the licensing agencies assessment of the national security issues involved licenses will also be denied if a military end user is involved to repeat these are not exceptions from the requirement to get a license only from the policy that the license would be automatically denied the same case by case license policy applies if the item is destined for a civil end use to a company in russia or belarus that is not a military end user and is not on the entity list or other proscribed list and that is a subsidiary of a u s company a u s joint venture or a company headquartered in country groups a 5 2 or a 6 3 or or a 6 or a joint venture of a u s company or companies headquartered in country groups a 5 or a 6 licenses for transactions involving russian or belarusian headquartered companies will be denied the a 5 and the a 6 group countries are those to which license exception sta strategic trade authorization may be used for various types of items although license exception sta is not available for any transactions involving russia or belarus bis has repurposed the pre existing lists of countries that are partner countries for various reasons to scope down the case by case licensing policy for exports to affiliates bis has the authority to consider requests for emergency processing of applications such as if for safety or human rights related reasons for other types of applications such as those involving civil end users that are one of the types of subsidiaries of or joint ventures with companies in sta countries or the united states license applications are not likely going to be processed quickly these are novel licensing policies bis and the other reviewing agencies will likely need several months to gather the necessary facts and policy views to decide whether to approve or deny any particular application for this reason and because the broader policy of denial would apply to most items exporters should not plan for many licenses to be approved although the new foreign direct product rules are based on the huawei specific foreign direct product rule created in august 2020 the huawei specific controls allowed for approvals on a case by case basis if the items involved would not be for use in 5g or other applications of concern the licensing policies for the new russia and belarus related controls are more restrictive and without carve outs for items merely because they are not sensitive iii the limited carve out from the license requirement for mass market commodities and software the one carve out from the new licensing requirements is for mass market commodities and software that are classified under eccns 5a992 or 5d992 that have been classified in accordance with 740 17 which refers to the ear s license exception enc encryption and are for civil end users that are one of the types of subsidiaries of or joint ventures with companies in sta countries or the united states such mass market items are business and consumer electronics such as phones computers printers and routers and similar software available to the public at retail to have been classified in accordance with 740 17 someone would have needed to follow the steps described in license exception enc section 740 17 to properly classify the items as mass market encryption items under 5a992 and 5d992 this would involve i obtaining a formal classification determination from bis a ccats for mass market items that implement non standard cryptography ii self classifying and submitting an annual self classification report to bis for mass market encryption components and executable software or iii self classifying and internally documenting the classification for mass market items such as phones or computers there are no licensing carve outs of any sort for technology described on the commerce control list this is also the case for the limited license exceptions described below that is they only apply to commodities and software not technology iv the rules create three new ways in which a foreign produced item is subject to the ear an earlier akin gump alert described the seven ways in which a commodity software or technology is subject to the export control jurisdiction of the ear as forecast in that alert bis has created three new ways in which a foreign produced commodity software or technology is subject to the ear one way is an expansion of the scope of the ear s legacy de minimis rule with respect to russia and belarus the other two are new foreign direct product fdp rules the russia belarus fdp rule and the russia belarus military end user russia belarus meu fdp rule a novel aspect of these new extraterritorial jurisdictional rules is that they do not apply to foreign produced items that are exported from the allied and partner countries that have committed to implement substantially similar export controls as part of their domestic sanctions against russia and belarus for now these countries are the eu member states the other five eyes countries canada australia the united kingdom and new zealand japan and south korea the list of such countries is likely to grow as additional allies and partner countries agree to impose similar controls in their systems because many of these countries do not have the general authority to impose controls over items that are not identified on one of the four primary multilateral regime export control lists there will need to be new domestic laws passed to give their export control and sanctions agencies such authority a the de minimis rule applies to more foreign produced items destined to russia or belarus under the ear s de minimis rule a controlled foreign produced item is subject to the ear if it has more than a specific percentage of controlled u s origin content that would require a license to export to the destination country if shipped separately bis did not amend the de minimis rule rather the new rules make more types of u s origin content controlled for export to russia and belarus these are primarily items controlled for anti terrorism reasons only one however does not include such newly controlled u s origin content in a de minimis calculation if the foreign produced item is to be shipped from a country that has agreed to impose substantially similar controls and is recognized by bis making de minimis determinations for shipments from other countries will likely be difficult for many companies that historically have not needed to determine whether their products are or contain anti terrorism controlled items subject to the ear the issue will be particularly difficult with respect to foreign origin technology that contains any percentage of controlled u s origin technology to rely on a determination that foreign origin controlled technology is not subject to the ear because it contains a de minimis amount of controlled u s technology one must first submit the analysis to bis to conduct a one time review of the calculation methodology and wait at least 30 days before exporting in addition the rule formally designates in the ear s country groups what had been u s government policy since march 2021 which is that russia is a country subject to an arms embargo i e in country group d 5 belarus was already in country group d 5 this designation confirms that the zero percent de minimis rule is applicable to foreign produced items that contain any amount of 9x515 i e satellite related items or 600 series i e military content subject to the ear in other words if a foreign produced item contains any amount of satellite or military related content that is subject to the ear the foreign produced item is subject to the ear and may not be shipped to russia or belarus from anywhere without a license which would be denied the rule does not change the long standing ear provision that one does not consider controls imposed under the entity list provisions when calculating controlled content for de minimis purposes also ear99 content is not controlled content for purposes of the de minimis rules b russia belarus fdp rule under the new russia belarus fdp rule a foreign produced item of a type described on the commerce control list i e not an ear99 item is subject to the ear if 1 it is either the direct product of u s origin technology or software subject to the ear and in commerce control list categories 3 through 9 or produced by equipment whether u s or foreign origin that is the direct product of u s origin technology described in commerce control list categories 3 through 9 and 2 there is knowledge that the foreign produced item is either destined to russia or belarus or will be incorporated into or used in the production or development of any commodity that is not an ear99 item and produced in or destined to russia or belarus except for shipments from allied and partner countries that have committed to impose similar controls a license is required to send such items from outside the united states to any destination bis used the phrase any destination in its licensing requirement provision for the russia belarus fdp rule to address situations involving multi step manufacturing processes that occur in more than one country and in which the parties involved have knowledge that the foreign produced item being produced will ultimately be reexported or exported from abroad to russia or belarus bis also wrote that this license requirement will apply to the reexports or exports from abroad from manufacturing country 1 to manufacturing country 2 each contributing to the production chain when there is knowledge that the reexport or export from abroad of the item is ultimately destined to russia or incorporated into or used in the production or development of any part component or equipment not designated ear99 produced in or ultimately destined to russia or belarus to avoid the imposition of significant new controls on the shipment to russia of foreign made common consumer items the russia belarus fdp rule does not apply to ear99 items either as inputs or outputs c russia belarus meu fdp rule under the new russia belarus meu fdp rule with limited exceptions a foreign produced item including ear99 items other than food or medicine is subject to the ear if 1 it is either the direct product of technology or software subject to the ear i e not just u s origin and described in any commerce control list category i e not just categories 3 through 9 or produced by any equipment whether made in the united states or a foreign country that itself is a direct product of u s origin technology or software subject to the ear and described in any commerce control list category and 2 there is knowledge that the foreign produced item will be incorporated into or used in the production or development of any commodity produced purchased or ordered by any of the russian or belarusian military end users identified on the entity list with a footnote 3 designation or when a footnote 3 russian or belarusian military end user is a party to the transaction the footnote 3 entities include 45 russian entities that had previously been identified on the ear s military end user meu list footnote 3 also includes two belarusian entities the russia belarus meu fdp rule is broader than the ear s traditional military end user rules because it applies to foreign produced items that are otherwise uncontrolled if produced with technology software or equipment subject to the ear as with the russia belarus fdp rule a license is required to send from outside the united states such items to any destination except for shipments from allied or partner countries that have committed to imposing similar controls unlike the russia belarus fdp rule however the russia belarus meu fdp rule applies even when the foreign produced item is an ear99 item except food or medicine the russia belarus meu fdp rule is similar to the huawei specific entity list fdp rule because it subjects foreign produced items without any u s origin content that are otherwise uncontrolled and outside the united states to the jurisdiction of the ear because of the types of technology software or equipment used to produce them the new rule is however much broader than the huawei specific fdp rule because a foreign produced item can become subject to the ear based on software technology or equipment used to produce it from any commerce control list category not just categories 3 semiconductors 4 computers or 5 telecommunications as with the huawei specific rule but unlike most entity list controls the scope of the party to the transaction provision in the new foreign direct product rules is not limited to situations when the entity is a purchaser intermediate consignee ultimate consignee or end user in other words the rule could be triggered when a russia belarus meu fdp item is shipped to a party other than the listed military end user but when the listed military end user is somehow a party to that transaction the direct product prong of the russia belarus meu fdp rule is slightly but materially different than the russia belarus fdp rule for the russia belarus fdp rule to apply the technology or software must be u s origin the russia belarus meu fdp rule counterpart is broader in that it refers to technology or software subject to the ear which includes foreign origin technology or software subject to the ear s jurisdiction v expanded scope of the existing military end use and end user rules until the new rules the scope of the items covered by the ear s military end use and military end user rules was limited to the specific anti terrorism controlled items identified in the updated supplement number 2 to part 744 bis has expanded the scope of the items covered by the russia specific military end use and military end user rules to include all items subject to the ear including ear99 items bis has also added belarus to the military end use and military end user controls with the same scope of items as russia i e to include ear99 items although the ear lists some military end users the new rules requirements are not limited to listed entities thus it effectively creates additional compliance and diligence responsibilities because its licensing obligations apply when an exporter reexporter or transferor of an item subject to the ear has knowledge that the item is for a military end use or a military end user the ear defines these terms broadly a military end user for example can be a purely private company selling commercial items that nonetheless is providing limited support for the repair of military items thus for example one cannot send without a license a toothbrush from the united states to an unlisted private company in russia or belarus if there is knowledge that the company even as a small part of its business provides occasional support for the repair of military items to align the ear s controls against belarus with those against russia bis has also applied the ear s military intelligence end user and end use controls to belarus this now means that if anyone has knowledge that an item subject to the ear even an ear99 item is intended entirely or in part for a military intelligence end use or military intelligence end user in belarus burma cambodia china russia venezuela iran syria north korea or cuba then a license is required the amendment also means that if any u s person provides any form of support even without the involvement of items subject to the ear to such end uses or end users then a license is required which will be denied vi limited availability of license exceptions with respect to russia belarus meu fdp items license exceptions are not available except in rare cases identified in specific entity list entries pertaining to u s government activities or those involving mass market commodities or software the following are the limited number of license exceptions that are however available for items now subject to the ear under the new controls on exports from the united states and items otherwise traditionally subject to the ear the expanded scope of the de minimis rule with respect to russia and belarus and the russia belarus fdp rule license exception tmp if for temporary exports reexports or transfers of items for use by the news media license exception gov if for certain government or international organization related exports reexports or transfers license exception tsu if for software updates so long as the end user is one of the subsidiaries of or joint ventures with companies in one of the sta countries or the united states license exception bag which authorizes exports of personal baggage excluding firearms and ammunition license exception avs if for temporary sojourns of civil passenger aircraft subject to the ear in and out of russia and belarus under certain conditions the march 2 rule limited the scope of the exception to exclude any aircraft registered in owned or controlled by or under charter or lease by russia or a national of russia bis limited the scope of the exception to align with orders blocking russian aircraft and airlines from entering and using domestic u s airspace the february 24 rule allowed for license exception enc to be used to export to parties in russia other than for government end users or russian state owned enterprises the march 2 rule removed this element and added in the requirement that the export be only to civil end users that are one of the five types of subsidiaries of or joint ventures with companies in sta countries or the united states bis presumably did not want to impair the ability of such affiliates to get the software needed for cybersecurity efforts while also not allowing for a general release of other types of commodities such as some types of semiconductors and telecommunications items generally available for export under the exception to be used in the sectors of concern in any event the availability of this exception is essentially meaningless because its scope is now the same as the revised scope of the carve out from licensing obligations for mass market items if for the same types of affiliates whether bis will expand the availability of the exception for u s company employees contractors for u s companies or branch offices of u s companies in russia or belarus is unknown license exception ccd authorizes specific types of consumer communications devices and software subject to the ear to be exported or reexported to or transferred in russia or belarus so long as they are either for independent non governmental organizations or civilians who are not government officials editors of state run media organizations are considered government officials the types of authorized items under license exception ccd are those that are controlled for anti terrorism reasons only and that are consumer computers consumer disk drives solid state storage equipment monitors printers modems network access controllers communications channel controllers mobile phones sim cards memory devices consumer information security equipment peripherals digital cameras televisions radios recording devices and consumer software other than encryption source code for use with such devices license exception ccd is not a general carve out for all types of items that are consumer devices it applies only to the devices specifically identified in the exception that fall within the scope of the specific eccns noted in the exception in addition bis noted in the march 2 rule that the exception may not be used for non consumer servers consumer servers for home or personal use however are authorized under the exception to make it harder for the russian government to control the message getting to the russian people vii deemed exports the new licensing policies do not apply to deemed exports or deemed reexports that is the new rules do not impose licensing obligations on the release of source code or technology subject to the new licensing policies if released to russians or belarusians in the united states or countries outside of russia or belarus this is a break from the usual licensing policy under which the deemed export and deemed reexport rules always apply to releases to nationals of a country to which the technology or source code would need a license if exported the difference is reasonable given that the objective of the new controls is to cut off the flow of the items that key sectors of the russian and belarusian economies need to function not to address concerns about sensitive technology being released to russian or belarusian individuals outside of russia or belarus there are however deemed export and deemed reexport requirements involving foreign nationals located in or from the crimea region of ukraine and now also the so called donetsk people s republic dnr and luhansk people s republic lnr regions of ukraine bis uses the nationality of the foreign national as determined by accepted methods such as looking to the passport or other nationality document s recognized by the united states government to determine nationality the u s government recognizes passport and nationality documents issued by russia and ukraine it does not recognize crimea dnr or lnr as countries for deemed export or deemed reexport purposes this means that the nationals from the newly sanctioned regions will be treated as ukrainian or russian nationals for deemed export or reexport considerations based on the country corresponding with the individual s issued passport or other nationality documents viii comprehensive embargoes on the dnr lnr and crimea regions of ukraine the rule imposes comprehensive export controls against dnr and lnr for all items subject to the ear with few exceptions such as for food medicine and certain internet based software for personal communications these new controls generally track the sanctions imposed against the occupied regions and the existing comprehensive embargoes imposed against the crimea regions of ukraine in 2014 unlike the office of foreign assets control ofac sanctions however the ear does not have a wind down period for prohibited activities in the dnr and lnr also the ofac general licenses do not match one to one with the ear license exceptions which means that companies must analyze both sets of rules carefully to determine whether a transaction is authorized ix new entities added to the entity list a new footnote 3 entities as a result of a series of moves from the military end user list revisions and new additions the following 51 entities are now footnote 3 entities that are subject to the russia belarus meu fdp rule admiralty shipyard jsc aleksandrov scientific research technological

police and government intelligence and reconnaissance organizations b additions to the regular entity list on march 3 bis added 91 entities to the regular entity list these entities were determined to be involved in contribute to or otherwise support the russian security services military and defense sectors and military or defense research and development efforts the entities are in multiple countries specifically belize estonia kazakhstan latvia malta russia singapore slovakia spain and the united kingdom x expansion of controls on oil and gas related exports to russia also on march 3 bis expanded existing controls applicable to the russian oil and gas sector to align with eu controls on items necessary to meet certain standards the new controls specifically target russia s oil refinery sector to limit revenue russia could use to support its military capabilities the new license requirement does not depend on the knowledge of the exporter but rather applies to all exports reexports and transfers of a long list of items identified in a supplement these items relate to oil and gas refining and are identified by harmonized tariff schedule hts 6 codes and by the bureau of census s schedule b numbers xi savings clause items subject to the new restrictions under the russia belarus fdp rule and the russia belarus meu fdp rule may proceed to their destination without a license if they were en route aboard a carrier to a port of export reexport or transfer on march 26 2022 pursuant to actual orders bis did not explain why the rules have a month long delayed effective date for the new foreign direct product rules to become effective presumably the delays were inserted to give the allies and partners planning on implementing their own new unilateral controls and sanctions enough time to change their domestic laws to control such items also determining which foreign produced items are subject to the new rules will require unusually complicated fact gathering and legal analyses that have never been conducted before the effective date of all other controls is the date when the rule was filed with the federal register for public inspection the russia specific controls became effective on february 24 unless modified by the march 2 rule the belarus specific controls became effective on march 2 xii conclusion steps a company could take to ensure compliance to help ensure compliance with the new export controls companies will need to at a minimum do the following examine all planned or possible exports and reexports to and transfers within russia or belarus or involving russian or belarusian entities directly or indirectly screen such exports against the new lists of entities for u s origin items and items that would be shipped from the united states companies will need to confirm the export control classification status of the items particularly whether they are controlled for anti terrorism only reasons companies that have not had to deal with embargoed destinations have generally not needed to distinguish whether their products are ear99 items or controlled for anti terrorism only reasons because the result would not generally change any ear compliance obligations for foreign produced items not shipped from allied or partner countries companies will need to conduct the complex analysis to determine whether the new scope of the de minimis rule the new russia belarus fdp rule or the russia belarus meu fdp rule apply companies should implement or expand military end use and military end user screening due diligence processes for russia and belarus to cover ear99 items which also apply to entities that are not formally identified or listed as military end users companies will need to conduct similar efforts to determine whether the new export control rules created by allied and partner governments impose new controls on exports from such countries track developments daily as allies and partners impose new controls bis is likely to match many of the changes so that the plurilateral controls are aligned also the controls will likely expand and evolve as situations on the ground change in ukraine russia and belarus finally given the novelty of the rules bis is likely going to amend them over time it will likely also publish answers to faqs to help ensure that the rules effectively accomplish the u s government s objectives pertaining to russia and belarus with so many more ways that items can become subject to the ear it is important to remember the scope of the ear violation provision in section 764 2 e it prohibits anyone from ordering buying removing concealing storing using selling loaning disposing of transferring transporting financing forwarding or otherwise servicing in whole or in part or conducting negotiations to facilitate such activities with respect to any item that has been is being or is about to be exported reexported or transferred that is subject to the ear with knowledge that a violation of the ear has occurred is about to occur or is intended to occur in connection with the item this prohibition and others can subject someone to liability under the ear even if they are not directly involved in the export of an item subject to the ear to russia or belarus finally remember that the u s government has many different tools available to it for investigating and enforcing violations of these and all other export control rules in particular bis and other u s government officials have made clear that bis will add to the entity list any foreign companies that bis believes have continued exporting u s or foreign origin items covered by the new rules without the required licenses from the united states or allied or partner countries indeed unlike past unilateral u s controls the enforcement of the new rules will be magnified by the coordinated action of and information sharing among the united states and its partner countries 1 a multilateral control is one based on agreements of one of the four primary multilateral export control regimes such as the wassenaar arrangement a plurilateral control is one agreed to by an ad hoc group of countries using their domestic authorities to impose coordinated unilateral controls outside the scope of the items controlled by one of the four multilateral regimes 2 the a 5 group countries are

as noted in previous client alerts including here boardroom diversity continues to be an increasing focus of stakeholders ranging from legislators to institutional investors to retail stockholders in recent years their efforts have yielded significant legal developments that impose pressure and in some cases mandatory requirements on corporations to include more directors from historically underrepresented groups on their boards against this backdrop multiple stockholder lawsuits have challenged companies alleged failures to fulfill their corporate diversity aspirations by bringing fiduciary duty and securities claims against directors and officers of these companies this client alert provides an update on the landscape in which u s corporations ramp up their boardroom diversity efforts topics include 1 the legal challenges directed against state and regulatory corporate diversity requirements 2 the status of certain stockholder litigations and 3 the updated board diversity policies of proxy advisory firms and large institutional investors legal challenges directed against state and regulatory corporate diversity requirements california statutes california spurred the growing legislative movement focusing on corporate diversity in 2018 the state signed into law sb 826 a statute requiring a minimum number of women to serve on the boards of public corporations with principal offices located there even if those entities are not incorporated in california ab 979 followed two years later and extended similar requirements to the number of directors from historically underrepresented communities both of these statutes predictably have been subject to legal challenge in state and federal courts a post trial decision is pending in the first of the actions crest v padilla filed in california state court to prevent the implementation and enforcement of sb 826 asserting standing as taxpayers three plaintiffs alleged that the statute s mandate is unconstitutional in setting a gender based quota and therefore sought to prevent the unlawful expenditure of taxpayer funds to enforce it california argued that the statute did not set any quota because it simply required adding seats for women without eliminating seats for men reflecting the state s compelling interest in gender diversity a companion suit filed by these plaintiffs challenges ab 979 on essentially the same grounds with a trial scheduled to begin before another judge in california state court at the end of march together these rulings could help clarify the constitutional parameters of state corporate diversity provisions meanwhile two ongoing federal lawsuits claim that these california statutes violate the equal protection clause of the u s constitution in meland v weber a shareholder of a public company headquartered in california filed an action challenging sb 826 the district court dismissed for lack of standing only to be reversed by a three judge panel of the ninth circuit the panel reasoned that person required by the government to discriminate by ethnicity or sex against others has standing to challenge the validity of the requirement even though the government does not discriminate against him back in the district court the parties now await a ruling on a preliminary injunction motion which the state opposed by reasserting a standing challenge on the grounds that the plaintiff purportedly did not own enough stock to affect the outcome of any director election and could not have been coerced to vote for a woman when he in fact had just voted against her the same district court judge presides over alliance for fair board recruitment v weber a lawsuit filed by a nonprofit organization whose members claim to be aspiring directors or shareholders of companies subject to both sb 826 and ab 979 the extent to which corporate diversity provisions can withstand these equal protection claims remains an open question once the courts issue their rulings these cases may provide guidance on how legislators in other states can draft their own versions of these provisions as well as how corporations can meet the applicable legal standards sec order approving nasdaq s proposed rule changes signifying an increasing regulatory interest in board diversity in august 2021 the u s securities and exchange commission sec issued an order approving the comply or disclose board diversity framework introduced by nasdaq inc as discussed in a previous client alert here nasdaq s proposed rule changes require companies listed on its stock exchange to either 1 include on their boards at least one woman as well as at least one individual who identifies as a racial minority or as lgbtq or 2 file a written explanation for why they are not meeting nasdaq s diversity targets in alliance for fair board recruitment v sec the same nonprofit that challenged california s corporate diversity statutes filed an action in the fifth circuit arguing that the sec s order violated the equal protection clause the nonprofit also asserted that the sec lacks statutory authority to regulate the demographic composition of corporate boards while section 25 a of the securities exchange act of 1934 permits any person aggrieved by a final order to seek review of the order the filing of the petition does not operate as a stay of the rule status of certain stockholder litigations we have previously noted the uptick in stockholder litigation claiming that large corporations and their directors committed fiduciary duty breaches and securities laws violations in connection with alleged diversity shortcomings including here this month a california district court granted a motion to dismiss a shareholder derivative action against cisco systems inc where the plaintiff did not properly allege that the board wrongly refused its pre suit demand or that such demand would have been futile to the contrary the court pointed to the extensive investigation and review conducted by the company s demand review committee over the course of several months which involved 22 witnesses on that basis the committee found that the company had accurately described its diversity initiatives and that none of its public statements in the proxy statements reports or elsewhere were false or misleading thus recommending that the board not pursue the claims this decision is consistent with ocegueda v zuckerberg in which the magistrate judge dismissed the complaint on similar grounds proxy advisory firms and institutional investors as we previously discussed here the two largest proxy advisory firms in the united states institutional shareholder services iss and glass lewis have released their u s voting policies for the 2022 proxy season which include specific guidelines relating to board diversity regarding gender diversity iss will recommend voting against the chair of the nominating committee for companies in the russell 3000 or s p 1500 indices if there is not at least one woman on the board for companies not in the russell 3000 or s p 1500 indices this policy will be effective for meetings on or after feb 1 2023 glass lewis goes a step further and will recommend voting against chairs of nominating committees of companies in the russell 3000 index if the board has fewer than two gender diverse directors identifying as female or outside of the gender binary and against the entire nominating committee if the board has no gender diverse directors starting jan 1 2023 glass lewis will recommend voting against the nominating committee chair if the board is not at least 30 gender diverse however glass lewis current policy requiring a minimum of one gender diverse director will continue to apply to companies not in the russell 3000 index or with boards of six or fewer directors with respect to racial and ethnic diversity iss will recommend voting against the chair of the nominating committee of any company in the russell 3000 or s p 1500 indices if the board does not have at least one apparent racially or ethnically diverse member starting in 2023 glass lewis will adopt a similar policy recommending shareholders vote against the chair of the nominating and or governance committee of companies in the s p 500 index that do not disclose individual or aggregate racial or ethnic demographic information for the board finally iss will approach shareholder proposals asking a company to conduct an independent racial equity and or civil rights audit on a case by case basis considering a number of factors including the company s established internal processes for addressing racial inequity discrimination the company s engagement with impacted communities whether the company has been the subject of recent controversy and whether the company s actions are aligned with market norms large institutional shareholders including blackrock vanguard and state street have also released updates to their 2022 proxy voting guidelines that address diversity concerns for example blackrock has adopted a policy regarding board diversity that is similar to glass lewis and has stated that companies should aspire to reach 30 member diversity on their boards with at least two directors who identify as female and at least one director who is a member of an underrepresented group unlike the policies proposed by the advisory firms vanguard has not adopted minimum diversity requirements but stated it will vote against the chair of the nominating or governance committee of the company if it is making insufficient progress with regard to board diversity and state street starting in 2022 expects each of its portfolio companies to have at least one woman on the board of directors and in 2023 will increase this requirement to 30 women for companies in major indices additionally state street will vote against responsible directors if 1 companies in the s p 500 and ftse 100 do not have a person of color on their boards 2 companies in the s p 500 and ftse 100 do not disclose the racial and ethnic diversity of their boards and 3 companies in the s p 500 do not disclose their eeo 1 reports conclusion as these recent developments demonstrate boardroom diversity continues to be a hot button issue directors and executive management and their advisors should be proactive in monitoring the constantly evolving legal regulatory and private frameworks governing diversity objectives see see a number of states have followed california s lead in enacting or considering enacting some type of board diversity measure for example new york requires every public and private for profit corporation authorized to do business in the state to report the number of directors on its board and how many of them are women thus encouraging gender diversity through this disclosure based legislative regime meanwhile washington mandates that the boards of public companies incorporated in the state either include at least 25 percent women or comply with disclosure requirements see see
there is a fragment of sculpture in the national museum of scotland it is just half a hand broken off at the wrist and knuckles the rest of the figure has been lost we cannot tell who carved it or where it stood weathering before it was shattered but we do know it was the hand of a bishop raised in blessing how is this possible given that we have no context for this medieval object it is because he was wearing a glove we can see a round medallion on the back of his hand this is the clue the sign of status like a mitre or a crozier gloves were symbolic objects that set a bishop apart and often these gloves were decorated with appliquéd roundels that glinted when he blessed his congregation a new study holy hands is drawing attention to liturgical gloves their making and meaning it includes a database of all the known examples of knitted gloves that have survived in european and north american collections so far the team has identified 96 pairs or singles a few have been dated to the 12th century but most are from the 17th and 18th centuries liturgical gloves continued to be worn by bishops in the roman catholic church until vatican ii in 1962 holy hands is a remarkable survey that raises questions about ritual and relics hand skills and conservation practices it is truly interdisciplinary it marries archival research with carefully crafted experiments reconstructing the patterns of long dead knitters like the single carved hand these fragile textiles have survived when so much has disappeared that would help to explain their origins there are many gaps in our understanding but the holy hands project combines practical approaches with theology and museology to shed light on an unexpected corner of church history advertisement knitting is sometimes called the cinderella of textiles it has often been overlooked as small scale domestic and humble but the evidence of the gloves tells a different story they were made from luxury materials and often embellished with embroidery pearls or gold wrapped yarn these gloves were worked in silk using the finest needles less than a millimetre in diameter for comparison most shops now would not stock anything finer than a 2mm needle we do not know for certain whether the needles were made of toledo steel or whittled bone but it is clear that the makers were highly skilled working in the round and stitching two colour patterns on the fingers and gauntlets most of the surviving gloves used red silk but there are also white and green examples their colours still strong even after 500 years in a cathedral treasury they are small but telling witnesses to the complex trade routes and cultural interactions of the early modern world the silk thread used for the oldest pairs would probably have been harvested and spun in the eastern mediterranean but gradually silk production was established in italy around calabria to supply the growing demand from clergy or courtiers so the gloves now found in oxford and uppsala travelled long distances in their lifetime it is not known whether they were knitted by women in convents or men belonging to local guilds or both it seems that some examples in spanish collections were made by muslim knitters who supplied highest quality work to christian prelates and princes these objects demonstrate possible areas of overlap between cultures national museums scotlandthe carved hand of a bishop from a stone effigy and by gathering so many gloves in one online resource we can start to piece together stories about how far roman catholic liturgy and dress became standardised across europe from the medieval church to the counter reformation we can see regional variations and changes over time mapped out in the delicate trimmings while one part of the holy hands project looks closely at the production of these gloves the team also hopes to find out more about how they were worn and why they became part of a bishop s regalia from the mid 12th century beautiful gloves were recognised as an emblem of ecclesiastical authority as highly personal objects bishops were often buried in their gloves and there are accounts of embalmed relics being dressed in a fresh pair if the originals had disintegrated over the years a new bishop was presented with his gloves during the ceremony of his investiture just after he received his mitre he did not put them on himself instead during the consecration he was helped into the gloves with a prayer that they should represent the purity of the new man and the healing gift that he offers with his hands sometimes they were made of palest kid leather but it seems that knitted gloves were more flexible easier to slip on afterwards whenever he celebrated mass the bishop would again be vested with his gloves which were worn until the offertory they emphasised the cleanliness not only of the bishop s hands but also the ritual purity of the chalice and paten the gloves were then put on for the final blessing it is at this point that their distinctive decoration comes into focus from c 1200 pope innocent iii insisted that a golden circulus should be stitched to the back of the hand william durandus writing at the end of the 13th century and st charles borromeo in the late 16th century also noted the importance of this gold roundel very few of the gloves illustrated on the holy hands database still have their medallions they were easily unstitched and reused on other vestments but there is a well preserved pair knitted in white silk with cuffs embroidered in red and green from bressanone in the italian tyrol they are dated to the early 12th century and wonderfully are still intact the medallions are decorated with enamelled images of the virgin mary and st paul and surrounded by tiny pearls most of the surviving gloves have complex knitted patterns instead decorating the back of the hand a sun burst a cruciform design a leafy garland or the holy letters ihs many also have gold bands circling the fingers to mimic the rings which could be worn by bishops over their gloves the gauntlets are often intricately trimmed too with knitted or embroidered borders and sometimes finished with tassels these ornaments lift the gloves beyond the everyday they are not simply luxury garments but through their decoration and use they become part of a carefully choreographed sacred action the medallions and gold embroidery catch the light of the candles on the altar as the bishop raises his hands to bless the congregation the elaborate design becomes an essential part of this movement making it visible at a distance advertisement we can perhaps get a better sense of the drama and symbolism created by the medallions and sunbursts when we look at paintings made during the renaissance and counter reformation there is for example an altarpiece in the courtauld institute of st peter by lippo vanni it was made in the mid 14th century the painted panel is heavily worked in gold leaf stamped and inlaid creating a complex embellished surface what is most noticeable in this context is the decoration of the gloves the jewels on the back of the hands are very prominent they look like red garnets surrounded by a gilded hexagonal outline in fact they resemble stigmata the wounded hands of christ these markings also anticipate the wounds received by peter at his own crucifixion it seems likely that at least in this case the deliberate placement of the decoration on the back of the gloves carries this additional symbolism certainly it is an idea worth pursuing at present the holy hands project has only looked at extant gloves rather than paintings of bishops and their regalia it will be interesting to see how the researchers might integrate images such as this into their study adding a new dimension to their findings st zenobius wears some bold red and gold gloves for instance in a painting by giovanni bilivert in the national gallery london and there is a late medieval flemish triptych in the bowes museum showing a bishop with bright green gloves holy hands is led by dr angharad thomas and lesley o connell edwards and is funded by a janet arnold award through the society of antiquaries they are mentored by dr jane malcolm davies and as a result have been able to add their work to her broader study of knitting in early modern europe keme the keme website allows public access to research on knitted caps as well as gloves and it encourages skilled members of the knitting community to reconstruct the historical garments in the case of the caps this hands on approach begins with finding the right breed of sheep to provide the fleece to spin appropriate wool yarn the sheep whose fleeces provided the yarn for the 16th century caps no longer exist in part owing to changes in the agricultural revolution and the term woollen yarn in the 16th century referred to the preparation and spinning process the other main preparation and spinning process created worsted yarn and many of the caps were made from worsted yarn both lead researchers are expert knitters themselves ms o connell edwards has recreated children s petticoats and mittens for the tudor tailor a dynamic online resource for the social history of dress which offers scholarly information with a sense of humour dr thomas is archivist for the knitting and crochet guild she has been knitting a collection of personalised gloves drawing on inspiration from natural colours and forms her work is also closely connected with estonian knitting traditions as part of the holy hands study ms o connell edwards has charted some of the complex two colour patterns for the cuffs while dr thomas has concentrated on the structure of liturgical gloves recreating their fingertips this is time consuming and requires great concentration as ms o connell edwards explains there is only one way to find out how they were made and that is to knit them again lesley o connell edwardsreconstruction of a gauntlet pattern on the gloves associated with william warham at new college oxford the original has a background of red silk and the patterning is done with gold metallic thread and blue green silk covid has meant that they could not visit the collections in museums and cathedrals overseas to see the gloves for themselves the team have been working from photographs and carefully recorded notes about the gauge of yarn the direction of knitting but it is not the same as being able to hold them or turn them over it helps to take a look inside to find out how the knitter worked the silks together without wasting too much gold wrapped thread these are things that were designed to be handled and worn they are simultaneously holy and intimate they bring us closer to the men who once wore them such as william warham archbishop of canterbury his gloves are the first pair on the database and are preserved at new college oxford did the archbishop wear them when he crowned henry viii and made catherine of aragon his queen did he carry them to france as part of the magnificent display on the field of the cloth of gold and perhaps we might ask another set of questions who measured the archbishop s hand tracing his distinctive stubby fingers who spun the silk who knitted the red and green rosettes and the flaming ihs through the holy hands study we begin to appreciate the past in new ways by looking intently at the little things that have been left behind dr suzanne fagence cooper is an art historian specialising in 19th and 20th century culture and design her next book how we might live at home with jane and william morris will be published in june 2022

traced the casualties back to one nursing home chain trilogy health services owned by a real estate venture with a new business plan for the cutthroat world of eldercare the investigation this nursing home chain stood out for nationally high death rates as pandemic peaked residents at trilogy s 115 campuses died of covid 19 last winter at twice the national average for nursing homes usa today found

who were focused on individual facilities during the pandemic the project dying for care trilogy stood out among 15 000 homes usa today s analysis started with the nation s more than 15 000 nursing homes to see which had reported the most covid deaths during the winter surge a year ago after focusing on the largest chain operators and isolating those with higher than average death rates a much smaller pool emerged trilogy which is based in the midwest had homes with more than twice the national average a figure the company now disputes and says it corrected with the federal government this week see the ratings how did your nearby nursing home fare during last winter s covid 19 surge dying for care how nursing homes failed during covid 19 a usa today investigation has traced a string of casualties back to one nursing home chain trilogy health services hannah gaber usa today pressure to shrink staffing can affect care trilogy went further than any other major chain in reducing care hours delivered to residents before the pandemic by the time the pandemic started a typical resident in a trilogy home was receiving about 45 minutes less care daily from nurses and bedside aides than the federal government recommends under trilogy s staff reductions levels of certified nursing assistants called cnas fell to among the lowest levels of major operators these frontline caregivers feed and bathe residents help them to the toilet and change diapers and make sure they do not get bed sores academic research suggests that having a larger staff increased the odds of covid 19 entering a nursing home but once the virus got in more care could keep residents alive how we did it read about the data driven work behind usa today s nursing home project at waterford place health campus in kokomo indiana trilogy reported 29 deaths related to covid between november 2020 and january 2021 hannah gaber usa today warnings were missed as facilities became covid 19 zones half of trilogy s facilities were cited by health inspectors for violating covid 19 safety rules in 2020 the first year of the pandemic among the lapses written up nursing aides who dispensed eye drops lifted patients to the toilet and fed them all without properly cleaning their hands an outbreak in kokomo indiana lasted nine weeks and infected 88 residents at trilogy s waterford place health campus by the end of january 29 had died overnight the facility turned into a scene from a sci fi movie with plastic barriers and bins set out for discarded masks and gowns a cna recalled sick and frantic residents on

millions of dollars continued to flow from trilogy to a california based real estate venture busy preparing its next investment pitch a stock listing expected to launch this year in 2015 trilogy was bought by a real estate investment trust known as a reit in a 1 billion acquisition targeting the future health care needs of a booming senior population known as the silver tsunami until trilogy major nursing home operators and their reits had separated the real estate from the care delivered inside but in this case the reit purchased not only trilogy s properties but also the health care operations inside its campuses the approach meant a chance at bigger profits as well as more risk in an economic downturn the real estate venture behind trilogy came out of the winter surge with cash on hand and planning underway for its next business move what is today called american healthcare reit proposes a major stock offering it touts a now 4 billion portfolio as potentially the largest healthcare reit listing in history the stock listing proposed for later this year will explore wall street s appetite for using a federal law enabling this arrangement known as ridea or the reit

producer of crude oil after saudi arabia and the united states this has pushed up global oil prices to us 130 the highest level since 2008 average national unleaded prices last week hit a record 183 9 cents a litre australian institute of petroleum data showed australian motorists in some postcodes are now paying 2 a litre for petrol and economists predict average prices could rise to 2 20 even before the russian invasion australia last year had a headline inflation rate of 3 5 per cent a level well above the reserve bank s 2 to 3 per cent target kiyosaki s warning of hyperinflation is far fetched with australia not having double digit inflation since 1983 and even then it was nothing remotely like what occurred in 1920s weimar republic germany or more recently in zimbabwe and venezuela nonetheless higher inflation means the central bank is more likely to raise interest rates in 2022 from a record low of 0 1 per cent after last year promising to leave them on hold until 2024 at the earliest australian house and unit prices in 2021 surged by 22 1 per cent in 2021 the fastest annual pace since 1989 corelogic data showed in records going back to 1880 that was the third fastest in

home and business loans pictured is a house at strathfield in sydney s inner west between march 2020 and june 2021 the reserve bank gave 188billion to the banks to provide cheap home and business loans which kiyosaki said led to real estate speculation it s good for a while you guys can keep flipping houses all this stuff but i m doing my best to warn you that something might happen he told daily mail australia in january from phoenix in arizona you can t just keep printing money what worked up to 2022 may not work after 2022 between march 2020 and june 2021 the reserve bank gave 188billion to the banks to provide cheap home and business loans this term funding facility program to help stimulate the australian economy during the pandemic lockdowns and restrictions coincided with real estate speculation you guys are a bunch of punters you gamble a lot mr kiyosaki said i watched your properties go up and up and up and up and i got out of there there are too many aussies and people all over the world they re flipping houses i ve got to be ten times more cautious now because we have never been here none of us have ever been here none of us alive have ever been here

prices are still growing albeit at a more modest pace but westpac chief economist bill evans said affordability issues were turning off potential buyers amid forecasts of an interest rate rise in this year we re starting to see real concern with regard to the housing market he said more people still expect prices to be rising but the fall that we ve seen today could be a signal that the confidence is really starting to unravel in terms of both house prices and affordability the westpac melbourne institute consumer sentiment index for march found there was a 32 7 per cent annual plunge in the proportion of people who thought now was a good time to buy a home proptrack economist paul ryan noted the 22 1 per cent rise in australian property prices in 2021 based on corelogic data was the

410 128 reserve bank governor philip lowe had previously promised to keep the cash rate at a record low of 0 1 per cent until 2024 but this week said it was plausible the cash rate would now raise the cash rate in 2022 given the outlook though it is plausible that the cash rate will be increased later this year he told the australian financial review business summit in sydney on wednesday i

u s sen richard blumenthal d conn anna moneymaker getty images leora levy tyler sizemore hearst connecticut media connecticut is only a few months into this election season but the campaigns are already well underway that means that from now until november voters will hear plenty of claims made by hundreds of candidates for federal state and local offices while some of those claims may ring true others will prove to be misleading lacking proper context or outright false to help parse out the fact from the fiction hearst connecticut media group is launching connectifact an occasional series that will examine the truth behind statements made by candidates over the airwaves in campaign literature or in old fashioned stump speeches advertisement article continues below this ad each statement will be rated along the following scale true mostly true it s complicated and false there will also be a fifth category reserved for the most outlandish claims that fall outside the bounds of everyday truth stretching to start connectifact examines a march 1 campaign email sent to supporters by republican u s senate candidate leora levy who is seeking to unseat u s sen richard blumenthal d conn the focus of levy s email were recent claims made in a conservative washington publication about blumenthal and financial disclosures he made involving the stock trading app robinhood here s what levy said advertisement article continues below this ad claim senator blumenthal s failure to disclose large financial transactions in the required time which has triggered a senate ethics investigation is deeply troubling connectifact rating false local news outlets quickly picked up on the allegations made against blumenthal last month in the washington free beacon including hearst connecticut reporter julia bergman who wrote about the senator s rebuke of the claims during a campaign stop in guilford last month levy s campaign however took those existing claims a step further by stating in an email to her supporters that the senate ethics committee had launched an investigation into blumenthal s financial disclosures however that is not true advertisement article continues below this ad the source for levy s claim appears to be another report published feb 28 by the free beacon which was linked to in the greenwich businesswoman s campaign email the very first sentence of that article however begins a watchdog group is calling for an ethics investigation the group referenced in the article the foundation for accountability and civic trust is a right wing advocacy organization that has called for investigations into numerous democratic lawmakers and biden administration officials the article makes no claim that the committee acted upon fact s call for an investigation according to the rules of the senate s select committee on ethics anyone can file an ethics complaint against a senator or member of their staff and the committee staff will look into that complaint as part of a preliminary inquiry to determine whether there s any basis for the alleged violation and whether it falls into the committee s jurisdiction that inquiry does not qualify as an investigation however as staff are required to look into every complaint no matter how frivolous once staff complete their initial inquiry the committee itself must vote to dismiss the complaint issue an admonition for minor violations or move forward with what s formally known as an adjudicatory review which would meet most people s definition of an investigation advertisement article continues below this ad no such vote has occurred because the committee has not met since the complaint against blumenthal was filed a spokesperson for blumenthal s campaign said the senator has not been contacted by ethics committee staff including as part of a preliminary inquiry there is no senate ethics committee investigation the spokesperson said in an email a complaint can be filed by literally anyone anyone can call for an investigation but that doesn t change the facts senator blumenthal owns no individual stock including robinhood stock in response to a request for comment from hearst connecticut media a spokesperson for levy s campaign walked back the candidate s claims of an investigation while maintaining the attack on blumenthal advertisement article continues below this ad the fact is senator blumenthal failed to report a large financial transaction in the required time the spokesperson said he showed that the rules that are in place do not apply to him in this instance an ethics complaint has been filed and no amount of protesting by his staff will change those facts shannon hamilton the nonpartisan staff director of the senate ethics committee did not respond to a request for comment during the guilford campaign stop blumenthal said the allegations that he purchased and sold stocks in robinhood were ridiculous blumenthal one of the wealthiest members of congress said he does not own individual stocks the sales of the stocks in question were made by the peter malkin family fund which was set up by his father in law the wealthy real estate investor blumenthal said he does not have any control over the family s investments advertisement article continues below this ad in two separate financial disclosure forms blumenthal reported the malkin fund s four sales of robinhood stock worth between 1 26 million and 2 55 million during the last three months of 2021

new york city new york ratings agency fitch has warned that a russian default on its national debt is imminent and downgraded the country s healthy investment rating to c a recent decree by russia s president vladimir putin allowing certain foreign debts to be paid off in the plummeting ruble which is currently worth less than eight tenths of an american cent was cited by the agency amidst russia s ongoing war against ukraine which led to the imposition of severe global economic sanctions against it the agency said more generally the further ratcheting up of sanctions and proposals that could limit trade in energy increase the probability of a policy response by russia that includes at least selective non payment of its sovereign debt obligations according to bloomberg putin s decree allows russian public and private entities to pay back debt in rubles if the debt is owed to a creditor from countries that engage in hostile activities including japan the u s and eu member states the russian government has 117 million in bond debts due on 16th march and analysts are concerned that a payment in rubles could trigger a credit default swap an additional 65 million is due next week
money continues to pour into their investment funds from traditional clients such as pension funds and retirement plans but private equity firms are not only buying up companies with investors money but also putting their own money on the line with new business ventures why the term private equity is a misnomer globally private equity firms managed us6 3 trillion in assets last year more than four times what they oversaw at the onset of the financial crisis in 2007 according to data provider preqin blackstone the largest told investors this year that it was on track to manage us1 trillion 1 36 trillion by the end of this year four years ahead of its goal even the term private equity is a misnomer since many big firms are public over the past two years shares of blackstone are up more than 145 per cent while apollo and carlyle are up more than 85 per cent and kkr is up about 130 per cent the s p 500 index meanwhile rose more than 55 per cent tpg a rare company deciding to embark on an initial public offering in the midst of a down and volatile market is trading only slightly below its january offer price the performance of their stocks is a sign of the prospects for growth said jim zelter an apollo co president investors see the business model we ve created as being at the intersection of companies who need to borrow and investors who need different choices he said the industry looks far different from its early days advertisement in 1982 a private equity firm wesray bought gibson greeting cards a unit of rca for roughly us80 million wesray s two owners contributed just us1 million using debt and the sale of gibson s real estate holdings to finance the rest a year and a half later they took the company public for us290 million but first paid themselves a us900 000 special dividend the gfc provided two key catalysts wall street financiers were mesmerised by the nascent industry s ability to create giant profits with little money down over the next two and a half decades more firms were built to race into these types of deals buyouts grew in size until the 2008 financial crisis then many either fell apart as banks withdrew lending or produced abysmal returns for many years leveraged buyout volume was less than half of what it was before the crisis according to dealogic data but the crisis provided the industry with two key catalysts first record low interest rates for more than a decade have pushed investors to seek out higher returns through riskier investments particularly after the hits their portfolios took during the mortgage meltdown second as government regulations forced banks to pull back from riskier areas including high interest lending private equity firms jumped into the mix they re opportunistic companies said patrick davitt a senior analyst with autonomous research the large alternative asset managers have taken the opportunity to fill that white space left by banks apollo for example lends to medium and large corporations but also makes loans for aircraft and mortgages kkr has also built out its underwriting operation allowing the industry to take a portion of the lucrative fees associated with pricing these deals advertisement mr gray said blackstone and its rivals could make some lending activity cheaper and more efficient by lending directly in contrast to the bank approach of syndicating a loan essentially promising the money but finding others to provide it but in a hunt for more money to manage private equity did more than offer a way to bypass banks firms became landlords insurance providers and late stage equity investors in 2009 apollo helped start athene holding which sells retirement products such as annuities a type of insurance designed to boost retirement savings and reinvests the premiums athene collects by selling those products other firms followed the same path kkr bought a life insurance company last year for roughly us4 7 billion raking it in from real estate as the real estate industry teetered after the mortgage crisis blackstone used its capital to buy up and rent housing and other real estate amassing us280 billion in assets which produce nearly half of the firm s profits as interest rates rise mr gray predicted real estate will continue to help its performance rents in the united states he noted have recently risen at two to three times the rate of inflation blackstone also ramped up its business of taking stakes in fast growing companies including women s shapewear company spanx and reese witherspoon s media company hello sunshine its life sciences division has been buying pharmaceutical companies or stakes in them and also pursuing drug development in cooperation with big drug makers it plans to spend us1 billion to acquire rights to artists music through a partnership with hipgnosis song management which owns rights to the songs of neil young steve winwood barry manilow and others but mr gray said the biggest change for blackstone had come as the firm realised it could attract clients outside the typical pool of large institutional investors it historically served advertisement our industry historically catered to a fairly narrow audience of customers he said big investors long leaned on a mix of stocks and bonds for reliable returns they risked only a small slice of their holdings on private equity which requires investors to commit money for five or 10 years on average in return the firms generally aimed for returns of 15 per cent or more over longer horizons targeting everyday investors but in recent years blackstone found that everyday investors could be lured by the potential for bigger returns than they might get elsewhere mr gray said the sudden and synchronous growth of private equity s business lines and client base has added to concerns about the sway of the so called shadow banking industry which also includes hedge funds and venture capital firms the securities and exchange commission is looking at new rules that would require such entities to disclose more information about holdings fees and returns while banks that are considered important to the financial system have faced stricter guidelines on lending and risk since the financial crisis and try to avoid serious problems if a large number of companies were to suddenly default private equity firms are lightly regulated even though they don t have the same governmental backstop some critics contend that the combination of more lending and fewer restrictions could rattle the economy if the firms bets go south advertisement david lowery the head of research insights at preqin said private equity firms had been very good at selecting companies and avoiding defaults but during a time of relative stability that strength will be tested he said so far the unbridled expansion has been good for business consider the eye popping windfall received by mr gray s boss at blackstone last month for last year mr schwarzman s compensation was us160 million that was roughly 4 5 times that of the highest paid bank chiefs james gorman of morgan stanley and david solomon of goldman sachs who each received roughly us35 million and mr schwarzman s pay package was dwarfed by the dividends he earned which pushed his total haul to more than us1 1 billion blackstone s push into seemingly everything is working well for the firm blackstone mr schwarzman told investors in late january reported the most remarkable results in our history on virtually every metric this article originally appeared in the new york times

true others will prove to be misleading lacking proper context or outright false to help parse out the fact from the fiction hearst connecticut media group is launching connectifact an occasional series that will examine the truth behind statements made by candidates over the airwaves in campaign literature or in old fashioned stump speeches advertisement article continues below this ad each

blumenthal d conn the focus of levy s email were recent claims made in a conservative washington publication about blumenthal and financial disclosures he made involving the stock trading app robinhood here s what levy said claim senator blumenthal s failure to disclose large financial transactions in the required time which has triggered a senate ethics investigation is deeply troubling advertisement article continues below this ad connectifact rating false local news outlets quickly picked up on the allegations made against blumenthal last month in the washington free beacon including hearst connecticut reporter julia bergman who wrote about the senator s rebuke of the claims during a campaign stop in guilford last month levy s campaign however took those existing claims a step further by stating in an email to her supporters that the senate ethics committee had launched an investigation into blumenthal s financial disclosures however that is not true the source for levy s claim appears to be another report published feb 28 by the free beacon which was linked to in the greenwich businesswoman s campaign email the very first sentence of that article however begins a watchdog group is calling for an ethics investigation advertisement article continues below this ad the group referenced in the article the foundation for accountability and civic trust is a right wing advocacy organization that has called for investigations into numerous democratic lawmakers and biden administration officials the article makes no claim that the committee acted upon fact s call for an investigation according to the rules of the senate s select committee on ethics anyone can file an ethics complaint against a senator or member of their staff and the committee staff will look into that complaint as part of a preliminary inquiry to determine whether there s any basis for the alleged violation and whether it falls into the committee s jurisdiction that inquiry does not qualify as an investigation however as staff are required to look into every complaint no matter how frivolous once staff complete their initial inquiry the committee itself must vote to dismiss the complaint issue an admonition for minor violations or move forward with what s formally known as an adjudicatory review which would meet most people s definition of an investigation no such vote has occurred because the committee has not met since the complaint against blumenthal was filed advertisement article continues below this ad a spokesperson for blumenthal s campaign said the senator has not been contacted by ethics committee staff including as part of a preliminary inquiry there is no senate ethics committee investigation the spokesperson said in an email a complaint can be filed by literally anyone anyone can call for an investigation but that doesn t change the facts senator blumenthal owns no individual stock including robinhood stock in response to a request for comment from hearst connecticut media a spokesperson for levy s campaign walked back the candidate s claims of an investigation while maintaining the attack on blumenthal the fact is senator blumenthal failed to report a large financial transaction in the required time the spokesperson said he showed that the rules that are in place do not apply to him in this instance an ethics complaint has been filed and no amount of protesting by his staff will change those facts advertisement article continues below this ad shannon hamilton the nonpartisan staff director of the senate ethics committee did not

1 these measures are not based on accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap and are defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable gaap measures management commentary barry goldstein kingstone s chief executive officer elaborated on the company s results there are two items in the fourth quarter that i want to call your attention to first we materially strengthened our reinsurance program and reduced our exposure to large losses we suffered a 10 million loss from hurricane ida in 2021 which like hurricane isaias in 2020 was a balance sheet event reducing our capital and surplus to protect our balance sheet going forward and allow us to continue growing in 2022 we entered into a new quota share treaty this will reduce our catastrophe loss retention from the previous year amount of 10 million to 7 4 million in addition we added a layer to our single risk excess of loss treaty which when coupled with the new quota share effectively reduces our maximum exposure from an individual loss from 1 million in 2021 to 500 000 in 2022 second our premium writings increased to 50 million a quarterly record while our premium writings grew 7 for the full year led by a heightened rate of 13 in q4 the rate of growth in exposures was but 2 9 year over year this shows the vast majority of our premium growth is coming from rate increases meryl golden kingstone s chief operating officer continued 2021 was a difficult financial year for our company driven by numerous catastrophe events while we did not deliver on our financial objectives for 2021 the team made huge progress on our kingstone 2 0 goals that were mapped out in 2019 we spent a lot of time and money designing building and testing our new kingstone select products with the help and support of our select producers we began 2022 with the rollout of both select home and dwelling fire products in new york see forward looking statements financial highlights table 1 these measures are not based on gaap and are defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable gaap measures 2021 fourth quarter and year end financial review net income net income was 2 2 million during the three month period ended december 31 2021 compared to net income of 3 0 million in the prior year period the decrease in net income in the latest three month period can be attributed to the tax benefit received in the prior year period under the cares act allowing for the carrying back of 2020 net operating losses to 2015 at a 13 higher tax rate for the year ended december 31 2021 the net loss was 7 4 million down from net income of 0 97 million in the prior year the decrease in net income can be attributed to an 11 6 point increase in net loss ratio driven by increased liability claims frequency for the dwelling fire line of business as well as an increase in the number of severe fire and water damage claims in the homeowner line a decrease in ceding commissions due to the 25 personal lines quota share that was in effect during 2020 offset by the related increase in net premiums earned in addition there was a 2 0 million tax benefit received in the prior year period under the cares act allowing for the carrying back of 2019 and 2020 net operating losses to 2014 and 2015 at a 13 higher tax rate the decrease in net income was tempered by the increase in realized gains as economic conditions improved financial markets through 2021 earnings loss per share eps kingstone reported eps of 0 21 per diluted share for the three months ended december 31 2021 compared to eps of 0 28 per diluted share for the three months ended december 31 2020 for the year ended december 31 2021 eps was 0 70 per diluted share compared to eps of 0 09 per diluted share for the year ended december 31 2020 eps for the three month periods ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was based on 10 8 million and 10 7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding respectively eps for the years ended december 31 2021 and 2020 was based on 10 6 million and 10 7 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding respectively direct written premiums 1 net written premiums 1 and net premiums earned direct written premiums1 for the fourth quarter of 2021 were 50 1 million an increase of 5 8 million or 13 2 from 44 2 million in the prior year period the increase is primarily attributable to a 4 5 million increase in premiums from our personal lines business and a 1 3 million increase in livery physical damage as the economy continues to reopen and more drivers return to work for the year ended december 31 2021 direct written premiums increased 7 3 to 181 7 million compared to 169 3 million in the prior year direct written premiums from our personal lines business for the year ended december 31 2021 were 171 7 million an increase of 9 5 million or 5 9 from 162 2 million in the prior year period net written premiums1 decreased 26 8 million or 58 5 to 19 0 million during the three month period ended december 31 2021 from 45 8 million in the prior year period for the year ended december 31 2021 net written premiums increased 1 3 to 128 1 million compared to 127 1 million in the prior year the decrease in the fourth quarter and the relatively small increase for the year was attributable to the inception of a 30 personal lines quota share treaty on a cut off basis on december 30 2021 and exit from the 25 personal lines quota share treaty on a cut off basis on december 30 2020 the inception cut off on december 30 2021 resulted in the ceding of 22 9 million of unearned premiums to our reinsurers the termination cut off on december 30 2020 resulted in the return 17 4 million of previously ceded unearned premiums from our reinsurers the decrease in net written premiums in q4 and modest increase in 2021 as a result the quota share cut offs was offset by growth in direct written premiums net premiums earned for the quarter ended december 31 2021 increased 37 3 to 37 1 million compared to 27 0 million for the quarter ended december 31 2020 for the year ended december 31 2021 net premiums earned increased 33 1 to 143 9 million compared to 108 0 million in the prior year the increase in the fourth quarter and for the year was attributable to the exit from the 25 personal lines quota share treaty on december 30 2020 net loss ratio for the quarter ended december 31 2021 the company s net loss ratio was 61 8 compared to 63 4 in the prior year period the loss ratio improved from the prior year period mainly due to a decrease in property claim frequency offset by higher severity in fire and water damage claims the impact of catastrophe losses was 6 8 points for the quarter compared to 4 5 points in the prior year period there was no prior year development during the quarter compared to 1 2 points in the prior year period for the year ended december 31 2021 the net loss ratio was 70 9 compared to 61 5 in the prior year period the loss ratio was higher than the prior year period mainly due to a continuation of increased liability claims frequency for the dwelling fire line of business as well as an increase in the number of severe fire claims in the homeowner line the impact of catastrophe losses was 10 3 points for 2021 compared to 10 7 points in the prior year period prior year development was stable in 2021 and favorable by less than one point in the prior year period net underwriting expense ratio for the quarter ended december 31 2021 the net underwriting expense ratio was 39 5 as compared to 38 9 in the prior year period an increase of 0 6 percentage points for the year ended december 31 2021 the company s net underwriting expense ratio increased to 40 6 from 38 9 in the prior year an increase of 1 7 percentage points the increase in the fourth quarter and for the full year was primarily attributable to the exit from the 25 personal lines quota share treaty and the decrease in provisional ceding commissions from the prior year quota share in addition there was an increase in it in the fourth quarter and full year and professional services expenses in the full year both related to kingstone 2 0 initiatives under the kingstone 2 0 initiative the increase in expenses was partially offset by a decrease in the inspection costs in the fourth quarter and full year 1 these measures are not based on gaap and are defined and reconciled below to the most directly comparable gaap measures balance sheet investment portfolio kingstone s cash and investment holdings were 237 9 million at december 31 2021

decrease in aoci at december 31 2021 of 8 1 million is attributable to the increase in realized gains from investments previously included in aoci and the increase in interest rates since december 31

measures direct written premiums represent the total premiums charged on policies issued by the company during the respective fiscal period net premiums written are direct written premiums less premiums ceded to reinsurers net premiums earned the gaap measure most comparable to direct written premiums and net premiums written are net premiums written that are pro rata earned during the fiscal period presented all of the company s policies are written for a twelve month period management uses direct written premiums and net premiums written along with other measures to gauge the company s performance and evaluate results net operating income loss is net income loss exclusive of realized investment gains losses net of tax net income loss is the gaap measure most closely comparable to net operating income loss management uses net operating income loss along with other measures to gauge the company s performance and evaluate results which can be skewed when including realized investment gains losses and may vary significantly between periods net operating income loss is provided as supplemental information not as a substitute for net income loss and does not reflect the company s overall profitability net combined ratio excluding effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development is a non gaap ratio which is computed as the difference between gaap net combined ratio and the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development on the net combined ratio we believe that these ratios are useful to investors and they are used by management to reveal the trends in our business that may be obscured by catastrophe losses and prior year loss development catastrophe losses cause our loss ratios to vary significantly between periods as a result of their incidence of occurrence and magnitude and can have a significant impact on the net loss ratio and net combined ratio prior year loss development can cause our loss ratio to vary significantly between periods and separating this information allows us to better compare the results for the current accident period over time we believe these measures are useful for investors to evaluate these components separately and in the aggregate when reviewing our underwriting performance we also provide them to facilitate a comparison to our outlook on the net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development the most directly comparable gaap measure is the net combined ratio the net combined ratio excluding the effect of catastrophes and prior year loss development should not be considered a substitute for the net combined ratio and does not reflect the company s net combined ratio the table below reconciles direct written premiums and net written premiums to net premiums earned for the periods presented the following table reconciles net operating loss income to net income loss for the periods indicated components may not sum due to rounding the following table reconciles the net combined ratio excluding catastrophes and prior year loss development to the net combined ratio for the periods presented the following table reconciles the net combined ratio excluding catastrophes to the net combined ratio for the periods presented the following table summarizes gross and net written premiums net premiums earned net loss and loss adjustment

rivian rivian the best funded electric vehicle startup in u s history said losses during its initial year of electric truck production were nearly 5 billion and that ongoing tight supplies of computer chips components and raw materials mean it can only build about 25 000 pickups suvs and delivery trucks this year the california based automaker founded by ceo rj scaringe reported a net loss of 2 5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 and 4 7 billion for the full year annual revenue was 55 million coming from deliveries of just 920 of its high end vehicles the company has orders for about 83 000 r1 t pickups and r1 s suvs though it will take until next year to get those to customers amazon an early investor is also waiting to get 100 000 electric delivery trucks the challenges our suppliers are facing vary including company specific production issues covid related delays and semiconductor allocations scaringe said on a results call with analysts rivian s production guidance for the year is conservative and we re certainly working as hard as we can to exceed that 25 000 he said still it s impossible to predict everything especially in this environment rivian the company s shares which fell 6 4 to 41 16 in nasdaq trading thursday ahead of the results announcement dropped a further 12 to 35 99 in after hours trading the stock has plummeted 60 this year and is down 76 since peaking at 172 01 on nov 16 2021 shares of electric vehicle makers including tesla lucid fisker and nikola have all been hammered this year as production is expected to be hamstrung by supply headaches that show no sign of easing even as surging oil prices boost the appeal of zero emission cars and trucks adding to the shortage of computer chips and specialty components there s growing concern that costs for raw materials used in batteries including nickel which is mined in russia as well as cobalt and lithium will continue to spike in the case of nickel as a result of russian president vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine that triggered devastating economic sanctions to say the rivian story has been disappointing to us and the street so far would be an understatement dan ives an equity analyst for wedbush securities said in a research note we believe rivian from a core engineering and design perspective along with the amazon commercial relationship has potential to be a major ev stalwart over the next decade however for that to happen they need to start delivery models to customers and stop the excuses despite the weaker than hoped outlook for 2022 rivian remains well positioned over the long term owing to its unusually large cash horde the company said it ended 2021 with 18 4 billion in cash and equivalents and that it has an additional fundraising capacity with an asset based revolving credit line it raised about 11 billion as a private company from backers including amazon and ford and a further 13 7 billion from its 2021 ipo that cash cushion means it should be able to weather rocky conditions in 2022 and proceed with construction of a second plant in georgia budgeted at 5 billion to bolster output at its normal illinois factory that will have capacity to produce 150 000 vehicles annually by next year scaringe lost his status as a billionaire this month after investors sold off rivian shares when the company angered customers waiting for vehicles by announcing price increases on march of as much as 20 even for those who had pre ordered r1 models at the original price the company reversed that decision for those waiting to take delivery and scaringe apologized for the move in thursday s call we recognize this was a mistake and quickly moved to honor the original configured pricing for our pre march 1 pre orders he said our relationship with customers is the most important aspect of what we re building we believe our early customers are critical for establishing the brand foundation needed to support many millions of sales across our future vehicle portfolio google finance the company is also preparing to offer vehicles with lower cost lower range lithium iron phosphate or lfp batteries starting next year those cells don t use nickel and other materials in conventional lithium ion batteries which may help insulate the company from some commodity price swings rivian will initially use lfp batteries in the delivery trucks it s making for amazon and gradually introduce them for r1 t and r1s models in 2023 while rivian is seen as a potential strong competitor with tesla it will need years to catch up to elon musk s industry leading ev producer notably if rivian only hits its 25 000 unit target this year it will also resemble tesla s slow production ramp up musk s company built fewer than 2 500 electric roadsters from its production start in 2008 through 2011 tesla shifted to its post startup phase with the model s that came out in 2012 it built 2 800 that year and 23 000 in 2013 or 23 800 in the first 18 months of production at its fremont california plant we re no doubt experiencing one of the most challenging supply chain environments the automotive industry has ever seen scaringe said but as we look out 10 years from now our products our technology and our brand platform will help us capture substantial market share in the transportation space follow me on linkedin check out

revenues in the fourth quarter of 2020 versus a more normalized delivery flow is spread out in the year for 2021 net revenue in 2021 was 4 2 billion up 11 from last year we had a solid revenue growth as all business units posted higher revenue compared to 2020 except for defense in commercial and executive aviation we had better sales mix and more aircraft delivered 2021 in services support we had the overall positive revenue contribution increasing for all segments important to note that 92 of our total revenue comes from export which shows our global outreach overall we reached 2021 guidance with net revenue within the 4 billion and 4 5 billion range moving on to adjusted ebit and ebitda we are very encouraged by the continued improvement in margin performance for the company for the fourth quarter on a consolidated basis our adjusted ebit margin was 4 3 and our adjusted ebitda margin was 8 2 an increase of 0 1 percentage points and 0 3 percentage points on a year on year basis respectively on a yearly basis adjusted ebit margin was 4 and adjusted ebitda at 8 6 both well above last year and within our outlook range of 3 to 4 for adjusted ebit and 8 5 to 9 5 adjusted ebitda for 2021 on a dollar basis adjusted ebit was 167 million compared to a loss of 111 million in 2020 and adjusted ebitda was 363 million compared to 82 million in 2020 our ebit would have been better if we did not have additional costs that are treated at corporate level related to integration and ongoing arbitration costs this improvement in ebit and ebitda are results of our fit for growth initiatives slide 10 look at sg a sg a as a whole continues to trend favorably over the past years yearly sg a down 360 million or 23 decline compared to 2019 figures selling expenses were down from 256 million to 230 million due to our focus on more cost effective ways to reach our customers general and administrative expenses were up from 143 million to 153 million in 2021 it s important to note that we remain highly focused on sg a efficiencies and apply linked principles to it on investment we have a more normalized level in 2021 with a 20 increase in combined in both capex and r d we continue to optimize our capital allocation including divestitures and program prioritization in slide 11 i d like first to highlight our remarkable recovery adjusted free cash flow in 2021 was 292 billion this is well above our 100 billion or better outlook more efficient inventory management better production planning and stronger sales and executive and commercial aviation and the down payments associated with these sales have led to our positive cash flow for the year adjusted net result was a loss of 29 million or 0 24 per ads although negative net results is trending up driven primarily by revenue growth and as our top line grows our fixed cost leverage and financial level will improve providing additional positive impact on earnings furthermore the company is targeting a positive net results for 2022 onwards this next slide show our cash and cash equivalents position we ended the year with 2 6 billion of cash and cash equivalents our total debt at the end of 2020 4 billion with a net debt of 1 4 billion we reduced 300 million debt in 2021 it s important to highlight that our net debt ebitda ratio decreased from 5 6 times to 3 5 times in 2021 this is a 2 1 times decline in just two years our average debt to maturity decreased to 3 7 years we remain focused on generating cash reduce our debt levels and improve our credit metrics with our recent bond maturing in 2020 to 23 buyback of 289 billion with that our average debt maturity increased above four years i will now guide you through our outlook for 2022 without eve we have an increased our range of deliveries for 2022 due to the uncertainties that we are seeing in recent events we are working very closely with our suppliers to overcome the liquidity challenge situation for commercial aviation we forecast 60 to 70 aircrafts and for executive 100 to 110 jets deliveries for revenue we forecast 4 5 billion to 5 billion for adjusted ebit margin 3 5 to 4 5 for adjusted ebitda margin 8 to 9 and for free cash flow we forecast 50 million or better with that i conclude my presentation and hand it back to francisco for his final remarks thank you very much francisco gomes neto thanks antonio the fourth quarter and year end results reinforce our confidence in our strategy before we do a quick recap i would like to briefly highlight about our urban air mobility eve the listing at new york stock exchange in closing is expected for this second quarter with total investments of about 500 million which includes spec and strategic investors the anticipated pro forma enterprise value is 2 4 billion eve has the strategic support from embraer with access to infrastructure extensive aircraft certification and manufacturing experience and already established global network of services and support intellectual property and engineers as major differentiators from other projects finally we have strategic partners such as skywest republic airways bae systems rolls royce azorra fond thales who know very well our capabilities i think it is also important to mention that the russia ukraine conflict should not bring supply disruption in the midterm because we have worked on stocking some strategic items our 2022 guidance shows another positive free cash flow for the full year based on the good momentum of the company with a mix of recovery and growth keeping our strong focus on the top line and higher profitability we hope to deliver net profit in 2022 we also expect that our strategic projects generate free cash flow so they can finance their growth on liability we seek the best capital structure with liquidity enhanced finally our focus are our pillars of growth efficiency innovation and esg safety first result oriented culture and one team spirit thank you to our great team for their focus and passion on creating disruptive and sustainable technologies and executing our strategic planning and thank you for your interest and confidence in our company questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from myles walton ubs myles walton ubs analyst thanks good morning i was hoping on the guidance for 2022 that you could perhaps give a little bit more color by segment and in particular given the margin pressure you had in 2021 in defense i would have expected the margins to at the midpoint be better than 2021 so maybe if you can just give some color there antonio garcia chief financial officer hi myles this is antonio speaking thanks for your question so basically what you are seeing in regards to guidance for 2020 one by the way we know that you guys maybe don t like to mute we don t like either but we have effects in our numbers that is not helping us for 2022 as we would like to see but basically what we are seeing in are margin by segment is starting with commercial variation we closed 2021 with minus 1 7 and we do see a black zero for 2022 with more volumes but we do have a little bit cost for the pp that we are spending money and not capitalizing ok that s why i do see a black zero here executive aviation we will still continue at the high single digit level for 2022 without services ok defense that s one issue that s concerned us right now we closed 2021 with 3 8 and we are going to suffer a little bit in 2022 and we do see a zero in 2022 because all budgets were cut especially in front of the brazilian government here therefore we are going to suffer in 2022 that s one of our headwinds we have in our guidance service support we do see i would say constant margin the level we closed for 2021 14 if you put all together it s more than our guidance but please take into account we do have costs on the corporate level which is more or less eating up 1 5 more or less 1 5 margin with the integration of commercial aviation arbitration costs that we are not adjusted to you guys but if you want to make an adjustment in your math then you are going to see that we are in the range of 6 of the business we have a part of this extraordinary effects that is going to hit our numbers for 2022 myles walton ubs analyst yeah great color yes no that was good color so on the embraer costs i think you implied it s something like 65 million in 22 does that go to zero in 23 or are we done in 22 antonio garcia chief financial officer we cannot comment too much but i would say we do expect to finish in 2023 and but is always assuming that you cannot tell too much about the arbitration process that s i would say the time line should end up in 2023 that s our hope but i would say let s see myles walton ubs analyst ok thank you i ll leave to one question thanks again antonio garcia chief financial officer thank you francisco gomes neto thanks myles operator our next question comes from metlife unknown speaker hi guys congratulations on the results i have two questions one is a follow up regarding guidance and more focus on free cash flow if you can comment on working capital assumptions on how you get the 50 million and the other one regarding esg particularly if you have any update on msci comment a couple of months ago is flat on the name if you have any answers from the agency or any comments on that francisco gomes neto for russia i think antonio can help you with the guidance but i d like you to repeat the question about esg that i wasn t able to understand we have agreed with us here to help but we need to understand better your question antonio garcia chief financial officer yes we got here francisco who is going to answer the question for instance regards to the cash flow we do see our working capital stable in 2022 and the free cash flow guidance is a result of the includes the we are seeing 50 million better because it includes also the out of the divestiture we are doing in portugal that should contribute with 150 million for 2022 it s important to mention our outlook does not include any cash inflow out of the business ok it s just the legacy business that we have working capital fixed and the divestiture is going to help us in the free cash flow and the msci level is going to answer unknown speaker about msci we actually just got a message stating that they have taken they have took everything in consideration so we don t have any flag items on msci so our rating should reflect that so no more cluster bomb ammunition issues whatsoever operator our next question comes from josh milberg morgan stanley josh milberg morgan stanley analyst good morning francisco and antonio and thank you guys for the detailed presentation i also had a follow up on the guidance and your indication that a breakeven ebit margin could be a reasonable expectation for the commercial division this year and was specifically just hoping that you could comment a little further on the mix pricing and other key variables driving that indication i think on the portuguese call today with respect to pricing you suggested that you expect it to keep pace with inflation for your overall operations but any additional color there would be great francisco gomes neto ok let s start with the last question josh and then i will ask antonio to help with the guidance so regarding the pricing we have followed very closely the movements of price and costs to make sure that we are keeping a healthy situation for our margins so we will continue with our initiatives to reduce costs internally we have this cogs reduction project we have the production the aircraft production lead time reduction we will continue to focus a lot on those initiatives and of course if we see an impact in one of our commodities that are higher or products we buy that are higher and we are able to compensate then we have to pass on to the price this is the way we are doing we are monitoring very closely this movements in price and costs of our from our suppliers and the price to our customers and the internal costs as well antonio would you like to clarify something about the guidance please antonio garcia chief financial officer yes josh in regards to the mix for the commercial aviation that s important to highlight we do have more e1s in 2022 compared with 2021 it s more or less 50 more e1 where we do have just 28 more e2s means have a different mix which impacts revenue because we have a lower ticket or lower average price for the e2 e1s compared with e2s also impact a bit the margins in regards to the price the price increase tech we do have in those platforms something like 2 to 3 i would say normal condition having our contracts for our suppliers and customers and that s more or less the premises we have pass through as long are not able to offset however there is a risk today in the market with hyperinflation we are impacting commodities that we are quantifying right now at least no risk but it could change next week or the next 10 days we don t know but i would say for the commercial aviation it s more e1s that s bringing the revenue a little bit down and e2s and on top of it when i mentioned the margin we are investing 50 million for the predevelopment of tp which has also impacted the margin for 2022 if you validate the business case you may capitalize it for the time being we are booking as a cost it s more or less what did you see in the aviation coming to a black zero and we hope throughout the year we are able to improve ebit josh milberg morgan stanley analyst ok great color antonio thank you francisco as well have a nice day francisco gomes neto thank you josh operator our next question comes from marcelo motta j p morgan marcelo motta j p morgan analyst hi everyone just a follow up on the guidance for 2022 i mean just to understand you always talk about adjusted margins adjusted ebit margin but it seems that this year you guys are commenting about a negative impact of 1 5 percentage points on this adjusted margin coming from integration cost as well as arbitrage costs however i mean i have the impression that every year you guys have been adjusting the margin for that so maybe the i don t know if the guidance is included in this 1 5 that is not really comparable to the margins that we were seeing in the previous years so just want to make sure that they were getting this correct francisco gomes neto marcelo we never and i have just two years in the company and i took a look back in ever just the carve out or caving cost it s more or less what you are talking about this is embedded included in the ebitda margin is the same for the arbitration is in there if you would you want to do a math we don t consider that we will see embraer in a better margin what we are seeing today but we are not adjusting the steel costs it s included in our adjusted ebitda ok marcelo motta j p morgan analyst ok and do you think it s fair to say that most of those costs will happen during the first quarter francisco gomes neto no no for the integration yes but for the ratios but for the arbitration costs you ll be spread out the whole year more or less antonio garcia chief financial officer exactly marcelo motta j p morgan analyst perfect thank you very much operator our next question comes from matias vammalle bluebay asset matias vammalle bluebay asset management analyst hi thank you very much i just wanted to double check which ties up with the margins but also the deliveries given the impact or given the effect that we re seeing on higher commodity prices how you think you can handle that again i presume a fair bit of that is already factored in your expected deliveries and your margins which are roughly flat to this year but if you can comment a little bit more on what you think the impact could be or how you would handle again higher commodity prices and also some of the challenges that other manufacturing companies are facing such as semiconductor shortages thank you francisco gomes neto well matías thanks for the question again i think antonio already clarified this point of cost and price right we are monitoring very closely this movement we have internal programs to offset some price increase but if the cost increase is above of what we are able to offset and there s no alternative then to pass it through the price we have already some escalation established in our contracts either with suppliers and with customers that is a kind of protection if anything out of this then we have to discuss how to offset but we believe we are in a good position for the guidance in regards as antonio said i mean it s considering the situation right i mean we believe we might have opportunities but we prefer to have a commitment with you that we will deliver at the end of the year and also antonio also mentioned that in the case of commercial aviation we will have this 50 million impact because of initial costs of the turboprop that if we approve the business case by the end of this year beginning of next year this will be will become investments but at this point of time we are contabilizing as costs operator our next question comes from noah poponak goldman sachs noah poponak goldman sachs analyst hey good morning everybody francisco gomes neto good morning noah poponak goldman sachs analyst it s a decent it was a decent order year last year in commercial it seems like there s a lot of replacement potential maybe you could just speak to how heavy the campaigning activity is maybe where you expect orders to come in in commercial in 2022 and then i guess how sold out how much visibility do you have for the delivery profile beyond this year francisco gomes neto well i mean for the deliveries this year we are facing some difficulties with the supply chain but we are working very hard to anticipate the issues and mitigate those risks as we did last year last year we did a good job we also faced some issues with the supply chain but we were able to deliver all the aircraft planned so same way we are going this year in order to mitigate issues and to deliver the aircraft regarding sales i mean we have a lot of sales campaigns ongoing in commercial aviation and yes we have to we have this potential impact of the war the oil price increase but also maybe some upsides because maybe the domestic market will be less affected than the long flights and we have the most efficient aircraft in the market so maybe this will be an upside for our sales during this year noah poponak goldman sachs analyst and where do you think the adjusted ebitda margin can go over time once you ve recovered pre pandemic commercial volumes antonio garcia chief financial officer no we do see in our in the mid term the mid single digit margin it s important to mention without services if we include services you ll be much higher and the same we did 1 7 if i would add the services side will be positive mid single digits already in 2021 with only aircraft sales we do see mid term mid single digit margin francisco gomes neto and noah just to give you a more medium term perspective in our plan we have the potential to double the revenues of the company in five years from now we are pushing a lot for these internal programs to increase efficiency this year we have some growth we could see in the deliveries in the guidance but we are still suffering some the impact of some extraordinary costs so again as soon as we overcome this difficult short term difficult i think the perspective is very positive for the following years we re enjoying the growth of our revenues and the growth in the market noah poponak goldman sachs analyst what kind of total company adjusted ebitda margin would you expect if you were to achieve that doubling of the revenue francisco gomes neto noah our dream here is to be higher single digit margin and also cover the capital costs in the middle term and it higher single digit market that s our dream antonio garcia chief financial officer exactly francisco gomes neto and i hope that you are going to see not so far in our opinion if again if you would accept of this costs that we needed to face here we would be already in the range of 6 2021 we closed with 4 without the hit from brazil air force would be at above 5 already that s why we are still facing this i would say impact from the past transaction with this joint venture and a part of it the business is showing that resilient and i would say close to above 80 in the medium term that s our plan that s our dream and we should see noah poponak goldman sachs analyst that s a ebita or ebitda number francisco gomes neto ebit antonio garcia chief financial officer ebit noah poponak goldman sachs analyst ok great ok thank you so much i appreciate it francisco gomes neto welcome antonio garcia chief financial officer thank you noah operator
