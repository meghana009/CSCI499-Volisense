washington democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage sunday a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer dn y ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative measures of the 21st century senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday afternoon democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake i think it s gonna pass biden told reporters as he left the white house early sunday to go to rehoboth beach delaware ending his covid 19 isolation the house seemed likely to provide final congressional approval when it returns briefly from summer recess on friday the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a campaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion rainbow of progressive aspirations in his build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin dw va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued he said spending and tax increases in the legislation would eliminate jobs while having insignificant impact on inflation and climate change in an ordeal imposed on all budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together a compromise negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits and those efforts were defeated most votes were forced by republicans and many were designed to make democrats look soft on us mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began saturday the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian elizabeth macdonough who referees questions about the chamber s procedures said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes but the thrust of their pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package although in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with annual profits above 1 billion a 1 tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings she also joined with other western senators to win 4 billion to combat the region s drought several democratic senators joined the gop led effort to exclude some firms from the new corporate minimum tax the package keeps to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000 a year it was on the energy and environment side that compromise was most evident between progressives and manchin a champion of fossil fuels and his state s coal industry clean energy would be fostered with tax credits for buying electric vehicles and manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines there would be home energy rebates funds for constructing factories building clean energy technology and money to promote climate friendly farm practices and reduce pollution in minority communities manchin won billions to help power plants lower carbon emissions plus language requiring more government auctions for oil drilling on federal land and waters party leaders also promised to push separate legislation this fall to accelerate permits for energy projects which manchin wants to include a nearly completed natural gas pipeline in his state

one of the largest antitrust trials ever to hit the publishing industry is unfolding in a federal courthouse in washington the department of justice says that the proposed merger announced in 2020 between penguin random house and simon schuster would stifle competition but what would a successful merger mean on a practical level for booksellers authors and others in the industry alli bibbo helm literary agency helm literary agency penguin random house author saira rao saira rao an author in richmond va has been watching the case closely even though penguin random house is her publisher she said she welcomes the government s pushback against the behemoth s attempt to grow even bigger rao said it s sending a message about the need for more diversity in the publishing industry which has traditionally excluded writers of color like herself and which has made her books harder to sell i have a white agent the editors of our books are white the heads of the marketing are white said rao who is south asian american it s white white white white white a study released in 2020 by major children s book publisher lee low books in collaboration with boston university says 76 of people in the industry identify as white down from 79 the last time the company conducted its survey in 2015 authors guild president douglas preston said reduced competition will likely make the sector even less diverse and that s bad not just for authors but also for readers the readers are served by a maximum diversity of authors and voices especially authors from overlooked communities preston said these are authors who don t make a lot of money but who have very important things to say a spokesman for penguin random house said in a statement it was committed to fostering diversity and providing bipoc opportunities across the literary world from editors to authors and that after the merger this would continue simon schuster said something similar in an emailed statement from a spokesperson simon schuster is committed to working with our employees authors and the publishing community to make our company and our industry a safe and inclusive environment for all he said that the company merger or not would continue working toward being a publisher whose books and staff represent the breadth and depth of our diverse population authors guild president preston who said some of his own books have been published by simon schuster added that author advances are also likely to take a hit with more consolidation the fewer publishers there are bidding against each other for an author s work the lower the advance preston said it s economics 101 but penguin random house contends the merger would increase author advances the pre trial brief shared with npr stated this is a pro consumer acquisition that will allow simon schuster and its editors and authors to become part of prh with its industry leading supply chain giving readers and book sellers across the world greater access to their books it will also enhance competition by enabling the combined company to offer increased advances and marketing support to authors competition will increase not decrease as a result of these investments a spokesperson for penguin random house said the company could not share data on author advances since the last major publishing industry merger occurred between random house and penguin in 2013 owing to legal constraints a spokesperson for simon schuster said the company couldn t discuss author advances because they were at issue in the trial some industry insiders agree with the publishers that the potential union of two of the five biggest publishing houses in the country does not pose a threat to a robust sector that puts out a million titles a year i don t see this as anything other than a blip in terms of the ability of the book publishing industry to meet the needs of readers said brian o leary executive director of the book industry study group which provides supply chain research for around two hundred publishing industry members including penguin random house and simon schuster o leary said even if the judge rules in favor of the merger book lovers still benefit from the hundreds of thousands of titles released each year by thousands of independent publishers there are plenty of outlets for writers and not just in the u s market but worldwide o leary said chloe veltman npr npr josiah luis alderete co owner of medicine for nightmares a san francisco calif bookstore focusing on communities of color but like other critics of the acquisition josiah luis alderete co owner of medicine for nightmares an independent bookstore in san francisco which stocks books by both indie presses and the big five publishing houses said consolidation will reduce all kinds of diversity and provide fewer opportunities for writers it worries me alderete said it s gonna be a lot less people deciding what s what but he said he wouldn t be surprised if the merger

good morning the proverbial consumer has become the central focus of the economy this summer the key to deciphering the murky outlook ahead consumer spending which makes up 68 of the us economy is tenuous and poised to decline so what are companies learning about consumers with confidence slipping and households growing more cautious about spending cfos are looking to their internal data to gain more granular insights into consumer behavior and to craft strategies to respond effectively this week consumer facing companies like block and carparts com reported earnings giving a glimpse into how they re adapting in uncertain times we have a number of signals into the health of consumers and businesses across our ecosystems block cfo amrita ahuja said in a call discussing the company s second quarter earnings we re tracking these trends in real time and we ll use them to act quickly and prudently to guide our business decisions that insight is likely one reason block formerly known as square said thursday it s cutting investments in areas like sales and marketing by 250 million this year including slowing down its pace of hiring block s earnings were a mixed bag with revenue falling 6 to 4 4 billion in the quarter largely tied to volatility in crypto assets although both revenue and earnings exceeded wall street s estimates it was the cost trimming however that raymond james analyst john davis saw as the key highlight of the report since it should more than offset any potentially lowered gross profit estimates he said after tumbling 7 late thursday block recovered somewhat in friday s trading session ahuja said block looks at metrics like consumer engagement with products along with product adoption and frequency of transactions to gauge consumer health those metrics show stability in both discretionary spending that is necessities like food and utilities and non discretionary splurges like travel or clothing data from both square payments and cashapp showed steady growth in verticals like food and drink retail and personal care even as consumers grappled with inflation and slower economic growth we ve seen a diverse range of use cases including gas utilities travel food and grocery and big box discount retailers ahuja said but we also recognize the environment has changed and we re prepared to adapt to uncertainty and maintain discipline by pulling back on operating expenses particularly those that are less efficient meanwhile carparts com is leveraging tech investments in its own ecommerce platform to strengthen its foothold in what it sees as a traditionally inefficient corner of the retail industry the online retailer adopted a warby parker like business model of selling directly to consumers and bypassing middlemen buttressing that model with a staff of data scientists and an in house logistics system that can better manage supply chain hiccups we ve leaned heavily into technology to create efficiencies and to help our employees be safer and more productive carparts cfo ryan lockwood tells me we ve built a foundation that we can now leverage instead of trying to play catch up in a difficult economic time while carparts aims to offer discounts to its brick and mortar competitors it s managed to avoid the margin squeeze that big discount retailers like walmart and target have seen as prices inflate the company s revenue grew 12 to 176 million last quarter for a net profit of seven cents a share with both figures topping analyst estimates unlike online retailers willing to sell goods at a loss to spur the volume of sales carparts has always been profitable on every transaction lockwood says the company also avoided the volatile swings in consumer demand when lockdowns and fiscal stimulus turbocharged online spending in 2020 and 2021 before slowing dramatically this year at a time when many digital retail stocks are slumping and startups are struggling for fundingcarparts is aiming to be an outlier that can tap growth by doing what ecommerce has always done best find an inefficiency in a stagnant market and draw in customers with a better retail experience the auto world is a really difficult place for consumers the pricing isn t transparent and it s not really clear what things should cost because it s an occasional purchase lockwood says no one s ever enjoyed their car repair experience i don t know if i ve ever heard someone say that the industry has wanted some disruption for a while from the consumer side and we re looking to meet that demand kevin kelleher twitter kpkelleher big deal finance executives at us companies are starting to sharpen their scissors as they evaluate their budgets in the coming year gartner surveyed more than 200 cfos and finance leaders in july to ask where they re planning to spend more and trim costs real estate spending is most likely to see cuts with 35 saying they plan to reduce their real estate footprint although 9 are willing to spend more finance and operations are two other areas that may see smaller budgets it costs remain popular inside corporate budgets however with 40 planning to increase spending in the era of digital transformations sales and r d are two other areas that may see an uptick in spending courtesy of gartner going deeper some early warning signs are emerging that banks are beginning to tighten standards for corporate loans the federal reserve s july survey of senior loan officers showed both stronger demand and tighter standards for commercial and industrial loans meanwhile banks reported tighter standards but weaker demand for most categories of commercial real estate loans particularly for subprime borrowers as for consumers demand for

inflation reduction act seen as critical in the mid term election washington senate passage sunday of a sweeping health care tax and climate bill is a significant victory for president biden and the democrats the bill now goes to the house where a victory could impact the crucial november midterm elections just three months away the 755 page bill includes 430 billion to combat climate change and extend health care coverage paid for with savings on prescription drugs and taxes on corporations it puts hundreds of billions of dollars toward deficit reduction the bulk of the spending more than 300 billion covers investments to tackle climate change and boost clean energy including incentives for farmers and ranchers to reduce methane emissions an extension of the electric vehicle tax credit and the launch of a national climate bank that would make investments in clean energy technologies and energy efficiency the legislation would empower medicare to negotiate prices with drug companies for the first time cutting prescription drug prices for people 65 and older the savings would help pay for a three year extension of affordable care act subsidies which would stave off an expected rise in insurance premiums that were set to go into effect in 2023 the package includes a cap on the price of insulin for those 65 and older on medicare but republicans successfully removed a 35 cap on insulin in the private market the bill also raises revenue through a new 15 minimum tax on large corporations though accelerated depreciation would be exempted a key ask of centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz who extracted several tax changes from leadership before getting on board with the package sinema also successfully killed a provision to close the carried interest tax loophole that benefits private equity and hedge fund managers it was replaced with sinema s support by a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks that actually pulls in more revenue than the carried interest provision would have california senator alex padilla cheered the bill s passage he pointed out there are no new taxes on families making 400 000 or less and no new taxes on small businesses economic and policy experts agree that this legislation will effectively fight inflation and reduce the federal deficit he said story date august 8 2022
updated august 12 2022 at 5 42 pm et the house gave final congressional approval on friday to a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion it was passed without any republican support and now goes to president biden for his signature house speaker nancy pelosi d calif called it a glorious day adding we sent to the president s desk a monumental bill that will be truly for the people senate democrats revived the bill a year in the making with a furious few final weeks of negotiations mainly between sen majority leader chuck schumer d n y and sen joe manchin of west virginia its final major hurdle was a marathon voting session last weekend in the senate the legislation was passed through the budget reconciliation process which meant that all 50 democrats in the senate and one tie breaker vote from vice president harris were needed since none of the 50 republican senators voted for the bill it also restricted the measures in the bill to those that directly change federal spending and revenue democrats have argued the measure will tackle voters main economic concern naming it the inflation reduction act republicans argue the new spending will aggravate inflation the nonpartisan congressional budget office says though the bill has a negligible effect on inflation in 2022 and into 2023 house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif called the bill tone deaf ahead of friday s floor vote democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford mccarthy added overall the bill is a very scaled down solution to what many democrats including president biden had asked for originally this bill is far from perfect it s a compromise but it s often how progress is made biden said at the white house last month my message to congress is this this is the strongest bill you can pass after the house passed it on friday biden said he will sign the historic legislation next week here s a look at some of what did get included in the democrats bill and what didn t you can see the entire 730 page bill here tackling climate change more than 300 billion will be invested in energy and climate reform the largest federal clean energy investment in u s history the bill has support from many environmental and climate activists but is short of the 555 billion that democrats had originally called for this portion of the bill takes on transportation and electricity generation and it includes 60 billion for growing renewable energy infrastructure in manufacturing like solar panels and wind turbines it also includes several tax credits for individuals on things like electric vehicles and making homes more energy efficient the bill will according to democrats lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40 based on 2005 levels by the end of the decade which is short of the 50 biden had originally aimed for it puts us within a close enough distance that further executive action state and local government efforts and private sector leadership could plausibly get us across the finish line by 2030 said jesse jenkins from princeton university who leads the repeat project analyzing the impact of government climate actions lowering the cost of prescription drugs on health reforms the bill takes on making prescription drugs more affordable but there are some limits the bill includes a historic measure that allows the federal health secretary to negotiate the prices of certain expensive drugs each year for medicare but this won t impact every prescription drug or every patient and it won t take effect quickly the negotiations will take effect for 10 drugs covered by medicare in 2026 increasing to 20 drugs in 2029 the portion of the bill that tried to cap at 35 per month the price of insulin a drug that is incredibly expensive in the u s compared to other countries was ruled out of order by the senate parliamentarian who ruled the cap could apply on medicare a government program but not on private insurance so democrats split the measure between medicare and private insurance but republicans ultimately blocked the measure for private insurance the parliamentarian also ruled that a measure that was in the bill to force drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was not totally in line with the rules for budget reconciliation she said that it could apply to medicare patients but not those with private insurers the bill puts a cap of 2 000 on out of pocket prescription drug costs for people on medicare effective in 2025 there s also a three year extension on healthcare subsidies in the affordable care act originally passed in a pandemic relief bill last year estimated by the government to have kept premiums at 10 per month or lower for the vast majority of people covered through the federal health insurance exchange that helps millions of americans avoid spikes in their health care costs tax reform the legislation creates a 15 minimum tax for corporations making 1 billion or more in income bringing in more than 300 billion in revenue a portion that got cut though is one that narrowed the carried interest tax loophole arizona kyrsten sinema agreed to sign onto the bill if this measure which would have changed the way private equity income is taxed was cut democrats said it would have brought in 14 billion in revenue instead a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks was introduced and it could bring in roughly five times as much revenue as the carried interest measure however it wouldn t take effect until next year raising predictions of a rush of buybacks by some companies before 2023 rolls around a major portion of the bill that isn t included due to opposition from west virginia sen joe manchin is extending the child tax credit manchin expressed last year that the cost to extend the credit was too high but progressives including vermont sen bernie sanders continued to push for its inclusion in the bill copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing climate change moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing big corporations the package on sunday heads next to the house where legislators are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative measures of the 21st century senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake i think it s gonna pass biden told reporters as he left the white house early sunday to go to rehoboth beach delaware ending his covid 19 isolation the house seemed likely to provide final congressional approval when it returns briefly from the us summer recess on friday the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 percent corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a campaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400bn caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes the whole package is paid for with some 300bn in extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion rainbow of progressive aspirations in his build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative senator joe manchin a democrat opposed it saying it was too costly and would drive inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time republican senate minority leader mitch mcconnell argued he said spending and tax increases in the legislation would eliminate jobs while having an insignificant effect on inflation and climate change in an ordeal imposed on all budget bills such as this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together a compromise negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist senator kyrsten sinema a democrat sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings progressive senator bernie sanders offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits but those efforts were defeated most votes were forced by republicans and many were designed to make democrats look soft on us mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement the thrust of the pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700bn over a decade the money would come from a 15 percent minimum tax on a handful of corporations with annual profits above 1bn a 1 percent tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs
washington bloomberg the united states senate passed the democrats landmark tax climate and health care bill setting up the legislation for house approval and president joe biden s signature after more than a year of stop and start negotiations democrats on sunday aug 7 agreed to a narrow bill to invest in energy initiatives curb drug prices and reduce the deficit paid for by new corporate taxes the legislation is far from the roughly us 4 trillion s 5 5 trillion to reshape the american economy that mr biden first envisioned when taking office but the bill still gives democrats something to show voters ahead of the november mid term elections here are the highlights of what s in the deal corporate minimum tax the bill imposes a 15 per cent minimum corporate levy on companies that have traditionally been able to pay little to no taxes because they were eligible for a long list of credits and deductions this measure is known as the book tax because it is applied to a company s book or financial statement earnings rather than the income calculation traditionally used for tax purposes the private equity industry scored a last minute win when several democrats voted with republicans to create a carveout that means fewer companies owned by investment firms will have to pay the tax the regular 21 per cent corporate rate is left untouched maintaining a key part of former president donald trump s 2017 tax law stock buyback tax
today senate democrats sided with american families over special interests mr biden said in a statement i ran for president promising to make government work for working families again and that is what this bill does period in part by tweaking federal tax laws chiefly to target tax cheats and some billion dollar companies that pay nothing to the government the bill is expected to raise enough money to cover its new spending democrats say the measure is also expected to generate an additional us300 billion for reducing projected budget deficits over the next 10 years though they have not yet furnished a final fiscal analysis of their legislation this is one of the most significant pieces of legislation passed in a decade senate majority leader chuck schumer said in an interview before the bill s passage in the senate things that americans have longed for and couldn t get done senate majority leader chuck schumer it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived bloomberg the package is the byproduct of the political realities in the narrowly divided senate where republicans stood immovably opposed to the bill and democrats had to negotiate among themselves to shepherd it to the chamber floor advertisement it hinged on a breakthrough deal negotiated in late july between senator schumer and senator joe manchin a moderate who nearly eight months ago single handedly scuttled a previous attempt to advance his party s agenda and its fate teetered at one point because of a last minute snag with senator kyrsten sinema another moderate despite various setbacks the bill gives democrats a campaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest federal effort on climate change so far caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to us2000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at us35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the us35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules universal preschool abandoned the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than us700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 per cent minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above us1 billion a 1 per cent tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs senator sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings she also joined with other western state senators to win us4 billion to combat the region s drought advertisement the package keeps to mr biden s pledge not to raise taxes on those earning less than us400 000 a year barely more than a tenth the size of mr biden s initial 10 year us3 5 trillion build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded childcare aid that plan collapsed after conservative democrat senator joe manchin opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation republicans said the new measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell argued in an ordeal imposed on most budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together the compromise bill negotiated by senator schumer progressives senator manchin and the inscrutable centrist senator sinema progressive senator bernie sanders criticised the bill s shortcomings and offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits but those efforts were defeated republicans forced their own votes designed to make democrats look soft on us mexico border security and fuel and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement advertisement it was on the energy and environment side that compromise was most evident between progressives and senator manchin a champion of fossil fuels and his state s coal industry clean energy would be fostered with tax credits for buying electric vehicles and manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines there would be home energy rebates funds for constructing factories building clean energy technology and money to promote climate friendly farm practices and reduce pollution in minority communities senator manchin won billions to help power plants lower carbon emissions plus language requiring more government auctions for oil drilling on federal land and waters party leaders also promised to push separate legislation later this year to accelerate permits for energy projects which senator manchin wants to include a nearly completed natural gas pipeline in his state still environmental groups hailed the passage as a milestone tremendous progress said manish bapna president and chief executive of the natural resources defence council in a statement with ap washington post
by alex rogers clare foran ali zaslav and manu raju cnn the senate is continuing to work sunday on a series of amendment votes but faced new drama early afternoon as democrats look to pass their sweeping climate health care and tax package the amendment process known on capitol hill as a vote a rama started saturday night shortly after 11 30 p m et a final vote on the bill will take place after the amendment votes end the timing of which is not yet clear but senators are looking at making changes to the bill just hours before the chamber is expected to pass it democratic sens joe manchin of west virginia and kyrsten sinema of arizona are in discussions with senate gop whip john thune on the 15 corporate minimum tax the two democrats who are pivotal in writing and passing the legislation were seen by cnn going into thune s office on sunday we re having conversations and continuing to work it said thune the issue has been percolating since saturday after sinema discovered language in a draft of the bill showing how subsidiaries of companies owned by private equity firms could be hit by the 15 corporate minimum tax if their combined book income exceeds 1 billion according to a senate source familiar with the matter if sinema succeeds in altering that provision the bill would raise 35 billion less in revenue potentially reducing the roughly 300 billion in deficit savings which is a key priority for manchin in a potential problem for democrats sinema could back a thune amendment to exempt those companies from the corporate minimum tax and pay for the lost revenue by extending for a year a limitation on individuals state and local tax deductions through 2026 if the senate adopts thune s proposal several democrats in the house primarily from coastal districts who have campaigned on repealing the limits on the salt deduction could object the bill named the inflation reduction act would represent the largest climate investment in us history and make major changes to health policy by giving medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years the legislation would reduce the deficit be paid for through new taxes including a 15 minimum tax on large corporations and a 1 tax on stock buybacks and boost the internal revenue service s ability to collect it would raise over 700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over 430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the affordable care act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit senate democrats only need a simple majority for final passage of the bill since they are using a process known as reconciliation which allows them to avoid a republican filibuster and corresponding 60 vote threshold in order to pass a bill through the reconciliation process however the package must comply with a strict set of budget rules and republicans are using the vote a rama to put democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes republicans were also successful in removing a key insulin provisions to cap the price of insulin to 35 per month on the private insurance market which the senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the senate s reconciliation rules the 35 insulin cap for medicare beneficiaries remains in place after the senate passes the bill the house is expected to return to washington on friday to consider it how the bill addresses the climate crisis while economists disagree over whether the package would in fact live up to its name and reduce inflation particularly in the short term the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions the nearly 370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in us history and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark clean air act it also comes at a critical time this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet analysis from senate majority leader chuck schumer s office as well as multiple independent analyses suggests the measure would reduce us carbon emissions by up to 40 by 2030 strong climate regulations from the biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to president joe biden s goal of cutting emissions 50 by 2030 the bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables and spur more american consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles lawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what s needed to combat the climate crisis this isn t about the laws of politics this is about the laws of physics democratic sen brian schatz of hawaii told cnn we all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do key health care and tax policy in the bill the bill would empower medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors offices or purchased at the pharmacy the health and human services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026 and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028 the number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond this controversial provision is far more limited than the one house democratic leaders have backed in the past but it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for obamacare coverage through 2025 a year later than lawmakers recently discussed that way they wouldn t expire just after the 2024 presidential election to boost revenue the bill would impose a 15 minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders known as book income as opposed to the internal revenue service the measure which would raise 258 billion over a decade would apply to companies with profits over 1 billion concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses particularly manufacturers sinema has suggested that she won changes to the democrats plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes the details remain unclear however sinema nixed her party s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20 long term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37 the provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate addressing this loophole which would have raised 14 billion over a decade had been a longtime goal of congressional democrats in its place a 1 excise tax on companies stock buybacks was added raising another 74 billion according to a democratic aide this story and headline have been updated with additional developments the cnn wire 2022

for all of this new corporate minimum tax the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left out of the inflation reduction act this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs ___ associated press writer matthew daly

democrats won senate approval for their election year economic package sunday afternoon representing the most substantial investment in history to counter the planet s warming the measure that passed with vice president kamala harris tie breaking vote was less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but it s represents a victory for deep rooted party dreams of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations debate began saturday and by sunrise on sunday democrats had swatted down a dozen republican efforts to torpedo the legislation despite unanimous gop opposition democrats stayed united in the 50 50 chamber and went over the tops with vice president kamala harris tiebreaking vote the house planned to return briefly from summer recess friday for what democrats hope will be final congressional approval it will reduce inflation it will lower prescription drug costs it will fight climate change it will close tax loopholes and it will reduce and reduce the deficit senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y said of the package it will help every citizen in this country and make america a much better place worst inflation since the 1980s republicans said the measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation ssince the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued he said spending and tax increases in the legislation would eliminate jobs while having insignificant impact on inflation and climate change nonpartisan analysts have said democrats inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices the bill is barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion rainbow of progressive aspirations and abandons its proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid even so the new measure gives democrats a campaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion hands medicare the power to negotiate pharmaceutical prices and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance biden s original measure collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation in an ordeal imposed on all budget bills like this one the senate descended into an hourslong vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together a compromise negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits and those efforts were defeated but most proposed changes were fashioned by republicans to unravel the bill or force democrats into votes on dangerous political terrain one gop proposal would have forced the biden administration to continue trump era restrictions that cited the pandemic for reducing the flow of migrants across the southwest border earlier this year democrats facing tough reelections supported such an extension forcing the party to drop its push for covid 19 spending when republicans conjoined the two issues this time with their far larger economic legislation at stake and elections approaching democrats rallied against the border controls other gop amendments would have required more gas and oil leasing on federal lands and blocked a renewal of a fee on oil that helps finance toxic waste cleanups all were rejected on party line votes republicans accused democrats of being soft on border security and opening the door to higher energy and gas costs before debate began saturday the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian elizabeth macdonough who referees questions about the chamber s procedures said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes but the thrust of their pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above 1 billion a 1 tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings she also joined with other western senators to win 4 billion to combat the region s drought it was on the energy and environment side that compromise was most evident between progressives and manchin a champion of fossil fuels and his state s coal industry clean energy would be fostered with tax credits for buying electric vehicles and manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines there would be home energy rebates funds for constructing factories building clean energy technology and money to promote climate friendly farm practices and reduce pollution in minority communities manchin won billions to help power plants lower carbon emissions plus language requiring more government auctions for oil drilling on federal land and waters party leaders also promised to push separate legislation this fall to accelerate permits for energy projects which manchin wants to include a nearly completed natural gas pipeline in his state
opinion editor s note star tribune opinion publishes a mix of national and local commentaries online and in print each day to contribute click here this column is about the excesses of the private equity investment industry it delves into the minutiae of the tax code corporate structure and certain abstruse practices of financial engineering there will be jargon carried interest leveraged buyout joint liability i am aware that none of this is anyone s favorite thing to be discussing on a summer s day but private equity is counting on your lack of interest the seeming impenetrability of its practices has been called one of its superpowers among the reasons the trillion dollar industry keeps getting away with it with what an accelerating behind the scenes desiccation of the american economy democrats in the senate had been poised to pass a rule that might slightly clip the industry s wings a change to the tax code that would force partners in private equity firms hedge fund managers and venture capitalists to pay a fairer share of taxes on the money they make but private equity has wrangled out of proposed regulation before and it s done so again sen kyrsten sinema the arizona democrat who has often frustrated her party s agenda agreed last week to support the inflation reduction act only after tax provisions in the plan were scaled back i can t fathom what her reluctance might be one of private equity s main plays is the leveraged buyout which involves borrowing huge sums of money to gobble up companies in the hopes of restructuring them and one day selling them for a gain but the acquired companies which range across just about every economic sector from retailing to food to health care and housing are often overloaded with debt to the point of unsustainability they frequently slash jobs and benefits for employees cut services and hike prices for consumers and sometimes even endanger lives and undermine the social fabric it is a dismal record private equity firms presided over many of the largest retailer bankruptcies in the last decade among them toys r us sears radioshack and payless shoesource resulting in nearly 600 000 lost jobs according to a 2019 study by several left leaning economic policy advocates other investigations have shown that when private equity firms buy houses and apartments rents and evictions soar when they buy hospitals and doctors practices the cost of care shoots up when they buy nursing homes patient mortality rises when they buy newspapers reporting on local governments dries up and participation in local elections declines it is unclear even if private equity pays off for the investors like university endowments public pension funds and wealthy individuals who put money into the industry in the hopes of outsize returns since at least 2006 according to a study by the economist ludovic phalippou the performance of the largest private equity funds has essentially matched returns of comparable publicly traded companies still the industry has been growing quickly and it had a record year in 2021 according to mckinsey private equity s total assets under management reached almost 6 3 trillion last year the american investment council a trade group representing the industry says that companies backed by private equity firms employ nearly 12 million americans with the help of lax regulation and indefensible tax loopholes private equity s apparent destructiveness can be enormously profitable for its partners private equity firms make money by extracting hefty fees from their investors and from the companies they purchase meaning they can succeed even if their investments go kaput phalippou found that between 2005 and 2020 the industry produced 19 multibillionaires private equity partners also get a pretty good deal from the government on what they earn the funds generally charge their investors two different fees a management fee of 2 of invested assets per year funds are held for an average of about six years and a carried interest fee that is 20 of any investment gains realized in the fund in most other industries the internal revenue service would categorize a fee like carried interest as ordinary income like how your salary is taxed rather than a capital gain like how your stock market winnings are taxed after all the partners are receiving the fee as compensation for performing a service managing investors money not collecting a gain on their own invested capital but that s not how it works for partnerships like private equity hedge funds and venture capital firms under irs guidelines carried interest is taxed as a capital gain which has a top rate of 20 rather than as income which has a top rate of nearly 40 the upshot millionaire and billionaire partners in private equity firms pay a far lower tax rate on much of their income than many of the rest of us the private equity industry defends its preferential rate by citing sweat equity even if partners don t put much of their own capital at stake they are being rewarded for investing their ideas and energy as steve klinsky a former chair of the american investment council put it in a recent article barack obama called for the loophole to be eliminated donald trump pledged to do so so did joe biden even several financial tycoons have called for its repeal jamie dimon bill ackman and warren buffett among them despite widespread opposition though the tax break has somehow endured eileen appelbaum an expert on the private equity industry who is a co director of the center for economic and policy research a liberal think tank told me she favored many of the ideas in the stop wall street looting act a bill introduced last year by sen elizabeth warren and several other liberal democrats the act would impose lots of new rules on the industry including limiting tax deductions on excessive debt and adding worker protections for when debt binges lead to bankruptcy one of the most important ideas appelbaum said is known as joint liability which would hold private equity firms responsible for the debt incurred by portfolio companies if the companies go belly up it doesn t tell you how much debt you can put on it appelbaum said it just says whatever debt you put on it you re going to be jointly responsible that struck me as an elegant and sensible idea if private equity firms claim they should get credit for their sweat equity why shouldn t they be held responsible when the sweat turns to tears

updated august 12 2022 at 5 42 pm et the house gave final congressional approval on friday to a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion it was passed without any republican support and now goes to president biden for his signature house speaker nancy pelosi d calif called it a glorious day adding we sent to the president s desk a monumental bill that will be truly for the people senate democrats revived the bill a year in the making with a furious few final weeks of negotiations mainly between sen majority leader chuck schumer d n y and sen joe manchin of west virginia its final major hurdle was a marathon voting session last weekend in the senate the legislation was passed through the budget reconciliation process which meant that all 50 democrats in the senate and one tie breaker vote from vice president harris were needed since none of the 50 republican senators voted for the bill it also restricted the measures in the bill to those that directly change federal spending and revenue democrats have argued the measure will tackle voters main economic concern naming it the inflation reduction act republicans argue the new spending will aggravate inflation the nonpartisan congressional budget office says though the bill has a negligible effect on inflation in 2022 and into 2023 house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif called the bill tone deaf ahead of friday s floor vote democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford mccarthy added overall the bill is a very scaled down solution to what many democrats including president biden had asked for originally this bill is far from perfect it s a compromise but it s often how progress is made biden said at the white house last month my message to congress is this this is the strongest bill you can pass after the house passed it on friday biden said he will sign the historic legislation next week here s a look at some of what did get included in the democrats bill and what didn t you can see the entire 730 page bill here tackling climate change more than 300 billion will be invested in energy and climate reform the largest federal clean energy investment in u s history the bill has support from many environmental and climate activists but is short of the 555 billion that democrats had originally called for this portion of the bill takes on transportation and electricity generation and it includes 60 billion for growing renewable energy infrastructure in manufacturing like solar panels and wind turbines it also includes several tax credits for individuals on things like electric vehicles and making homes more energy efficient the bill will according to democrats lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40 based on 2005 levels by the end of the decade which is short of the 50 biden had originally aimed for it puts us within a close enough distance that further executive action state and local government efforts and private sector leadership could plausibly get us across the finish line by 2030 said jesse jenkins from princeton university who leads the repeat project analyzing the impact of government climate actions lowering the cost of prescription drugs on health reforms the bill takes on making prescription drugs more affordable but there are some limits the bill includes a historic measure that allows the federal health secretary to negotiate the prices of certain expensive drugs each year for medicare but this won t impact every prescription drug or every patient and it won t take effect quickly the negotiations will take effect for 10 drugs covered by medicare in 2026 increasing to 20 drugs in 2029 the portion of the bill that tried to cap at 35 per month the price of insulin a drug that is incredibly expensive in the u s compared to other countries was ruled out of order by the senate parliamentarian who ruled the cap could apply on medicare a government program but not on private insurance so democrats split the measure between medicare and private insurance but republicans ultimately blocked the measure for private insurance the parliamentarian also ruled that a measure that was in the bill to force drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was not totally in line with the rules for budget reconciliation she said that it could apply to medicare patients but not those with private insurers the bill puts a cap of 2 000 on out of pocket prescription drug costs for people on medicare effective in 2025 there s also a three year extension on healthcare subsidies in the affordable care act originally passed in a pandemic relief bill last year estimated by the government to have kept premiums at 10 per month or lower for the vast majority of people covered through the federal health insurance exchange that helps millions of americans avoid spikes in their health care costs tax reform the legislation creates a 15 minimum tax for corporations making 1 billion or more in income bringing in more than 300 billion in revenue a portion that got cut though is one that narrowed the carried interest tax loophole arizona kyrsten sinema agreed to sign onto the bill if this measure which would have changed the way private equity income is taxed was cut democrats said it would have brought in 14 billion in revenue instead a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks was introduced and it could bring in roughly five times as much revenue as the carried interest measure however it wouldn t take effect until next year raising predictions of a rush of buybacks by some companies before 2023 rolls around a major portion of the bill that isn t included due to opposition from west virginia sen joe manchin is extending the child tax credit manchin expressed last year that the cost to extend the credit was too high but

loading error loading washington after a year of painstaking negotiations that seemed for a time to be going nowhere senate democrats on sunday approved sweeping legislation aiming to reduce the nation s output of greenhouse gases and make health care more affordable the vote was split 50 50 along party lines with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaker after a marathon session of votes on amendments the house is expected to take up the legislation and pass it on friday advertisement democrats celebrated after the bill passed by roaring in applause and hugging one another on the senate floor aides who were intimately involved in negotiations wiped away tears in jubilation senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y said the bill would endure as one of the defining legislative feats of the 21st century the inflation reduction act while substantially narrowed from prior versions is now poised to give president joe biden another major legislative victory ahead of november s midterm elections its given name is a reflection of the shaky politics for his party at the moment with rising costs of food gasoline and energy at the top of voters minds advertisement the bill would make broad changes in energy drug and tax policies prior to some last minute changes caused by procedural issues the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimated the bill would cut the budget deficit by a little more than 90 billion over 10 years democrats also claim another 200 billion in deficit reduction from the revenues that the government would collect from tougher irs enforcement the bill sets aside hundreds of billions of dollars to fight climate change including through incentivizing clean energy technology senate finance committee chairman ron wyden d ore said 260 billion would go toward clean energy tax credits that he called transformational advertisement the bill would also enact a change democrats have sought for more than a decade to allow medicare to negotiate with drug companies over the prices of prescription drugs that kind of haggling was outlawed in the 2003 part d prescription drug benefit bill passed by republicans a separate provision of the legislation would extend a temporary set of subsidies for the affordable care act that reduce the price of insurance that people buy directly through healthcare gov or through state run insurance exchanges like pennsylvania s pennie and connect for health care colorado for some insurance buyers the subsidies lead to savings of hundreds or even thousands of dollars a year the subsidies which democrats enacted in 2021 as part of their pandemic relief package were set to expire this year the inflation reduction act has them staying in place through 2025 on taxes the bill would put in place a 15 minimum corporate tax and beef up irs enforcement to the tune of 80 billion over the next 10 years advertisement democrats had initially hoped to pass a much broader social policy bill but couldn t get sen joe manchin d w va on board with things like paid leave affordable housing and child care after months of stalled talks that left progressives steaming manchin shocked washington by agreeing to a deal with senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y on a narrower package and angering republicans who believed he had driven the final nail in the coffin democrats eventually won over sen kyrsten sinema d ariz their last holdout by agreeing to make several changes to the bill including eliminating a provision that would have tightened a tax loophole associated with hedge fund managers and private equity executives that measure was replaced with a new excise tax on stock buybacks slated to begin in 2023 through saturday night republicans did their best to extract a political cost for democrats in passing the bill making them vote on a series of ticklish amendments intended less to be adopted than to give democratic senate candidates nightmares about the ads they could spawn sen susan collins r maine offered an amendment that would have prohibited the irs from accessing its additional money in the bill until 90 of the agency s employees were back to work in person it failed on a 50 50 vote a proposed amendment by sen mike crapo r idaho that would have prohibited the new irs funds from being used to audit taxpayers with taxable incomes of less than 400 000 annually the level below which biden said people would not see any tax hikes was also defeated in a 50 50 tie advertisement other proposed republican amendments aimed to put in place proposals that democrats said they supported but that were not included in the bill like a revamp of environmental permitting requirements and opening up outer continental shelf areas for energy exploration they were defeated by a 49 50 procedural vote and a 50 50 tally respectively my r friends have made clear they re completely unwilling to support this bill under any condition none of their amendments would change that for this reason i ll vote to protect the integrity of the ira regardless of the substance of their fake amendments manchin tweeted saturday pledging to stick with democrats in brushing back the gop s efforts not all of the defeated amendments were from republicans though senate democrats stuck to their plan to avoid upsetting the bill s delicate balance with any on the fly changes meaning that proposed amendments offered by senate budget chairman bernie sanders i vt which would have expanded health care benefits were defeated on 1 99 3 97 and 1 98 votes democrats though supportive of that effort voted those amendments down since their adoption would have increased the overall cost of the package and lost them the support of manchin advertisement senator sanders is right sen sherrod brown d ohio said after sanders proposed an amendment to extend a monthly child allowance but i ask my colleagues to vote no because this would bring the bill down democratic attempts to introduce a 35 cap on insulin prices also failed because the senate parliamentarian concluded that the provision violated the complex rules that govern legislation moving through the reconciliation process democrats sought to include the measure in the bill anyway but republicans voted to strip it out the final bill was a patchwork that some senators only grudgingly supported sanders on saturday stepped on democrats messaging by echoing gop complaints that the bill would not rein in inflation he labeled it the so called inflation reduction act to the delight of the republican national committee republicans were backed up thursday by the head of the nonpartisan congressional budget office phillip swagel at the request of sen lindsey graham s c the top republican on the senate budget committee swagel offered his opinion of the inflation fighting impact of the bill and said it would be negligible in 2022 in 2023 it would result in inflation being only 0 1 percentage point lower or higher than under current law he said advertisement but democratic leaders said that analysis failed to account for health and energy rebates in the bill they also vowed to fight for the rest of their agenda in the coming months there are people who want to do more wyden told reporters on saturday i share that view it wasn t on offer tonight couldn t get 50 votes and sen elizabeth warren d mass on sunday

washington democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage sunday a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative measures of the 21st century senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday afternoon democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake i think it s gonna pass biden told reporters as he left the white house early sunday to go to rehoboth beach delaware ending his covid 19 isolation the house seemed likely to provide final congressional approval when it returns briefly from summer recess on friday the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a c ampaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion rainbow of progressive aspirations in his build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued he said spending and tax increases in the legislation would eliminate jobs while having insignificant impact on inflation and climate change in an ordeal imposed on all budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together a compromise negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits and those efforts were defeated most votes were forced by republicans and many were designed to make democrats look soft on u s mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began saturday the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian elizabeth macdonough who referees questions about the chamber s procedures said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes but the thrust of their pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above 1 billion a 1 tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings

biden s pledge not to raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000 a year it was on the energy and environment side that compromise was most evident between progressives and manchin a champion of

washington ap democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage sunday a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative measures of the 21st century senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday afternoon democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake i think it s gonna pass biden told reporters as he left the white house early sunday to go to rehoboth beach delaware ending his covid 19 isolation the house seemed likely to provide final congressional approval when it returns briefly from summer recess on friday the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a c ampaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion rainbow of progressive aspirations in his build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued he said spending and tax increases in the legislation would eliminate jobs while having insignificant impact on inflation and climate change in an ordeal imposed on all budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together a compromise negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits and those efforts were defeated most votes were forced by republicans and many were designed to make democrats look soft on u s mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began saturday the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian elizabeth macdonough who referees questions about the chamber s procedures said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under

washington aug 7 2022 prnewswire the concord coalition today welcomed the deficit reduction goals of the democratic climate tax and health care bill but cautioned that the heavily back loaded nature of the savings poses a significant risk that some of those savings will never take effect the inflation reduction act ira h r 5376 which the congressional budget office cbo projects will reduce federal budget deficits by up to 300 billion over the coming 10 years won passage today in the u s senate and now moves onto the house for consideration there is much to like about the ira the prescription drug pricing reforms will help slow the rate of growth in medicare the energy provisions are an essential down payment in combating climate change and the revenue raisers will help reduce future budget deficits said robert l bixby executive director of the concord coalition but the back loaded nature of the savings is concerning according to a preliminary estimate provided by the congressional budget office the ira would save approximately 740 billion over the next decade when nonscorable savings from enhanced irs enforcement are included and spend nearly 435 billion reducing future deficits by 305 billion but two thirds of those savings don t materialize until the last half of the budget window savings from the ira heavily rely on future revenue increases including roughly 300 billion from a 15 percent minimum book tax on corporations which will be a challenge to implement as happened with the ill fated cadillac tax in the affordable care act there is a clear danger that this new minimum corporate tax will be repeatedly delayed and eventually repealed without raising a nickel to offset the cost of the ira s new spending said bixby in addition to back loaded savings the bill would extend the enhanced affordable care act aca premium tax subsidies for just three years rather than make them permanent a well worn budget gimmick often used to hide the true cost of legislation it s clear congress has no intention of letting the expanded aca premiums expire said bixby lawmakers shouldn t force americans to play healthcare roulette every few years if the intent is to make the expanded premium subsidies permanent congress should find a way to offset that cost since the cbo published its preliminary estimate of the ira senate democrats announced several changes to the legislation the carried interest tax provision was dropped the 15 minimum book tax was altered to protect accelerated depreciation and wireless spectrum purchases a new 1 fee on corporate stock buy backs was added and a 35 monthly cap on insulin for medicare recipients was attached in addition senate democrats were forced to drop a key revenue raiser penalties on pharmaceutical companies who raise private sector drug prices faster than inflation cbo has not yet issued a revised score that reflects these changes when it does the concord coalition will provide additional comment the concord coalition is a nonpartisan grassroots organization dedicated to fiscal responsibility since 1992 concord has worked to educate the public about the causes and consequences of the federal deficit and debt and to develop realistic solutions for sustainable budgets for more fiscal news and analysis visit concordcoalition org and follow us on facebook concordcoalition and on twitter concordc source the concord coalition

passage sunday aug 7 2022 a compromise less ambitious than biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations mariam zuhaib ap this is one of the most significant pieces of legislation passed in a decade senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y said before the senate acted on sunday things that americans have longed for and couldn t get done photo for the washington post by shuran huang washington the senate on sunday approved a sweeping package to combat climate change lower health care costs raise taxes on some billion dollar corporations and reduce the federal deficit as democrats overcame months of political infighting to deliver the centerpiece to president joe biden s long stalled economic agenda the party line vote was a milestone in a tumultuous journey that began last year when democrats took control of congress and the white house with a promise to bring financial relief to ordinary americans with a tiebreaking vote from vice president kamala harris the 50 50 senate sent the bill to the house which aims to approve it and send it to the white house for biden s signature later this week dubbed the inflation reduction act of 2022 the package would authorize the biggest burst of spending in u s history to tackle global warming about 370 billion to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 40 below their 2005 levels by the end of this decade the proposal also would make good on democrats years old pledge to reduce prescription drug costs for the elderly advertisement article continues below this ad in part by tweaking federal tax laws chiefly to target tax cheats and some billion dollar companies that pay nothing to the government the bill is expected to raise enough money to cover its new spending democrats say the measure is also expected to generate an additional 300 billion for reducing projected budget deficits over the next 10 years though they have not yet furnished a final fiscal analysis of their legislation this is one of the most significant pieces of legislation passed in a decade senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y said in an interview before the bill s passage in the senate things that americans have longed for and couldn t get done the package is the byproduct of the political realities in the narrowly divided senate where republicans stood immovably opposed to the bill and democrats had to negotiate among themselves to shepherd it to the chamber floor it hinged on a breakthrough deal negotiated in late july between schumer and sen joe manchin d w va a moderate who nearly eight months ago single handedly scuttled a previous attempt to advance his party s agenda and its fate teetered at one point because of a last minute snag with sen kyrsten sinema d ariz to assuage manchin democrats had to give up some of their more ambitious plans free prekindergarten for all paid family and medical leave for workers nationwide and offer new support for fossil fuels to satisfy sinema meanwhile party leaders repeatedly dialed back their proposed tax policies particularly those targeting wealthy investors advertisement article continues below this ad in the final hours of debate sen bernie sanders i vt tried unsuccessfully to restore some of the jettisoned proposals including a significant expansion of medicare to provide dental vision and hearing coverage to the elderly delivering multiple fiery speeches sanders implored his colleagues to improve a bill that does nothing to address the greatest financial challenges facing families repeatedly though democrats rejected even ideas they once supported leaving sanders the lone aye vote on the amendments as they labored to protect a compromise bill they saw as fragile many democrats emphasized the need to overlook the losses and savor the gains in a package that weeks earlier had seemed out of reach this is not bernie s bill i understand that manchin told reporters sunday but it s a piece of legislation that s a tremendous piece of legislation it s a balanced approach republicans meanwhile lambasted their democratic counterparts for the drug pricing program massive climate spending and new tax policies during nearly 19 hours of debate gop lawmakers alleged that the measure would worsen inflation at a time when prices already are rising at the fastest rate in four decades they painted the tax provisions in particular as a threat to workers and their wages even though the bill would not raise rates on individuals and they unleashed a battery of unsuccessful amendments that forced democrats to take uncomfortable votes on issues including immigration advertisement article continues below this ad it does nothing to bring the economy out of stagnation and recession but rather the inflation reduction act of 2022 gives us higher taxes more spending higher prices and an army of irs agents sen mike crapo of idaho the top republican on the tax focused senate finance committee said referring to a big infusion of cash that would be dedicated to staffing up the internal revenue service for senate democrats though the outcome marks the latest victory in a spate of legislative accomplishments including bipartisan efforts to rethink gun laws improve veterans health care and boost the manufacture of much needed high tech computer chips it comes two days after a federal labor report showed the u s economy had recovered all the jobs it had lost since the start of the coronavirus pandemic a positive sign for the president as fears about a recession hover over washington even before the vote was final democratic lawmakers on the chamber floor rejoiced and cheered shaking hands and hugging as their republican counterparts cast their votes and headed for the exits for a month long summer break manchin made a beeline for schumer s desk as the two men leaned their heads together and clasped their hands sen brian schatz d hawaii a proponent of climate change provisions broke into tears the developments offer fresh political fuel for biden and democratic leaders as they make their case to voters ahead of the midterm elections the fast approaching november contest serves as a referendum on democratic control of washington over the past two years injecting urgency into democrats once defunct push to pass an economic package advertisement article continues below this ad in a statement biden hailed the outcome and praised democrats for having sided with american families over special interests acknowledging the many compromises that led to the vote he encouraged the house to act swiftly lawmakers could take up the bill friday the prescription drug pricing reforms aim to help cut costs for seniors enrolled in medicare it caps their out of pocket costs at 2 000 annually while allowing the u s government to negotiate the price of a small set of medicines beginning in 2026 the landmark proposal is expected to save elderly americans money and achieve billions in savings for washington over the next decade pharmaceutical giants which forcefully opposed the bill also would be required to pay rebates to the federal government if they raise medicare drug prices beyond the rate of inflation but democrats did not accomplish everything they sought an attempt to lower and cap the price of insulin for example faltered after republicans on sunday stripped it from the bill their opposition appeared to doom the plan for the remainder of the year because a bipartisan attempt to reduce the cost of the lifesaving diabetes drug previously failed to secure gop support the reality is the cost of insulin is not just out of control it is devastating people sen patty murray d wash said before nearly every republican voted to weaken the cap advertisement article continues below this ad the bill also includes 64 billion to stave off health insurance premium increases for about 13 million americans who buy coverage through state and federal exchanges under the affordable care act these beneficiaries currently receive discounted coverage under a coronavirus era program set to expire this year threatening them with premium increases into hundreds of dollars next month to respond to a rapidly warming planet democrats set aside about 370 billion for energy security and climate change the investments include a bevy of tax credits to incentivize wind solar and other renewable power sources while helping people purchase new or used electric vehicles and install energy efficient heating and cooling systems in their homes the bill creates a 1 5 billion program that includes new payments for companies that cut emissions of methane a potent greenhouse gas with some penalties for those firms that do not while the new spending contributes greatly toward biden s emission reduction goals democrats coupled it with additional provisions that boost fossil fuels an approach necessary to win manchin s support democrats agreed to mandate new oil and gas leasing in the gulf of mexico and off the coast of alaska while party leaders committed to pursue a separate bill in the coming months that makes it easier for developers to override some environmental objections that proposal could greatly benefit a long stalled pipeline in manchin s home state a trade off that some democrats described as an uncomfortable necessity we made a deal with joe manchin so there was always going to be something for fossil schatz said emphasizing that the bill would still reduce emissions by 40 over the next eight years it also has stuff i don t like but that s the nature of getting a bill done that all of us can support advertisement article continues below this ad to pay for the spending democrats included a new tax on a set of large companies that currently pay nothing to the u s government and added about 80 billion for the irs to pursue those who dodge what they owe they also approved a 1 tax on companies that buy back their own stock a practice that many party lawmakers see as detrimental to the economy to the benefit of wealthy shareholders and executives but the tax proposals are a far cry from what democrats had envisioned part of a last minute effort to ensure the support of sinema another moderate in their ranks the arizona lawmaker agreed last week to vote for the measure after party leaders agreed to scale back the minimum corporate tax and scrap a separate plan to close a tax loophole for wealthy hedge fund real estate and investment managers on sunday the senator intervened again this time in a way that benefited private equity and the companies in their portfolios that forced democrats to rethink their minimum tax and essentially carve out the industry to retain her support a slew of similar compromises define the inflation reduction act which democrats opted to move through the process known as budget reconciliation the tactic allowed them to sidestep gop opposition avoid the normal 60 vote requirement to get past a senate filibuster and prevail with the support of their 50 members plus harris s tiebreaker advertisement article continues below this ad the maneuver required democrats to unite giving moderates such as manchin and sinema outsize influence in the negotiations with the rest of their party which supported a more ambitious economic package the intraparty tensions have been on stark display since democrats tried and failed to move a much larger roughly 2 trillion plan known as the build back better act the precursor bill was vast in scope provisioning child care free community college for low income americans and subsidized health insurance along with new provisions to ease immigration drawing its name from biden s 2020 campaign slogan its backers including sanders whose budget work helped enable the bill saw it as the most ambitious legislation since the great depression but manchin never supported the sky high price tag arguing that it might worsen the country s fiscal health at a moment of great economic and political uncertainty the house adopted the bill in november but the senate never considered it as manchin staked his public opposition angering his party and drawing a rare rebuke from the white house we were probably too aggressive said sen mark warner d va a behind the scenes negotiator over the past year reflecting on what went wrong the idea we were going to solve virtually every issue in one bill was probably a bridge too far advertisement article continues below this ad by january democrats at biden s direction began rethinking the package a set of negotiations led by schumer at times they seemed on the verge of collapse especially after manchin said in july that he could not support a bill that raised taxes and spent money on climate change though he had supported some of those aims manchin cited the rising cost of groceries gas and other goods as reason for his opposition schumer and manchin ultimately worked out their differences solidified an agreement and sold it to a caucus that had hoped for something more robust and after a year of failure and countless hours of bickering and with an election less than three months away democrats were eager to take it you could always say i wanted

washington ap democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage sunday a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative measures of the 21st century senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday afternoon democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake i think it s gonna pass biden told reporters as he left the white house early sunday to go to rehoboth beach delaware ending his covid 19 isolation the house seemed likely to provide final congressional approval when it returns briefly from summer recess on friday the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a c ampaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion rainbow of progressive aspirations in his build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued he said spending and tax increases in the legislation would eliminate jobs while having insignificant impact on inflation and climate change in an ordeal imposed on all budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together a compromise negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits and those efforts were defeated most votes were forced by republicans and many were designed to make democrats look soft on u s mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began saturday the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian elizabeth macdonough who referees questions about the chamber s procedures said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes but the thrust of their pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above 1 billion a 1 tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings she also joined with other western senators to win 4 billion to combat the region s drought several democratic senators joined the gop led effort to exclude some firms from the new corporate minimum tax the package keeps to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000 a year it was on the energy and environment side that compromise was most evident between progressives and manchin a champion of fossil fuels and his state s coal industry clean energy would be fostered with tax credits for buying electric vehicles and manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines there would be home energy rebates funds for constructing factories building clean energy technology and money to promote climate friendly farm practices and reduce pollution in minority communities manchin won billions to help power plants lower carbon emissions plus language requiring more government auctions for oil drilling on federal land and waters party leaders also promised to push separate legislation this fall to accelerate permits for energy projects which manchin wants to include a nearly completed natural gas pipeline in his state
senate democrats finally got something meaningful done voting 51 50 on sunday with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote to pass a 750 billion healthcare clean energy and tax bill the inflation reduction act of 2022 would give medicare the power to negotiate prices for prescription drugs make 369 billion in investments in clean energy and reduce the federal deficit with a 15 percent minimum tax on large corporations and a 1 percent tax on stock buybacks this bill will lower the price of prescription drugs and healthcare reduce the deficit and invest in american energy to both address climate change and bring down energy bills and in another big win for virginia it will help ensure that miners suffering from black lung and their families get the help they need virginia sens mark warner and tim kaine said in a joint statement while we will continue to look for ways to support the health and well being of our communities decrease inflation and lower costs for virginians we re proud that today we took a major step forward in addressing those challenges the democrats said healthcare the power that would go to medicare to negotiate drug prices is a first the bill would also extend the expanded affordable care act subsidies for three years through 2025 since aarp s founding we have fought for older adults to have access to affordable healthcare including prescription drugs and we have been working for nearly two decades to allow medicare to negotiate the price it pays for medications thanks to today s historic vote in the senate millions of americans 50 are one step closer to real relief from out of control prescription drug prices aarp ceo jo ann jenkins said this bill will save medicare hundreds of billions of dollars and give seniors peace of mind knowing there is an annual limit on what they must pay out of pocket for medications lowering prescription drug prices is a top priority for americans with more than 80 percent of people across political parties supporting the measure we thank all the senators who voted today to lower drug prices we are also pleased that the bill will keep health insurance affordable for millions of americans who purchase their coverage in the marketplace especially consumers aged 50 64 more than 1 million of whom have gained more affordable options we urge the house to move quickly and enact this momentous reform aarp fought hard for this victory and we will keep fighting to get americans relief from the high price of prescription drugs jenkins said clean energy the inflation reduction act includes roughly 369 billion in climate spending designed to reduce emissions by 40 percent by 2030 and put the united states paris climate accord goals within reach according to a recent analysis the clean energy provisions of the inflation reduction act are expected to create nearly 1 million jobs per year the bill includes key provisions related to clean energy 9 billion in consumer home energy rebate programs to electrify home appliances and for energy efficient retrofits ten years of consumer tax credits to make heat pumps rooftop solar electric hvac and water heaters more affordable so homes can be more energy efficient and run on clean energy and a 10 billion investment tax credit to build clean technology manufacturing facilities including facilities that make electric vehicles wind turbines and solar panels electric vehicles a 4 000 tax credit for consumers to buy used electric vehicles and up to a 7 500 tax credit for consumers to buy new evs 3 billion for electric u s postal service trucks 1 billion for electric heavy duty vehicles such as school buses and garbage trucks and 3 billion for zero emission technology at u s ports pollution reduction and natural climate solutions a methane emissions reduction program a reinstated polluter pays tax to increase funding to clean up superfund toxic waste sites and 50 million to inventory and protect old growth forests which absorb global warming carbon emissions on national forest system land the bill represents a compromise and includes some provisions that will benefit fossil fuel development including requiring lease sales for offshore drilling and providing tax incentives that would help coal and gas plants however modeling by energy innovation found emissions increases from these provisions are offset 24 to 1 by the bill s climate friendly provisions the group also found that the bill could prevent 3 700 to 3 900 deaths in 2030 in addition to 99 000 to 100 000 avoided asthma attacks the finish line is now clearly within reach said gregory wetstone president and ceo of the american council on renewable energy the senate s passage of the inflation reduction act of 2022 is a historic step toward the clean energy future the american people want and scientists say we desperately need the legislation s landmark investment of 369 billion in climate and clean energy programs will help deploy thousands of megawatts of renewable power create hundreds of thousands of good paying american jobs reduce the cost of electric power and finally put the country on track toward achievement of our climate goals but we re not done yet acore remains committed to working with allies to ensure swift approval in the house of representatives our planet will be better off when president biden signs this transformative legislation into law national ocean industries association president erik milito we extend our thanks to senator manchin for his leadership in securing an all of the above energy package that boosts offshore oil and gas offshore wind and carbon capture and storage all key priorities for the offshore sector and for long term american energy security no legislation is perfect and the inflation reduction act certainly reflects compromises but american offshore energy is an issue of national and global consequence the senate just unlocked a much brighter future for americans and the planet nature and human ingenuity have made it increasingly possible for us to power our homes cars and businesses with clean renewable sources such as the sun and wind said lisa frank executive director of environment america s washington legislative office and as the climate warms making this transition is of the utmost urgency the renewable energy and electric vehicle tax incentives in the inflation reduction act are a real game changer that will make it cheaper and easier for individuals businesses school districts and more to go solar swap out old polluting vehicles and save energy this is a big deal said u s pirg environment campaigns director matt casale the senate just passed an historic investment in a clean and healthy future for americans climate change is the challenge of our times and what we do to address it today will have lasting effects on generations to come not everything in the bill is perfect and there remains work to do but the clean energy tax credits in particular will inject a jolt of renewable energy into state and local efforts to reduce emissions and clean the air they will help make it affordable for americans of all stripes to switch to electric vehicles put solar panels on their roofs and purchase cleaner healthier electric appliances that don t pump pollution in our homes and air the funding in the bill will help electrify the u s postal fleet and help communities clean up toxic superfund sites while requiring polluters to bear the cost in addition to making major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions these provisions will significantly reduce air pollution that makes people sick

san francisco and suzhou china aug 7 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the first patient with diabetic macular edema dme has been successfully dosed in the phase 1 study of ibi324 a potential first in class ophthalmic recombinant human anti vegf a and anti ang 2 bispecific antibody this phase 1 dose escalations study ctr20221524 aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravitreal injection of ibi324 in subjects with diabetic macular edema dme ibi324 is a dual target specific recombinant fully humanized anti vegf a and anti ang 2 bispecific antibody developed by innovent which can achieve anti angiogenesis vascular stabilization and inflammation inhibition by blocking both vegf a and ang 2 aiming to bring more potential clinical benefits to dme patients such as prolonging the dosing interval and improving treatment compliance professor xiaodong sun vice president and director of the eye center of the first people s hospital of shanghai jiao tong university principal investigator of this study stated anti vegf ophthalmic agents are now the standard of care for many neovascular fundus diseases however existing anti vegf drugs require repeated intravitreal injections every 4 to 12 weeks frequent injections and follow up reduce patient compliance with treatment resulting in poor long term treatment efficacy in many patients for example persistent macular edema remains in approximately 40 of patients with dme under standard treatment the multi targeted agents based on anti vegf has become the current trend in drug development for fundus diseases we expect ibi324 to demonstrate positive safety and bioactivity results in the dme population by blocking both vegf a and ang 2 targets and lengthen the

compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life cheers broke out as senate democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote after an all night session today senate democrats sided with american families over special interests president joe biden said in a statement from rehoboth beach delaware i ran for president promising to make government work for working families again and that is what this bill does period biden who had his share of long nights during his three decades as a senator called into the senate cloakroom during the vote on speakerphone to personally thank the staff for their hard work the president urged the house to pass the bill as soon as possible speaker nancy pelosi said her chamber would move swiftly to send this bill to the president s desk house votes are expected friday it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative feats of the 21st century he said senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday afternoon democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a campaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes and reaping savings from the long sought goal of allowing the government to negotiate drug prices for medicare the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the 755 page inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the new measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued in an ordeal imposed on most budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together the compromise bill negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz sen kyrsten sinema d ariz arrives for a meeting of the senate homeland security committee at the capitol in washington wednesday sen joe manchin sealed the deal reviving president joe biden s big economic health care and climate bill but it was sinema who intently quietly and deliberately shaped the final product photo j scott applewhite associated press progressive sen bernie sanders i vt criticized the bill s shortcomings and offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits but those efforts were defeated republicans forced their own votes designed to make democrats look soft on u s mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian who said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes but the thrust of democrats pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above 1 billion a 1 tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings she also joined with other western senators to win 4 billion to combat the region s drought several democratic senators joined the gop led effort to exclude some firms from the new corporate minimum tax the package keeps to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000 a year it was on the energy and environment side that compromise was most evident between progressives and manchin a champion of fossil fuels and his state s coal industry clean energy would be fostered with tax credits for buying electric vehicles and manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines there would be home energy rebates funds for constructing factories building clean energy technology and money to promote climate friendly farm practices and reduce pollution in minority communities manchin won billions to help power plants lower carbon emissions plus language requiring more government auctions for oil drilling on federal land and waters party leaders also promised to push separate legislation this fall to accelerate permits for energy projects which manchin wants to include a nearly completed natural gas pipeline in his state still environmental groups hailed the passage as a milestone tremendous progress said

medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the first patient with diabetic macular edema dme has been successfully dosed in the phase 1 study of ibi324 a potential first in class ophthalmic recombinant human anti vegf a and anti ang 2 bispecific antibody this phase 1 dose escalations study ctr20221524 aims to evaluate the safety and tolerability of intravitreal injection of ibi324 in subjects with diabetic macular edema dme ibi324 is a dual target specific recombinant fully humanized anti vegf a and anti ang 2 bispecific antibody developed by innovent which can achieve anti angiogenesis vascular stabilization and inflammation inhibition by blocking both vegf a and ang 2 aiming to bring more potential clinical benefits to dme patients such as prolonging the dosing interval and improving treatment compliance professor xiaodong sun vice president and director of the eye center of the first people s hospital of shanghai jiao tong university principal investigator of this study stated anti vegf ophthalmic agents are now the standard of care for many neovascular fundus diseases however existing anti vegf drugs require repeated intravitreal injections every 4 to 12 weeks frequent injections and follow up reduce patient compliance with treatment resulting in poor long term treatment efficacy in many patients for example persistent macular edema remains in approximately 40 of patients with dme under standard treatment the multi targeted agents based on anti vegf has become the current trend in drug development for fundus diseases we expect ibi324 to demonstrate positive safety and bioactivity results in the dme population by blocking both vegf a and ang 2 targets and lengthen the

democrats in the united states have passed a sweeping 430bn bill intended to fight climate change lower drug prices and raise some corporate taxes in a major victory for president joe biden the package known as the inflation reduction act passed the senate on sunday by a 51 50 party line vote with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking ballot the senate is making history an elated senate majority leader chuck schumer said after pumping his fists in the air as democrats cheered and their staff members responded to the vote with a standing ovation to americans who ve lost faith that congress can do big things this bill is for you he said this bill is going to change america for decades schumer said the legislation contains the boldest clean energy package in american history to fight climate change while reducing consumer costs for energy and some medicines the action sends the measure to the house of representatives for a vote likely friday when representatives plan to reconvene briefly during a summer recess they are expected to pass it which would then send the bill to the white house for biden s signature in a statement biden said he looked forward to signing the bill into law democrats hope the bill s passage will help the party s house and senate candidates in the november 8 midterm elections at a time when biden is suffering from anemic public approval ratings amid high inflation senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation conservative lawmakers have criticised the bill as wasteful spending with top republican senator mitch mcconnell accusing democrats of voting to double down on their economic disaster biggest climate investment in us history the legislation is aimed at reducing carbon emissions and shifting consumers to green energy while cutting prescription drug costs for the elderly and tightening enforcement on taxes for corporations and the wealthy the bill would invest nearly 375bn over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60bn for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30bn for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in us history by far this is a historic achievement said gregory wetsone president of the american council on renewable energy this represents the first time in the united states that we have seen congress take a serious effort to deal with the climate problem and this bill the programmes it includes are ones we have been advocating for many years and i think will have a huge impact allowing the clean energy transition that we know we are going to need to deal with climate change he told al jazeera lower prescription drug costs on the healthcare front the bill would allow the medicare programme to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies for the first time saving the federal government some 288bn over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies it also extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance the bill s final costs were being recalculated but overall it would raise more than 700bn over a decade the money would come from a 15 percent minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above 1bn a 1 percent tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs with some 740bn in new revenue and around 440bn in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300bn toward deficit reduction the latest package is barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5

one of the largest antitrust trials ever to hit the publishing industry is unfolding in a federal courthouse in washington the department of justice says that the proposed merger announced in 2020 between penguin random house and simon schuster would stifle competition but what would a successful merger mean on a practical level for booksellers authors and others in the industry alli bibbo helm literary agency helm literary agency penguin random house author saira rao saira rao an author in richmond va has been watching the case closely even though penguin random house is her publisher she said she welcomes the government s pushback against the behemoth s attempt to grow even bigger rao said it s sending a message about the need for more diversity in the publishing industry which has traditionally excluded writers of color like herself and which has made her books harder to sell i have a white agent the editors of our books are white the heads of the marketing are white said rao who is south asian american it s white white white white white a study released in 2020 by major children s book publisher lee low books in collaboration with boston university says 76 of people in the industry identify as white down from 79 the last time the company conducted its survey in 2015 authors guild president douglas preston said reduced competition will likely make the sector even less diverse and that s bad not just for authors but also for readers the readers are served by a maximum diversity of authors and voices especially authors from overlooked communities preston said these are authors who don t make a lot of money but who have very important things to say a spokesman for penguin random house said in a statement it was committed to fostering diversity and providing bipoc opportunities across the literary world from editors to authors and that after the merger this would continue simon schuster said something similar in an emailed statement from a spokesperson simon schuster is committed to working with our employees authors and the publishing community to make our company and our industry a safe and inclusive environment for all he said that the company merger or not would continue working toward being a publisher whose books and staff represent the breadth and depth of our diverse population authors guild president preston who said some of his own books have been published by simon schuster added that author advances are also likely to take a hit with more consolidation the fewer publishers there are bidding against each other for an author s work the lower the advance preston said it s economics 101 but penguin random house contends the merger would increase author advances the pre trial brief shared with npr stated this is a pro consumer acquisition that will allow simon schuster and its editors and authors to become part of prh with its industry leading supply chain giving readers and book sellers across the world greater access to their books it will also enhance competition by enabling the combined company to offer increased advances and marketing support to authors competition will increase not decrease as a result of these investments a spokesperson for penguin random house said the company could not share data on author advances since the last major publishing industry merger occurred between random house and penguin in 2013 owing to legal constraints a spokesperson for simon schuster said the company couldn t discuss author advances because they were at issue in the trial some industry insiders agree with the publishers that the potential union of two of the five biggest publishing houses in the country does not pose a threat to a robust sector that puts out a million titles a year i don t see this as anything other than a blip in terms of the ability of the book publishing industry to meet the needs of readers said brian o leary executive director of the book industry study group which provides supply chain research for around two hundred publishing industry members including penguin random house and simon schuster o leary said even if the judge rules in favor of the merger book lovers still benefit from the hundreds of thousands of titles released each year by thousands of independent publishers there are plenty of outlets for writers and not just in the u s market but worldwide o leary said chloe veltman npr npr josiah luis alderete co owner of medicine for nightmares a san francisco calif bookstore focusing on communities of color but like other critics of the acquisition josiah luis alderete co owner of medicine for nightmares an independent bookstore in san francisco which stocks books by both indie presses and the big five publishing houses said consolidation will reduce all kinds of diversity and provide fewer opportunities for writers it worries me alderete said it s gonna be a lot less people deciding what s what but he said he wouldn t be surprised if the merger

senate democrats approve big biden deal house to vote next president joe biden walks to board marine one on the south lawn of the white house in washington on his way to his rehoboth beach del home after his most recent covid 19 isolation sunday aug 7 2022 ap photo manuel balce ceneta washington ap democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage sunday a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life cheers broke out as senate democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote after an all night session today senate democrats sided with american families over special interests president joe biden said in a statement from rehoboth beach delaware i ran for president promising to make government work for working families again and that is what this bill does period biden who had his share of long nights during his three decades as a senator called into the senate cloakroom during the vote on speakerphone to personally thank the staff for their hard work the president urged the house to pass the bill as soon as possible speaker nancy pelosi said her chamber would move swiftly to send this bill to the president s desk house votes are expected friday it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative feats of the 21st century senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday afternoon democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a campaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the new measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued in an ordeal imposed on most budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together the compromise bill negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt criticized the bill s shortcomings and offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits but those efforts were defeated republicans forced their own votes designed to make democrats look soft on u s mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian who said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes but the thrust of democrats pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above 1 billion a 1 tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings she also joined with other western senators to win 4 billion to combat the region s drought several democratic senators joined the gop led effort to exclude some firms from the new corporate minimum tax the package keeps to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000 a year it was on the energy and environment side that compromise was most evident between progressives and manchin a champion of fossil fuels and his state s coal industry clean energy would be fostered with tax credits for buying electric vehicles and manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines there would be home energy rebates funds for constructing factories building clean energy technology and money to promote climate friendly farm practices and reduce pollution in minority communities manchin won billions to help power plants lower carbon emissions plus language requiring more government auctions for oil drilling on federal land and waters party leaders also promised to push separate legislation this fall to accelerate permits for energy projects which manchin wants to include a nearly completed natural gas pipeline in his state still environmental groups hailed the passage as a milestone tremendous progress said manish bapna president and ceo of the natural resources defense council in a statement ___ associated press writers chris megerian in rehoboth del and matthew daly in washington contributed to this report
new york bloomberg billionaire investor warren buffett s berkshire hathaway is following an age old adage buy the dip the conglomerate was a net buyer of equities in the quarter reporting us 3 8 billion s 5 2 billion in purchases according to results released on saturday aug 6 it was a net seller in the second quarter of last year berkshire stepped in as the s p 500 shed 16 per cent in the latest quarter the company which is based in omaha nebraska also reported an operating profit of us 9 2 billion as the insurance and railroad businesses posted gains cfra research analyst cathy seifert said one business flashing potential warning signs is geico the company s personal auto insurance unit it reported an underwriting loss of us 487 million even as the conglomerate s other insurance lines gained alongside the division s investment income but ms seifert said that the report as a whole reflected decent top line growth still decent demand for various goods and services offset by higher input costs and volatility in equity markets tough spot berkshire said losses at geico were the result of higher claims due to rising used car prices and auto parts shortages the company said policies in force declined even as it increased premiums a potential sign that the business is losing market share as customers hunt for better rates elsewhere they are in a little bit of a tough spot right now ms seifert said adding that the same trends are playing out at other auto insurers but appear to be hitting geico particularly hard it is probably a good idea to watch for further deterioration the same market weakness increasing mr buffett s buying power is weighing on his company s results at least on paper the company reported a net loss of us 43 8 billion due to a us 53 billion loss in the company s investment portfolio berkshire downplays those results as a function of accounting rules saying these provide a misleading picture of the company s actual performance bloomberg calculated the net purchases by subtracting first quarter numbers from the first half total mr buffett s appetite for his own stock declined even as he piled into shares elsewhere stock buy backs clocked in at us 1 billion for the second quarter lagging the us 3 2 billion in repurchases made at the start of the year insurance investment income clocked in at us 1 91 billion the company also reported that berkshire hathaway energy had acquired us 870 million in common stock from vice chairman greg abel in june the transaction was not previously disclosed despite the spending spree berkshire made only a measly dent in its cash pile the company reported us 105 4 billion at the end of june barely budging from the us 106 billion at the end of the first quarter the aggressive pace at which berkshire picked up shares of occidental petroleum has raised questions as to whether berkshire is looking to make an acquisition of the energy giant but the company did not provide insight into its strategy in this quarter s regulatory filing
the 430bn climate change healthcare and tax bill the us senate began debating on saturday night could deliver a major win for democrats and help reduce the carbon emissions that drive climate change while also cutting costs for the elderly democrats hope the bill which they aim to push through the senate over united republican opposition will boost their chances in the november 8 midterm elections when republicans are favoured to recapture the majority in at least one chamber of congress the package called the inflation reduction act is a dramatically scaled back version of a prior bill backed by democratic president joe biden that was blocked by maverick senate democrats joe manchin and kyrsten sinema as too expensive it s what the american people want senate majority leader chuck schumer told reporters we re prioritising the middle class working families those struggling to get to the middle class instead of what republicans do prioritise those at the very top if the senate passes the bill which likely would require a tie breaking vote from vice president kamala harris it would send the legislation on to the democratic controlled house of representatives which intends to take it up on friday after which biden could sign it into law republicans blasted the bill as a spending wish list that they argued would hurt an economy weighed down by inflation saying it would kill jobs raise energy costs and undermine growth at a time when the economy is facing a potential recession the democrats most recent reckless tax and spending spree suffers from a serious case of policy whiplash said republican senator chuck grassley on saturday the last thing businesses and families need right now are tax hikes and a rash of poorly vetted policies creating even more confusion and uncertainty in the economy about half of americans some 49 support the bill including 69 of democrats and 34 of republicans according to a reuters ipsos poll conducted aug 3 and 4 the most popular element of the bill is giving medicare the power to negotiate drug prices which 71 of respondents support including 68 of republicans economists who say the legislation could help the federal reserve combat inflation do not expect a sizeable impact on the economy in coming months climate focus with 370bn in climate focused spending it would become the most consequential climate change bill ever passed by congress the bill offers businesses and families billions in incentives to encourage purchases of electric vehicles and energy efficient appliances as well as to spur new investments in wind and solar power that would double the amount of new clean electricity generating capacity coming online in the united states by 2024 according to modelling by the repeat project at princeton university that would help put the us on course to meet its pledge to slash its greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 below 2005 levels made at last year s glasgow climate summit while environmental groups largely embraced the bill they noted that compromises secured by manchin who represents coal producing west virginia would prolong us use of fossil fuels those provisions include rules that would only allow the federal government to authorise new wind and solar energy developments on federal land when it is also auctioning rights to drill for oil and natural gas drug costs the legislation would lower drug costs for the government employers and patients said juliette cubanski deputy director of the medicare programme at the kaiser family foundation perhaps the biggest effect would be for people with prescription drug coverage through medicare she said a key change is the provision allowing the federal medicare health plan for older and disabled americans to negotiate lower prescription drug prices the pharmaceutical industry says price negotiation would stifle innovation negotiated prices for 10 of the costliest drugs for medicare would apply starting in 2026 with that number rising until it caps at 20 a year in 2029 the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates medicare would save 101 8bn over 10 years by negotiating drug prices the provision also introduces a 2 000 annual cap on out of pocket costs for the elderly through the medicare programme tax provisions the bill also imposes a new excise tax on stock buybacks a late change after sinema raised objections over another provision that would have imposed new levies on carried interest currently a tax loophole for hedge fund and private equity financiers the provision was dropped the excise tax is expected to raise an additional 70bn in tax revenue per year lawmakers said that is more than the carried interest provision had been forecast to raise a report by the nonpartisan congressional budget office released prior to that last change estimated the measure would reduce the federal deficit by a net 101 5bn over the next decade that was about one third of the 300bn in

senate democrats approve big biden deal house to vote next president joe biden walks to board marine one on the south lawn of the white house in washington on his way to his rehoboth beach del home after his most recent covid 19 isolation sunday aug 7 2022 ap photo manuel balce ceneta washington ap democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage sunday a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life cheers broke out as senate democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote after an all night session today senate democrats sided with american families over special interests president joe biden said in a statement from rehoboth beach delaware i ran for president promising to make government work for working families again and that is what this bill does period biden who had his share of long nights during his three decades as a senator called into the senate cloakroom during the vote on speakerphone to personally thank the staff for their hard work the president urged the house to pass the bill as soon as possible speaker nancy pelosi said her chamber would move swiftly to send this bill to the president s desk house votes are expected friday it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative feats of the 21st century senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday afternoon democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a campaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the new measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued in an ordeal imposed on most budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together the compromise bill negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt criticized the bill s shortcomings and offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits but those efforts were defeated republicans forced their own votes designed to make democrats look soft on u s mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian who said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes but the thrust of democrats pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above 1 billion a 1 tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings she also joined with other western senators to win 4 billion to combat the region s drought several democratic senators joined the gop led effort to exclude some firms from the new corporate minimum tax the package keeps to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000 a year it was on the energy and environment side that compromise was most evident between progressives and manchin a champion of fossil fuels and his state s coal industry clean energy would be fostered with tax credits for buying electric vehicles and manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines there would be home energy rebates funds for constructing factories building clean energy technology and money to promote climate friendly farm practices and reduce pollution in minority communities manchin won billions to help power plants lower carbon emissions plus language requiring more government auctions for oil drilling on federal land and waters party leaders also promised to push separate legislation this fall to accelerate permits for energy projects which manchin wants to include a nearly completed natural gas pipeline in his state still environmental groups hailed the passage as a milestone tremendous progress said manish bapna president and ceo of the natural resources defense council in a statement ___ associated press writers chris megerian in rehoboth del and matthew daly in washington contributed to this report
updated august 12 2022 at 5 42 pm et the house gave final congressional approval on friday to a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion it was passed without any republican support and now goes to president biden for his signature house speaker nancy pelosi d calif called it a glorious day adding we sent to the president s desk a monumental bill that will be truly for the people senate democrats revived the bill a year in the making with a furious few final weeks of negotiations mainly between sen majority leader chuck schumer d n y and sen joe manchin of west virginia its final major hurdle was a marathon voting session last weekend in the senate the legislation was passed through the budget reconciliation process which meant that all 50 democrats in the senate and one tie breaker vote from vice president harris were needed since none of the 50 republican senators voted for the bill it also restricted the measures in the bill to those that directly change federal spending and revenue democrats have argued the measure will tackle voters main economic concern naming it the inflation reduction act republicans argue the new spending will aggravate inflation the nonpartisan congressional budget office says though the bill has a negligible effect on inflation in 2022 and into 2023 house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif called the bill tone deaf ahead of friday s floor vote democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford mccarthy added overall the bill is a very scaled down solution to what many democrats including president biden had asked for originally this bill is far from perfect it s a compromise but it s often how progress is made biden said at the white house last month my message to congress is this this is the strongest bill you can pass after the house passed it on friday biden said he will sign the historic legislation next week here s a look at some of what did get included in the democrats bill and what didn t you can see the entire 730 page bill here tackling climate change more than 300 billion will be invested in energy and climate reform the largest federal clean energy investment in u s history the bill has support from many environmental and climate activists but is short of the 555 billion that democrats had originally called for this portion of the bill takes on transportation and electricity generation and it includes 60 billion for growing renewable energy infrastructure in manufacturing like solar panels and wind turbines it also includes several tax credits for individuals on things like electric vehicles and making homes more energy efficient the bill will according to democrats lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40 based on 2005 levels by the end of the decade which is short of the 50 biden had originally aimed for it puts us within a close enough distance that further executive action state and local government efforts and private sector leadership could plausibly get us across the finish line by 2030 said jesse jenkins from princeton university who leads the repeat project analyzing the impact of government climate actions lowering the cost of prescription drugs on health reforms the bill takes on making prescription drugs more affordable but there are some limits the bill includes a historic measure that allows the federal health secretary to negotiate the prices of certain expensive drugs each year for medicare but this won t impact every prescription drug or every patient and it won t take effect quickly the negotiations will take effect for 10 drugs covered by medicare in 2026 increasing to 20 drugs in 2029 the portion of the bill that tried to cap at 35 per month the price of insulin a drug that is incredibly expensive in the u s compared to other countries was ruled out of order by the senate parliamentarian who ruled the cap could apply on medicare a government program but not on private insurance so democrats split the measure between medicare and private insurance but republicans ultimately blocked the measure for private insurance the parliamentarian also ruled that a measure that was in the bill to force drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was not totally in line with the rules for budget reconciliation she said that it could apply to medicare patients but not those with private insurers the bill puts a cap of 2 000 on out of pocket prescription drug costs for people on medicare effective in 2025 there s also a three year extension on healthcare subsidies in the affordable care act originally passed in a pandemic relief bill last year estimated by the government to have kept premiums at 10 per month or lower for the vast majority of people covered through the federal health insurance exchange that helps millions of americans avoid spikes in their health care costs tax reform the legislation creates a 15 minimum tax for corporations making 1 billion or more in income bringing in more than 300 billion in revenue a portion that got cut though is one that narrowed the carried interest tax loophole arizona kyrsten sinema agreed to sign onto the bill if this measure which would have changed the way private equity income is taxed was cut democrats said it would have brought in 14 billion in revenue instead a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks was introduced and it could bring in roughly five times as much revenue as the carried interest measure however it wouldn t take effect until next year raising predictions of a rush of buybacks by some companies before 2023 rolls around a major portion of the bill that isn t included due to opposition from west virginia sen joe manchin is extending the child tax credit manchin expressed last year that the cost to extend the credit was too high but progressives including vermont sen bernie sanders continued to push for its inclusion in the bill copyright 2022 npr to see more visit
by alex rogers clare foran ali zaslav and manu raju cnn the senate on sunday afternoon passed democrats 750 billion health care tax and climate bill in a significant victory for president joe biden and his party the final party line vote was 51 50 with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie the package is the product of painstaking negotiations and its final passage would give democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections the democrat controlled house which is expected to take up the legislation on friday august 12 must approve the bill before biden can sign it into law the sweeping bill named the inflation reduction act would represent the largest climate investment in us history and make major changes to health policy by giving medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years the legislation would reduce the deficit be paid for through new taxes including a 15 minimum tax on large corporations and a 1 tax on stock buybacks and boost the internal revenue service s ability to collect it would raise over 700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over 430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the affordable care act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit senate democrats with a narrow 50 seat majority stayed unified to pass the legislation using a special filibuster proof process to approve the measure without republican votes final passage came after a marathon series of contentious amendment votes known as a vote a rama that stretched nearly 16 hours from late saturday night until sunday afternoon west virginia democratic sen joe manchin told cnn that the legislation he helped write is a good balanced bill i think we ll all benefit from it the country will manchin told cnn we have energy security that s what we were looking for and we have the ability to invest in the energy of the future biden praised the senate for passing the bill in a statement sunday thanking democrats in the chamber and touting the legislation s climate investments and health care provisions today senate democrats sided with american families over special interests voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs health insurance and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share biden said how senate democrats passed the bill on a party line vote senate democrats have long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus manchin played a key role in shaping the legislation which only moved forward after the west virginia democrat and senate majority leader chuck schumer announced a deal at the end of july a major breakthrough for democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out arizona sen kyrsten sinema on thursday night offered critical support after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals indicating she would move forward on the sweeping economic package but sinema manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making crucial alterations on the bill to avoid a last minute collapse of the bill on sunday democrats created a plan to win over sinema who was concerned over the 15 corporate minimum tax s impact on subsidiaries owned by private equity senate democrats accepted a narrower tax proposal but instead of paying for it through a change to the state and local tax salt deduction as senate gop whip john thune of south dakota suggested they instead extended the limitation on the amount of losses that businesses can deduct for another two years the change was intended to prevent house democrats primarily from coastal districts who have campaigned on repealing limits on the salt deduction from breaking from the bill when they vote on it later this week after the bill s passage in the senate sinema said in a statement it would help arizonans build better lives for themselves and their families by lowering prices making health care more affordable and accessible and securing arizona s water and energy future while also boosting innovation and spurring job creation in a good sign for the bill becoming law key house democrats signaled later sunday that they ll vote for it despite previous demands over salt rep josh gottheimer of new jersey had been part of the no salt no deal caucus but he said the bill passes his test because it doesn t raise individual income tax rates rep mikie sherrill of new jersey another member of that caucus echoed his sentiment i will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing salt because this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district but in fact significantly lowers their costs i will be voting for it republicans used the weekend vote a rama to put democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes they were also successful in removing a key insulin provision to cap the price of insulin to 35 per month on the private insurance market which the senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the senate s reconciliation rules the 35 insulin cap for medicare beneficiaries remains in place senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said in a statement that the bill included giant job killing tax hikes and amounted to a war on american fossil fuel the kentucky republican said democrats do not care about middle class families priorities and their response to the runaway inflation they ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all said mcconnell the american people are clear about their priorities environmental regulation is a 3 issue americans want solutions for inflation crime and the border how the bill addresses the climate crisis while economists disagree over whether the package would in fact live up to its name and reduce inflation particularly in the short term the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions the nearly 370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in us history and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark clean air act it also comes at a critical time this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet analysis from senate majority leader chuck schumer s office as well as multiple independent analyses suggests the measure would reduce us carbon emissions by up to 40 by 2030 strong climate regulations from the biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to president joe biden s goal of cutting emissions 50 by 2030 the bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables and spur more american consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles lawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what s needed to combat the climate crisis this isn t about the laws of politics this is about the laws of physics democratic sen brian schatz of hawaii told cnn we all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do key health care and tax policy in the bill the bill would empower medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors offices or purchased at the pharmacy the health and human services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026 and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028 the number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond this controversial provision is far more limited than the one house democratic leaders have backed in the past but it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for obamacare coverage through 2025 a year later than lawmakers recently discussed that way they wouldn t expire just after the 2024 presidential election to boost revenue the bill would impose a 15 minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders known as book income as opposed to the internal revenue service the measure which would raise 258 billion over a decade would apply to companies with profits over 1 billion concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses particularly manufacturers sinema has suggested that she won changes to the democrats plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes the details remain unclear however sinema nixed her party s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20 long term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37 the provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate addressing this loophole which would have raised 14 billion over a decade had been a longtime goal of congressional democrats in its place a 1 excise tax on companies stock buybacks was added

one of the largest antitrust trials ever to hit the publishing industry is unfolding in a federal courthouse in washington the department of justice says that the proposed merger announced in 2020 between penguin random house and simon schuster would stifle competition but what would a successful merger mean on a practical level for booksellers authors and others in the industry alli bibbo helm literary agency helm literary agency penguin random house author saira rao saira rao an author in richmond va has been watching the case closely even though penguin random house is her publisher she said she welcomes the government s pushback against the behemoth s attempt to grow even bigger rao said it s sending a message about the need for more diversity in the publishing industry which has traditionally excluded writers of color like herself and which has made her books harder to sell i have a white agent the editors of our books are white the heads of the marketing are white said rao who is south asian american it s white white white white white a study released in 2020 by major children s book publisher lee low books in collaboration with boston university says 76 of people in the industry identify as white down from 79 the last time the company conducted its survey in 2015 authors guild president douglas preston said reduced competition will likely make the sector even less diverse and that s bad not just for authors but also for readers the readers are served by a maximum diversity of authors and voices especially authors from overlooked communities preston said these are authors who don t make a lot of money but who have very important things to say a spokesman for penguin random house said in a statement it was committed to fostering diversity and providing bipoc opportunities across the literary world from editors to authors and that after the merger this would continue simon schuster said something similar in an emailed statement from a spokesperson simon schuster is committed to working with our employees authors and the publishing community to make our company and our industry a safe and inclusive environment for all he said that the company merger or not would continue working toward being a publisher whose books and staff represent the breadth and depth of our diverse population authors guild president preston who said some of his own books have been published by simon schuster added that author advances are also likely to take a hit with more consolidation the fewer publishers there are bidding against each other for an author s work the lower the advance preston said it s economics 101 but penguin random house contends the merger would increase author advances the pre trial brief shared with npr stated this is a pro consumer acquisition that will allow simon schuster and its editors and authors to become part of prh with its industry leading supply chain giving readers and book sellers across the world greater access to their books it will also enhance competition by enabling the combined company to offer increased advances and marketing support to authors competition will increase not decrease as a result of these investments a spokesperson for penguin random house said the company could not share data on author advances since the last major publishing industry merger occurred between random house and penguin in 2013 owing to legal constraints a spokesperson for simon schuster said the company couldn t discuss author advances because they were at issue in the trial some industry insiders agree with the publishers that the potential union of two of the five biggest publishing houses in the country does not pose a threat to a robust sector that puts out a million titles a year i don t see this as anything other than a blip in terms of the ability of the book publishing industry to meet the needs of readers said brian o leary executive director of the book industry study group which provides supply chain research for around two hundred publishing industry members including penguin random house and simon schuster o leary said even if the judge rules in favor of the merger book lovers still benefit from the hundreds of thousands of titles released each year by thousands of independent publishers there are plenty of outlets for writers and not just in the u s market but worldwide o leary said chloe veltman npr npr josiah luis alderete co owner of medicine for nightmares a san francisco calif bookstore focusing on communities of color but like other critics of the acquisition josiah luis alderete co owner of medicine for nightmares an independent bookstore in san francisco which stocks books by both indie presses and the big five publishing houses said consolidation will reduce all kinds of diversity and provide fewer opportunities for writers it worries me alderete said it s gonna be a lot less people deciding what s what but he said he wouldn t be surprised if the merger

in america as in europe there is fear and anger at system disintegration the train wreck has been expected for so long that we have become comfortable living under its shadow life went on markets were sanguine that the market lifestyle subsidy provided by the central banks would continue unabated and not without good reason either any trader disappointment at central bank action any dip in markets brought forth a collective market hissy fit that usually strong armed the central banks into immediate appeasement we were hard pressed to imagine differently by alastair crooke now however we re in a new era in many ways the west has entered upon a war with russia and china the west however did not do its homework first and now is finding that the war is cruelly revealing the structural rigidities and flaws integral to its own economic system rather than mining the weaknesses of its rivals why is this new era so grave firstly because of what lies beneath the stones these structural contradictions have been accumulating over decades lurking in the dark damp underside to the stones kept hidden from sight by the serendipitous for the u s economic outcome to ww2 and the equally serendipitous combination of factors that kept inflation low so low that western economists believed they had found the holy grail of monetary easing they had banished recessions for ever so simple really just turn on the money printer hubris prevailed it was magic a new economics and then inadvertently team biden kicked over the stones in their eagerness to cut russia down to size instigating sanctions and stealing russia s foreign reserves and inflation was the serpent under the rock long latent unseen yet always present and no longer one serpent but now many and then they found they are fighting the wrong war ukraine was conceived as the urban war american and nato trainers had absorbed from the jihadists fighting president assad in syria but russia knew this type of war well they did not bite instead they fought a classic artillery war in which russia traditionally has excelled so the serpents of inflation at a time of structural economic checkmate are loosened as they always are in war and as pressures mount things and people get thrown under a bus war makes for clarity it becomes starkly clear what baggage must go overboard to save the vessel saving the vessel of course is imperative thus america has decided to look after its own the davos brussels plan to eventually to roll up the over indebted european commercial banks into a single brussels controlled digital currency suddenly is seen as if scales had fallen from the eyes as potentially threatening to hole the hull below the waterline what this reveals is that the strong dollar weak dollar play in tandem with treasury sanctions has been not so bad for the ny big banks why let the europeans scoop up all those distressed assets that pop up in times of crisis why allow the u s big banking sphere to dissolve into a world of fin tech apps why deprive the former of their historic raiding rights why stop now because the europeans want davos so the u s big banks are thinking let the ecb and by extension the euro zone fall under the bus co ordinating policy with the ecb anyway has tied the hands of the fed to manage affairs to its own advantage with war the serpents crawl out again a stark clarity emerges what worked when inflation was less than 2 doesn t cut it at double digit inflation the low inflation era was dominated by monetarist dogma and so it also bred structural contradictions even moderate interest rate increases now risk eviscerating bonds and highly leveraged u s companies and yet still will not be high enough to stem inflation the fed s 75bps rate hike is a drop in the bucket compared to what will be needed to slow the inflationary crisis what to do with war comes inflation and a decline in those willing to fund the u s government s borrowing requirement as interest due on 30 trillion blows out interest rates therefore must rise even if they do nothing to stem inflation to keep value in treasuries thrown under the next bus too then is the u s consumer as inflation will soar higher rates however have not been enough to lure outside investors into treasury markets with treasuries now facing the worst bond market collapse in half a century this has led china to dump u s treasuries to the lowest level in 12 years and japan once a stalwart pillar of u s investment is cutting their holdings as well the decline in u s treasuries along with the ongoing decline in the u s dollar as the world reserve currency leads to one thing more inflation more pain here is another structural contradiction thrown up by the monetarist era theoretically should the fed crash demand enough by making people so poor they cannot afford things inflation can quicky be lowered to 2 huge sigh of relief ensues can the fed then get back to printing money again not so quick please this outcome is monetarist group think it is part of the hubris today s narrative is that the fed can hike until the year end hammer the consumer senseless and then start the printing presses again so that the market lifestyle subsidy is on again it s the war stupid to misquote president clinton if you take a sanctions hammer to a fragile just in time complex supply network you will have supply blockages and cost push inflation is inevitable turning on the money tap when you face supply generated inflation will only return the inflationary dynamic to the system what the fed is trying to do is to keepsome benefits of a reserve currency intact at a time when commodity value as a trading medium commands the world s attention what is this likely to mean in terms of practical politics well cost of living crises are already here as is the beginning to the ensuing political ructions the ecb last week announced the end of the asset purchases and did not put anything else in place all the ecb said was that it would work on an emergency instrument so clearly there is an emergency yet there is no new instrument and there won t be one the ecb can use an existing qe tool to buy an unlimited amount of sovereign bonds or not it s a choice not a new tool the euro is but a derivative of the dollar which itself is a derivative of the underlying collateral the euro system to use a military metaphor was built to protect existing static defensive lines it is no roving mobile expeditionary military force the systemic basis to the euro zone has been the ecb s absolute commitment to keep german 10 year bund at a managed premium over 10 year u s treasuries these are respectively the two value anchors underpinning the functioning of the euro zone and as interest rates rise in the u s this must be reflected in the bund to preserve its value for sovereign bonds represent the highly leveraged collateral upon which the european banking edifice stands or not if the value of say italian collateral declines a financial doom loop sets in as it did in 2012 in a word the euro zone potentially would collapse at 2 inflation european sovereign bonds could be kept more or less aligned at 8 they cannot and the bond market is fragmenting the spreads between states bonds have skyrocketed in recent weeks as a stopgap the ecb seems to be selling german bunds to buy italian debt what does this portend for the future a hint of what might be coming was when christine lagarde left no doubt that the ecb will at least try to tough it out she said during a conversation at the london school of economics that the ecb would not subject itself to financial dominance financial dominance is a broader concept than fiscal dominance because it includes bailing out banks and other financial institutions as well as government borrowing needs that sounds very much like her stating a readiness to throw either eu banks or countries or both under a bus hypothetically the only remedy might be a mutualised eurobond and full qe though that would require eu treaty renegotiation qe would of course exacerbate inflation and the spreads but would the northern frugal states acquiesce might they not prefer to opt for a truncated frugalist mini euro zone by throwing portugal italy greece and spain under the bus this effectively might at least save a core to the euro project by winnowing out the weaker states and reserving the euro to the less indebted northern economies the consequence would be a europe emulating that which wall street did to russia during the yeltsin era i e imagine it as italy with its assets privatised and sold off for 1 as draghi once did to banco popular which he took over as ecb chief and then sold to santander for euro 1 as of now it seems the euro élites have not sensed the danger they are in they entered a war and already three major geo political tectonic shifts are visible firstly putin s rebellion has prompted the rest of the world to say that they have had it with westification by which is meant the predatory grasping type of colonialism that has characterised western foreign policy by all means be the west but not westified by all means be european but not an eu values missionary the non westerners suggest secondly european voters are not looking for more efficient markets or regulatory structures as the cold winds of recession blow they look to their leaders for protection from markets and regulatory absurdities they sense the danger of unknown doom loops imploding parts of their economy they are beginning to understand that in wars rivals strike back too war is what it is the risk coming from the cost of living crisis is easy to grasp the risk from additional food shortages is almost beyond calculation but what we observe from america and the recent round of the french assembly elections is normal politics checkmated social distrust widening reservations toward the legitimacy of central authority and increasing scepticism and doubts about ideologised science in the u s there is evident a centrifugal separation reflected in migratory flows the checkmating the toxification of politics is leading americans to want to live amongst their like minded counterparts it is as it were a political ben op a literal and geographic mass movement to live within encircled wagons and in states such as florida and texas with their clear tribal immigration an increasing self definition in opposition to the federal government thirdly there is in america as in europe fear and anger too at system disintegration fear as cities become both violent and mal administered the situation at europe s airports in these last weeks of sheer chaos and unbelievable queues gives a foretaste of the angst that is unleashed toward remote techno fragile systems that simply freeze solid under pressure triggering both anger and grievance war even a war of choice always reveals the fragility of complex systems an article in the atlantic recently noted that if you as a typical urban professional millennial woke up on a casper mattress worked out with a peloton ubered to a wework ordered on doordash for lunch took a lyft home and ordered dinner through postmates only to realize your partner had already started on a blue apron meal your household had in one day interacted with eight unprofitable companies that collectively lost about 15 billion in one year it has been a millennial lifestyle subsidy that may vanish in the twinkling of an eye or in one hike of an interest rate it is a mirage one that reflects the absurdities of the cult of tech in a zero interest rate era it will soon be gone yet if our various crises stop at such minor inconveniences we shall be lucky rather we may well see ideological movements as likely upper middle class as drawn from the blue collar sphere split with one part staying mainstream and others seeking violence and revolution as did the baader meinhof and the red brigade groups in 1970s europe in the u s there are already intimations of such armed actions stemming from splinters of the pro abortion movement but in europe and

washington ap not as robust as the proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking the estimated 740 billion package passed sunday by the senate and heading to the house is full of party priorities those include capping prescription drug costs at 2 000 out of pocket for seniors helping americans pay for private health insurance and what democrats are calling the most substantial investment in history to fight climate change some 375 billion over the decade almost half the money raised 300 billion will go toward paying down federal deficits it s all paid for largely with new corporate taxes including a 15 minimum tax on big corporations to ensure they don t skip out on paying any taxes at all as well as projected federal savings from lower medicare drug costs called the inflation reduction act of 2022 it s not at all clear the 755 page bill will substantially ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs votes fell strictly along party lines in the 50 50 senate with all democrats in favor all republicans opposed and vice president kamala harris providing a tie breaking vote for 51 50 passage the house is expected to vote by friday a look at what s in and out of the final package lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a dose a provision to extend that price cap on insulin to americans with private health insurances was out of line with senate budget rules and republicans stripped it from the final bill help pay for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would invest nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies including investments in renewable energy production and tax rebates for consumers to buy new or used electric vehicles it s broken down to include 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water for consumers there are tax breaks as incentives to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar there are tax breaks for buying electric vehicles including a 4 000 tax credit for purchase of used electric vehicles and 7 500 for new ones in all democrats believe the strategy could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far how to pay for all of this the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade the revenue would have been higher but sinema insisted on one change to the 15 corporate minimum allowing a depreciation deduction used by manufacturing industries that shaves about 55 billion off the total revenue to win over sinema democrats dropped plans to close a tax loophole long enjoyed by wealthier americans so called carried interest which under current law taxes wealthy hedge fund managers and others at a 20 rate the left has for years sought to boost the carried interest tax rate hiked to 37 in the original bill more in line with upper income earners sinema wouldn t allow it keeping the tax break for the wealthy deprives the party of 14 billion in revenue they were counting on to help pay for the package in its place democrats with sinema s nod will impose a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year the lower drug prices for seniors are paid for with savings from medicare s negotiations with the drug companies extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left behind this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs ___ associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report

one of the largest antitrust trials ever to hit the publishing industry is unfolding in a federal courthouse in washington the department of justice says that the proposed merger announced in 2020 between penguin random house and simon schuster would stifle competition but what would a successful merger mean on a practical level for booksellers authors and others in the industry alli bibbo helm literary agency helm literary agency penguin random house author saira rao saira rao an author in richmond va has been watching the case closely even though penguin random house is her publisher she said she welcomes the government s pushback against the behemoth s attempt to grow even bigger rao said it s sending a message about the need for more diversity in the publishing industry which has traditionally excluded writers of color like herself and which has made her books harder to sell i have a white agent the editors of our books are white the heads of the marketing are white said rao who is south asian american it s white white white white white a study released in 2020 by major children s book publisher lee low books in collaboration with boston university says 76 of people in the industry identify as white down from 79 the last time the company conducted its survey in 2015 authors guild president douglas preston said reduced competition will likely make the sector even less diverse and that s bad not just for authors but also for readers the readers are served by a maximum diversity of authors and voices especially authors from overlooked communities preston said these are authors who don t make a lot of money but who have very important things to say a spokesman for penguin random house said in a statement it was committed to fostering diversity and providing bipoc opportunities across the literary world from editors to authors and that after the merger this would continue simon schuster said something similar in an emailed statement from a spokesperson simon schuster is committed to working with our employees authors and the publishing community to make our company and our industry a safe and inclusive environment for all he said that the company merger or not would continue working toward being a publisher whose books and staff represent the breadth and depth of our diverse population authors guild president preston who said some of his own books have been published by simon schuster added that author advances are also likely to take a hit with more consolidation the fewer publishers there are bidding against each other for an author s work the lower the advance preston said it s economics 101 but penguin random house contends the merger would increase author advances the pre trial brief shared with npr stated this is a pro consumer acquisition that will allow simon schuster and its editors and authors to become part of prh with its industry leading supply chain giving readers and book sellers across the world greater access to their books it will also enhance competition by enabling the combined company to offer increased advances and marketing support to authors competition will increase not decrease as a result of these investments a spokesperson for penguin random house said the company could not share data on author advances since the last major publishing industry merger occurred between random house and penguin in 2013 owing to legal constraints a spokesperson for simon schuster said the company couldn t discuss author advances because they were at issue in the trial some industry insiders agree with the publishers that the potential union of two of the five biggest publishing houses in the country does not pose a threat to a robust sector that puts out a million titles a year i don t see this as anything other than a blip in terms of the ability of the book publishing industry to meet the needs of readers said brian o leary executive director of the book industry study group which provides supply chain research for around two hundred publishing industry members including penguin random house and simon schuster o leary said even if the judge rules in favor of the merger book lovers still

updated august 12 2022 at 5 42 pm et the house gave final congressional approval on friday to a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion it was passed without any republican support and now goes to president biden for his signature house speaker nancy pelosi d calif called it a glorious day adding we sent to the president s desk a monumental bill that will be truly for the people senate democrats revived the bill a year in the making with a furious few final weeks of negotiations mainly between sen majority leader chuck schumer d n y and sen joe manchin of west virginia its final major hurdle was a marathon voting session last weekend in the senate the legislation was passed through the budget reconciliation process which meant that all 50 democrats in the senate and one tie breaker vote from vice president harris were needed since none of the 50 republican senators voted for the bill it also restricted the measures in the bill to those that directly change federal spending and revenue democrats have argued the measure will tackle voters main economic concern naming it the inflation reduction act republicans argue the new spending will aggravate inflation the nonpartisan congressional budget office says though the bill has a negligible effect on inflation in 2022 and into 2023 house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif called the bill tone deaf ahead of friday s floor vote democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford mccarthy added overall the bill is a very scaled down solution to what many democrats including president biden had asked for originally this bill is far from perfect it s a compromise but it s often how progress is made biden said at the white house last month my message to congress is this this is the strongest bill you can pass after the house passed it on friday biden said he will sign the historic legislation next week here s a look at some of what did get included in the democrats bill and what didn t you can see the entire 730 page bill here tackling climate change more than 300 billion will be invested in energy and climate reform the largest federal clean energy investment in u s history the bill has support from many environmental and climate activists but is short of the 555 billion that democrats had originally called for this portion of the bill takes on transportation and electricity generation and it includes 60 billion for growing renewable energy infrastructure in manufacturing like solar panels and wind turbines it also includes several tax credits for individuals on things like electric vehicles and making homes more energy efficient the bill will according to democrats lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40 based on 2005 levels by the end of the decade which is short of the 50 biden had originally aimed for it puts us within a close enough distance that further executive action state and local government efforts and private sector leadership could plausibly get us across the finish line by 2030 said jesse jenkins from princeton university who leads the repeat project analyzing the impact of government climate actions lowering the cost of prescription drugs on health reforms the bill takes on making prescription drugs more affordable but there are some limits the bill includes a historic measure that allows the federal health secretary to negotiate the prices of certain expensive drugs each year for medicare but this won t impact every prescription drug or every patient and it won t take effect quickly the negotiations will take effect for 10 drugs covered by medicare in 2026 increasing to 20 drugs in 2029 the portion of the bill that tried to cap at 35 per month the price of insulin a drug that is incredibly expensive in the u s compared to other countries was ruled out of order by the senate parliamentarian who ruled the cap could apply on medicare a government program but not on private insurance so democrats split the measure between medicare and private insurance but republicans ultimately blocked the measure for private insurance the parliamentarian also ruled that a measure that was in the bill to force drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was not totally in line with the rules for budget reconciliation she said that it could apply to medicare patients but not those with private insurers the bill puts a cap of 2 000 on out of pocket prescription drug costs for people on medicare effective in 2025 there s also a three year extension on healthcare subsidies in the affordable care act originally passed in a pandemic relief bill last year estimated by the government to have kept premiums at 10 per month or lower for the vast majority of people covered through the federal health insurance exchange that helps millions of americans avoid spikes in their health care costs tax reform the legislation creates a 15 minimum tax for corporations making 1 billion or more in income bringing in more than 300 billion in revenue a portion that got cut though is one that narrowed the carried interest tax loophole arizona kyrsten sinema agreed to sign onto the bill if this measure which would have changed the way private equity income is taxed was cut democrats said it would have brought in 14 billion in revenue instead a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks was introduced and it could bring in roughly five times as much revenue as the carried interest measure however it wouldn t take effect until next year raising predictions of a rush of buybacks by some companies before 2023 rolls around a major portion of the bill that isn t included due to opposition from west virginia sen joe manchin is extending the child tax credit manchin expressed last year that the cost to extend the credit was too high but

one of the largest antitrust trials ever to hit the publishing industry is unfolding in a federal courthouse in washington the department of justice says that the proposed merger announced in 2020 between penguin random house and simon schuster would stifle competition but what would a successful merger mean on a practical level for booksellers authors and others in the industry alli bibbo helm literary agency helm literary agency penguin random house author saira rao saira rao an author in richmond va has been watching the case closely even though penguin random house is her publisher she said she welcomes the government s pushback against the behemoth s attempt to grow even bigger rao said it s sending a message about the need for more diversity in the publishing industry which has traditionally excluded writers of color like herself and which has made her books harder to sell i have a white agent the editors of our books are white the heads of the marketing are white said rao who is south asian american it s white white white white white a study released in 2020 by major children s book publisher lee low books in collaboration with boston university says 76 of people in the industry identify as white down from 79 the last time the company conducted its survey in 2015 authors guild president douglas preston said reduced competition will likely make the sector even less diverse and that s bad not just for authors but also for readers the readers are served by a maximum diversity of authors and voices especially authors from overlooked communities preston said these are authors who don t make a lot of money but who have very important things to say a spokesman for penguin random house said in a statement it was committed to fostering diversity and providing bipoc opportunities across the literary world from editors to authors and that after the merger this would continue simon schuster said something similar in an emailed statement from a spokesperson simon schuster is committed to working with our employees authors and the publishing community to make our company and our industry a safe and inclusive environment for all he said that the company merger or not would continue working toward being a publisher whose books and staff represent the breadth and depth of our diverse population authors guild president preston who said some of his own books have been published by simon schuster added that author advances are also likely to take a hit with more consolidation the fewer publishers there are bidding against each other for an author s work the lower the advance preston said it s economics 101 but penguin random house contends the merger would increase author advances the pre trial brief shared with npr stated this is a pro consumer acquisition that will allow simon schuster and its editors and authors to become part of prh with its industry leading supply chain giving readers and book sellers across the world greater access to their books it will also enhance competition by enabling the combined company to offer increased advances and marketing support to authors competition will increase not decrease as a result of these investments a spokesperson for penguin random house said the company could not share data on author advances since the last major publishing industry merger occurred between random house and penguin in 2013 owing to legal constraints a spokesperson for simon schuster said the company couldn t discuss author advances because they were at issue in the trial some industry insiders agree with the publishers that the potential union of two of the five biggest publishing houses in the country does not pose a threat to a robust sector that puts out a million titles a year i don t see this as anything other than a blip in terms of the ability of the book publishing industry to meet the needs of readers said brian o leary executive director of the book industry study group which provides supply chain research for around two hundred publishing industry members including penguin random house and simon schuster o leary said even if the judge rules in favor of the merger book lovers still benefit from the hundreds of thousands of titles released each year by thousands of independent publishers there are plenty of outlets for writers and not just in the u s market but worldwide o leary said chloe veltman npr npr josiah luis alderete co owner of medicine for nightmares a san francisco calif bookstore focusing on communities of color but like other critics of the acquisition josiah luis alderete co owner of medicine for nightmares an independent bookstore in san francisco which stocks books by both indie presses and the big five publishing houses said consolidation will reduce all kinds of diversity and provide fewer opportunities for writers it worries me alderete said it s gonna be a lot less people deciding what s what but he said he wouldn t be surprised if the merger

not as robust as the proposal president joe biden once envisioned to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems the democrats compromise of health care climate change and deficit reduction strategies is still a substantial undertaking approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws get south florida local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc south florida newsletters called the inflation reduction act of 2022 the 730 page bill may not do much to immediately ease inflationary pressures though millions of americans are expected to see some relief in health care and other costs a look at what s in and out of the 740 billion final package lowering the cost of prescription drugs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window those new revenues would be put back into lower costs for seniors on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the money would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for people who are purchasing their own health care policies single biggest investment in climate change in u s history the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water president joe biden urged lawmakers thursday to pass the inflation reduction act of 2022 a bill which would offer inflation relief and invest in energy security and climate change programs how will the government for all of this new corporate minimum tax the biggest revenue raiser in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which put out a new report this week on long term projections what s left out of the inflation reduction act this latest package emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs ___ associated press writer matthew daly

washington ap democrats pushed their election year economic package to senate passage sunday a hard fought compromise less ambitious than president joe biden s original domestic vision but one that still meets deep rooted party goals of slowing global warming moderating pharmaceutical costs and taxing immense corporations the estimated 740 billion package heads next to the house where lawmakers are poised to deliver on biden s priorities a stunning turnaround of what had seemed a lost and doomed effort that suddenly roared back to political life democrats held united 51 50 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote it s been a long tough and winding road but at last at last we have arrived said senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y ahead of final votes the senate is making history i am confident the inflation reduction act will endure as one of the defining legislative measures of the 21st century senators engaged in a round the clock marathon of voting that began saturday and stretched late into sunday afternoon democrats swatted down some three dozen republican amendments designed to torpedo the legislation confronting unanimous gop opposition democratic unity in the 50 50 chamber held keeping the party on track for a morale boosting victory three months from elections when congressional control is at stake i think it s gonna pass biden told reporters as he left the white house early sunday to go to rehoboth beach delaware ending his covid 19 isolation the house seemed likely to provide final congressional approval when it returns briefly from summer recess on friday the bill ran into trouble midday over objections to the new 15 corporate minimum tax that private equity firms and other industries disliked forcing last minute changes despite the momentary setback the inflation reduction act gives democrats a c ampaign season showcase for action on coveted goals it includes the largest ever federal effort on climate change close to 400 billion caps out of pocket drug costs for seniors on medicare to 2 000 a year and extends expiring subsidies that help 13 million people afford health insurance by raising corporate taxes the whole package is paid for with some 300 billion extra revenue for deficit reduction barely more than one tenth the size of biden s initial 10 year 3 5 trillion rainbow of progressive aspirations in his build back better initiative the new package abandons earlier proposals for universal preschool paid family leave and expanded child care aid that plan collapsed after conservative sen joe manchin d w va opposed it saying it was too costly and would fuel inflation nonpartisan analysts have said the inflation reduction act would have a minor effect on surging consumer prices republicans said the measure would undermine an economy that policymakers are struggling to keep from plummeting into recession they said the bill s business taxes would hurt job creation and force prices skyward making it harder for people to cope with the nation s worst inflation since the 1980s democrats have already robbed american families once through inflation and now their solution is to rob american families a second time senate minority leader mitch mcconnell r ky argued he said spending and tax increases in the legislation would eliminate jobs while having insignificant impact on inflation and climate change in an ordeal imposed on all budget bills like this one the senate had to endure an overnight vote a rama of rapid fire amendments each tested democrats ability to hold together a compromise negotiated by schumer progressives manchin and the inscrutable centrist sen kyrsten sinema d ariz progressive sen bernie sanders i vt offered amendments to further expand the legislation s health benefits and those efforts were defeated most votes were forced by republicans and many were designed to make democrats look soft on u s mexico border security and gasoline and energy costs and like bullies for wanting to strengthen irs tax law enforcement before debate began saturday the bill s prescription drug price curbs were diluted by the senate s nonpartisan parliamentarian elizabeth macdonough who referees questions about the chamber s procedures said a provision should fall that would impose costly penalties on drug makers whose price increases for private insurers exceed inflation it was the bill s chief protection for the 180 million people with private health coverage they get through work or purchase themselves under special procedures that will let democrats pass their bill by simple majority without the usual 60 vote margin its provisions must be focused more on dollar and cents budget numbers than policy changes but the thrust of their pharmaceutical price language remained that included letting medicare negotiate what it pays for drugs for its 64 million elderly recipients penalizing manufacturers for exceeding inflation for pharmaceuticals sold to medicare and limiting beneficiaries out of pocket drug costs to 2 000 annually the bill also caps medicare patients costs for insulin the expensive diabetes medication at 35 monthly democrats wanted to extend the 35 cap to private insurers but it ran afoul of senate rules most republicans voted to strip it from the package though in a sign of the political potency of health costs seven gop senators joined democrats trying to preserve it the measure s final costs were being recalculated to reflect late changes but overall it would raise more than 700 billion over a decade the money would come from a 15 minimum tax on a handful of corporations with yearly profits above 1 billion a 1 tax on companies that repurchase their own stock bolstered irs tax collections and government savings from lower drug costs sinema forced democrats to drop a plan to prevent wealthy hedge fund managers from paying less than individual income tax rates for their earnings she also joined with other western senators to win 4 billion to combat the region s drought several democratic senators joined the gop led effort to exclude some firms from the new corporate minimum tax the package keeps to biden s pledge not to raise taxes on those earning less than 400 000 a year it was on the energy and environment side that compromise was most evident between progressives and manchin a champion of fossil fuels and his state s coal industry clean energy would be fostered with tax credits for buying electric vehicles and manufacturing solar panels and wind turbines there would be home energy rebates funds for constructing factories building clean energy technology and money to promote climate friendly farm practices and reduce pollution in minority communities manchin won billions to help power plants lower carbon emissions plus language requiring more government auctions for oil drilling on federal land and waters party leaders also promised to push separate legislation this fall to accelerate permits for energy projects which manchin wants to include a nearly completed natural gas pipeline in his state
updated august 12 2022 at 5 42 pm et the house gave final congressional approval on friday to a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion it was passed without any republican support and now goes to president biden for his signature house speaker nancy pelosi d calif called it a glorious day adding we sent to the president s desk a monumental bill that will be truly for the people senate democrats revived the bill a year in the making with a furious few final weeks of negotiations mainly between sen majority leader chuck schumer d n y and sen joe manchin of west virginia its final major hurdle was a marathon voting session last weekend in the senate the legislation was passed through the budget reconciliation process which meant that all 50 democrats in the senate and one tie breaker vote from vice president harris were needed since none of the 50 republican senators voted for the bill it also restricted the measures in the bill to those that directly change federal spending and revenue democrats have argued the measure will tackle voters main economic concern naming it the inflation reduction act republicans argue the new spending will aggravate inflation the nonpartisan congressional budget office says though the bill has a negligible effect on inflation in 2022 and into 2023 house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif called the bill tone deaf ahead of friday s floor vote democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford mccarthy added overall the bill is a very scaled down solution to what many democrats including president biden had asked for originally this bill is far from perfect it s a compromise but it s often how progress is made biden said at the white house last month my message to congress is this this is the strongest bill you can pass after the house passed it on friday biden said he will sign the historic legislation next week here s a look at some of what did get included in the democrats bill and what didn t you can see the entire 730 page bill here tackling climate change more than 300 billion will be invested in energy and climate reform the largest federal clean energy investment in u s history the bill has support from many environmental and climate activists but is short of the 555 billion that democrats had originally called for this portion of the bill takes on transportation and electricity generation and it includes 60 billion for growing renewable energy infrastructure in manufacturing like solar panels and wind turbines it also includes several tax credits for individuals on things like electric vehicles and making homes more energy efficient the bill will according to democrats lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40 based on 2005 levels by the end of the decade which is short of the 50 biden had originally aimed for it puts us within a close enough distance that further executive action state and local government efforts and private sector leadership could plausibly get us across the finish line by 2030

millions of americans avoid spikes in their health care costs tax reform the legislation creates a 15 minimum tax for corporations making 1 billion or more in income bringing in more than 300 billion

private equity income is taxed was cut democrats said it would have brought in 14 billion in revenue instead a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks was introduced and it could bring in roughly five times as much revenue as the carried interest measure however it wouldn t take effect until next year raising predictions of a rush of buybacks by some companies before 2023 rolls around a major portion of the

it s no secret that it s hard to plan for retirement in addition to growing a sizeable nest egg you must protect it from external factors like market volatility inflation and unforeseen expenses and to be brutally honest that s been tough as of late northwestern mutual s 2022 planning progress study shows that personal savings are down 15 percent from 73 100 in 2021 to 62 086 in 2022 moreover 60 percent of american adults say the pandemic is highly disruptive to their finances in the midst of the pandemic though americans saved around 2 5 trillion unfortunately those cash reserves are drying up as people use them to deal with 40 year high inflation according to a forbes advisor survey two thirds of americans are raiding their savings because goods and services are so darn expensive that said planning to retire comfortably means securing your savings and assets while that can be overwhelming initially here are the 10 easiest ways to protect your retirement money 1 develop a financial forecast for retirement calculating how much cash you ll need for each year of retirement can help you save a bigger than expected nest egg nowadays if you retire at 65 you should have a financial plan for 20 years tenpao lee a professor of economics at niagara university in new york told u s news because your funds will need to last through these decades you may want to consider 401 k and ira withdrawals as your new paycheck those amounts plus your social security benefits can cover your daily expenses developing a retirement budget can prevent you from overspending incurring debt or exhausting your savings 2 make use of your retirement savings to bridge the social security gap use your retirement savings to fund a social security bridge strategy advises steve vernon president of rest of life communications doing so can significantly increase the amount of social security income you ll receive over your lifetime by enabling you to delay the start of your benefits as long as you can however delaying further than 70 doesn t offer any benefits you can also bolster your retirement income with a social security bridge plan how vernon explains that you can convert easily accessible savings a target for fraudsters into a guaranteed income stream from the government 3 diversify your retirement portfolio as the adage goes don t put all your eggs in one basket make sure you re spreading your investments out between stocks and bonds you should also take your risk tolerance into account when choosing your investments more specifically your retirement portfolio should contain high yielding bonds and dividend paying stocks it is generally recommended that your investments should become less risky the closer you get to retirement you can spread out the risk by investing in different things which will give you a more stable allocation of your assets also look for other ways to make money besides bonds and stocks many people seek additional income streams and new opportunities even in retirement examples include freelancing working from home and passive income sources like rental properties 4 choose your asset mix carefully it s essential to think about your asset mix which simply means the different types of investments that go into your portfolio recommends jordan bishop in a previous due article for example investing in stocks may help you grow your retirement fund faster but if they drop substantially you could also see plenty of losses that s why you ve got to choose your assets carefully also ensure that your portfolio includes a combination of investments how can you choose the right assets first invest in stocks when you re young when deciding how to allocate your funds a general rule of thumb is that the younger you are the more you can invest in stocks adds jordan since stocks offer much higher returns than other assets they have always tended to rise in value but if there are any losses you have time to recoup secondly choose safer investments as you get older investing in low cost index funds will provide you with an average return without taking on too much risk jordan states but if you really want to reduce risk as much as possible investing in bonds or bond funds rather than stocks or stock funds is the way to go 5 keep some cash on hand almost all financial planners say you should hold on to at least some stocks in order to avoid outliving your assets however retirees need to be more careful with their investments unlike younger investors they don t have long time horizons professionals say you should keep five years worth of expenses in cash as a safeguard lucky those with that kind of cash have had enough extra to work toward a goal like that alternatively you may use cash equivalents such as short term bonds certificates of deposit and treasury bills you should be able to keep most of your expenses stable once you retire but that doesn t mean you re free from the unexpected for example how would you cover a home repair or medical emergency working overtime is no longer an option so will you use a credit card or tap into your savings moreover if market conditions temporarily cause your investments to fall you should not withdraw money from them if you re worried that inflation will grow and erode your purchasing power consider holding some cash equivalents these typically take the form of treasury inflation protected securities tips have a fixed interest rate but their par value increases with changes in the consumer price index in other words if inflation hits 5 percent

according to a fidelity retiree health care cost estimate in 2022 a retired couple would need around 315 000 saved after tax to cover health care expenses in retirement however with people more likely to live longer they will need to pay even more down the road so keep that in mind when constructing your retirement plan while the federal reserve claims inflation s bubble will pop soon experts anticipate the cpi won t fall below 4 percent by the year s end he adds that means you can expect another year of high inflation bumping up prices there is however a silver lining you can use the following techniques to stop inflation from deflating your savings according to a fidelity retiree health care cost estimate in 2022 a retired couple would need around 315 000 saved after tax to cover health care expenses in retirement however with people more likely to live longer they will need to pay even more down the road so keep that in mind when constructing your retirement plan and to make matters worse this figure does not include long term care ltc costs you might want to set aside a separate fund for long term care costs to secure your retirement income additionally you should consider long term care insurance this could help protect seniors over 65 who may suffer from disabilities chronic conditions need nursing care and home health care also if you have an annuity ensure you attach a long term care rider to cover these expenses there are also stand alone ltc annuities if you re interested 8 have a plan for taxes individuals don t always understand how taxes can impact their retirement savings and assets capital gains inheritances and estate taxes can heavily reduce your retirement fund in turn this reduces your savings that s why when planning for retirement consider all the taxes that your savings assets and income may be subject to today and tomorrow consulting a financial advisor for direction is also strongly recommended 9 rethink target date funds target date funds provide an investment mix of stocks bonds and cash based on the age you plan to retire as you approach retirement the fund will automatically adjust its mix to become more conservative however some people use them wrong says mike gray a captrust financial advisor suppose they plan to retire in 2045 instead of purchasing a fund for the year they put a little bit of money into a fund for the year 2030 why they think that ll be safer following that they put some money in a 2060 target date fund which is more aggressive the combination of those choices may not be as effective as choosing the single right target date fund so you need to put it in one fund based on your planned retirement age and stick with it he says one size will never fit all the one size fits all approach relying simply on a date can cause inappropriate asset allocation the one size fits all approach relying simply on a date can cause inappropriate asset allocation the funds invest in themselves most target date funds invest mainly in other funds managed by the same company ignoring the conflict of interest for now limiting investment options can hurt returns most target date funds invest mainly in other funds managed by the same company ignoring the conflict of interest for now limiting investment options can hurt returns fees because they invest in other funds target date funds charge multiple fees because they invest in other funds target date funds charge multiple fees most investors can do better but unfortunately despite target date funds good premise growing wealth during the first years of a career and protecting it later for many investors they won t deliver on their promise 10 avoid excessive withdrawals your retirement income can be at risk if you spend your funds too fast as such it is prudent to withdraw your funds slowly toward the end of your working life furthermore it s essential to know that 401 k s traditional iras and even roth iras have different rules taxes and withdrawal rates but that s not the only problem with target date funds your retirement income can be at risk if you spend your funds too fast as such it is prudent to withdraw your funds slowly toward the end of your working life furthermore it s essential to know that 401 k s traditional iras and even roth iras have different rules taxes and withdrawal rates these rates and taxes can severely eat away at your retirement savings if you don t take measures to minimize them because of that it s a good idea to be mindful of them and plan withdrawals accordingly in short you may derail your retirement planning if you withdraw too much from your retirement account 11 buy an annuity when facing an income expense gap consider an annuity annuities provide lifelong guaranteed income you can therefore manage your money throughout retirement more effectively when you buy an annuity you sign a contract with an insurance company this company assumes the risk of a series of payments over the years in return for a lump sum investment however some annuities can be purchased over a series of payments although you can specify an exact timeframe like for 20 years you ll receive monthly payments for the rest of your life with a fixed annuity you ll also know what you ll be getting for instance with due you get 3 percent on your money no matter what at the same time it s often suggested that you wait on an annuity until you ve maxed out your other retirement accounts frequently asked questions how much money do i need to retire there are several factors that determine the amount you need it depends on your age at retirement how long you live and how much money you get from pensions or social security if your spending needs are more than your retirement income you ll have to take withdrawals from your retirement fund to fill the gap the most important factors are how much you re withdrawing for how long and any earnings or losses on your savings how much can i contribute to a retirement account contribution limits for retirement accounts are often increased annually for example a person s contribution limit to a qualified individual retirement account ira in 2022 will be 6 000 7 000 if you are 50 or older individuals can contribute up to 20 500 to a traditional 401 k in 2022 people over 50 can make a catch up contribution of 6 500 per year making their total 27 000 there are no contributions with annuities what happens if i take money out of my retirement account early when it comes to retirement accounts you can t withdraw money until you re age 59 ½ the early withdrawal penalty is 10 percent plus any taxes due are there taxes on retirement account withdrawals in most cases yes taxes are deferred on iras and 401 k s this means you put money into the account before taxes and could deduct it in the year you funded it therefore you ll be taxed on withdrawals in retirement at your current tax rate on the other hand roth iras are tax free because they re funded with after tax money what is the best way to invest my retirement savings it s crucial to avoid significant losses in your early retirement years and years leading up to it if you withdraw money with a low balance you ll run out of money sooner than expected but that doesn t mean you shouldn t risk it at all your retirement will hopefully last a long time however prices will rise over time and your account balances may need to grow to keep up with inflation and fund a lifetime of income unfortunately you might not produce enough if you put your money into low yielding safe investments it s hard to find that balance and it s easy to get fooled by too good to be true investments but on the other hand many people can fund a comfortable retirement with a diversified mix of low cost mutual funds or exchange traded funds ultimately you must figure out how to spread your money among these investments and depends on your risk tolerance and financial

emerged suddenly at the end of july after 18 months of start stop negotiations leaves behind many of biden s more ambitious goals senate majority leader chuck schumer d n y struck a deal with sen joe manchin to revive biden s package slimming it down to bring the west virginia democrat back to the negotiating table next they drew sinema the remaining party holdout with additional changes the package remains robust by typical standards but nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned while congress did pass a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that biden signed into law last year the president s and the party s other key priorities have slipped away among them is a continuation of a 300 monthly child tax credit that was sending money directly to families during the pandemic and is believed to have widely reduced child poverty also gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs ___ associated press writer matthew daly

send investors back into the arms of traditional safe assets dollar yen which soared 38 from a march 2020 trough to mid july this year is in retreat the big yen short as we know it this year it s over said rodrigo catril strategist at national australia bank ltd in sydney dollar yen s peak is now likely behind us catril is joined by the likes of rabobank and daiwa securities group inc in predicting a slowdown in losses for japan s currency the worst performer in the group of 10 this year strategists see the yen strengthening to 130 per dollar on average by the first quarter of 2023 according to data compiled by bloomberg a clear contrast with calls arguing that 140 and higher lay ahead at the peak of the bearishness in mid july an end to what threatened to become the worst ever drawdown for the currency would be welcomed by businesses to consumers to politicians in japan where higher import costs are weighing on a post pandemic recovery it would vindicate the resolutely dovish stance of bank of japan governor haruhiko kuroda and put pressure on hedge funds who came late to popular short yen macro strategies treasuries boost perhaps the most effective handbrake on the yen s steep decline has been the pull back from ever higher treasury yields the yen is closely correlated to movements in us government bonds as the dynamic of a boj keeping rates pinned to the floor even as the federal reserve hikes aggressively weighs on relative attractiveness of japanese assets now treasury yields have retreated from their highs as traders tweak estimates for peak fed rates and reconsider bonds on fears of a us slowdown us japan monetary policy divergence will no longer be a factor as markets have pretty much priced that in said yukio ishizuki a senior currency strategist at daiwa in tokyo yen selling appears to have peaked benchmark treasury yields have fallen more than 60 basis points from their peak in june to 2 82 on monday the yen has strengthened over 3 from its trough to

mark the devastating impact on import costs has eased bloomberg economics yuki masujima expects japan s trade deficit to have narrowed in july and the nation s import bill to have increased at a slower pace thanks to cheaper commodity prices the energy terms of trade shock is easing particularly if you look at oil prices said nab s catril while a spike in gas prices and us 10 year bond yields

curbs fed rate hike bets which reduces the dollar s safe haven with high yield appeal allowing the yen to reassert its safe haven appeal he added hedge funds appear to be voting with their feet leveraged investors have slashed their net bearish yen wagers to the least since march 2021 recent data from the commodity futures trading commission showed doubts remain to be sure not everyone is betting the big yen short is over dovish market expectations for longer term fed rates seem at odds with the central bank s own hawkish view and stronger than expected us employment data friday sent treasury yields higher a reminder that the pressure on bonds hasn t completely eased while goldman sachs group inc sees the yen rising over the long term further depreciation pressures are likely as

marles who is acting prime minister while anthony albanese takes leave this week expressed satisfaction with the performance of the existing submarine fleet known as the collins class despite concerns about the diesel powered vessels since they were launched in the 1990s i think the collins is operating excellently in 2022 he said i mean the only point to make is that obviously when collins was imagined and put into place it was expected that it would start coming out of the water in the middle of this decade there were issues earlier on around utilisation but i think we ve addressed those and there s a good rhythm around it and it is a highly capable asset the government said last year it would extend the life of the collins fleet by about a decade during the wait for nuclear submarines that are meant to be deployed from 2040 but this has sparked a debate about whether the existing fleet could last that long or may need to be upgraded a second time marles reiterated there was a real possibility of a capability gap after the extension of the collins class and that this would have to be considered by the working group looking into the submarine timeframe under the aukus agreement with the united states and united kingdom as well as by a separate review of defence he announced last week loading we are open minded about looking at every possibility as to how to plan for the capability gap he said opposition defence spokesman andrew hastie warned of a very bleak strategic outlook and said australia should accelerate its work on missiles nuclear submarines fuel stocks and ammunition stocks the point is that if there was a conflict around taiwan whether we re involved directly or indirectly on the periphery we would certainly be in the gun hastie told the abc s insiders program on sunday and that s why we need to build our deterrent strength that s why we need to exercise exceptional political leadership diplomatic leadership concerns about local jobs influenced major coalition decisions on defence in the past decade including the rejection of japanese submarines in 2015 and the choice of french submarines in 2016 with a promise they would be built in south australia but the french contract was cancelled at a cost of 2 4 billion in favour of the aukus agreement on nuclear propelled boats marles emphasised the need for strategic need to take priority but said australian industrial capacity was also fundamental over time now as it turns out when we re talking specifically about submarines we will inevitably have to develop the capacity to build the submarines here obviously not the reactor that will come from overseas he said we need to do that for two reasons one is that because if you think about the net industrial capability of australia the us and the uk we ve got to play our part in increasing that were we to simply place ourselves in some queue in the us and the uk it is a very long queue general dynamics the us company that makes the virginia class nuclear submarine last year reported a us39 billion 56 billion backlog of work at its electric boat division loading marles said the second argument for local industrial capacity was to demonstrate australia could manage the nuclear vessels under its commitments on nuclear non proliferation a key issue for the international atomic energy agency and australian allies and other countries defence industry can t be just a proxy for industry policy which is what it was for the former government when it comes to doing defence industry it is a strategic call there are good strategic reasons why we should do it and it s the strategic rationale that should drive it and ultimately make it sustainable he said

one of the largest antitrust trials ever to hit the publishing industry is unfolding in a federal courthouse in washington the department of justice says that the proposed merger announced in 2020 between penguin random house and simon schuster would stifle competition but what would a successful merger mean on a practical level for booksellers authors and others in the industry alli bibbo helm literary agency helm literary agency penguin random house author saira rao saira rao an author in richmond va has been watching the case closely even though penguin random house is her publisher she said she welcomes the government s pushback against the behemoth s attempt to grow even bigger rao said it s sending a message about the need for more diversity in the publishing industry which has traditionally excluded writers of color like herself and which has made her books harder to sell i have a white agent the editors of our books are white the heads of the marketing are white said rao

the industry identify as white down from 79 the last time the company conducted its survey in 2015 authors guild president douglas preston said reduced competition will likely make the sector even less diverse and that s bad not just for authors but also for readers the readers are served by a maximum diversity of authors and voices especially authors from overlooked communities preston said these are authors who don t make a lot of money but who have very important things to say a spokesman for penguin random house said in a statement it was committed to fostering diversity and providing bipoc opportunities across the literary world from editors to authors and that after the merger this would continue simon schuster said something similar in an emailed statement from a spokesperson simon schuster is committed to working with our employees authors and the publishing community to make our company and our industry a safe and inclusive environment for all he said that the company merger or not would continue working toward being a publisher whose books and staff represent the breadth and depth of our diverse population authors guild president preston who said some of his own books have been published by simon schuster added that author advances are also likely to take a hit with more consolidation the fewer publishers there are bidding against each other for an author s work the lower the advance preston said it s economics 101 but penguin random house contends the merger would increase author advances the pre trial brief shared with npr stated this is a pro consumer acquisition that will allow simon schuster and its editors and authors to become part of prh with its industry leading supply chain giving readers and book sellers across the world greater access to their books it will also enhance competition by enabling the combined company to offer increased advances and marketing support to authors competition will increase not decrease as a result of these investments a spokesperson for penguin random house said the company could not share data on author advances since the last major publishing industry merger occurred between random house and penguin in 2013 owing to legal constraints a spokesperson for simon schuster said the company couldn t discuss author advances because they were at issue in the trial some industry insiders agree with the publishers that the potential union of two of the five biggest publishing houses in the country does not pose a threat to a robust sector that puts out a million titles a year i don t see this as anything other than a blip in terms of the ability of the book publishing industry to meet the needs of readers said brian o leary executive director of the book industry study group which provides supply chain research for around two hundred publishing industry members including penguin random house and simon schuster o leary said even if the judge rules in favor of the merger book lovers still

on monday the trumbull council approved a request from public works director george estrada for an additional 190 000 to pay for tree removal performed last year the money was needed to remove beech and oak trees due to drought and insect damage ned gerard hearst connecticut media trumbull insect infestation and drought conditions are combining to put a dent in the town s finances in addition to its greenery on monday the town council approved a request from public works director george estrada for an additional 190 000 to pay for tree removal performed last year the money was needed to remove beech and oak trees due to drought and insect damage the town had originally budgeted 100 000 for tree removal the total cost entailed removing about 99 trees advertisement article continues below this ad first selectwoman vicki tesoro said budgeting for the task is open ended due to the inherent unpredictability of how many trees should be removed we re dealing with public safety issues if there s a problem with a tree that has to come down we re going to take it down she said so we can never tell ahead of time exactly how many trees are going to come down or what the cost is going to be because it depends on the tree itself estrada last month explained to the board of finance that a variety of factors most prominently the emerald ash borer and the gypsy moth but also infections from fungi and diseases storms drought and invasive plants had taken their toll on the town s trees removal of damaged and diseased trees is proving to be expensive for municipalities across the state he said drought was particularly concerning he said advertisement article continues below this ad today july 14 the state initiated a phase 2 level drought warning so the state is in that position right now estrada said every time we hit that drought period that has a tremendous effect on the aging forests but that s just nature it s nothing that we can do according to the same presentation the town spent a little over 59 000 in tree removals for the revised budget during 2010 by 2021 the amount was at 260 000 estrada said 256 trees were assessed in 2022 and 49 trees were already considered in imminent danger another 74 were considered to be at risk the costs can mount fast in a state that is more than 60 percent forested estrada said the beech right now has an issue with the underside of the leaves which is called beech leaf disease he said and we have detected it in trumbull already so that is something that is has basically been coming across the country and it has arrived in connecticut advertisement article continues below this ad but another reason for the increase in tree removals he said was the pandemic residents began to stay indoors or if they were cooped up too long ventured outside and took stock of their properties he said soon enough people who had tired of the social isolation began to migrate to their front yards and communicate with their neighbors he stressed he didn t have any proof to back up his claims but he speculated the rise in calls is due to more people simply noticing the trees that experience of so much time outside people really started taking stock and what the front of their homes look like there was a lot of improvement and a lot of identification of problems he said our numbers from 2021 in the system were 153 to 2022 our numbers went to 256 so it s it s more than 100 more calls that we received on trees according to the data in our system right now another reason for the increase in tree removals was a new portal where residents could easily log complaints or requests for tree removals he said
updated august 12 2022 at 5 42 pm et the house gave final congressional approval on friday to a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion it was passed without any republican support and now goes to president biden for his signature house speaker nancy pelosi d calif called it a glorious day adding we sent to the president s desk a monumental bill that will be truly for the people senate democrats revived the bill a year in the making with a furious few final weeks of negotiations mainly between sen majority leader chuck schumer d n y and sen joe manchin of west virginia its final major hurdle was a marathon voting session last weekend in the senate the legislation was passed through the budget reconciliation process which meant that all 50 democrats in the senate and one tie breaker vote from vice president harris were needed since none of the 50 republican senators voted for the bill it also restricted the measures in the bill to those that directly change federal spending and revenue democrats have argued the measure will tackle voters main economic concern naming it the inflation reduction act republicans argue the new spending will aggravate inflation the nonpartisan congressional budget office says though the bill has a negligible effect on inflation in 2022 and into 2023 house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif called the bill tone deaf ahead of friday s floor vote democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford mccarthy added overall the bill is a very scaled down solution to what many democrats including president biden had asked for originally this bill is far from perfect it s a compromise but it s often how progress is made biden said at the white house last month my message to congress is this this is the strongest bill you can pass after the house passed it on friday biden said he will sign the historic legislation next week here s a look at some of what did get included in the democrats bill and what didn t you can see the entire 730 page bill here tackling climate change more than 300 billion will be invested in energy and climate reform the largest federal clean energy investment in u s history the bill has support from many environmental and climate activists but is short of the 555 billion that democrats had originally called for this portion of the bill takes on transportation and electricity generation and it includes 60 billion for growing renewable energy infrastructure in manufacturing like solar panels and wind turbines it also includes several tax credits for individuals on things like electric vehicles and making homes more energy efficient the bill will according to democrats lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40 based on 2005 levels by the end of the decade which is short of the 50 biden had originally aimed for it puts us within a close enough distance that further executive action state and local government efforts and private sector leadership could plausibly get us across the finish line by 2030 said jesse jenkins from princeton university who leads the repeat project analyzing the impact of government climate actions lowering the cost of prescription drugs on health reforms the bill takes on making prescription drugs more affordable but there are some limits the bill includes a historic measure that allows the federal health secretary to negotiate the prices of certain expensive drugs each year for medicare but this won t impact every prescription drug or every patient and it won t take effect quickly the negotiations will take effect for 10 drugs covered by medicare in 2026 increasing to 20 drugs in 2029 the portion of the bill that tried to cap at 35 per month the price of insulin a drug that is incredibly expensive in the u s compared to other countries was ruled out of order by the senate parliamentarian who ruled the cap could apply on medicare a government program but not on private insurance so democrats split the measure between medicare and private insurance

updated august 12 2022 at 5 42 pm et the house gave final congressional approval on friday to a spending bill which would attempt to tackle climate change the high cost of prescription drugs and lower the deficit by roughly 300 billion it was passed without any republican support and now goes to president biden for his signature house speaker nancy pelosi d calif called it a glorious day adding we sent to the president s desk a monumental bill that will be truly for the people senate democrats revived the bill a year in the making with a furious few final weeks of negotiations mainly between sen majority leader chuck schumer d n y and sen joe manchin of west virginia its final major hurdle was a marathon voting session last weekend in the senate the legislation was passed through the budget reconciliation process which meant that all 50 democrats in the senate and one tie breaker vote from vice president harris were needed since none of the 50 republican senators voted for the bill it also restricted the measures in the bill to those that directly change federal spending and revenue democrats have argued the measure will tackle voters main economic concern naming it the inflation reduction act republicans argue the new spending will aggravate inflation the nonpartisan congressional budget office says though the bill has a negligible effect on inflation in 2022 and into 2023 house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif called the bill tone deaf ahead of friday s floor vote democrats more than any other majority in history are addicted to spending other people s money regardless of what we as a country can afford mccarthy added overall the bill is a very scaled down solution to what many democrats including president biden had asked for originally this bill is far from perfect it s a compromise but it s often how progress is made biden said at the white house last month my message to congress is this this is the strongest bill you can pass after the house passed it on friday biden said he will sign the historic legislation next week here s a look at some of what did get included in the democrats bill and what didn t you can see the entire 730 page bill here tackling climate change more than 300 billion will be invested in energy and climate reform the largest federal clean energy investment in u s history the bill has support from many environmental and climate activists but is short of the 555 billion that democrats had originally called for this portion of the bill takes on transportation and electricity generation and it includes 60 billion for growing renewable energy infrastructure in manufacturing like solar panels and wind turbines it also includes several tax credits for individuals on things like electric vehicles and making homes more energy efficient the bill will according to democrats lower greenhouse gas emissions by 40 based on 2005 levels by the end of the decade which is short of the 50 biden had originally aimed for it puts us within a close enough distance that further executive action state and local government efforts and private sector leadership could plausibly get us across the finish line by 2030 said jesse jenkins from princeton university who leads the repeat project analyzing the impact of government climate actions lowering the cost of prescription drugs on health reforms the bill takes on making prescription drugs more affordable but there are some limits the bill includes a historic measure that allows the federal health secretary to negotiate the prices of certain expensive drugs each year for medicare but this won t impact every prescription drug or every patient and it won t take effect quickly the negotiations will take effect for 10 drugs covered by medicare in 2026 increasing to 20 drugs in 2029 the portion of the bill that tried to cap at 35 per month the price of insulin a drug that is incredibly expensive in the u s compared to other countries was ruled out of order by the senate parliamentarian who ruled the cap could apply on medicare a government program but not on private insurance so democrats split the measure between medicare and private insurance but republicans ultimately blocked the measure for private insurance the parliamentarian also ruled that a measure that was in the bill to force drug companies to offer rebates if prescription prices outpaced inflation was not totally in line with the rules for budget reconciliation she said that it could apply to medicare patients but not those with private insurers the bill puts a cap of 2 000 on out of pocket prescription drug costs for people on medicare effective in 2025 there s also a three year extension on healthcare subsidies in the affordable care act originally passed in a pandemic relief bill last year estimated by the government to have kept premiums at 10 per month or lower for the vast majority of people covered through the federal health insurance exchange that helps millions of americans avoid spikes in their health care costs tax reform the legislation creates a 15 minimum tax for corporations making 1 billion or more in income bringing in more than 300 billion in revenue a portion that got cut though is one that narrowed the carried interest tax loophole arizona kyrsten sinema agreed to sign onto the bill if this measure which would have changed the way private equity income is taxed was cut democrats said it would have brought in 14 billion in revenue instead a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks was introduced and it could bring in roughly five times as much revenue as the carried interest measure however it wouldn t take effect until next year raising predictions of a rush of buybacks by some companies before 2023 rolls around a major portion of the bill that isn t included due to opposition from west virginia sen joe manchin is extending the child tax credit manchin expressed last year that the cost to extend the credit was too high but progressives including vermont sen bernie sanders continued to push for its inclusion in the bill copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

by alex rogers clare foran ali zaslav and manu raju cnn the senate on sunday afternoon passed democrats 750 billion health care tax and climate bill in a significant victory for president joe biden and his party the final party line vote was 51 50 with vice president kamala harris breaking the tie the package is the product of painstaking negotiations and its final passage would give democrats a chance to achieve major policy objectives ahead of the upcoming midterm elections the democrat controlled house which is expected to take up the legislation on friday august 12 must approve the bill before biden can sign it into law the sweeping bill named the inflation reduction act would represent the largest climate investment in us history and make major changes to health policy by giving medicare the power for the first time to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs and extending expiring health care subsidies for three years the legislation would reduce the deficit be paid for through new taxes including a 15 minimum tax on large corporations and a 1 tax on stock buybacks and boost the internal revenue service s ability to collect it would raise over 700 billion in government revenue over 10 years and spend over 430 billion to reduce carbon emissions and extend subsidies for health insurance under the affordable care act and use the rest of the new revenue to reduce the deficit senate democrats with a narrow 50 seat majority stayed unified to pass the legislation using a special filibuster proof process to approve the measure without republican votes final passage came after a marathon series of contentious amendment votes known as a vote a rama that stretched nearly 16 hours from late saturday night until sunday afternoon west virginia democratic sen joe manchin told cnn that the legislation he helped write is a good balanced bill i think we ll all benefit from it the country will manchin told cnn we have energy security that s what we were looking for and we have the ability to invest in the energy of the future biden praised the senate for passing the bill in a statement sunday thanking democrats in the chamber and touting the legislation s climate investments and health care provisions today senate democrats sided with american families over special interests voting to lower the cost of prescription drugs health insurance and everyday energy costs and reduce the deficit while making the wealthiest corporations finally pay their fair share biden said how senate democrats passed the bill on a party line vote senate democrats have long hoped to pass a signature legislative package that would incorporate major agenda items for the party but struggled for months to reach a deal that gained full support of their caucus manchin played a key role in shaping the legislation which only moved forward after the west virginia democrat and senate majority leader chuck schumer announced a deal at the end of july a major breakthrough for democrats after earlier negotiations had stalled out arizona sen kyrsten sinema on thursday night offered critical support after party leaders agreed to change new tax proposals indicating she would move forward on the sweeping economic package but sinema manchin and other senators worked through the weekend making crucial alterations on the bill to avoid a last minute collapse of the bill on sunday democrats created a plan to win over sinema who was concerned over the 15 corporate minimum tax s impact on subsidiaries owned by private equity senate democrats accepted a narrower tax proposal but instead of paying for it through a change to the state and local tax salt deduction as senate gop whip john thune of south dakota suggested they instead extended the limitation on the amount of losses that businesses can deduct for another two years the change was intended to prevent house democrats primarily from coastal districts who have campaigned on repealing limits on the salt deduction from breaking from the bill when they vote on it later this week after the bill s passage in the senate sinema said in a statement it would help arizonans build better lives for themselves and their families by lowering prices making health care more affordable and accessible and securing arizona s water and energy future while also boosting innovation and spurring job creation in a good sign for the bill becoming law key house democrats signaled later sunday that they ll vote for it despite previous demands over salt rep josh gottheimer of new jersey had been part of the no salt no deal caucus but he said the bill passes his test because it doesn t raise individual income tax rates rep mikie sherrill of new jersey another member of that caucus echoed his sentiment i will also remain steadfast in my commitment to ensuring that any discussion of reforms to the 2017 tax law begins with addressing salt because this legislation does not raise taxes on families in my district but in fact significantly lowers their costs i will be voting for it republicans used the weekend vote a rama to put democrats on the spot and force politically tough votes they were also successful in removing a key insulin provision to cap the price of insulin to 35 per month on the private insurance market which the senate parliamentarian ruled was not compliant with the senate s reconciliation rules the 35 insulin cap for medicare beneficiaries remains in place senate minority leader mitch mcconnell said in a statement that the bill included giant job killing tax hikes and amounted to a war on american fossil fuel the kentucky republican said democrats do not care about middle class families priorities and their response to the runaway inflation they ve created is a bill that experts say will not meaningfully cut inflation at all said mcconnell the american people are clear about their priorities environmental regulation is a 3 issue americans want solutions for inflation crime and the border how the bill addresses the climate crisis while economists disagree over whether the package would in fact live up to its name and reduce inflation particularly in the short term the bill would have a crucial impact on reducing carbon emissions the nearly 370 billion clean energy and climate package is the largest climate investment in us history and the biggest victory for the environmental movement since the landmark clean air act it also comes at a critical time this summer has seen punishing heat waves and deadly floods across the country which scientists say are both linked to a warming planet analysis from senate majority leader chuck schumer s office as well as multiple independent analyses suggests the measure would reduce us carbon emissions by up to 40 by 2030 strong climate regulations from the biden administration and action from states would be needed to get to president joe biden s goal of cutting emissions 50 by 2030 the bill also contains many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables and spur more american consumers to switch to electricity to power their homes and vehicles lawmakers said the bill represents a monumental victory and is also just the start of what s needed to combat the climate crisis this isn t about the laws of politics this is about the laws of physics democratic sen brian schatz of hawaii told cnn we all knew coming into this effort that we had to do what the science tells us what we need to do key health care and tax policy in the bill the bill would empower medicare to negotiate prices of certain costly medications administered in doctors offices or purchased at the pharmacy the health and human services secretary would negotiate the prices of 10 drugs in 2026 and another 15 drugs in 2027 and again in 2028 the number would rise to 20 drugs a year for 2029 and beyond this controversial provision is far more limited than the one house democratic leaders have backed in the past but it would open the door to fulfilling a longstanding party goal of allowing medicare to use its heft to lower drug costs democrats are also planning to extend the enhanced federal premium subsidies for obamacare coverage through 2025 a year later than lawmakers recently discussed that way they wouldn t expire just after the 2024 presidential election to boost revenue the bill would impose a 15 minimum tax on the income large corporations report to shareholders known as book income as opposed to the internal revenue service the measure which would raise 258 billion over a decade would apply to companies with profits over 1 billion concerned about how this provision would affect certain businesses particularly manufacturers sinema has suggested that she won changes to the democrats plan to pare back how companies can deduct depreciated assets from their taxes the details remain unclear however sinema nixed her party s effort to tighten the carried interest loophole which allows investment managers to treat much of their compensation as capital gains and pay a 20 long term capital gains tax rate instead of income tax rates of up to 37 the provision would have lengthened the amount of time investment managers profit interest must be held from three years to five years to take advantage of the lower tax rate addressing this loophole which would have raised 14 billion over a decade had been a longtime goal of congressional democrats in its place a 1 excise tax on companies stock buybacks was added
