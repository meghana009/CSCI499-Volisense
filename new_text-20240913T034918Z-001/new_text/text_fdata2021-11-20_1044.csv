no comments ford to double ev production scraps plans with rivian ford will increase global ev production to 600 000 by 2023 photo ford if the early response to the 2022 ford f 150 lightning is any indication ford needs to start ramping up its expectations for ev production and according to ceo jim farley that begins by doubling annual output to 600 000 electric vehicles a year by 2023 ford s got a smash hit on its hands see why the 2022 ford f 150 lightning is electrifying drivers in droves farley spoke with automotive news this week and revealed that the automaker will double its original projections for ev production by building 600 000 evs a year ford would become america s no 2 electric vehicle manufacturer behind tesla the decision to beef up production comes as the all new f 150 lightning surpassed 160 000 reservations just six months from its may debut farley told auto news that the number is now closing in on 200 000 f 150 lightnings and that the expectation is around 80 percent of those reservations will convert to sales the demand is so much higher than we expected farley said it s a really new experience for this big company trying to be agile we had to approach it very differently than we ve done capacity planning while bumping global production capacity to 600 000 evs would solidify ford as the no 2 behind tesla the automaker is not content to stop there i m saying no 2 in the next two years farley said imagine what we can do after that ford f 150 lightning demand and desirability surge new f 150 lightning boasts unique tech like ford intelligent backup assist photo ford ford had originally intended to build just 20 000 f 150 lightning pickups per year however the huge crush of demand for the truck led ford to invest another 250 million across three michigan plants increasing annual output to 80 000 and adding 450 new direct jobs ford finds itself in the driver s seat in the early going of the electric truck wars when the f 150 lightning arrives next spring only the gmc hummer ev and the rivian r1t will have beaten it to market those two trucks brought up the rear in a recent autolist survey which found that more drivers are interested in buying the f 150 lightning than any other electric pickup crucially the f 150 lightning is the first large scale all electric truck to be launched in the u s said autolist president and ceo corey lydstone given americans appetite for all things truck related that s ford s ace in the hole ford f 150 lightning doesn t reinvent the wheel when it comes to looks unlike some trucks photo ford according to the results of a survey released friday 38 percent said they would prefer the ford f 150 lightning over the silverado ev tesla cybertruck gmc hummer ev and rivian r1t the silverado ev which will be revealed at ces in january came in second at 26 percent tesla s uh let s say wonky looking cybertruck sits at third with 20 percent the hummer ev ranks fourth at 11 percent and the rivian r1t finished last with just 5 percent interestingly interest is even higher among drivers who haven t owned an ev before thirty nine percent of respondents who have yet to own an ev said they d be more interested in the f 150 lightning compared to 33 percent of current ev owners giving the nod to the ford ford also had a large advantage among prospective first time truck owners 34 percent and current truck owners 41 percent this is just more evidence that ford s f 150 lightning will be the electric truck to beat when it comes to market in 2022 lydstone said being able to appeal to both experienced ev shoppers and newcomers to electric power will be critical it s also worth noting that ford says around 75 percent of all current f 150 lightning reservation holders are new to the blue oval brand ford rivian drop plans for jointly developed ev rivian ceo rj scaringe says ford partnership is an important part of our journey photo ford another interesting wrinkle in the ev truck race is the fact that ford is a major stakeholder in rivian until recently ford who has invested 1 2 billion in the company since 2019 had planned to jointly develop a vehicle with rivian but farley told auto news this week that the two companies have agreed to cancel those plans when you compare today with when we originally made that investment so much has changed about our ability about the brand s direction in both cases and now it s more certain to us what we have to do we want to invest in rivian we love their future as a company but at this point we re going to develop our own vehicles rivian opened up an initial public stock offering on nov 10 by the close of trading the stock had risen from 78 to 100 73 per share resulting in a valuation of 86 billion and a market cap of 127 3 billion the latter was nearly 50 billion higher than ford s estimated market cap as of nov 10 but the decision to discontinue a joint project is not the result of hard feelings farley told auto news that the relationship with rivian is like that of a brother or a sister rivian ceo rj scaringe in a statement confirmed that ford remains an investor and ally on our shared path to an electrified future there s also ford representation on rivian s board alexandra ford english ford executive chair bill ford s daughter has been a member of rivian s board of directors since may 2020 ford and rivian had initially planned to use the latter s skateboard chassis to underpin an electric vehicle for the latter s lincoln luxury brand however the plug was pulled on those plans and lincoln will now set about plans to go all electric by debuting its first ev next year lincoln will play a role in ford s plans to produce 600 000 evs globally per year by 2023 and its ambitions to be the world s top ev producer thereafter ford will continue to expand its ev offerings over the next several years with likely additions being electric versions of the ford explorer and lincoln aviator as well as an all electric ford bronco
a few days ago berkshire hathaway brk a brk b released its third quarter 13 f morningstar s resident berkshire specialist gregg warren noted that berkshire was a net seller of equities during the

mclennan mmc and charter communications chtr among others berkshire initiated new positions in royalty pharma rprx and floor decor fnd and added to its stake in chevron cvx we think most of berkshire s holdings are fairly valued to overvalued as of this writing but there are three names that weren t trimmed during the quarter that we think are quite undervalued here are our analysts latest stock analyst notes about each dig deeper how to invest like warren buffett amazon com amzn current morningstar rating as of nov 16 4 stars economic moat rating wide we are lowering our fair value estimate for wide moat amazon to 4 100 per share from 4 200 based mainly on margin pressures arising from hiring and shipping challenges which we think may pressure profitability in the near term and to a lesser extent the long term that said we see the shares as attractive amazon reported third quarter results that came in above the midpoints of its guidance range for both revenue and operating income but were still shy of investor expectations guidance for the fourth quarter was modestly below our expectations but has little bearing on our long term view meanwhile the company continues to rapidly add capacity in order to meet customer demand and one day delivery even as it roughly doubled its footprint during the past two years we don t see issues with the long term story as amazon remains well positioned to prosper from the secular shift toward e commerce and the public cloud over the next decade but we do see a modest reset in terms of growth and profitability through the next several quarters third quarter revenue grew 15 15 in constant currency year over year to 110 8 billion compared with factset consensus of 111 6 billion and guidance of 106 billion 112 billion surging growth last year in online stores and third party seller services slowed to 3 and 19 year over year gains in the third quarter respectively while physical stores accelerated to 13 growth this shift succinctly captures the dynamics of the end of pandemic driven lockdowns on a year over year basis subscription services slowed to 24 growth aws accelerated to 39 growth and other decelerated to 50 growth performance of aws was staggering with acceleration from a 12 billion base a year ago we continue to view advertising in other and aws as key long term growth drivers for the firm dan romanoff analyst kraft heinz khc current morningstar rating as of nov 16 4 stars economic moat rating none rampant cost pressures supply chain disruptions and stepped up competition did not derail no moat kraft heinz s performance in the third quarter we attribute its results to the foresight to set out on a revised strategic course even before the pandemic took hold organic sales edged up 1 3 versus a year ago and impressively jumped 7 6 relative to the pre pandemic period in 2019 further while adjusted operating margins contracted 250 basis points over last year to 19 8 we re encouraged that management has opted to continue funneling resources to support its brands and capabilities despite facing unrelenting inflationary headwinds in this context advertising was up 9 through the first nine months of the year and research and development spend has increased to the tune of 17 in addition kraft heinz has directed 3 4 of sales toward capital expenditures for the year to date versus just 2 1 over the same horizon in 2020 although the market doesn t seem enamored with shares down a touch we think results showcase the extent to which the company has prudently prioritized investments for the long term health of the business as opposed to its previous mandate to boost margins at all costs since ceo miguel patricio took the helm in mid 2019 with just three months left in its fiscal year management articulated its expectations for organic sales to hold flat relative to 2020 and adjusted ebitda to amount to more than 6 2 billion up from 6 1 billion prior we will likely tweak our near term outlook to reflect marks through the first nine months but see little to warrant altering our long term forecast 2 3 annual top line growth and operating margins holding in the low

there was some highly encouraging news about coronavirus vaccines but not the one the company is associated with what happened ocugen ocgn 1 18 one of the more talked about meme stocks in the biotech sector closed out this week on a high note the company s shares flew more than 6 higher on the back of generally positive developments for coronavirus vaccines and perhaps some fresh news about employee incentives so what on friday the food and drug administration fda granted authorization for booster shots of the coronavirus vaccines from both moderna and the partnership of pharmaceutical sector mainstay pfizer and biontech to all adult americans it had previously turned on the green light for a booster of johnson johnson s one shot jab note that ocugen is not on that list the company holds the commercial rights to a vaccine called covaxin which has been developed by india based company bharat biotech while covaxin has done well in late stage clinical testing particularly against the delta variant it is not yet authorized or approved for use by the fda regardless many in the meme stock crowd are excited about covaxin s prospects considering it to be somewhat of a dark horse contender in the coronavirus vaccine space also on friday ocugen announced that the compensation committee of its board of directors approved the company s granting of stock options in the company s words this covers an aggregate of 93 000 shares of its common stock and restricted stock units rsus covering an aggregate of 15 600 shares of common stock to six hired employees it did not specify who those employees are although it s safe to assume they re in the highest tiers of company management now what ocugen bulls are eager to leap on any scrap of good news and these two items qualify as scraps yes the fda is eager to get shots in arms as quickly as possible however covaxin still has some distance to go before it reaches that stage plus there s no guarantee that the fda will give it a nod no matter how encouraging its performance in trials may be and the stock options are a nice incentive and morale booster but they likely won t make or break ocugen s success as a business or a stock
booster shots could soon be available for all u s adults what happened shares of moderna mrna 1 75 climbed 5 on friday after u s health regulators took steps toward making covid 19 booster vaccines available for more americans so what the u s food and drug administration fda authorized booster shots developed by moderna and rival drugmaker pfizer for people aged 18 and older the shots are designed to be administered at least six months after people receive their second dose throughout the course of the covid 19 pandemic the fda has worked to make timely public health decisions as the pandemic evolves acting fda commissioner janet woodcock said in a press release vaccines have proven to be the best and highly effective defense against covid 19 woodcock said booster shots will offer better protection against the most serious potential effects of the disease including hospitalization and death health officials also said that expanding the eligibility criteria to all u s adults would help reduce confusion about who could get one the fda had previously authorized booster shots for people 65 years of age and older younger individuals who were at high risk of severe covid 19 and adults with frequent institutional or occupational exposure to the novel coronavirus now what shortly before the market close an advisory committee for the centers for disease control and prevention cdc voted in favor of booster shots cdc director rochelle walensky is now expected to sign off on the additional vaccine doses in short order that would pave the way for moderna to begin supplying doses to tens of millions of americans who received their primary series of its covid 19 vaccine earlier this year this emergency use authorization comes at a critical time as we enter the winter months and face increasing covid 19 case counts and hospitalizations across the country moderna ceo stéphane bancel said
security and defense are suddenly back on europe s agenda the united states chaotic withdrawal from afghanistan which left european allies reeling over the perceived lack of consultation and tensions with france over the australia united kingdom united states aukus submarine deal have sharpened european concerns that as washington embraces the pivot to asia american priorities are shifting away not just from europe but also from the middle east and north africa and although president joe biden s commitment to nato s article 5 pledge to treat an attack against one nato member as an attack against them all remains ironclad polling suggests that on both sides of the political spectrum americans appetite for military intervention to resolve conflicts in europe s broader neighborhood has waned in recent years alert to this trend european officials increasingly recognize that europe must begin to take charge of its own security on september 15 european commission president ursula von der leyen announced that the european union will hold a summit on defense in the first six months of 2022 during france s upcoming presidency of the bloc but what makes this moment different is a shift not in paris or brussels but in washington in meetings between french and american officials following the aukus spat and then in an october 29 meeting in rome between biden and french president emmanuel macron the united states acknowledged the need for more robust european defense capabilities complementary to nato for the united states which has long been concerned that independent european defense initiatives could subvert the transatlantic alliance such a public endorsement of europe s ability to defend its security apart from nato was a potentially meaningful policy concession but as former u s ambassador to nato alexander vershbow recently commented talk is cheap capabilities are not the united states newfound openness to eu defense is ultimately significant only if the eu seizes the moment and takes real initiative time to go big unless the eu comes through with a bold proposal that results in tangible military acquisitions that fill gaps in nato s capabilities and enable europe to act on its own if needed a more balanced transatlantic partnership will remain a pipe dream thanks in large part to the precedent set by europe s pandemic recovery plan there is now a straightforward way for the eu to fund new defense initiatives borrow the money we propose the european union launch a new 100 billion euro initiative to support defense acquisitions not the 1990s any more despite regular calls for increased european defense spending the united states has opposed eu defense integration efforts for decades at a december 1998 meeting of nato foreign ministers then secretary of state madeleine albright laid out some redlines for future eu defense initiatives the boundaries albright expressed became known as the three ds eu defense could not duplicate nato efforts decouple decision making from the alliance or discriminate against nato members outside the eu and soon congealed into doctrine europe s dependence on the united states for its security has given washington a de facto veto over eu defense proposals and it has used it suggesting that its european partners must choose between the eu and nato for u s allies in central and eastern europe for whom the threat posed by russia is not merely theoretical this is not a choice at all as the united states remains the backbone of the continent s defense american skepticism of european defense initiatives has prompted opposition within the eu european officials have often come to washington privately expressing frustration at french security initiatives believing this to be what their american interlocutors wish to hear but the world has changed a great deal since the 1990s whereas the clinton administration was preoccupied with ensuring nato s survival in a post cold war world nato s role today is far more secure the eu has also evolved and american caution toward the union is no longer warranted europe s political union has survived many crises proving its durability and playing an increasingly prominent global role despite u s objections the eu has also become more of a defense actor creating a common defense fund to make procurements and provide security assistance abroad nevertheless skeptical attitudes toward european defense efforts retain considerable sway among policymakers on both sides of the atlantic thwarting significant progress for too long european countries have paid homage to the nato alliance while letting their militaries atrophy as recent international military efforts such as the intervention in libya and the fight against the islamic state or isis have demonstrated europe s ability to act militarily depends heavily on american support a strong stable and more militarized europe capable of independently fending off challenges in its neighborhood is of vital interest to washington although biden has called nato s article 5 a holy obligation would washington act if a crisis erupted in the eastern mediterranean or north africa that did not directly involve a nato member state yet would likely create damaging repercussions for europe would a european union capable of independent military action be better positioned to stop a genocide in the western balkans than it was in the 1990s when it relied on the united states or at a very basic level would a crisis in a distant capital mobilize the united states to evacuate eu citizens addressing such questions should be an urgent priority for the united states and will require a new approach to european defense simply demanding that european states spend more on their own defense is a recipe for continued transatlantic drift for too long european states such as germany have paid homage to the nato alliance while letting their militaries atrophy looking ahead not only are the eu states unlikely to spend more in the aftermath of the covid 19 pandemic but whatever marginal spending might materialize will have little impact on european security as it will be spread across the eu s 27 member states thus on the current course europe s military weakness could well worsen increasing european dependence on the united states this european free riding may have a high price in euros but it also has a clear cost to transatlantic relations if washington views europe as providing little practical help and sees engaging europe as not worth the time greater estrangement will only ensue as such both the united states and europe must chart a new approach one that sees europe make real investments and the united states support integrating those efforts at the eu level the eu can afford to spend upgrading european defense capabilities to the point that the eu is capable of independent military action will be costly but the eu s historic 750 billion euro coronavirus recovery package the next generation eu fund offers a potential model for financing new eu military initiatives the eu should borrow an additional 100 billion euros to finance the acquisition of defense capabilities by member states and to support existing eu initiatives such additional stimulus funding would boost europe s economic recovery and supercharge european defense efforts transforming europe s ability to defend itself and allowing it to partner with nato and the united states on a more equal footing before the summer of 2020 the notion that the european union would borrow funds was almost unimaginable but the european recovery package did something novel instead of asking member states to draw on their national budgets as they do to fund the eu budget the european union backed by the euro and the european central bank went to the financial markets which turned out to be eager to lend to brussels the eu credit rating came in at aaa and as bloomberg noted in june market demand for eu debt has been stratospheric with its newly established ability to borrow at interest rates that range between negative and just above zero the european union can invest in itself at no additional cost since there will be opposition from more frugal eu members to more borrowing american insistence is key collective spending will give the eu more bang for the euro it could also prove more palatable for some eu member states for instance there is little prospect that a new german government will spend more domestically on defense but two of the german coalition parties the greens and the free democratic party support the concept of eu defense in principle and they all put the transatlantic alliance at the core of their message recent initiatives aimed at advancing the structural integration of the eu s armed forces such as the european defense fund and the permanent structured cooperation pesco framework which were both activated in 2017 are already working to optimize european defense spending efforts and have begun funding defense research and acquisitions but now that the eu has the institutional structure to do much more on defense it can ramp up spending on concrete capabilities the eu would be wise to focus first on making the kinds of major military acquisitions that will both fill gaps in capabilities identified by nato ensure interoperability and reduce the eu s dependence on the united states for example in light of the recent situation in which european countries were forced to rely on the united states while evacuating afghanistan off the shelf acquisitions that would fill real capability gaps might include fleets of long range air transport and air refueling tankers the eu might also consider acquiring advanced submarines or naval vessels that would help reverse a declining maritime presence improved cyber infrastructure and drones and upgraded air patrol capabilities which would allow it to monitor russian violations of european airspace and the enforcement of embargoes on libya or syria some of the funding could be invested in the more than 40 pesco defense projects that are already underway especially the defense programs that were halted due to pandemic related budgetary cuts in particular full funding should be restored to the eu s military mobility initiative which was reduced in eu budgetary negotiations but performs crucial work retrofitting roads railways and bridges so that nato tanks can move eastward every advancement in the european project has sparked major institutional reforms and the eu s entry into defense will be no different although some difficult compromises may be necessary the institutional reforms that will enable the eu to build more robust defense capabilities may ultimately pave the way for a more coherent and effective european foreign policy a breakthrough summit a new european security initiative along these lines could be announced during the early 2022 eu defense summit that will be held during france s upcoming six months in the rotating eu presidency it would make sense for paris a traditional backer of european defense to spearhead the effort but a spirit of compromise will be essential if france claims to act in the interests of european sovereignty it must demonstrate the intent to shield the eu against all threats including russia in recent weeks the eu has witnessed a showdown between brussels and warsaw over a polish constitutional court s ruling that eu law should not supersede national law a fundamental challenge to the eu s legal framework although the eu must enforce its democratic principles a recognition of the geopolitical vulnerability of central and eastern european countries in the face of continued russian aggression must also be reflected in its spending priorities meanwhile the united states must provide steadfast support for these efforts for this plan to succeed the administration will need to be actively engaged it must reassure eastern europe that eu defense initiatives will not diminish washington s commitment to nato and european security on the contrary the united states should make clear that it views eu defense integration as a long term investment in the transatlantic partnership that far from supplanting nato will necessitate robust transatlantic defense cooperation through nato washington must demonstrate to its european allies that if they take their own security more seriously the united states will take europe more seriously backing eu defense will also require the united states to accept that spending will primarily boost the european defense industrial base a necessary step to ensure european resilience and domestic political buy in it is critical that major european acquisitions create jobs across the eu this may be a hard pill for u s defense contractors to swallow but it will allow the biden administration to show the american public that positive engagement not insults and threats prompted europe to increase defense spending in undertaking this commitment to european defense europeans could help themselves and help biden in a fraught domestic environment skepticism that the eu will take strong action is warranted yet after a decade plagued by crises from the greek debt rescue to brexit to the covid 19 pandemic the eu has emerged stronger and more capable over the last two years the eu has proved that it can undertake massive policy initiatives while the u s congress struggles to pass climate legislation and regulate big tech the eu is leading the way globally with its european green deal and its digital markets and services acts the european union can do big things and the united states should encourage the eu to think big and act boldly on defense because european security is badly in need of an overhaul now is the time for europe to step up and launch the defense effort the european union and nato need

here are three covid 19 stock ideas a vaccine biotech a big pharma stock and an investment in a reopening will covid 19 be finished in 2022 that would be nice if the vaccines work and we develop herd immunity covid will certainly recede in importance it will be more like the flu and many of us will get vaccinated every year to stay safe so how should investors play this transition three fool com contributors have three different approaches for the new year here s why they like pfizer pfe 1 82 novavax nvax 0 47 and live nation entertainment lyv 1 65 in 2022 and beyond a dominant force in the covid 19 arena george budwell pfizer pfizer s stock has rocketed higher this year by a whopping 35 the drugmaker s meteoric rise in 2021 is largely due to its biontech partnered covid 19 vaccine known as comirnaty in the third quarter alone this vaccine raked in over 13 billion in sales comirnaty is on pace to become the best selling vaccine of all time what s more this novel coronavirus vaccine has quickly become the market leader by a wide margin in both the u s and the eu according to the company s third quarter conference call the bad news for shareholders though is that comirnaty s sales are likely to drop by a few billion next year pfizer may already have a viable solution to this problem however on tuesday the pharma giant announced that it had applied for emergency use authorization from the food and drug administration fda for the oral covid 19 pill paxlovid in a large randomized trial paxlovid slashed the risk of hospitalization and or death among patients at risk of severe disease by 89 when taken within three days of the onset of symptoms pfizer s oral coronavirus pill thus appears destined to be a big seller what s an oral covid 19 pill worth while the company has yet to release any definitive pricing info wall street thinks this pill ought to generate at least 15 billion in sales next year this amount should easily offset the anticipated slowdown in comirnaty sales next year as a result pfizer s stock seems poised for another banner year in 2022 novavax is leading the race for a covid flu combo vaccine taylor carmichael novavax in the short term i m expecting novavax stock to spike higher when the company receives authorizations around the world for its covid 19 vaccine the stock market has already assumed a lot of success based on the biotech s fantastic phase 3 data all that clinical success is why the stock shot up from a micro cap to a 14 billion company in two years while there might be some profit taking along the way novavax stock promises to be an outstanding long term hold the biotech has two major vaccines ready to hit the market the company s flu vaccine nano flu defeated the market leading flu vaccine from sanofi in a head to head phase 3 trial last year and its covid vaccine has already started getting authorizations in indonesia and the philippines the flu is a 6 billion annual market around the world and covid vaccines are projected to hit 25 billion in annual revenue by 2024 so what s really exciting for novavax investors the biotech is the first drug company to get a covid flu combo vaccine into clinical trials back in september novavax initiated its phase 1 phase 2 trial in 640 adults no other drug company has a combo vaccine in clinical trials yet while novavax stock has had a huge run over the last couple of years there is still plenty of upside in 2022 and beyond and the beat goes on patrick bafuma live nation entertainment with covid 19 boosters on the scene i hear a lady singing that the end

macroeconomic readings this week starting on tuesday with the u s census bureau reporting that retail sales increased 1 7 in october ahead of estimates and following a 0 8 advance in september the

percentage point pp increase in manufacturing a 3 1pp advance in mining and a 0 8pp increase in utilities with october s results industrial production is up 5 1 yoy while capacity has increased 0 3

corporate america has been feeding a stock buyback boom for decades with companies spending trillions of dollars to repurchase their shares without paying any taxes on those transactions that could soon change in president biden s roughly 2 trillion build back better act which narrowly passed the house on friday but faces a tough fight in the senate democrats have proposed a 1 percent tax on stock buybacks although it may not seem like much the tax is a way to raise as much as 124 billion over 10 years according to government estimates and could help pay for the social spending and climate package both supporters and critics of the proposed surcharge say it could alter the behavior of companies but in ways that would have very different consequences for the economy to carry out a buyback a company typically uses its excess cash or even borrows to repurchase shares from investors the goal is to lift the price of a stock by reducing the number of shares outstanding which rewards existing shareholders
updated november 19 2021 at 10 20 am et the house voted on near party lines friday morning to approve a roughly 2 trillion social and climate spending package ending months of squabbles among democrats over the details of the far reaching measure the vote was 220 213 with one democrat rep jared golden of maine joining all republicans in opposition the legislation is meant to fulfill many of president biden s promises during the 2020 campaign including plans to address climate change and provide a stronger federal safety net for families and low income workers we have the built back better bill that is historic transformative and larger than anything we have ever done before house speaker nancy pelosi d calif said on the house floor if you re a parent a senior a child a worker if you are an american this bill s for you and it is better house democrats overcame internal divisions over the cost and scope of the spending package but the fight will continue as the bill heads to the senate for revisions the vote was delayed after house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif spoke all through the night for more than eight hours his speech decried democrats spending plans but also veered to subjects including china and border security never in american history has so much been spent at one time he said never in american history will so many taxes be raised and so much borrowing be needed to pay for all this reckless spending but president biden praised house passage of the bill noting it was the second time in two weeks that the chamber moved two consequential pieces of his legislative agenda he described the vote as a giant step forward in carrying out my economic plan to create jobs reduce costs make our country more competitive and give working people and the middle class a fighting chance jim watson afp via getty images afp via getty images house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif speaks during his weekly press conference on capitol hill on thursday what s in the measure the legislation includes 550 billion to address climate change through incentives and tax breaks funding to extend the expanded monthly child tax credit for one year housing assistance including 150 billion in affordable housing expenditures expansions to medicaid and further assistance to reduce the cost of health care premiums for plans purchased under the affordable care act four weeks of paid family and medical leave funding for universal pre k for roughly 6 million 3 and 4 year olds a provision to allow medicare parts b and d to negotiate prices directly with drug manufacturers on certain drugs and cap out of pocket spending for seniors at 2 000 per year a 35 cap on monthly insulin expenses the spending is mostly offset with taxes on the wealthy and corporations including a 5 surtax on taxpayers with personal income above 10 million and an additional 3 added on income above 25 million a 15 minimum tax on corporate profits of large corporations that report more than 1 billion in profits a 1 tax on stock buybacks a 50 minimum tax on foreign profits of u s corporations house democrats unite after months of fighting moderate democrats ultimately voted for the legislation after concerns that estimates from the nonpartisan congressional budget office would show the measure to be more costly than leaders have projected ultimately the cbo found the bill would cost the federal government 367 billion over the next decade not counting any additional revenue that may be generated by additional funding for tax enforcement many democrats including the white house argue that when that is taken into account the measure would pay for itself members of the fiscally moderate new democrat coalition endorsed the legislation ahead of the final cost estimates rep brad schneider d ill said the official estimates don t take into account extra revenue from increased tax enforcement or the broader economic benefits of the legislation when discussing the importance of the bill we also have to talk about the costs that would be incurred if we don t pass this bill schneider said on a call with reporters the cost of inaction is simply too high and it can only be headed off if we act now for progressive democrats the vote fulfills a promise from biden and house leaders not to neglect policies that have energized the left wing of their party members of the congressional progressive caucus set aside major demands throughout the negotiations including more spending and plans for aggressive changes to the nation s health care system in order to reach an agreement that satisfied the full caucus senate hurdles could drag on for weeks the house vote is just the latest step in a lengthy process that will almost certainly involve further changes to the bill centrist sens kyrsten sinema d ariz and joe manchin d w va have each expressed concerns about the house version of the legislation manchin is particularly opposed to a provision that would provide four weeks of paid family and medical leave for most workers sinema s objections are less clear but democrats need both lawmakers on board in order for the legislation to pass it is unclear how long it would take for senators to work out their disagreements and finalize the legislation once that work is done the senate would have to start a lengthy process to vote on the bill using the budget reconciliation process that would allow the bill to be passed in the senate with 50 votes rather than the 60 votes needed for most legislation pelosi told reporters on thursday that senate staff have already completed a necessary step to ensure the legislation meets the basic requirements to avoid a republican filibuster but the process still has several steps including a series of unlimited amendment votes known as a vote a rama copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

the euro has been demolished by fears that new lockdowns will hit economic growth this has turbocharged the dollar as traders look for shelter and the upcoming business surveys will be crucial for whether this rotation continues meanwhile markets are split on whether the reserve bank of new zealand will deliver a single or double rate increase leaving the kiwi vulnerable in case the central bank plays it safe euro gets hammered the single currency has been taken to the cleaners lately as several risks threaten to hamstring economic growth a sharp spike in covid cases across europe has seen the netherlands and austria impose lockdowns again raising concerns that germany could follow soon then there s the spiral in energy prices squeezing consumers and simultaneously providing fuel for anti european forces in france ahead of next year s presidential election and with the chinese economic machine slowing down demand for european exports seems shaky in this light it s quite surreal that money markets continue to price in a minor rate increase by the european central bank next year derivatives traders are essentially betting that intensifying inflationary pressures will eventually force the ecb s hand however that s very unlikely the ecb knows the economy isn t strong enough to handle higher rates with the labor market still miles away from recovering rate increases could also revive fears around the fiscal health of large indebted economies like italy sparking havoc in bond markets a barrage of pmi business surveys coming up on tuesday could finally convince investors the ecb is unlikely to raise rates next year between new covid restrictions higher inflation eating into profit margins and china s slowdown there s a strong risk the pmis sink further dealing another blow to the devastated euro fed minutes on the menu in sharp contrast the dollar has obliterated its competitors lately as a string of encouraging data fueled expectations for earlier fed rate increases money markets are now pricing in two rate hikes for next year and around 40 chance for a third one america is probably the strongest major economy at this stage consumption is booming inflation is sizzling hot lost jobs are coming back quickly wage growth is firing up and business surveys point to a powerful spell of growth ahead on top of everything congress is about to bring more spending to this party the coming week will bring a storm of us releases the preliminary markit pmis for november are out on tuesday ahead of durable goods orders the second reading of gdp for q3 personal income and consumption and the core pce price index all on wednesday a few hours later the minutes of the latest fed meeting will hit the markets most of the focus could fall on the pmis as they are forward looking indicators there s still scope for a third fed rate hike to be baked in for next year so if they reaffirm america s economic supremacy the dollar could get another shot in the arm the minutes are always important too but are unlikely to reveal anything new as most policymakers have spoken publicly since then rbnz meeting single or double a rate increase from the reserve bank of new zealand on wednesday is almost certain the real question is whether it will be just a regular 25 basis points rate hike or whether it will be a double of 50 basis points markets are currently split between the two there are solid arguments why monetary policy needs to be tightened the unemployment rate hit a record low in q3 inflationary pressures are intensifying and the housing market is on absolute fire however going for a double rate hike seems unnecessary such a drastic move would risk shocking the economy at a time when there are still several risks on the radar from covid infections spreading across the country to china s slowdown threatening demand for new zealand s commodity exports so while surprises from the rbnz are always possible the most likely outcome is just a single rate increase that disappoints the kiwi considering how elevated market expectations are australian and british data eyed across the tasman sea it s a busy data week in australia too the pmis for november are out on tuesday ahead of capital expenditure numbers for q3 on thursday and the final estimate of retail sales for october on friday sinking iron ore prices and a stronger us dollar have hammered the aussie lately and the pain could continue as markets are still pricing in three rate increases from the reserve bank next year which seems excessive the australian economy is not that strong and could suffer serious collateral damage if china s slowdown deepens last but not least the british pound could enjoy some volatility with the release of pmis for november on tuesday sterling was the only major currency to hold its nerve in the face of the dollar s onslaught lately even managing to touch new post pandemic highs against the euro that likely boils down to hopes the bank of england will raise rates in december which seems plausible given the strength of recent data markets are only pricing a 50 probability for a rate hike next month so there is room for more short term gains that said hiking rates four times by this time next year as money markets currently suggest is a bridge too far which allows scope for longer term disappointment

peat exports from ireland are over 11 times import levels as concerns grow that there is not enough supply for the domestic horticultural sector data released by the central statistics office cso to noteworthy the investigative platform from the journal shows that exports of peat have far outstripped imports over the past 20 years this includes the past two years since a landmark high court decision effectively forced the horticultural peat industry to cease harvesting overnight the sector supplies growing material to various industries including mushrooms fruit production and professional plant growers while exports have historically made up the majority of the irish horticultural peat market noteworthy can reveal as part of its peat s sake investigation that a working group examining peat use in horticulture was not tasked with examining exports as part of its remit aerial drone image of large scale peat harvesting operation in ireland corkscrew shutterstock corkscrew shutterstock shutterstock planning and licensing headache following a long legal and planning battle since the early 2010s the 2019 high court ruling made it clear that companies engaged in large scale peat extraction need planning permission and epa licensing both of which involve a thorough environmental assessment process required under eu law due to the climate and biodiversity impacts of peat extraction the majority of peat harvesting for horticultural use has taken place in the midlands which contains most of ireland s unique raised bogs that today account for half of europe s entire raised bog network nearly all major companies in the sector have neither planning permission or licenses bord na mona is the only company that has epa licences to date throwing the industry into disarray this issue is acknowledged by the industry itself in a submission to an oireachtas committee in february 2021 growing media ireland which represents most horticultural peat producers stated that no company has planning permission for the harvesting of peat and would be operating outside the law if they continue to do so following the ruling there have been widespread calls from the industry for emergency legislative changes to allow them to harvest again in 2022 as stocks of already harvested peat have dwindled leaving the 477 million horticultural industry facing a crisis for supply of growing media bord na mona supplied nearly all the peat for compost for garden plant growers but in january 2021 announced it had ended all peat harvesting operations on its lands with reserves expected to have run out by the end of may the mushroom industry relies on the use of a thin layer of peat casing on top of high quality compost to ensure mushrooms grow in a uniform manner in a submission to the 2020 review of the use of peat in horticulture walsh mushrooms said that the industry is totally reliant on peat in its current form to be able to operate all eye on imports this concern culminated in widespread media attention after the recent importation of a large amount of peat from the baltic region that arrived at drogheda port in september the peat was destined for klasmann deilmann near the longford and westmeath border the company describes itself as a leading corporate group in the international substrate industry across europe asia and america reporting of the shipment led to a wave of calls from national politicians for emergency legislation to be brought in to allow the industry to recommence harvesting in 2022 in 2021 to date 42 800 tonnes of peat valued at 7 3m has been imported into ireland the vast majority came in from northern ireland followed by the netherlands great britain germany lithuania ukraine and belarus analysis of cso data shows that there has been an increased demand for imports with this year s imports to date more than twice that imported in 2019 and 2020 combined it is also the highest amount imported over the past 20 years although large amounts were also imported prior to the 2019 high court ruling with almost 20 000 and 25 000 tonnes of peat products imported in 2016 and 2017 respectively according to growing media ireland the concern from the industry now is that there is a lack of supply of materials needed for the professional horticultural and mushroom sectors the industry group claimed to noteworthy that the stockpiles that were in place following the high court decision in late 2019 have been exhausted and the only viable source of horticultural peat at the moment is imported peat it said the imported peat has an obvious environmental impact compared to harvesting irish peat as well as a direct higher cost for irish horticultural growers and the 17 000 jobs that depend on the sector export driven industry however the importation figures still pale in comparison to the amount of peat products being exported from ireland with over 500 000 tonnes worth 94 million leaving the country so far this year 11 5 times import levels in 2020 when the industry was already raising alarm bells about shortfalls in the sector 919 371 tonnes of peat was exported from ireland this is 10 times what is needed for the domestic horticultural market according to a briefing note from june 2021 released to noteworthy that was prepared for the minister of state at the department of agriculture dafm pippa hackett the commercial horticultural peat sector has always been export focused according to dafm 10 of all peat extracted in ireland has historically been harvested for horticulture with 90 of it exported as milled peat or for mushroom casing advertisement this is confirmed by the industry in a submission to the 2020 review of peat use in horticulture bulrush one of the largest companies in the sector said that the industry exists to supply an export market for substrates klasmann deilmann also said that the industry in ireland would effectively not exist without the export market with an estimated 95 of its peat exported with a few exceptions revenues in the industry are mostly derived from exports it said the cso data analysed by noteworthy however does not differentiate between the different types of peat exported and it is unclear what percentage of exports would be suitable for use in the professional horticultural sector for example a large percentage of exports in 2020 and 2021 went to the uk the key market for amateur or hobby peat products such as gardening composts that is often not up to the standards required for the professional industry in a statement to noteworthy growing media ireland said that the total export figure is greatly exaggerated as the figures include peat mixed with alternatives in addition it said that domestic stockpiles were still being exhausted until very recently and that the figures for the full year will be very different as the latter half of the year has seen exports collapse and imports soar however detailed international trade data for 2020 and 2021 seen by noteworthy does show that professional grade peat supplies for the mushroom and other professional industries was exported to customers in north america as recently as this month in addition the cso data shows that there has been significant exports to the netherlands south africa and israel in 2020 and 2021 with the mushroom industries in these countries known to be destinations for irish peat products report findings the concern over imports has formed the key talking point of a working group of stakeholders set up earlier this year to examine the future use of peat in the horticultural industry the working group includes industry representative bodies such as the commercial mushroom producers growing media ireland and the irish farmers association ifa as well as ictu environmental groups bord na mona the agri research body teagasc and independent academics and experts the group s report coordinated by its chair and former chief scientist at bord na mona dr munoo prasad is now with the minister of state malcolm noonan and awaiting release noteworthy has seen a version of the final report the contents of which were widely circulated in the media this week that calls for peat in horticulture to be phased out by 2035 providing alternative materials become available the report also has a strong focus on provisions to allow for harvesting from existing ecologically destroyed bogs to continue so long as they have already been prepared for harvesting this would require amendments to the current legislation to allow for large scale extraction that the report said is absolutely critical for the 2022 season recommending new legislation as a priority by the end of this year the report also recommends that the importation of peat should only take place under special circumstances e g to make up a shortfall the report however only makes scant reference to exports briefly comparing the size of the export trade to the needs in the domestic market according to a spokesperson for friends of the irish environment fie which sat on the working group until recently the level of exports still taking place undermines the validity of the working group report the group said that its representative was assured there were no significant exports taking place the organisation recently stepped down from the group over the issue could not support the recommendations of the working group who were concerned only with finding ways around the law to continue to extract peat until transition in 2035 the group claimed fie sent an email to the chair dr prasad in october outlining the latest available cso figures at the time showing large volumes of peat exports between january and july in a reply the same day with department of housing officials in copy dr prasad told fie that the export of peat from ireland does not fall in the remit of my working group noteworthy asked dr prasad for comment but he said that he was instructed by the department not to comment on the report until minister noonan has officially approved the report and released the report the department was also asked to comment on this point and said that while it would not be commenting on the report until after publication the chair is correct to say that the export of peat did not fall within the group s remit according to teagasc switching to peat free production will require significant research and development of a range of alternatives with the department of agriculture funding a number of projects looking at substitutes and partial peat replacements noteworthy will publish more articles as part of its peat sake investigation into the peat industry over the coming months as it delves into enforcement concerns and the future use of our precious peatlands as we transition away from harvesting this article was written by niall sargent of noteworthy it was proposed and funded by you

the resilience is doing little to dissipate gloom among strategists when it comes to 2022 the average projection for the s p 500 at the end of 2022 is 4843 representing a mere 3 per cent advance from the current level that counts as the least optimistic outlook behind only 2019 in two decades of data chalk up caution among the normally bullish group to an unorthodox recovery that has played havoc with forecasts take the latest week when many were convinced strained supply would hamper growth instead retailers were bragging about their ability to build inventories ahead of the holidays and jobless claims fell to a new pandemic era low signalling a still strong labour market stocks advanced for a sixth week in seven with the s p 500 rising 0 3 per cent as countries in europe announced new travel restrictions amid a fresh wave of pandemic cases investors again sought safety in the usual beneficiaries of a stay at home economy software and internet stocks the tech heavy nasdaq 100 outperformed jumping more than 2 per cent strategists are not alone in finding it difficult to make predictions in the pandemic era single stock analysts have watched companies beat the average estimate for earnings per share by an unprecedented amount economists and central bankers have seen their view on inflation being transitory run into against a multi month surge in consumer prices advertisement in the end the stock pessimists are almost surely staring at a year where their forecasts for equities missed badly in january the highest year end target was 4400 the s p 500 ended friday just below 4700 being wrong about the pace of the recovery in 2021 hasn t fostered optimism among strategists for 2022 they now see the predicted slump in the rate of economic growth occurring next year with gains hampered by the fed s tightening cycle that could include the first rate hike since the pandemic began with so much future growth priced into equities the market has become unusually sensitive to the rise of interest rates according to bank of america strategist savita subramanian an increase of 1 percentage point in the discount rate could send the s p 500 into a tailspin that takes it to 3600 her team s model shows on the other hand a rate drop of similar size would push the stock benchmark to 6300 a small increase in the discount rate could roil equities subramanian who expects the s p 500 to end 2022 at 4600 wrote in a recent note to clients but we cannot ignore the opposite scenario advertisement helping underpin this year s us12 trillion stock rally is a string of corporate earnings that has defied all the concerns ranging from supply chain snarls to labour shortages and commodity inflation up more than 40 per cent in each of the first three quarters profits rather than price earnings multiples have accounted for all the share gains profit growth to slow that kind of boom however is unlikely to last prognosticators say s p 500 profit growth will weaken to roughly 8 per cent in 2022 analyst estimates compiled by bloomberg intelligence show while that doesn t necessarily spell trouble for the market it threatens to remove some buffer should rates start to creep up ned davis research compared the s p 500 s earnings yield how big profits are relative to share prices to inflation adjusted 10 year treasury yields and found that the lower premium that stocks offer over bonds the worse they perform since 1984 when the spread was below its 12 month average the s p 500 tended to rise 7 3 per cent a year that s 4 percentage points behind the return when the spread was above the mean at the end of october the gap sat near its average advertisement the risk of potentially higher rates pressuring equity p e ratios is partly why morgan stanley sees the s p 500 finishing next year at 4400 a forecast that s the lowest among those tracked by bloomberg we re still predicting 10 per cent earnings growth the key linchpin in the equation is interest rates daniel skelly head of equity model portfolio solutions at morgan stanley said in an interview on bloomberg surveillance we think risk reward at the index level is unexciting at this point corporate buying record within reach not everyone s pessimistic though equity bulls point to favourable trends in money flows as one reason to stay invested thanks to zero commissions at brokers and pandemic lockdowns a new generation of retail traders have emerged to help propel the market another pillar of support comes from corporate buybacks us firms have announced plans to buy us1 1 trillion of their own shares since january almost triple the level at this time last year and poised to surpass the record set in 2018 data compiled by birinyi associates and bloomberg show net demand for equities from corporations and households will total us550 billion in 2022 according to estimates from goldman sachs strategist david kostin he expects the s p 500 to finish the year at 5100 to brian belski bmo s chief investment strategist all the worries over a growth slowdown or fed tightening set the stage for the bull market to keep going we do not believe the returns registered in 2020 2021 are sustainable belski wrote in a note earlier in the week 2022 will be a year of less positive yet positive nonetheless think of it as a much deserved respite of sorts bloomberg

julia sees paying off her 64 000 mortgage as a priority it has about 14 years to run if she were to pay it off entirely within the next five years so that it would be finished at her age 56 she would have to increase her monthly payments by 713 which is more than her budget will support the better plan would be to maintain her amortization and retire at 60 at that time she could take 2 096 pension and bridge benefit plus 462 cpp as well her rrsps with a recent value of 143 000 and 1 200 annual contributions will grow to 199 140 in nine years when she is 60 assuming a three per cent annual rate of return the rrsp would then be able to support a taxable annual payout of 9 864 per year or 822 per month for the following 30 years to her age 90 these taxable sources of income at age 60 add up to 40 560 per year or 3 380 per month after 11 per cent average tax she would have 3 008 per month to spend that works out to a replacement of 94 per cent of her present 3 200 monthly after tax income but with her mortgage ended at 65 and no further tfsa or rrsp savings she would have an income surplus of about 1 000 per month at 65 her oas benefit 635 per month would lift income to 4 015 per month

tax free savings account with a present balance of 7 000 would grow to 29 224 in nine years with 1 920 annual contributions and growth at 3 per cent per year she can keep the tfsa for unplanned expenses such as replacing her car present estimated value 6 000 income and security living on 36 000 at 60 and 41 400 at 65 monthly after tax income will not be easy bargain flights off season resorts and other economies will enable this plan to work we have not estimated long run returns on investments beyond our customary three per cent for a blended stock and bond portfolio on top of three per cent annual inflation her investments are a blend of low fee etfs a few high fee but very successful mutual funds and a u s asset fund julia needs guidance and her portfolio s appreciation suggests she is getting some value for her fees study of investment markets in her retirement would give her a perspective on the risks she faces and future returns she might expect recommended from editorial the pandemic wedding boom is in full bloom but for many young couples the financial picture has never been cloudier how to avoid a debt hangover after the holiday spending season this ontario woman needs a retirement tune up and downsizing her home could do the trick advertisement 5 story continues below this advertisement has not loaded yet but your article continues below article content however when her parents pass away which might be a decade or two she can expect an inheritance of presently unknown value we cannot time the event or estimate what she might get after final tax returns nevertheless using today s numbers a six figure inheritance subject to unknown market changes and taxes will probably produce a six figure net sum assuming a value of 500 000 invested at three per cent per year she would be able to add 15 000 to her income subject to 11 per cent tax net 13 350 per year that would be a significant addition to her pre inheritance income we do not include that in our projections as a cost saving measure julia can use the abundant free time she will have in retirement to schedule travel to low seasons on the other hand she may face unknown strata condo fee increases and future costs of a new or newer car the income this analysis estimates will have a sufficient surplus for a car update and modest increases in strata fees should julia decide that a three or more decade retirement is boring without work she can add to income with tax rates using pension and age credits likely to be modest or make substantial contributions to her tfsa with no tax consequences she will also have the gift of being able to time her spending and shopping without competition from work on the whole her situation is good her present assets are rather

farmers and everybody has the same problem they can t find people leonard said so they are producing as fast as they can with half the people turkey production overall appears to be down this year compared with last year the usda reported in september that turkey production nationwide is expected to be down 4 this year with a 9 decline in virginia that was the case for craig and nancy miller who raise about 200 000 turkeys a year on their farm in rockingham county in the heart of the shenandoah valley s poultry producing region this year the number of turkeys they raised was down about 30 mainly because of a lack of processing capacity said miller who has been farming since 1986 the reason is they just don t have enough people in these plants to accommodate a normal number miller said i don t think that is really anybody s fault covid just changed the way we do business in every aspect of life as farmers we are resilient and we will get through it he said covid affected the food chain dramatically miller said it will eventually balance itself out but on the other hand not just our country but our world has never quite been though something like covid it is going to take a while for it to correct itself but i am confident it will the shelves at the tom leonard s store were filled with turkeys on friday several other grocery chains have said they expect to have enough thanksgiving meal supplies while we continue to have some out of stocks in our stores we re in good shape for our customers upcoming holiday celebrations a spokesperson for grocery chain wegmans said

menees corporate affairs manager for kroger s mid atlantic division which operates the chain s 18 stores in the richmond area however supplies of pre cooked turkeys could be more limited ukrop s homestyle foods the henrico based company that makes and ships bakery and prepared foods notified its customers in early october that it won t be able to sell fully cooked turkeys this year because of supply issues we heard from our supplier that the order we placed months ago will not be fulfilled we immediately began looking for turkeys elsewhere but have not been successful the company said in the october letter to customers increased demand for fully cooked and smaller turkeys has resulted in a shortage that will be felt across the country last year ukrop s had orders for 1 659 fully

topics including shortages in labor semiconductor chips and inventory guided friday morning s roundtable discussion hosted by u s pete stauber r hermantown and wisconsin u s rep tom tiffany r minoqua in duluth the representatives met at clyde iron works with 14 northland leaders in transportation business and community development industries to discuss supply chain crisis impacts patrick miner of miner s inc in hermantown said the implications of shortages on the manufacturing side will bring an even greater impact to distribution at the company s grocery and liquor stores which includes super one many large manufacturing companies like procter gamble and kraft heinz are increasing prices of products miner said offering competitive pricing is critical for the business but it s hard to keep the price of products low when they have to pay more for inventory in addition he said many trucks are coming half or three quarters full which means there is less of a need for employees to unload those trucks and stock shelves with fewer products london road rental center s jerry kortesmaki said some products for the business inventory including floor finisher are stuck on trucks or ships and the delay of their delivery will also delay the jobs of people who need those products in order to complete their projects he also noted that equipment is aging and can t be replaced and the money he would use to buy new equipment is instead going toward raised taxes advertisement dwayne haapanen of kolar auto group described the dealership as the poster child for supply chain issues he said the global chip shortage has prolonged the inventory shortage of new cars and trucks and hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes are owed due to the last in first out reserve method stauber said he intends to push in washington d c for domestic production of chips which is impacting both automotive sales inventory and parts needed for equipment across the transportation industry we have the workforce and technology and the space available to do it stauber said chip manufacturing specifically hits all areas from the grocery store to trucking to shipping to national security to defense we need to reshore these facilities to be made in america and not rely on foreign nations tiffany and stauber said they blame actions by the biden administration for many of the supply chain issues including depending on foreign raw and manufactured materials and for the federal vaccine mandate amid a nationwide labor shortage northland leaders in the transportation business and community development industries talked with minnesota u s rep pete stauber and wisconsin u s tom tiffany on friday nov 19 2021 at clyde iron works in duluth about the supply chain shortage s impacts laura butterbrodt duluth news tribune attendees also discussed the challenges of the minnesota requirement to be age 21 to drive a commercial vehicle across state lines which wisconsin operated businesses said creates problems when they have 18 year old employees who aren t able to do their jobs if it requires driving into duluth stauber and tiffany said they were going to look into what could be done about the age requirement in order to help expand the labor pool amid shortages kortesmaki said he has witnessed a lack of work experience in individuals seeking jobs which he believes is due to too much dependence on government assistance he sees high turnover rates of staff as well tiffany said that while the enhanced unemployment benefits may have been necessary at the beginning of the pandemic he believes they were too prolonged and incentivized people to drop out of the labor pool advertisement the fabric of this country was built on work ethic stauber said before you can get a better job first you have to get a job douglas county board chair mark liebaert said the county is really struggling to keep enough service workers especially at jails he said because of the shortage people are working overtime which in turn is causing high turnover rates he expressed concerns about government services being unavailable to the public if they aren t able to hire more workers lance klatt of the minnesota service station convenience store association said he believes there is too much emphasis on earning a four year degree and not enough encouragement is given to young people to enter the trades which is hurting the skilled labor industry richard stewart university of wisconsin superior transportation and logistics professor noted that people in education know how to work hard too but he agreed there could be more of an emphasis on the opportunities in the area s trades and community and technical colleges stewart also noted there were no women participating in the roundtable discussion and said there have been generations of barriers for women to enter the transportation and skilled labor force as a society we haven t said truck driving s great work stewart said whenever i speak to folks who ask why we can t get truck drivers i say so how many of you encouraged your kids to be truck drivers well there s your answer tiffany said the transportation hub of the twin ports is underutilized nationally jayson hron of duluth seaway port authority said he hopes to help as much as the port authority can to be a solution to some of the shortages he said the st lawrence seaway is capable of increasing its shipping volumes which could take some of the burden off of coastal ports stauber and tiffany said many of the problems faced locally are the same that

a shameless dating app with half a million users is spiking in popularity in the us as it promotes itself as uber for dating right here right now pure which launched in 2013 has users all over in the world in cities like london and paris but has just taken off with new marketing in the us with users more than doubling in the past year while the app is sex positive and gives users room to explore kinks and meet up quickly it s also much more mysterious than tinder in that anyone can remain anonymous and do not even have to include photos in their profiles the sex forward dating app pure has users all over in the world in cities like london and paris but has just taken off with new marketing in the us stock image in pure you can be whoever you choose to be but still be yourself reads the company s website the app launched back in 2013 and was promoted as bringing seamless to the bedroom offering sex on demand by simply asking users their gender and their gender of their preference it was launched in 2013 by ukrainian entrepreneurs roman sidorenko and alexander kukhtenko while most apps require users to fill out some sort of profile pure created by ukrainian entrepreneurs roman sidorenko and alexander kukhtenko removes all of that and simply offers two people who want to have sex the ability to arrange a meet up we wanted an easy way to find sex basically sidorenko told new york magazine in 2013 we thought it would be cool to use an approach like uber where you basically create the request and you get a car pretty soon we thought it would be cool to have something like that to find a sex buddy he added it s very interesting to see what fifty shades of gray did for the pleasure products industry when that book became a monster hit it became okay to talk about bdsm stuff it became okay to buy sex toys this is the way the dating industry will be changed to get started users share their gender and sexual identity they can include photos but those are not mandatory however embracing adult content made it hard to get approval on apple s app store so at first they needed to advertise themselves as an instant companion finder the app has evolved a bit since it launched eight years ago now men pay 18 a month for access while women use it for free according to the new york post two thirds of the users are male just under a third is female and three per cent identify as nonbinary sidorenko said that on other apps he d get bored with the idea that you need to talk with people before making a plan to meet up for a hookup the average age is between 25 and 40 with 70 per cent identifying as straight 20 per cent as bisexual and ten per cent gay lesbian queer or asexual about 20 000 users are in new york city alone to get started users share their gender and sexual identity they can include photos but those are not mandatory like in other dating apps users swipe to match with other users and begin messaging or they can skip the matching process and message right away for 2 one a match is made a chat timer gives users 24 hours to start talking before the match expires lighting a fire under people to get things moving quickly our founders imagined pure like uber for dating right here right now anna hintsyak the company s marketing manager in the us and uk told the post she said sidorenko saw that western culture was straying away from monogamy and saw a different opportunity for pure to provide quality over quantity for dating app users users only have to share their gender and sexual orientation identities aren t confirmed and photos aren t necessary se also said the app gives users room to understand their desires and kinks are healthy valid and natural for many the privacy is a key selling point users don t have to show their faces or include photos at all for that matter if they do send photos they self destruct in the app photos and chats also cannot be copied or saved in the app and if someone tries to take a screenshot an alert is sent pure is a lot of cut to the chase one user told the post while others described it as t he best straight hook up app and better than the other sites when it comes to no strings attached hook ups the anonymity of the app can mean that meeting up has its surprises finding a gem on here requires a lot of vetting and hard work but they do exist said one user i ve had one or two not good experiences mostly where guys don t look like what they re supposed to but i ve also had a lot of really good experiences too said another pure is a lot of cut to the chase one user told the post while others described it as the best straight hook up app and better than the other sites when it comes to no strings attached hook ups we wanted an easy way to find sex basically sidorenko the founder said not pictured finding a gem on here requires a lot of vetting and hard work but they do exist said one user a good experience for one user was meeting up with a man who wanted extremely strict dom daddy little girl role play after enjoying some bubble tea they had sex in a kind of public spot in central park at night another female user who was bored with her married sex life met up with a man at a hotel ultimately though the app is about finding sex without small talk i used to be an active user of different dating sites and i was always bored with the idea that you need to talk with people to understand what they are up to right now sidorenko told business insider i hated all the endless chatting that was going on with pure we want to make this as instant as possible like getting a cab he went on he learned that there were women who wanted that too but he insists apps designed for that like ashley madison and adult friend finder were sketchy
listen to this article listen to this article the day before the u s house of representatives voted to approve h r 5376 referred to as president joe biden s build back better reconciliation bill the state chamber and other chambers of commerce in oklahoma signed on to a letter urging members of congress to reject the measure while supporters of the measure claim the bill will create jobs and lower taxes the chambers of commerce and industry associations nationwide that signed the letter claim the measure would harm economic recovery this is quite simply the greatest investment in american families in generations house budget chairman john yarmuth d ky said in a statement released friday morning announcing the reconciliation bill had passed the house it will lower costs lower taxes and ease the mounting financial burdens of everyday life in the 21st century yarmuth said millions of good jobs will be created and we will finally give the climate crisis the resources and attention necessary to save the planet there is virtually no american trying to get ahead whose life will not be improved by the build back better act in the coming months and for decades to come the 1 75 trillion bill includes funding for child care assistance universal pre school caps on prescription drug costs under medicare investment in affordable housing extends the recent expansion of the child tax credit and earned income tax credit and a host of other provisions for addressing climate change the administration claims the spending would be offset by raising taxes on the wealthiest americans members of oklahoma s delegation all republicans voted against the measure which passed largely along party lines 220 to 213 although president joe biden has repeatedly claimed his social spending bill would be fully paid for that is not the case said u s rep tom cole r okla according to the congressional budget office s nonpartisan full cost estimate received just hours before the vote the legislation would not only levy massive taxes on the american people but it would increase the deficit by nearly 400 billion over the next 10 years and on top of all that if every program contained in the bill were made permanent the actual cost would be at least 4 trillion the congressional budget office estimated the legislation would increase the federal deficit by 367 billion over the next decade not counting the irs savings the bill is estimated to provide the reconciliation bill includes 80 billion to increase irs tax enforcement enabling the agency to collect an additional 207 billion in new revenue over the decade when factoring in the irs savings the deficit increase was estimated at 160 billion for the decade not only would this bill implement trillions in reckless spending and allow for more government control of our lives but it also contains a wish list of controversial provisions including expanding the irs and granting mass amnesty and taxpayer funded benefits to millions of illegal immigrants cole said today s exercise and passage of the build back better act wasn t about making smart thoughtful policy decisions that better serve the american people said u s rep frank lucas r okla regretfully today s exercise was about using gimmicks to dramatically increase the size and scope of the federal government and further burdening our children s children with an unforgiveable sum of debt at a time when energy costs are skyrocketing it s troubling that this bill rejects an all of the above approach to energy research and instead focuses almost entirely on climate change buzzwords lucas said furthermore the bill ignores the needs of rural america from rural broadband to producer assistance to detrimental tax policy the needs of family farms are being neglected and left to wither the letter sent by chambers of commerce from all over the u s including the state chamber and chambers of broken arrow claremore edmond poteau and the tulsa regional chamber said the reconciliation bill would add to rather than reduce challenges confronting america s employers economic experts agree that the initial spending and transfer payments will add to near term inflationary pressures further harming american families and businesses who are already suffering from higher prices on everything from food to energy the letter reads the proposed tax increases including a new corporate minimum tax on book income a new tax on stock buybacks and tax increases on u s business income earned abroad will harm the recovery and hamstring america as we work to compete globally especially with china the bill aims to pay for its spending with taxes targeted at corporations and households making more than 400 000 per year the measure would close a backdoor roth tax loophole used to avoid income and savings limits that apply to roth individual retirement accounts and require individuals with more than 10 million in retirement savings to draw down their accounts each year companies that report over 1 billion in profits to shareholders would have to pay at least a 15 tax rate on profits the bill would impose a 1 excise tax on publicly traded u s corporations for the value of their stock buybacks the reconciliation bill would impose a 5 surtax on individuals with incomes over 10 million and an extra 3 surtax on incomes over 25 million which applies to the richest 0 02 percent of taxpayers the bill would also overturn nearly 90 years of labor law to tilt the playing field in favor of unions by threatening employers of all sizes with bankruptcy inducing civil penalties that do not exist in current law the letter from the chambers of commerce reads we urge you to oppose the reconciliation bill as currently drafted and instead turn your attention to addressing the challenges holding back our economic recovery the letter reads the measure next heads to the senate where democrats and republicans hold equal numbers and tie votes can be broken by a vote from the vice president kamala harris
