paris afp in the extravagant world of the french luxury industry brands used to prefer destroying their unsold goods rather than offering their high priced products at a discount but gone are the days of binning the coats handbags and shoes pooh poohed by shoppers after a new anti waste law came into force at the start of the year now luxury houses are managing their stocks more carefully offering deals to staff making donations and recycling goods it s a subject that has become important today said luxury goods expert at the cultz consulting agency julie el ghouzzi she pointed to the scandal that engulfed burberry in 2018 after the british luxury brand disclosed that it had destroyed gbp28 million of unsold goods in 2017 the equivalent of 20 000 of its trench coats following the firestorm the revelation triggered burberry announced it would halt the practice from the following year markdowns to move goods are not an option in the luxury business as lower prices can undermine the attractiveness of their labels which thrive on their elite status in the luxury sector if the price tag is lower so is the desire to buy it said el ghouzzi luxury houses are paying more attention to the subject now said portfolio manager at paris based asset manager flornoy arnaud cadart mentalities have changed we re no longer in an economy that values unbridled creation above all else he said also gone is the mentality that if it doesn t work we ll destroy it said cadart now luxury houses strive to fine tune their stocks the kering group which owns the gucci saint laurent and balenciaga labels among others has invested in artificial intelligence ai to better manage its stock at its competitor lvmh the world s largest luxury group that includes louis vuitton dior and celine among many others environmental development director helene valade said the luxury business model is closely adjusted to demand with low levels of stock being held by the firms nevertheless she acknowledged that the new law will push luxury houses to learn even more about their clients to better anticipate their purchases and thus reduce stocks to a minimum el ghouzzi said louis vuitton is already quite good at keeping track of its stock when there are nevertheless unsold goods selling them to staff at advantageous prices is one option these large fashion groups have large staffs with more than 150 000 employees at lvmh 38 000 at kering and 16 600 at hermes gifts to associations is another option lvmh has a partnership with cravate solidaire an association that collects donations of professional clothing and provides it to people with disadvantaged backgrounds trying to land jobs designers have also begun to make use of discarded or leftover materials a practice often called upcycling previously a designer with a brilliant idea would go search for materials to realise their idea lvmh s valade told afp today the process is sometimes the reverse there are certain designers who start with the materials at hand old collections unused fabric hanging about leftover bits of leather and it inspires them she said this was the case for late american designer virgil abloh who was the artistic director of louis vuitton s menswear collection from 2018 until his death in 2021 marc jacobs in new york works with fabscrap which recycles unused fabric to create insulation or products like furniture lining or donates it to students and artists to use for their creations lvmh also has a partnership with weturn which collects unsold clothing and material to recycle it into new thread and fabric
oil supply is expected to increase considerably during the course of 2022 providing tankers with a much needed support in its latest weekly report shipbroker gibson said that the decision by opec to raise output by another 400kbd in march came as little surprise to the oil market which had largely priced in further modest output increases from the group it took ministers just 16 minutes to sign off on the 400kbd uplift yet even with this the fact remains that the wider opec group pumped 790kbd below target in december yet despite these shortcomings the international energy agency iea calculates that if opec maintains its current strategy through this year then oil supply is primed for a 6 2mbd increase in 2022 which if delivered would represent the largest ever annual increase in oil supply according to gibson this year opec members are projected to contribute 4 4mbd to global supplies but this task is not without its challenges in recent months opec production has failed to achieve planned output with nigeria and angola collectively pumping 740kbd below their combined target in december accounting for 94 of the group s underperformance whilst these countries may be able to raise output marginally they are unlikely to be a major contributor of opec production growth in the short term further the current quota framework does not allow for underproduction in one country to be compensated by another member which could prevent opec from hitting their collective output target however whilst production growth in west africa might face some headwinds in the middle east most major producers have ample spare capacity to raise output indeed saudi arabia kuwait the uae and iraq all have sustainable spare capacity and will all receive a quota boost in may totalling 1 13mbd giving the potential for a significant increase in regional crude exports should these producers choose to do so outside of the core opec group russia should attain pre pandemic output this year and also receives a quota boost of 500kbd in may contributing another chunk to the oil supply picture later in 2022 the next major source of supply growth comes from the united states where production is forecast to grow by 1mbd this is evidenced by the higher capex budgets of exxon and chevron which have announced plans to raise permian output by 25 and 10 respectively in 2022 further south brazil will add 150kbd whilst exxonmobil could start production at guyana s fpso liza unity this month liza unity will gradually ramp up to its capacity of 220kbd and is twice the size of the existing fpso liza destiny the shipbroker said gibson added that the iea s forecast does seem optimistic and has a number of key dependencies but nevertheless paints a positive demand story for tankers given the increase of 6 2mbd sits above the iea s projection of a 3 2mbd demand increase supply is once again expected to exceed demand later this year suggesting countries will build stocks however the current structure in oil futures and high flat prices will deter stock building indeed whilst the iea see opec output growing by 4 4mbd their 2022 call on opec output sits just 1 8mbd higher than last year suggesting actual demand for opec crude may be lower than the intended supply increases however none of these figures account for iran which is perhaps the biggest sensitivity aside from developments in ukraine a potential return of iranian supply would provide upside to middle east exports whilst also likely to accelerate scrapping activity overall tankers can expect a healthy increase in oil supply during 2022 even if the latest forecasts prove to be too optimistic whilst arguably the geopolitical stage is the tensest in decades the shipbroker concluded nikos roussanoglou hellenic shipping news worldwide

china have never been easy bedfellows with the histories of the development of their regimes following parallel paths but with significant differences we now see russia supplying china with natural gas at preferential rates while it ramps up prices into europe stoking inflation and pressurising the eu in many ways china is enjoying the benefits of its newly cemented alliance as russia punishes

produced a critical report on the technology of standard lithium mkt cap c 1 1bn standard lithium have described the short report as false and misleading previously a report by blue orca claimed the actual recovery rate from the company s arkansas facility was magnitudes lower than company claims standard lithium claims this report is full of inaccuracies and misunderstandings we note that standard lithium is using a a novel osmotically assisted high pressure reverse osmosis hpro unit to concentrate the licl solution prior to carbonation they say this hpro unit was successfully integrated into the plant and has been operating according to design criteria since september 2021 and consistently producing licl solutions containing approximately 7 000 mg l lithium we are not going to give any opinion on standard lithium or its processes however we are not aware of any lithium company that has proven dle direct lithium extraction technology in anything other than pilot scale to date we note sqm and albemarle extract lithium after the concentration of already high grade brines in the atacama in chile in a process which is sensitive to the chemistry of the brines and their concentrate while we can see dle works in process plants in certain circumstances but we suspect there are still be significant issues to overcome before dle sees commercial reality this is down to the chemistry consistency and concentration of the lithium bearing brines input into the process rio tinto s proposed 825m acquisition of rincon is interesting and if completed rios will throw significant hydrometallurgical expertise at the project to raise production rates we are hopeful that certain projects have sufficiently clean chemistry to enable dle commercialisation but in the

by anshuman daga singapore reuters after years of struggling to emerge from the shadows of regional rivals singapore exchange otc is looking to establish itself as the hub for blank cheque firms riding on regulatory overhaul support by state firms and a tech boom in its back yard encouraged by the flurry of southeast asian tech start ups seeking funding and the bourse s revised rules singapore could list up to a dozen special purpose acquisition companies spacs within the next 12 18 months bankers venture capitalists and analysts say a key test for sgx will come when such companies also known as blank cheque or shell firms have to seal merger targets within two years a de spacing process already weighing on u s deals as hundreds of spacs chase targets analysts say singapore faces a challenge to get its traditionally risk averse investors interested in a new asset class especially after sgx has met with limited success in its previous attempts to shore up its equity market in contrast large international institutions have turned to hong kong for blockbuster equity listings over the past decade while a craze in spacs has fizzled out in the united states since early 2021 amid regulatory scrutiny and poor returns sgx hosted three spacs last month in their first major debut in asia the attraction is that they are simpler and typically more rewarding for startups than an ipo looking at the response for the first spacs the pipeline is very strong said eng kwok seat moey capital markets head at dbs joint issue manager on two spac ipos with credit suisse six singapore spacs are likely to chase targets in fintech tech and consumer sectors bankers say valuations of targets could range between s 800 million 596 million to up to s 2 billion with dealmaking likely as early as this year the size of the opportunity of younger companies scaling up and going for listings is several times what it was many years ago and over the next decade it ll be multiples of those said ashish wadhwani a singapore based managing partner at ivycap ventures an indian firm managing about 400 million of assets last year fundraising on sgx halved to 565 million a six year low with just eight listings refinitiv data shows underlying singapore s cautious approach state investor temasek linked entities featured among cornerstone investors in two of the three spacs all of which were oversubscribed vertex nasdaq venture holdings a temasek subsidiary and one of southeast asia s largest funds was the first to launch a s 200 million tech spac in january cautious start i expect the exchange and regulators to be quite careful in all these processes i don t think they will suddenly just open up the floodgates and everybody can come said chua kee lock ceo of vertex which manages 5 1 billion of assets backers of regional tech and industrial buyout fund novo tellus s 150 million spac included a temasek unit european asset manager tikehau capital which has two europe listed spacs also chose singapore for a s 170 million spac listing with co sponsors including lvmh chairman bernard arnault the latest moves could lead to more global funds playing an active role in public equity markets in singapore which is already a leading asian finance and wealth hub it s a chicken and egg situation maybe if you create this spac market then more investors will come wadhwani said spacs typically offer stock with warrants which are viewed as a key way to attract early investors still for wealthy investors such as prantik mazumdar the listing of big regional names in singapore and successful business mergers of spacs are crucial before he chooses them over directly investing in pre ipo u s tech companies unless there are exclusive opportunities in specific sectors and differentiated structures that spacs offer i m probably on the fence mazumdar said in 2010 sgx deliberated on spacs but didn t get favourable market feedback last year it launched a spac framework with a focus on scrutinising track record of sponsors it required them to invest in their spacs and unlike in hong kong sgx allowed participation from retail investors a spac listing can definitely help a start up exit and raise funds faster with less hassle said chandra tjan co founder of indonesia focussed alpha jwc ventures last year singapore also announced two funds with s 2 billion in capital for late stage funding and ipos as dealmaking surges twenty private companies in southeast asia joined the ranks of those valued at 1 billion or more in 2021 while 53 firms joined the list of those with near term potential of being valued at 1 billion data from research firm tracxn shows fundamentally the benchmark to be a sponsor in singapore is higher between the capital requirements and the willingness to embrace independent directors who will decide the de spac said neil parekh ceo of pegasus asia the tikehau backed singapore spac singapore s success as a global hub for real estate investment trusts reits could be a template to build a spac market singapore has the necessary ingredients to build a healthy spacs market and it can develop in the same way as the reit market if we keep a close watch over the quality of sponsors and maintain overall listing standards said mohamed nasser ismail sgx s head of equity capital

federal reserve chair jerome powell s stance on the current economy as very different than the last time the fed hiked rates raised fears about a more aggressive hawkish cycle and a potential 50 basis point rate hike as soon as march but several fed presidents came out last week with a go slow message and one said a 50 basis point rate hike is not their initial preference the risk of the fed surprising the market with more aggressive action at some point in 2022 isn t going to be ruled out and stocks are likely to remain volatile a few weeks ago when fed chair jerome powell was asked at his post fomc meeting press conference whether a 50 basis point rate hike was on table he did what a fed chair is supposed to do he wouldn t rule it out and stuck to his more general talking points which are more hawkish about the economy being stronger than the last time the fed began a tightening cycle we fully appreciate that this is a different situation if you look back to where we were in 2015 16 17 18 when we were raising rates inflation was very close to 2 percent even below 2 percent unemployment was not at our estimates of natural rate and growth was you know in the 2 to 3 percent range right now we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and you know more persistently than we would like we have growth even in forecasts even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022 we still see growth higher than substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate and we see a labor market where by so many measures it is historically tight we haven t made to your specific question we really have not addressed those questions and we ll begin to address them as we move into the march meeting and meetings after that at least five times during his press conference powell made a statement about how different the economy is this time and it was so much on his mind that his last reference to the strength of the economy was a reminder to his audience about how many times he had said something to that effect during the press conference get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters market history since world war ii says when the fed starts hiking stock returns will be on average more modest but not necessarily negative and in the months ahead of a fed rate hike the stock market does well with the greater pressure on stocks coming once the hikes actually begin this year has not followed that script with a terrible january and even though last week the s p 500 rebounded it is still down more than 5 year to date and the dow jones industrial average down by roughly 3 5 as of friday fear of a 50 basis point fed rate hike alongside a wall street scurrying into more hawkishness itself with bank of america now predicting seven rate hikes this year is one factor that has unsettled the market and introduced greater volatility for investors already prepared for a central bank at the end of an easing era but has the fear of a 50 basis point rate hike in march ever been realistic the debate isn t only limited to the u s last week the bank of england voted 5 4 to raise rates by 25 basis points in the fight against inflation four members voted in favor of a 50 basis point increase the odds of a 50 basis point rate hike at the start of a new fed tightening cycle have moved around quite a bit roughly doubling in recent weeks before moving back down when several fed presidents including fed officials known to be more hawkish and more attuned to inflation ahead of peers on the fomc spoke last week about moving gradually even if at the same time they ruled no policy move out prematurely ideally you always want to go gradually kansas city fed president esther george told an audience at the economic club of indiana if the data say that things have evolved in a way that a 50 basis point move is required or be appropriate then i m going to lean into that if moving in successive meetings makes sense i ll be comfortable with that atlanta fed president raphael bostic said in an interview with the ft a week ago a day later bostic told yahoo finance of a 50 basis point hike in march that s not my preferred setting policy action for the next meeting the odds ticked higher again after the big jobs number on friday which defied pessimistic expectations about omicron s impact on hiring though the fed has maintained throughout covid waves that each one has proven to have less of an impact on the economy the recent rate hike history recent fed history does suggest that if the fed moves by 50 basis points it is not likely to be its first move in a hiking cycle a may 2000 increase of 50 basis points came after five bumps of 25 basis points from june 1999 to march 2000 and was the last rate increase of the cycle the 50 and 75 basis point moves in 1994 1995 may august november february came after three bumps of 25 basis points february march and april 1994 as is in the 1999 2000 rate hike cycle these larger moves marked the end of monetary policy tightening according to a review of the moves by datatrek research history says the fed leaves 50 basis point moves or greater for the middle to end of a tightening cycle but remember that chair powell has explicitly said the current environment is different from the past datatrek research s colas wrote in a recent analysis futures are putting low odds on a march 50 bp hike but that could easily change if incoming data shows inflation is still accelerating for john ryding chief economic advisor at brean capital there is a disconnect between the logical case for a 50 basis point hike and actual understanding of how this fed acts starting with the principal that the sooner the fed acts and the more aggressively it acts in the short run the less they have to do in the long run this idea was once an established principal of the central bank which past fed vice chairman alan blinder called the stitch in time philosophy in the 1990s blinder warned that the fed needed to act in anticipation of economic conditions rather than use the bunker hill wait until you see the whites of their eyes approach which is a recipe for failure by the time you see the whites of their eyes they ve already shot you right through the heart you try to save nine by stitching in time blinder said in a 1995 speech but to ryding s mind if the fed were more serious about trying to get ahead of inflation than the market already expected it would have raised rates already not only did the fed pass up the opportunity to raise rates in january which was expected but which a majority of respondents to cnbc s fed survey thought would have been the right move to make given how far behind the fed is on inflation but the fed is still buying bonds in february 30 billion worth ryding noted even with all it already knows about the economic situation if it still isn t willing to say that it is time to stop adding to the balance sheet that doesn t sound to me like a fed ready to raise by 50 basis points he said did the stock market get too hawkish the volatility in stocks and the big rebound last week led by strong earnings in some of the largest technology companies may be a reflection that wall street potentially went too far to other side of the fed monetary policy spectrum too hawkish led by the bank of america call for seven rate hikes and causing too much near term bearishness in the stock market there was good reason for a market overreaction to the fed s own hawkishness it was only last september that the fomc anticipated no rate hikes in 2022 by december only one member thought there would not be a rate hike and the median was three changes are occurring swiftly powell s non answer on a 50 basis point rate hike meanwhile doesn t say anything more than that the process has to play out among fed members powell can t say no we will not do 50 basis points unless you know every members is of that mind it s very difficult so he has to respect the process ryding said but the fact that several top fed officials seemed to downplay a 50 basis point hike last week isn t necessarily a strong signal let alone commentary ryding would define as walking back at all the fed prepares markets for bad news and at this point the market is already prepared for the idea that the central bank is leaning into the idea of doing more rather than less to tame inflation the bank also would never rule out any specific policy move ahead of time and remains data dependent and if it were to end up doing less that is not a change it would feel the need to prepare the market for in advance when it comes to market participants catching up they have a tendency to run from one side of the boat to other and that takes the market with it and that s something of what we saw i will guarantee you if there is any chance of the fed doing 50 basis points we will all be in no doubt about it ryding said the fed has other options too the financial market has too much cash that it doesn t know what to do with and has been giving back to the fed in the reverse repo market and 1 5 trillion in bank reserves more than the banks need all this liquidity has to be soaked up and lots of adjustment on the balance sheet are yet to be made and that balance sheet unwind won t occur at the glacial pace it did last time that won t be case this time ryding said which the fed has made clear is its position though details remain scant the dna of this fed the market s shifting view on a 50 basis point hike in march may continue to move around but being too bearish in the short term doesn t mean the market is not underestimating the degree of monetary restraint that will eventually be needed to rein in inflation even if the fed is of the mind to stick with a 25 basis point hike in march it will come back in may with a much better idea of where the economy is and have the option to pursue a 50 basis point hike at that point if warranted ryding says based on everything we have seen and heard from the fed to date it is much more likely that if they are inclined to go above 25 basis points at any point it isn t before may 50 is just i think out of character for this fed and they have additional strategies ryding said i don t think the adjustment is about doing more than expected at the march meeting it s fleshing out the skeletal details we have on the balance sheet ryding s forecast is four rate hikes this year and if he had to choose between three and five he would lean to five based on his inflation forecast and eventually he does think the fed becomes more hawkish just not yet to come out of the blocks with a 50 basis point rate hike is not in this fed s dna he said and until there is more recognition of the upside risk to inflation as becoming reality in the fed forecast not the base case powell said after the last fomc meeting but with the fed chair nevertheless describing the risk as tilted to the upside policy won t get tighter than expected eventually i do think the fed will have to do more than the market expects but not in the near term ryding said when the vix hit 40 before last week s stock market rebound it was a sign of stocks being oversold but that volatility will remain a feature of the market volatility has to be a theme because we ve been spoon fed for many many years for the best part of the past decade we ve never been surprised and the fed has moved very gradually but now it doesn t know what it will do it s either more now or later for powell a 50 basis point hike in march may be too soon for this fed but it remains the view of economic forecaster joel naroff that unless the inflation numbers decline sharply the fed will have to get more aggressive than expected at some point with businesses having pricing power for the first time in decades they are not likely to give it up easily which increases the potential for a significant misreading on inflation if cpi and other inflation readings stay at the current level the fed would be responsible if they started signaling we will be on top of this and the simplest way is by going 50 basis points whether in march or june he says to his mind if the fed follows through on the expectation of a 25 basis point hike in march it only means that there is a higher probability that the 50 basis point rate hike comes later i ve been thinking they need to do more than simply say the economy is different and we have a strong economy naroff said referencing fed chair powell s recent post fomc comments that were interpreted as broadly more hawkish he has provided the ability for the members who want to do more than 25 basis points to come out he said naroff thinks the 50 basis move is the right one to more quickly correct the mistakes made by the fed during the transitory inflation period they could dispel all of the questions by simply going 50 basis points he said in fact if the fed moved quicker and sooner they might be able to do a lower number of total rate hikes everyone has the belief they have to go each quarter but i m hoping the fed at some point does something that is classified as off meeting naroff said powell said there is plenty of room to move and not the hurt economy so why take three years to get to 3 when we have a strong economy and inflation that should be a message the market should have received a long time ago he said to his mind whether the fed does 100 basis points or 125 basis points of hikes this year and whether in 25 basis point increments or more is largely irrelevant the point is that this is not the end and he made that pretty clear naroff said i just think 50 basis points is a stronger statement last friday s jobs number reinforces the view that the next inflation number or two may push the fed into more of a hawkish corner but the latest fed presidents comments do show that they seem to be more unified in a go slowly posture for now but after that first move all the bets do come off and they can go in any direction they want naroff said the bottom line is more volatility as grant thornton chief economic diane swonk concluded after the fomc meeting and whether up or down stocks have remained volatile in trading since then the fed has completed its pivot from being patient to panicked on inflation its next move will be to raise rates soon after it will be looking to reduce its massive balance sheet to amplify shifts in short term rates and ease the transition for the broader economy that sounds nice in theory but it has never actually been done making matters worse will be how heated the debate within the fed gets as the fomc decides how best to calibrate tightening brace yourselves for dissents and the dissonance that creates for financial markets in the year ahead swonk wrote

interest rates are expected to rise more than once in 2022 which means it will cost more to borrow money unlike in normal years pricier loans probably won t come with the tradeoff of higher savings yields this time around either gobankingrates top picks best savings accounts of 2022 and more best checking accounts of 2022 so if you want to grow your bank account in 2022 you can t rely on your bank account to do it for you the good news though is there s plenty you can do on your own to help your funds put on a little extra weight this year and keep it on this time start with the basics budget and automate you can t do your bank account any favors until you take inventory of what s coming in and what s going out of your financial life create a budget said blaine thiederman a cfp and the founder of progress wealth management an easy way to do this is by signing up for a free budgeting tool online like mint com or creating your own budget with spreadsheet software like excel or google sheets why awareness of how much you re spending and where your money is going makes it easier to adjust the way you spend like many experts thiederman recommends automating your savings but he offers a unique strategy that could be especially useful for cash strapped families that can t find room in their tight budgets to save money create a separate bank account that you have limited access to log into your payroll account through your employer and adjust your deposit to put 1 into the new bank account said thiederman spend whatever s deposited into your normal account not the external one once it feels easy to live on what s left increase that 1 to 2 2 to 3 etc i ve had a lot of my clients utilize this method and they ve all experienced success learn one third of people have 100 or less in their checking accounts survey shows here s how much experts say you should actually have make sure you re banking at the right bank if it s been a while since you ve taken a look at your current bank s competition now is an excellent time to see what else is out there one of the best ways to grow your bank accounts in 2022 is to review your current bank s interest rates and any fees and charges related to your accounts then shop around to see where you can get a better deal said karen condor a finance expert with us insurance agents this is a great time to comparison shop banks in the wake of bank of america and wells fargo slashing and ending fees for overdraft accounts those moves are pressuring other banks to take similar steps remember that you don t necessarily have to select one financial institution for all of your accounts you can pick one bank that s best for the type of checking account you need and another bank for the best type of savings account that you want related all the steps you need to take to switch banks eliminate debt it s true that you need to have a cushion of savings to stand between you and financial catastrophe once you achieve that however you should commit every other dollar you can spare to severing the ball and chain that s holding you back first and foremost the best way to grow your bank account is to pay off your debt said katelynn sortino a freelance financial writer and owner of the site cross culture love i know this sounds counterintuitive but over time you re going to waste so much time and money paying high interest rates don t even bother having more than a simple emergency savings until you have all of your debts paid off because you re just working against your long term financial health when all of your money is going towards interest payments do yourself a favor pay off your debt first and then save it s my belief that you don t actually have savings when you have debt control your money 35 useless expenses you need to slash from your budget now or at least consolidate it eliminating debt is an easy thing to suggest and a hard thing to do in 2022 you can start by gathering your high interest debt from your credit cards if you re like most people into one loan that costs less to finance over time try to apply for a lower interest loan to pay off your consolidated debt said jeffrey zhou co founder and ceo of fig loans you ll reduce the interest you have to pay and you ll be debt free much sooner the average interest rate for a personal loan is 9 09 according to the fed s most recent data that s hardly free money but considering the average credit card rate is 16 44 consolidation might let you steer a whole lot of cash that you would have spent on finance charges into your bank account instead tips what not to do while trying to get out of debt create a cd ladder to boost yields without tying up cash savings rates are so low that yields are barely noticeable even if you have thousands of dollars in your account the big gains are in stocks but many experts expect the market to cool this year as interest rates rise in between are savings vehicles like cds which generally deliver the highest guaranteed returns a bank can offer certificates of deposit are interest bearing savings accounts that can be held for a period of time said jared bauman co founder and ceo of 201 creative you re allowing your money to grow while in this account until the cd matures if you want to keep your original deposit and the interest it has accrued you can do so or you can transfer it to another cd one strategy for maximizing gains while increasing access to cash you might nee is to create a cd ladder which puts money into cds with different term lengths and frequently renews short term cds to cds with longer terms and higher rates with rising interest rates in mind you could transfer maturing cds with lower rates into cds with a better annual percentage yield said bauman in the meantime even if interest rates fall you can still benefit from the higher rates on your older cds until they mature more from gobankingrates this article originally appeared on gobankingrates com the 5 fastest ways to grow your bank account according to experts

from may 13 2017 followup to isis the mob and trump more history than we knew as we have been closely examining the russian mafia ties of the trump administration felix sater sheferovsky keeps coming up the film below describes sater as known by the fbi to be a syndicate crime boss for simeon mogilevich moscow organized crime family sater s father michael sheferovsky worked for mogilevich one of the top ten of the fbi most wanted three of mogilevich s syndicate members lived at trump tower sater s father was arrested for extortion for forcing brooklyn entrepreneurs to pay him in 1991 sater stabbed someone with margarita glass in a bar fight later he becomes involved in financial fraud pumping penny stocks part ii according to the film sater works together with a group of mafia members driving up shares by providing false information the fbi traces him but sater flees to russia when he returns to ny he still stands trial but then something strange happens he is basically on the verge of pleading guilty to those offenses sater closes a deal and becomes an fbi informant he avoids punishment by turning on his accomplices however there is more to the story the very basis of how and why sater was able to avoid prosecution and that lies in the federal court system sater s cooperation allowed for the the illegal concealment of his racketeering conviction to evade millions of dollars of mandatory restitution he owed to the victims of his organized crime stock fraud by itself this is no surprise as it occurred in the eastern district of new york home to jordan belfort the wolf of wall street and other cooperators who like sater got to keep the money and live in luxury while their victims were left to rot according to law 360 but what hasn t been explained before is that sater also used and was allowed by the government to use the concealment of his conviction to fraudulently induce banks partners and investors into parting with nearly a billion dollars to finance trump branded projects which if successful would have paid the trump organization a hundred million dollars and laundered a quarter billion dollars of the share of profits expected by bayrock group llc sater s company outside of the country to evade taxation much of the fraud took place between 2003 and 2010 with the chargeable knowledge and facilitation of loretta lynch now u s attorney general leslie caldwell now assistant u s attorney general for the criminal division and her now designated second in command marshall miller all of whom came out of the edny u s attorney s office and with the knowledge and facilitation of the federal judges of the eastern and southern districts of new york and the court of appeals for the second circuit it s bad enough that sater and others acting with him committed and were allowed to commit hundreds of millions of dollars of bank real estate mail wire and tax fraud and money laundering and extortion as a reward for his ostensible cooperation in other cases how much worse is it that even after 2010 by which time the government admits sater s usefulness as a cooperator had ended he was allowed to continue to get away with it insofar as the author his client his client s clients and others who learned the truth of all this almost six years ago have been threatened ever since with criminal prosecution if we tell anyone what we learned even though we learned it lawfully from private records sater had kept at his firm and then abandoned when he left and from public records which couldn t be made to disappear because they were in the custody of congress indeed one such order a hyper injunction issued against us ex parte by the second circuit not only without a hearing but literally without findings forbad us from telling congress what we knew and from telling congress or anyone else of that order itself according to the documentary above zembla the dubious friends of donald trump the russians it was rumored that sater helped american intelligence services by providing information on stinger missiles being sold to the taliban so the american government agreed to cover up court transcripts about the fraud sater then later appears as managing director of bayrock while banks and investors do not find out about his criminal past and connections to the russian mafia former bayrock attorney fred oberlander at the 20 minute mark of the video says that by keeping sater s past a secret bayrock committed a felony it isn t legal to run a business where you hide the fact that where one of the biggest owners is a convicted mobster the maximum jail term would be 30 years unless of course this is routine practice of the courts concealing criminal proceedings in exchange for cooperation as is the case with sater bayrock knew in 2007 about sater s criminal activity and confirmed in emails sited in the film the legal council at the time wrote about the risk that felix s past would be uncovered the legal council also wanted sater s name removed from corporate documents threats of exposure are more than on paper law 360 experienced threats that may be common place when confronting members of the russian mafia that have been given a pass for cooperation by the courts threats from the individuals themselves also extend to those who seek to out them in the film oberlander discloses that a bayrock employee told him that sater threatened to kill him he said do you know how many times sater has threatened to kill me he threatened to stab me in the throat if i ever talked oberlander said that he is being threatened by saters associates as well the film discloses that an investor in a bayrock project who accused the company of embezzlement was also threatened he swears that sater has threatened to administer electric shocks to his genitalia to cut off his legs and to leave his dead body in the trunk of his car now is that someone our courts should be protecting from law 360 in sum for years trump partnered with sater through the trump organization and bayrock group llc respectively while sater a secretly convicted racketeer used the illegal concealment of his record to defraud banks into financing trump projects from which trump would have taken enormous sums and the u s treasury would have been defrauded of like amount by profits laundered overseas the crimes committed then covered up are staggering take one example trump soho a monument to organized criminal activity protected by federal courts and attorneys even though it was financed by hundreds of millions of dollars of loans procured from banks that were deceived because of sater s fraudulent concealment of his conviction sater admitted his criminal mens rea confessing to the fbi the u s attorney and judge leo glasser edny that he d defrauded banks for years via bayrock expressing only regret that he couldn t keep doing it after rumors spread about his conviction sater admitted this at his oct 23 2009 sentencing which the government says was in open court and the transcript of which shows he used his real name yet all record of his sentencing then disappeared until forced public by the author and his client all judicial records of the sentencing required to be public in which he confessed that he d committed years of crimes even while ostensibly cooperating in other cases thus violating his cooperation agreement were illegally hidden this wasn t the first time the courts and government knew sater was using the secrecy of his case to defraud five years earlier for example his initial pre sentence report disclosed that he was hiding his conviction from bayrock and that the probation officer had joined with the courts and u s attorney in the concealment before it collapsed financially in 2010 perhaps two hundred million dollars of condominiums had been sold and every sale was felony fraud under new york law the martin act for failure to disclose that sater owned most of the co developer bayrock group llc and was a convicted racketeer those sales were a violation of covenants in the 300 million construction loan which provided that real estate sales fraud would make both tevfik arif bayrock s chairman and the sapir family its financial partner in trump soho jointly liable for the entire otherwise non recourse 300 million loan when in late 2010 trump soho did collapse and istar the public company which had lent the 300 million was about to foreclose on the loan bayrock bailed out arif and the sapirs by arranging for cim an investment firm to buy the loan for 250 million by concealing from cim and istar the truth about sater and the above crimes though by then bayrock had admitted knowing the truth in sworn documents filed under seal in sater s case by then dozens of buyers were suing for unrelated fraud in an action before sdny judge wood as buyers of trump international were suing for fraud in an action before a federal judge in florida none knew till too late that they had rights of rescission based on new york s martin act and florida laws providing such remedies for concealment frauds like sater s bayrock sater sapir and istar escaped the consequences of the fraud while settling plaintiffs received tens of millions less than they should have while cim paid tens of millions more because pleas of the author his client and his client s clients who d learned the truth but had been gagged for months to judges involved to let us tell it were ignored and instead we were threatened and still are with prosecution if we told what we knew and had the project not failed the trump organization would have received a fortune while federal state and city governments would have been defrauded out of a fortune because up to 225 million of its profits were set to be laundered overseas so why are the courts covering up for organized criminals and billion dollar frauds let alone by using illegal secrecy and threats of prosecution against this author and his client according to law 360 one answer is it s the result of concerted efforts of second circuit courts and prosecutors to protect their decades long operation of a covert criminal justice system of secret dockets hidden convictions and protected cooperators allowed to commit crime with impunity so long as they earn their keep p journalist former publisher of the military beat

federal reserve chair jerome powell s stance on the current economy as very different than the last time the fed hiked rates raised fears about a more aggressive hawkish cycle and a potential 50 basis point rate hike as soon as march but several fed presidents came out last week with a go slow message and one said a 50 basis point rate hike is not their initial preference the risk of the fed surprising the market with more aggressive action at some point in 2022 isn t going to be ruled out and stocks are likely to remain volatile a few weeks ago when fed chair jerome powell was asked at his post fomc meeting press conference whether a 50 basis point rate hike was on table he did what a fed chair is supposed to do he wouldn t rule it out and stuck to his more general talking points which are more hawkish about the economy being stronger than the last time the fed began a tightening cycle we fully appreciate that this is a different situation if you look back to where we were in 2015 16 17 18 when we were raising rates inflation was very close to 2 percent even below 2 percent unemployment was not at our estimates of natural rate and growth was you know in the 2 to 3 percent range right now we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and you know more persistently than we would like we have growth even in forecasts even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022 we still see growth higher than substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate and we see a labor market where by so many measures it is historically tight we haven t made to your specific question we really have not addressed those questions and we ll begin to address them as we move into the march meeting and meetings after that at least five times during his press conference powell made a statement about how different the economy is this time and it was so much on his mind that his last reference to the strength of the economy was a reminder to his audience about how many times he had said something to that effect during the press conference feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here market history since world war ii says when the fed starts hiking stock returns will be on average more modest but not necessarily negative and in the months ahead of a fed rate hike the stock market does well with the greater pressure on stocks coming once the hikes actually begin this year has not followed that script with a terrible january and even though last week the s p 500 rebounded it is still down more than 5 year to date and the dow jones industrial average down by roughly 3 5 as of friday fear of a 50 basis point fed rate hike alongside a wall street scurrying into more hawkishness itself with bank of america now predicting seven rate hikes this year is one factor that has unsettled the market and introduced greater volatility for investors already prepared for a central bank at the end of an easing era but has the fear of a 50 basis point rate hike in march ever been realistic the debate isn t only limited to the u s last week the bank of england voted 5 4 to raise rates by 25 basis points in the fight against inflation four members voted in favor of a 50 basis point increase the odds of a 50 basis point rate hike at the start of a new fed tightening cycle have moved around quite a bit roughly doubling in recent weeks before moving back down when several fed presidents including fed officials known to be more hawkish and more attuned to inflation ahead of peers on the fomc spoke last week about moving gradually even if at the same time they ruled no policy move out prematurely ideally you always want to go gradually kansas city fed president esther george told an audience at the economic club of indiana if the data say that things have evolved in a way that a 50 basis point move is required or be appropriate then i m going to lean into that if moving in successive meetings makes sense i ll be comfortable with that atlanta fed president raphael bostic said in an interview with the ft a week ago a day later bostic told yahoo finance of a 50 basis point hike in march that s not my preferred setting policy action for the next meeting the odds ticked higher again after the big jobs number on friday which defied pessimistic expectations about omicron s impact on hiring though the fed has maintained throughout covid waves that each one has proven to have less of an impact on the economy the recent rate hike history recent fed history does suggest that if the fed moves by 50 basis points it is not likely to be its first move in a hiking cycle a may 2000 increase of 50 basis points came after five bumps of 25 basis points from june 1999 to march 2000 and was the last rate increase of the cycle the 50 and 75 basis point moves in 1994 1995 may august november february came after three bumps of 25 basis points february march and april 1994 as is in the 1999 2000 rate hike cycle these larger moves marked the end of monetary policy tightening according to a review of the moves by datatrek research history says the fed leaves 50 basis point moves or greater for the middle to end of a tightening cycle but remember that chair powell has explicitly said the current environment is different from the past datatrek research s colas wrote in a recent analysis futures are putting low odds on a march 50 bp hike but that could easily change if incoming data shows inflation is still accelerating for john ryding chief economic advisor at brean capital there is a disconnect between the logical case for a 50 basis point hike and actual understanding of how this fed acts starting with the principal that the sooner the fed acts and the more aggressively it acts in the short run the less they have to do in the long run this idea was once an established principal of the central bank which past fed vice chairman alan blinder called the stitch in time philosophy in the 1990s blinder warned that the fed needed to act in anticipation of economic conditions rather than use the bunker hill wait until you see the whites of their eyes approach which is a recipe for failure by the time you see the whites of their eyes they ve already shot you right through the heart you try to save nine by stitching in time blinder said in a 1995 speech but to ryding s mind if the fed were more serious about trying to get ahead of inflation than the market already expected it would have raised rates already not only did the fed pass up the opportunity to raise rates in january which was expected but which a majority of respondents to cnbc s fed survey thought would have been the right move to make given how far behind the fed is on inflation but the fed is still buying bonds in february 30 billion worth ryding noted even with all it already knows about the economic situation if it still isn t willing to say that it is time to stop adding to the balance sheet that doesn t sound to me like a fed ready to raise by 50 basis points he said did the stock market get too hawkish the volatility in stocks and the big rebound last week led by strong earnings in some of the largest technology companies may be a reflection that wall street potentially went too far to other side of the fed monetary policy spectrum too hawkish led by the bank of america call for seven rate hikes and causing too much near term bearishness in the stock market there was good reason for a market overreaction to the fed s own hawkishness it was only last september that the fomc anticipated no rate hikes in 2022 by december only one member thought there would not be a rate hike and the median was three changes are occurring swiftly powell s non answer on a 50 basis point rate hike meanwhile doesn t say anything more than that the process has to play out among fed members powell can t say no we will not do 50 basis points unless you know every members is of that mind it s very difficult so he has to respect the process ryding said but the fact that several top fed officials seemed to downplay a 50 basis point hike last week isn t necessarily a strong signal let alone commentary ryding would define as walking back at all the fed prepares markets for bad news and at this point the market is already prepared for the idea that the central bank is leaning into the idea of doing more rather than less to tame inflation the bank also would never rule out any specific policy move ahead of time and remains data dependent and if it were to end up doing less that is not a change it would feel the need to prepare the market for in advance when it comes to market participants catching up they have a tendency to run from one side of the boat to other and that takes the market with it and that s something of what we saw i will guarantee you if there is any chance of the fed doing 50 basis points we will all be in no doubt about it ryding said the fed has other options too the financial market has too much cash that it doesn t know what to do with and has been giving back to the fed in the reverse repo market and 1 5 trillion in bank reserves more than the banks need all this liquidity has to be soaked up and lots of adjustment on the balance sheet are yet to be made and that balance sheet unwind won t occur at the glacial pace it did last time that won t be case this time ryding said which the fed has made clear is its position though details remain scant the dna of this fed the market s shifting view on a 50 basis point hike in march may continue to move around but being too bearish in the short term doesn t mean the market is not underestimating the degree of monetary restraint that will eventually be needed to rein in inflation even if the fed is of the mind to stick with a 25 basis point hike in march it will come back in may with a much better idea of where the economy is and have the option to pursue a 50 basis point hike at that point if warranted ryding says based on everything we have seen and heard from the fed to date it is much more likely that if they are inclined to go above 25 basis points at any point it isn t before may 50 is just i think out of character for this fed and they have additional strategies ryding said i don t think the adjustment is about doing more than expected at the march meeting it s fleshing out the skeletal details we have on the balance sheet ryding s forecast is four rate hikes this year and if he had to choose between three and five he would lean to five based on his inflation forecast and eventually he does think the fed becomes more hawkish just not yet to come out of the blocks with a 50 basis point rate hike is not in this fed s dna he said and until there is more recognition of the upside risk to inflation as becoming reality in the fed forecast not the base case powell said after the last fomc meeting but with the fed chair nevertheless describing the risk as tilted to the upside policy won t get tighter than expected eventually i do think the fed will have to do more than the market expects but not in the near term ryding said when the vix hit 40 before last week s stock market rebound it was a sign of stocks being oversold but that volatility will remain a feature of the market volatility has to be a theme because we ve been spoon fed for many many years for the best part of the past decade we ve never been surprised and the fed has moved very gradually but now it doesn t know what it will do it s either more now or later for powell a 50 basis point hike in march may be too soon for this fed but it remains the view of economic forecaster joel naroff that unless the inflation numbers decline sharply the fed will have to get more aggressive than expected at some point with businesses having pricing power for the first time in decades they are not likely to give it up easily which increases the potential for a significant misreading on inflation if cpi and other inflation readings stay at the current level the fed would be responsible if they started signaling we will be on top of this and the simplest way is by going 50 basis points whether in march or june he says to his mind if the fed follows through on the expectation of a 25 basis point hike in march it only means that there is a higher probability that the 50 basis point rate hike comes later i ve been thinking they need to do more than simply say the economy is different and we have a strong economy naroff said referencing fed chair powell s recent post fomc comments that were interpreted as broadly more hawkish he has provided the ability for the members who want to do more than 25 basis points to come out he said naroff thinks the 50 basis move is the right one to more quickly correct the mistakes made by the fed during the transitory inflation period they could dispel all of the questions by simply going 50 basis points he said in fact if the fed moved quicker and sooner they might be able to do a lower number of total rate hikes everyone has the belief they have to go each quarter but i m hoping the fed at some point does something that is classified as off meeting naroff said powell said there is plenty of room to move and not the hurt economy so why take three years to get to 3 when we have a strong economy and inflation that should be a message the market should have received a long time ago he said to his mind whether the fed does 100 basis points or 125 basis points of hikes this year and whether in 25 basis point increments or more is largely irrelevant the point is that this is not the end and he made that pretty clear naroff said i just think 50 basis points is a stronger statement last friday s jobs number reinforces the view that the next inflation number or two may push the fed into more of a hawkish corner but the latest fed presidents comments do show that they seem to be more unified in a go slowly posture for now but after that first move all the bets do come off and they can go in any direction they want naroff said the bottom line is more volatility as grant thornton chief economic diane swonk concluded after the fomc meeting and whether up or down stocks have remained volatile in trading since then the fed has completed its pivot from being patient to panicked on inflation its next move will be to raise rates soon after it will be looking to reduce its massive balance sheet to amplify shifts in short term rates and ease the transition for the broader economy that sounds nice in theory but it has never actually been done making matters worse will be how heated the debate within the fed gets as the fomc decides how best to calibrate tightening brace yourselves for dissents and the dissonance that creates for financial markets in the year ahead swonk wrote

by anshuman daga singapore reuters after years of struggling to emerge from the shadows of regional rivals singapore exchange is looking to establish itself as the hub for blank cheque firms riding on regulatory overhaul support by state firms and a tech boom in its back yard encouraged by the flurry of southeast asian tech start ups seeking funding and the bourse s revised rules singapore could list up to a dozen special purpose acquisition companies spacs within the next 12 18 months bankers venture capitalists and analysts say a key test for sgx will come when such companies also known as blank cheque or shell firms have to seal merger targets within two years a de spacing process already weighing on u s deals as hundreds of spacs chase targets analysts say singapore faces a challenge to get its traditionally risk averse investors interested in a new asset class especially after sgx has met with limited success in its previous attempts to shore up its equity market in contrast large international institutions have turned to hong kong for blockbuster equity listings over the past decade while a craze in spacs has fizzled out in the united states since early 2021 amid regulatory scrutiny and poor returns sgx hosted three spacs last month in their first major debut in asia the attraction is that they are simpler and typically more rewarding for startups than an ipo looking at the response for the first spacs the pipeline is very strong said eng kwok seat moey capital markets head at dbs joint issue manager on two spac ipos with credit suisse singapore spacs are likely to chase targets in fintech tech and consumer sectors bankers say valuations of targets could range between s 800 million 596 million to up to s 2 billion with dealmaking likely as early as this year the size of the opportunity of younger companies scaling up and going for listings is several times what it was many years ago and over the next decade it ll be multiples of those said ashish wadhwani a singapore based managing partner at ivycap ventures an indian firm managing about 400 million of assets last year fundraising on sgx halved to 565 million a six year low with just eight listings refinitiv data shows underlying singapore s cautious approach state investor temasek linked entities featured among cornerstone investors in two of the three spacs all of which were oversubscribed vertex venture holdings a temasek subsidiary and one of southeast asia s largest funds was the first to launch a s 200 million tech spac in january cautious start i expect the exchange and regulators to be quite careful in all these processes i don t think they will suddenly just open up the floodgates and everybody can come said chua kee lock ceo of vertex which manages 5 1 billion of assets backers of regional tech and industrial buyout fund novo tellus s 150 million spac included a temasek unit european asset manager tikehau capital which has two europe listed spacs also chose singapore for a s 170 million spac listing with co sponsors including lvmh chairman bernard arnault the latest moves could lead to more global funds playing an active role in public equity markets in singapore which is already a leading asian finance and wealth hub it s a chicken and egg situation maybe if you create this spac market then more investors will come wadhwani said spacs typically offer stock with warrants which are viewed as a key way to attract early investors still for wealthy investors such as prantik mazumdar the listing of big regional names in singapore and successful business mergers of spacs are crucial before he chooses them over directly investing in pre ipo u s tech companies unless there are exclusive opportunities in specific sectors and differentiated structures that spacs offer i m probably on the fence mazumdar said in 2010 sgx deliberated on spacs but didn t get favourable market feedback last year it launched a spac framework with a focus on scrutinising track record of sponsors it required them to invest in their spacs and unlike in hong kong sgx allowed participation from retail investors a spac listing can definitely help a start up exit and raise funds faster with less hassle said chandra tjan co founder of indonesia focussed alpha jwc ventures last year singapore also announced two funds with s 2 billion in capital for late stage funding and ipos as dealmaking surges twenty private companies in southeast asia joined the ranks of those valued at 1 billion or more in 2021 while 53 firms joined the list of those with near term potential of being valued at 1 billion data from research firm tracxn shows fundamentally the benchmark to be a sponsor in singapore is higher between the capital requirements and the willingness to embrace independent directors who will decide the de spac said neil parekh ceo of pegasus asia the tikehau backed singapore spac singapore s success as a global hub for real estate investment trusts reits could be a template to build a spac market singapore has the necessary ingredients to build a healthy spacs market and it can develop in the same way as the reit market if we keep a close

the u s economy created far more jobs than expected in january despite the disruption to consumer facing businesses from a surge in covid 19 cases pointing to underlying strength that should sustain the expansion as the federal reserve starts to raise interest rates the labor department s closely watched employment report on friday also showed a whopping 709 000 more jobs were added in november and december than previously estimated wage gains accelerated last month and the labor pool expanded the upbeat report ended days of anxiety among economists and white house officials who had frantically tried to prepare the nation for a disappointing payrolls number this is a strong jobs report said chris low chief economist at fhn financial in new york the odds of quelling inflation without a recession look better today than yesterday nonfarm payrolls increased by 467 000 jobs last month the survey of establishments showed economists polled by reuters had forecast 150 000 jobs would be added in january estimates ranged from a decrease of 400 000 to a gain of 385 000 jobs employment is 2 9 million jobs below its pre pandemic peak part of the broad increase in payrolls likely reflected low layoffs after the holiday hiring season because of worker shortages though the drop in actual employment in january was in line with prior years there were large differences at the industry level the government also reported that 374 000 more jobs were created in the 12 months through march 2021 than previously reported the labor market resilience could alter expectations that economic growth would slow significantly in the first quarter after consumer spending exited 2021 with a whimper the economy grew at a 6 9 annualized rate in the fourth quarter growth estimates for the first quarter are below a 2 pace strong employment gains accompanied by the biggest annual increase in wages since may 2020 pave the way for the u s central bank to raise interest rates in march by at least 25 basis points to tame high inflation economists expect as many as seven rate hikes this year the report is unequivocally good for the economy but not for markets as the strength in the numbers presents another data point which supports more aggressively hawkish fed action said cliff hodge chief investment officer at cornerstone wealth in charlotte north carolina stocks on wall street were mixed the dollar rose against a basket of currencies u s treasury prices fell labor pool expands economists had been bracing for a weak jobs report as the government surveyed businesses for payrolls in mid january when omicron infections were peaking the labor department said 3 616 million people who had a job were absent during the survey week because of illness workers who are out sick or in quarantine and do not get paid during the payrolls survey period are counted as unemployed in the establishment survey even if they still have a job lower paid hourly workers in industries like healthcare as well as leisure and hospitality who typically do not have paid sick leave bore the brunt of the winter covid 19 wave according to the latest government data paid sick leave was available to 79 of civilian workers in march 2021 the leisure and hospitality industry added 151 000 jobs in january healthcare employment increased by 18 000 there were gains in retail professional and business services employment as well as transportation and warehousing and wholesale trade manufacturing payrolls rose by 13 000 but construction employment fell 5 000 likely because of freezing temperatures government payrolls increased by 23 000 jobs employment could increase further as coronavirus infections continue to subside first time applications for unemployment benefits dropped for a second straight week last week the united states is reporting an average of 354 399 new covid 19 infections a day sharply down from the more than 700 000 in mid january according to a reuters analysis of official data the government introduced new population estimates for the household survey from which the unemployment rate is derived the new assumptions had a negligible effect on the unemployment rate which rose to 4 0 from 3 9 in december the labor force participation rate or the proportion of working age americans who have a job or are looking for one increased to 62 2 due to the changes in the composition of the population from 61 9 in december the workforce increased by 1 393 million people the employment to population ratio rose to 59 7 from 59 5 in december other details of the household survey were strong employment increased by 1 199 million the survey counts people who have a job as employed regardless of whether they got paid during the survey week if they were temporarily absent from their jobs because of illness bad weather vacation labor management disputes or personal reasons a broader measure of unemployment which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part time because they cannot find full time employment dropped to 7 1 from 7 3 in december with some lower hourly paid workers at home wage growth accelerated in january average hourly earnings increased 0 7 which raised the annual increase to 5 7 the largest gain since may 2020 but omicron s surge shortened the average workweek to 34 5 hours

it could still be decades before the impact of the ev revolution begins to be truly felt by the fossil fuel sector oil and gas investors will receive the latest revelation with a bit of trepidation considering that evs are seen as the arch nemesis of the sector ev sales accounted for 8 6 of the global light duty vehicle market compared to just 2 5 in 2019 as per a with the global energy transition in full swing few clean energy sectors if any are expanding faster than the electric car market a decade ago a grand total of 130 000 evs were sold globally fast forward to the present and nearly a similar number are sold in just a week to use a cliché the ev sector has truly been playing chess while everyone else plays checkers with sales of battery electric and plug in hybrid combined more than doubling last year to around 6 6 million vehicles ev sales accounted for 8 6 of the global light duty vehicle market compared to just 2 5 in 2019 as per a new international energy agency report as expected tesla inc nasdaq tsla remains the company to beat in the ev space with the ev kingpin managing global sales of 936 000 units last year tesla sold 352k units in its u s home turf 321k in china 170k in the european market and 93k elsewhere ev sales in the u s totaled 487 560 units in 2021 an 89 y y increase over the 257 872 units sold in 2020 second placed volkswagen ag otcpk vwagy managed to sell 762k units byd company otcpk byddf sold 598k units general motors nyse gm shipped 517k units while stellantis n v nyse stla did 343k units even though tesla remains the world s leading ev manufacturer with 14 2 market share and an even more commanding 65 8 share in the u s the rest of the pack is rapidly closing in bank of america has predicted that tesla s share of u s ev sales will fall from 78 in 2018 to around 20 in 2024 while ihs markit sees tesla with less than 15 of u s sales by 2027 however that massive contraction in market share will not be due to any weakness on tesla s part the company expected to maintain robust growth in the current year but rather due to explosive growth by the ev universe with 146 ev models expected to be available in the u s in 2025 compared to just 24 in 2020 nixing oil demand obviously oil and gas investors will receive the latest revelation with a bit of trepidation considering that evs are seen as the arch nemesis of the sector the latest ev report suggests that the transition from ices to evs is happening at a faster than expected clip perhaps more so due to a flurry of ice giants joining the ev race over the past few years the ev momentum has gone into overdrive thanks to the esg craze and the shift to renewable energy last year marked a fresh high for the ev industry after the global electric car market recorded growth of 41 according to an international energy agency report last year bloomberg news akshat rathi claimed that every f 150 lightning destroys 50 barrels of oil demand forever the f 150 lightning is ford motors nyse f electric equivalent of the marquee ford 150 truck it s becoming a familiar refrain by a cross section of experts including stanford university economist tony seba who went ballistic a few years ago and declared that evs will obliterate the global oil industry by 2030 but how much threat does the ev revolution actually pose for the fossil fuel sector a report from ihs markit shows that in 2020 light plug in and fuel cell vehicles as well as electric city buses and two wheelers collectively displaced about 370 000 barrels per day of global oil consumption a figure that is projected to grow to 1 5 million barrels per day by 2025 equal to about 1 4 of the projected level of total world oil demand source ihs markit electrifying america s vehicles is a critical part of combating climate change considering that the transport sector accounts for 21 of total ghg emissions the burgeoning ev sector is moving full steam ahead but has to contend with a more than century old ice industry bloomberg new energy finance bnef has projected that evs will account for 8 of the global fleet by 2030 and reach 31 of the global fleet by 2040 the new energy research provider also says that it will take at least two decades for ev sales to hit 60 of all new vehicle sales advertisement as dean foreman chief economist at the american petroleum institute has quipped evs can eat into traditional market share for liquid fuels but that s largely a developed economy or rich country issue at this point bloomberg new energy finance estimates that road fuel oil demand will peak in 2027 but it will take another decade for the impact of advancements to be materially felt emissions will almost halve by 2050 but the sector will still be nowhere near net zero in the best case scenario by the 2050s fossil derived road fuel demand will fall below levels last seen in the early 1970s in this case oil related emissions will drop to 3 4 gigatons co2 by 2050 down from almost 6 5gt in 2019 that said the ev sector could end up hurting the oil sector in the long run with bnef predicting that electric and fuel cell vehicles will displace 21 million barrels per day in oil demand by 2050 in other words it s probably going to be decades before the impact of the ev revolution begins to be truly felt by the fossil fuel sector by alex kimani for oilprice com more top

as vaclav smil wrote in his wonderful book titled numbers don t lie the decade of the 1880s were miraculous it was the decade when america built 100 000 kilometers of railroads houses and cities first received electricity elevators made skyscrapers practical the internal combustion engine was invented which made cars possible the first telegraph systems appeared the first practical bicycle was sold coca cola was launched and the wall street journal was first published also read business school rankings 2022 in india business standard b school survey these miraculous inventions also caused enormous business upheaval managers running businesses in this era of transformation required a new set of skills in response to this demand for a new set of skills management programmes were created in the united states some of the earliest management programmes were offered by wharton school established 1881 and harvard business school established 1908 without a doubt management education has evolved over the past hundred years with dramatic changes in the curriculum pedagogy duration and formats an mba was once out of bounds for many people but through the online learning revolution and emeritus partnerships with top tier universities management programmes have become more accessible and affordable to individuals around the world now in 2022 as we navigate a pandemic that has created enormous business upheaval and we are in the midst of new global challenges it is a good time to reimagine the mba reinvent curriculum this will require a reimagining of the mba curriculum to align with global mega trends and not just digital transformation in a world of shrinking and ageing populations mba courses should consider teaching students how to serve ageing populations nearly every mba course in the world teaches students how to appeal to the young but we now live in a world where a large number of people are older and richer but most products and services the world makes are not appropriate for them for instance why don t we have a mainstream mobile phone that is made for older people in a world of inequality it is important study and understand the household p l of people with low incomes along with studying the p l of companies this would probably create a more empathetic business leader who can balance the priorities of shareholders versus employees versus community in a polarized world mba studies should include an unbiased study of economic models beyond capitalism the curriculum should include material that expresses points of view of those who oppose globalization and capitalism the world will require business managers to understand and appreciate a more diverse range of view points to be able to create more equitable business models with the worldwide focus on decarbonization the curriculum should include studies of every aspect of a decarbonized economy from the tech innovations driving it to the business models to the environmental impact of every aspect of the supply chain similar to the changes that have occurred in the past the world s path to decarbonization will not happen only via technology and policy it will need business managers to drive the change by creating products services financial models and operating models that will make a decarbonized world viable and possible for instance making electric cars is relatively easy today but building an ecosystem which includes charging points financing options and making an electric car the preferred choice requires management innovations which will come from mbas most mba students would be unable to point to the straits of malaca on a map the straits carry 25 of world cargo and is just 38 kilometers across at its narrowest point the suez canal carries 18 000 ships a year and its blockage made headline news worldwide the straits of malacca carry a 100 000 ships a year and a blockage would be catastrophic the pandemic has demonstrated how dependent businesses are on supply chains it is important that mba students are taught geo politics and its impact on supply chains and businesses the pandemic has opened up an opportunity for universities to remove dated content in the core subjects and include current and future global content reinvent teaching model the mba teaching model has had classroom teaching in the center with online learning and field immersion via internships and industry projects as supplementary course material it s a great time to invert that model and invent a teaching model that has field immersion online learning at the center supplemented with classroom teaching where required for instance a course on decarbonization may be best served by listening to bill gates decarbonization lectures on youtube rather than attending a classroom and the relevant aspects of leadership communication empathy community related to decarbonization can be best taught in a field immersion reinvent career service the typical mba programme has students who seem to have similar career goals most want to join a startup or become a management consultant or a vc after finishing their mba we should consider reinventing mba career services where recent advances in brain science and data science could be used to enable students to discover the career that is most appropriate for them for instance if a combination of a brain scan and data analysis shows me that i deeply dislike sitting in aircrafts a management consultant s career may not be the right choice for me although this seems obvious it is suprising how many years mba students spend in different careers before finally discovering what really matters to them the key is to enable students to discover themselves once a student understands their own self better they may make better career choices in conclusion mba education is important to society nearly every company on the fortune 500 list has a ceo with an mba and large companies impact our lives in a myriad of ways ensuring that we create mbas that are appropriate to the era we live in will positively impact society the author is ceo india apac consumer emeritus

after years of struggling to emerge from the shadows of regional rivals singapore exchange is looking to establish itself as the hub for blank cheque firms riding on regulatory overhaul support by state firms and a tech boom in its back yard encouraged by the flurry of southeast asian tech start ups seeking funding and the bourse s revised rules singapore could list up to a dozen special purpose acquisition companies spacs within the next 12 18 months bankers venture capitalists and analysts say a key test for sgx will come when such companies also known as blank cheque or shell firms have to seal merger targets within two years a de spacing process already weighing on us deals as hundreds of spacs chase targets analysts say singapore faces a challenge to get its traditionally risk averse investors interested in a new asset class especially after sgx has met with limited success in its previous attempts to shore up its equity market in contrast large international institutions have turned to hong kong for blockbuster equity listings over the past decade while a craze in spacs has fizzled out in the united states since early 2021 amid regulatory scrutiny and poor returns sgx hosted three spacs last month in their first major debut in asia the attraction is that they are simpler and typically more rewarding for startups than an ipo looking at the response for the first spacs the pipeline is very strong said eng kwok seat moey capital markets head at dbs joint issue manager on two spac ipos with credit suisse singapore spacs are likely to chase targets in fintech tech and consumer sectors bankers say valuations of targets could range between s 800 million 596 million to up to s 2 billion with deal making likely as early as this year the size of the opportunity of younger companies scaling up and going for listings is several times what it was many years ago and over the next decade it ll be multiples of those said ashish wadhwani a singapore based managing partner at ivycap ventures an indian firm managing about 400 million of assets last year fundraising on sgx halved to 565 million a six year low with just eight listings refinitiv data shows underlying singapore s cautious approach state investor temasek linked entities featured among cornerstone investors in two of the three spacs all of which were oversubscribed vertex venture holdings a temasek subsidiary and one of southeast asia s largest funds was the first to launch a s 200 million tech spac in january cautious start i expect the exchange and regulators to be quite careful in all these processes i don t think they will suddenly just open up the floodgates and everybody can come said chua kee lock ceo of vertex which manages 5 1 billion of assets backers of regional tech and industrial buyout fund novo tellus s 150 million spac included a temasek unit european asset manager tikehau capital which has two europe listed spacs also chose singapore for a s 170 million spac listing with co sponsors including lvmh chairman bernard arnault the latest moves could lead to more global funds playing an active role in public equity markets in singapore which is already a leading asian finance and wealth hub it s a chicken and egg situation maybe if you create this spac market then more investors will come wadhwani said spacs typically offer stock with warrants which are viewed as a key way to attract early investors still for wealthy investors such as prantik mazumdar the listing of big regional names in singapore and successful business mergers of spacs are crucial before he chooses them over directly investing in pre ipo us tech companies unless there are exclusive opportunities in specific sectors and differentiated structures that spacs offer i m probably on the fence mazumdar said in 2010 sgx deliberated on spacs but didn t get favourable market feedback last year it launched a spac framework with a focus on scrutinising track record of sponsors it required them to invest in their spacs and unlike in hong kong sgx allowed participation from retail investors a spac listing can definitely help a start up exit and raise funds faster with less hassle said chandra tjan co founder of indonesia focussed alpha jwc ventures last year singapore also announced two funds with s 2 billion in capital for late stage funding and ipos as deal making surges twenty private companies in southeast asia joined the ranks of those valued at 1 billion or more in 2021 while 53 firms joined the list of those with near term potential of being valued at 1 billion data from research firm tracxn shows fundamentally the benchmark to be a sponsor in singapore is higher between the capital requirements and the willingness to embrace independent directors who will decide the de spac said neil parekh ceo of pegasus asia the tikehau backed singapore spac singapore s success as a global hub for real estate investment trusts reits could be a template to build a spac market singapore has the necessary ingredients to build a healthy spacs market and it can develop in the same way as the reit market if we keep a close watch over the quality of sponsors and maintain overall listing standards said mohamed nasser ismail sgx s head of equity capital markets read also singapore lists first spac as asia investors warm up to blank check firms
the escalating hysteria from abroad about the imminent russian invasion from abroad is paying the first dividends for the ukrainian leadership it finally broke the implicit embargo on supplying lethal weapons to kyiv the united states was the main country violating the embargo but now a number of nato countries are sending modern military equipment to independent ukraine and this assortment of gifts has significantly grown over the weekend the first batch of weapons from an additional aid package approved by president joe biden arrived in ukraine according to various sources a large boeing 747 cargo plane delivered around 60 to 90 tons of munitions video taken of the loading showed at least 100 of the already familiar javelin anti tank guided missile systems this time however they were supplemented with smaw d anti bunker grenade launchers designed to destroy field fortifications along with light armored vehicles on sunday the same plane took off from the united states with a new shipment this delivery is hardly remarkable as the 200 million package that was approved in early january is not very big since 2014 the united states has provided military assistance in the form of 2 5 billion and aircraft from the united states transportation command that regularly lands in kyiv in the past year the command has already delivered several shipments of javelins but now london is actively involved in the process last week the u k completed a delivery of around 2 000 nlaw anti tank missiles you can t call them a wonder weapon but these smart munitions that operate on the principle of fire and forget are stronger and much more effective than soviet rpg 7 grenades or disposable grenade launchers currently available to ukraine s armed forces we are ready to deliver some of our javelin stock to kyiv and the baltic states the united states allowed the delivery of stinger man portable air defense systems to ukraine for the first time this made kyiv particularly happy everyone remembers how supplying stingers to the afghan mujahedeen created serious problems for soviet aircraft 35 years ago you have to admit that the united states and its closest allies have chosen quite a reasonable strategy for the rapid build up of ukraine s military capability kyiv has not received the complex and expensive weapons systems it demanded but instead it obtained modern high tech infantry weapons that can be mastered and deployed much faster in order to learn how to operate and pilot even relatively uncomplicated f 16 fighters it will take two to three years of training for pilots and ground personnel the situation is only slightly better with heavy armored vehicles which take at least a year to fully master one can be fully trained on atgms and manpads in a month but there is another question is this enough in a hypothetical confrontation with russia saturating the ukrainian armed forces with infantry weapons will hardly affect the balance of power in modern combat such complex systems do not play a decisive role in the confrontation between two regular armies it is no longer the brand of anti tank systems that is important but rather the effectiveness of intelligence communication and decision making systems as well as network centricity and the possibility of hitting targets immediately after detection modern russian aviation has already demonstrated in syria that it operates at an altitude that its stingers cannot reach it is more likely that the munitions are being sent not for direct confrontation with a stronger enemy but for the organization of partisan and semi partisan actions which will allow small groups to inflict painful bites hitting not only armored vehicles but also supply convoys and trucks the united states has had success in providing similar support for allies in in syria the cia and the pentagon supplied moderate groups of religious extremists with the outdated but still effective long range anti tank system tow 2 with american help it was possible to exhaust the government army and deprive it of its main supply of armored vehicles kyiv is now receiving both qualitatively and quantitatively more effective anti tank systems canada has also announced military assistance a 120 million loan will provide new equipment to the territorial defense forces equipment that ukraine had crafted as plywood mock ups of weapons and hunting carbines for submachine and machine guns the older european members of nato such as germany france and italy have not yet joined in pumping kyiv up with weapons berlin still believes this will be counterproductive to a peaceful solution but even without these countries the resources from the united states great britain canada and eastern europe will be enough to quickly and significantly raise the technical level of the ukrainian infantry it is impossible to disagree with the position of old europe a dramatic change in the balance of power between ukraine and the regions that broke away from it will definitely not make a diplomatic solution any more desirable after all the conditions of the minsk agreements are considered to be humiliating and disadvantageous by many in the country s political establishment the powerful supply of modern weapons and the receipt of reliable guarantees from allies about introducing unprecedented sanctions in case russia makes any attempt to intervene in the ukrainian conflict may push kyiv to intensify hostilities against donbass such a situation can be prevented only by giving ukraine the confidence to believe that without the most decisive response from our country there will be no attempt at military revenge

oliver wing carolyn kousky jeremy porter and paul bates for the conversation climate change is raising flood risks in neighborhoods across the u s much faster than many people realize over the next three decades the cost of flood damage is on pace to rise 26 due to climate change alone an analysis of our new flood risk maps shows that s only part of the risk despite recent devastating floods people are still building in high risk areas with population growth factored in we found the increase in u s flood losses will be four times higher than the climate only effect our team develops cutting edge floodrisk maps that incorporate climate change it s the data that drives local risk estimates you re likely to see on real estate websites in the new analysis published jan 31 we estimated where flood risk is rising fastest and who is in harm s way the results show the high costs of flooding and lay bare the inequities of who has to endure america s crippling flood problem they also show the importance of altering development patterns now the role of climate change flooding is the most frequent and costliest natural disaster in the united states and its costs are projected to rise as the climate warms decades of measurements computer models and basic physics all point to increasing precipitation and sea level rise as the atmosphere warms it holds about 7 more moisture for every degree celsius that the temperature rises meaning more moisture is available to fall as rain potentially raising the risk of inland flooding a warmer climate also leads to rising sea levels and higher storm surges as land ice melts and warming ocean water expands yet translating that understanding into the detailed impact of future flooding has been beyond the grasp of existing flood mapping approaches previous efforts to link climate change to flood models offered only a broad view of the threat and didn t zoom in close enough to provide reliable measures of local risk although they could illustrate the general direction of change most local flood maps such as those produced by the federal emergency management agency have a different problem they re based on historical changes rather than incorporating the risks ahead and the government isslow to update them our maps account for flooding from rivers rainfall and the oceans both now and into the future across the entire contiguous united states they are produced at scales that show street by street impacts and unlike fema maps they cover floods of many different sizes from nuisance flooding that may occur every few years to once in a millennium disasters while hazard maps only show where floods might occur our new risk analysis combines that with data on the u s building stock to understand the damage that occurs when floodwaters collide with homes and businesses it s the first validated analysis of climate driven flood risk for the u s the inequity of america s flood problem we estimated that the annual cost of flooding today is over us 32 billion nationwide with an outsized burden on communities in appalachia the gulf coast and the northwest when we looked at demographics we found that today s flood risk is predominantly concentrated in white impoverished communities many of these are in low lying areas directly on the coasts or appalachian valleys at risk from heavy rainfall but the increase in risk as rising oceans reach farther inland during storms and high tides over the next 30 years falls disproportionately on communities with large african american populations on the atlantic and gulf coasts urban and rural areas from texas to florida to virginia contain predominantly black communities projected to see at least a 20 increase in flood risk over the next 30 years historically poorer communities haven t seen as much investment in flood adaptation or infrastructure leaving them more exposed the new data reflecting the cost of damage contradicts a common misconception that flood risk exacerbated by sea level rise is concentrated in whiter wealthier areas our findings raise policy questions about disaster recovery prior research has found that these groups recover less quickly than more privileged residents and that disasters can further exacerbate existing inequities current federal disaster aid disproportionately helps wealthier residents without financial safety nets disasters can be tipping points into financial stress or deeper poverty population growth is a major driver of flood risk another important contributor to flood risk is the growing population as urban areas expand people are building in riskier locations including expanding into existing floodplains areas that were already at risk of flooding even in a stable climate that s making adapting to the rising climate risks even more difficult hurricane harvey made that risk painfully clear when its record rainfall sent two reservoirs spilling into neighborhoods inundating homes that had been built in the reservoirs flood zones that was in 2017 and communities in houston are rebuilding in risky areas again we integrated into our model predictions how and where the increasing numbers of people will live in order to assess their future flood risk the result future development patterns have a four times greater impact on 2050 flood risk than climate change alone on borrowed time if these results seem alarming consider that these are conservative estimates we used a middle of the road trajectory for atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations one in which global carbon emissions peak in the 2040s and then fall importantly much of this impact over the next three decades is already locked into the climate system while cutting emissions now is crucial to slow the rate of sea level rise and reduce future flood risk adaptation is required to protect against the losses we project to 2050 if future development was directed outside of the riskiest areas and new construction met higher standards for flood mitigation some of these projected losses could be avoided in previous research we found that for a third of currently undeveloped u s floodplains it is cheaper to buy the land at today s prices and preserve it for recreation and wildlife than develop it and pay for the inevitable flood damages later the results stress how critical land use and building codes are when it comes to adapting to climate change and managing future losses from increasing climate extremes protecting lives and property will mean moving existing populations out of harm s way and stopping new construction in flood risk areas this essay s authors are researchers at the university of briston the university of pennsylvania and the city university

with the global energy transition in full swing few clean energy sectors if any are expanding faster than the electric car market a decade ago a grand total of 130 000 evs were sold globally fast forward to the present and nearly a similar number are sold in just a week to use a cliché the ev sector has truly been playing chess while everyone else plays checkers with sales of battery electric and plug in hybrid combined more than doubling last year to around 6 6 million vehicles ev sales accounted for 8 6 of the global light duty vehicle market compared to just 2 5 in 2019 as per a new international energy agency report as expected tesla inc nasdaq tsla remains the company to beat in the ev space with the ev kingpin managing global sales of 936 000 units last year tesla sold 352k units in its u s home turf 321k in china 170k in the european market and 93k elsewhere ev sales in the u s totaled 487 560 units in 2021 an 89 y y increase over the 257 872 units sold in 2020 second placed volkswagen ag otcpk vwagy managed to sell 762k units byd company otcpk byddf sold 598k units general motors nyse gm shipped 517k units while stellantis n v nyse stla did 343k units even though tesla remains the world s leading ev manufacturer with 14 2 market share and an even more commanding 65 8 share in the u s the rest of the pack is rapidly closing in bank of america has predicted that tesla s share of u s ev sales will fall from 78 in 2018 to around 20 in 2024 while ihs markit sees tesla with less than 15 of u s sales by 2027 however that massive contraction in market share will not be due to any weakness on tesla s part the company expected to maintain robust growth in the current year but rather due to explosive growth by the ev universe with 146 ev models expected to be available in the u s in 2025 compared to just 24 in 2020 nixing oil demand obviously oil and gas investors will receive the latest revelation with a bit of trepidation considering that evs are seen as the arch nemesis of the sector the latest ev report suggests that the transition from ices to evs is happening at a faster than expected clip perhaps more so due to a flurry of ice giants joining the ev race over the past few years the ev momentum has gone into overdrive thanks to the esg craze and the shift to renewable energy last year marked a fresh high for the ev industry after the global electric car market recorded growth of 41 according to an international energy agency report last year bloomberg news akshat rathi claimed that every f 150 lightning destroys 50 barrels of oil demand forever the f 150 lightning is ford motors nyse f electric equivalent of the marquee ford 150 truck it s becoming a familiar refrain by a cross section of experts including stanford university economist tony seba who went ballistic a few years ago and declared that evs will obliterate the global oil industry by 2030 but how much threat does the ev revolution actually pose for the fossil fuel sector a report from ihs markit shows that in 2020 light plug in and fuel cell vehicles as well as electric city buses and two wheelers collectively displaced about 370 000 barrels per day of global oil consumption a figure that is projected to grow to 1 5 million barrels per day by 2025 equal to about 1 4 of the projected level of total world oil demand source ihs markit electrifying america s vehicles is a critical part of combating climate change considering that the transport sector accounts for 21 of total ghg emissions the burgeoning ev sector is moving full steam ahead but has to contend with a more than century old ice industry bloomberg new energy finance bnef has projected that evs will account for 8 of the global fleet by 2030 and reach 31 of the global fleet by 2040 the new energy research provider also says that it will take at least two decades for ev sales to hit 60 of all new vehicle sales as dean foreman chief economist at the american petroleum institute has quipped evs can eat into traditional market share for liquid fuels but that s largely a developed economy or rich country issue at this point bloomberg new energy finance estimates that road fuel oil demand will peak in 2027 but it will take another decade for the impact of advancements to be materially felt emissions will almost halve by 2050 but the sector will still be nowhere near net zero in the best case scenario by the 2050s fossil derived road fuel demand will fall below levels last seen in the early 1970s in this case oil related emissions will drop to 3 4 gigatons co2 by 2050 down from almost 6 5gt in 2019 that said the ev sector could end up hurting the oil sector in the long run with bnef predicting that electric and fuel cell vehicles will displace 21 million barrels per day in oil demand by 2050 in other words it s probably going to be decades before the impact of the ev revolution begins to be truly felt by the fossil fuel sector by alex kimani

buckley who once avoided minibars at all costs is now invested in their success as vice president of food and beverage for atelier ace the company behind small boutique chain ace hotel the company seeks out local partners to build its minibar program with a focus on diversity and inclusion while also stocking choices that will appeal to the masses it gives people the opportunity to shop local that s our goal right now to really work with that diversity and really work with interesting vendors that are putting out amazing products and small businesses that don t have the opportunity to penetrate these bigger markets she says at one of the company s newest properties the ace hotel brooklyn that means the kombucha gummy bears and whiskey are from borough based companies whose owners are women people of colour or members of other underrepresented groups it gives people the opportunity to shop local but also learn about the community that they re travelling in buckley says the top seller is water she says ace partners with boxed water brand just water co founded by actor jaden smith and gummy bears granola and power bars are also popular although buckley says the company will include a small amount of well known items such as m ms about 80 per cent of the minibar stock is locally sourced quirky boutique hotels may have their own approach but many luxury properties and casino resorts have also held on to the minibar that s where bruno agrario vice president of sales and marketing for bartech systems international gets the bulk of his business the family owned company supplies automated minibars and trays to 1300 hotels around the world with this selling point technology keeps track of everything so the daily labour demand is significantly lower than a traditional minibar that requires someone to check each room regularly our minibar system is fighting all the negative aspects of traditional minibars agrario says in other words we fully understand why minibars are usually hated advertisement agrario says water is the top seller cashews beer white wine kettle brand chips pringles and chocolate almonds also do well diet coke is the top selling soda he touts a familiar is best approach and he encourages customers to avoid specialised local products because he argues the heart wants what it already knows and craves not something new you don t know those local items he says a minibar is all about impulse purchase you see the item you consume if you don t know the item you are not likely to use as much the las vegas favourites mgm resorts which has minibars in its luxury las vegas properties says in a statement that hotels always keep the favourites in stock including vodka tequila beer chips nuts and candy bars we evaluate and review all feedback provided on a regular basis and then use that information to make decisions based on trends and common themes the company says additionally we will test new products on a floor or two within one of our properties to get real time feedback so we can use that data to make sound choices on products we will carry in the future minibars had a pop culture moment late last year an in episode of hbo comedy curb your enthusiasm larry david the creator of the show who plays a version of himself wants to curate the offerings for his friend s hotel but his suggestions wasabi peas parmesan crisps figs and the coup de grace york peppermint patties fail to impress if you don t have the vision to know how amazing a wasabi pea would be in a minibar i don t really want anything to do with you david grumbles before storming out of the meeting buckley with ace hotel says the fictional david would probably get hired as a minibar curator we like that avant garde approach she says the pandemic dealt the latest blow to the old amenity and inspired a new round of so long minibar predictions in may 2020 npr quoted one consultant as saying i think the death of the minibar is probably finally here advertisement harteveldt says there were practical reasons for hotels to ditch the stocked fridges or trays of non perishables as the coronavirus spread properties needed to limit the presence of workers in guest rooms and get rid of unnecessary contact points buckley and agrario says they noticed a different trend as the pandemic progressed after initial restrictions on minibars lifted they saw demand increase sales are up because a lot of times people don t feel comfortable going out buckley says people like to be in their safe space so what s next for the minibar experts say there is plenty of downside including a continuing labour shortage and the persistence of covid 19 but opportunity remains mehmet erdem an associate professor of hotel operations and technology at the university of nevada at las vegas says innovative and creative approaches could appeal to a new generation of travellers if hotels could figure out a pricing model that would make the minibar more attractive he says they might keep more people spending money on site rather than looking elsewhere it can be a win win for everybody nice affordable convenience for the guest and it can be one more amenity offered for the hotel room that adds to the competitive edge of a particular brand he says erdem added i wouldn t write off the minibars quite yet washington post

list up to a dozen special purpose acquisition companies spacs within the next 12 18 months bankers venture capitalists and analysts say a key test for sgx will come when such companies also known as blank cheque or shell firms have to seal merger targets within two years a de spacing process already weighing on u s deals as hundreds of spacs chase targets analysts say singapore faces a challenge to get its traditionally risk averse investors interested in a new asset class especially after sgx has met with limited success in its previous attempts to shore up its equity market in contrast large international institutions have turned to hong kong for blockbuster equity listings over the past decade while a craze in spacs has fizzled out in the united states since early 2021 amid regulatory scrutiny and poor returns sgx hosted three spacs last month in their first major debut in asia the attraction is that they are simpler and typically more rewarding for startups than an ipo looking at the response for the first spacs the pipeline is very strong said eng kwok seat moey capital markets head at dbs joint issue manager on two spac ipos with credit suisse singapore spacs are likely to chase targets in fintech tech and consumer sectors bankers say valuations of targets could range between s 800 million 596 million to up to s 2 billion with dealmaking likely as early as this year the size of the opportunity of younger companies scaling up and going for listings is several times what it was many years ago and over the next decade it ll be multiples of those said ashish wadhwani a singapore based managing partner at ivycap ventures an indian firm managing about 400 million of assets last year fundraising on sgx halved to 565 million a six year low with just eight listings refinitiv data shows underlying singapore s cautious approach state investor temasek linked entities featured among cornerstone investors in two of the three spacs all of which were oversubscribed vertex venture holdings a temasek subsidiary and one of southeast asia s largest funds was the first to launch a s 200 million tech spac in january cautious start i expect the exchange and regulators to be quite careful in all these processes i don t think they will suddenly just open up the floodgates and everybody can come said chua kee lock ceo of vertex which manages 5 1 billion of assets backers of regional tech and industrial buyout fund novo tellus s 150 million spac included a temasek unit european asset manager tikehau capital which has two europe listed spacs also chose singapore for a s 170 million spac listing with co sponsors including lvmh chairman bernard arnault the latest moves could lead to more global funds playing an active role in public equity markets in singapore which is already a leading asian finance and wealth hub it s a chicken and egg situation maybe if you create this spac market then more investors will come wadhwani said spacs typically offer stock with warrants which are viewed as a key way to attract early investors still for wealthy investors such as prantik mazumdar the listing of big regional names in singapore and successful business mergers of spacs are crucial before he chooses them over directly investing in pre ipo u s tech companies unless there are exclusive opportunities in specific sectors and differentiated structures that spacs offer i m probably on the fence mazumdar said in 2010 sgx deliberated on spacs but didn t get favourable market feedback last year it launched a spac framework with a focus on scrutinising track record of sponsors it required them to invest in their spacs and unlike in hong kong sgx allowed participation from retail investors a spac listing can definitely help a start up exit and raise funds faster with less hassle said chandra tjan co founder of indonesia focussed alpha jwc ventures last year singapore also announced two funds with s 2 billion in capital for late stage funding and ipos as dealmaking surges twenty private companies in southeast asia joined the ranks of those valued at 1 billion or more in 2021 while 53 firms joined the list of those with near term potential of being valued at 1 billion data from research firm tracxn shows fundamentally the benchmark to be a sponsor in singapore is higher between the capital requirements and the willingness to embrace independent directors who will decide the de spac said neil parekh ceo of pegasus asia the tikehau backed singapore spac singapore s success as a global hub for real estate investment trusts reits could be a template to build a spac market singapore has the necessary ingredients to build a healthy spacs market and it can develop in the same way as the reit market if we keep a close watch over the quality of sponsors and maintain overall listing standards said mohamed nasser ismail sgx s head of equity capital markets 1 1 3426 singapore dollars reporting by anshuman daga editing

federal reserve chair jerome powell s stance on the current economy as very different than the last time the fed hiked rates raised fears about a more aggressive hawkish cycle and a potential 50 basis point rate hike as soon as march but several fed presidents came out last week with a go slow message and one said a 50 basis point rate hike is not their initial preference the risk of the fed surprising the market with more aggressive action at some point in 2022 isn t going to be ruled out and stocks are likely to remain volatile a few weeks ago when fed chair jerome powell was asked at his post fomc meeting press conference whether a 50 basis point rate hike was on table he did what a fed chair is supposed to do he wouldn t rule it out and stuck to his more general talking points which are more hawkish about the economy being stronger than the last time the fed began a tightening cycle we fully appreciate that this is a different situation if you look back to where we were in 2015 16 17 18 when we were raising rates inflation was very close to 2 percent even below 2 percent unemployment was not at our estimates of natural rate and growth was you know in the 2 to 3 percent range right now we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and you know more persistently than we would like we have growth even in forecasts even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022 we still see growth higher than substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate and we see a labor market where by so many measures it is historically tight we haven t made to your specific question we really have not addressed those questions and we ll begin to address them as we move into the march meeting and meetings after that at least five times during his press conference powell made a statement about how different the economy is this time and it was so much on his mind that his last reference to the strength of the economy was a reminder to his audience about how many times he had said something to that effect during the press conference get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters market history since world war ii says when the fed starts hiking stock returns will be on average more modest but not necessarily negative and in the months ahead of a fed rate hike the stock market does well with the greater pressure on stocks coming once the hikes actually begin this year has not followed that script with a terrible january and even though last week the s p 500 rebounded it is still down more than 5 year to date and the dow jones industrial average down by roughly 3 5 as of friday fear of a 50 basis point fed rate hike alongside a wall street scurrying into more hawkishness itself with bank of america now predicting seven rate hikes this year is one factor that has unsettled the market and introduced greater volatility for investors already prepared for a central bank at the end of an easing era but has the fear of a 50 basis point rate hike in march ever been realistic the debate isn t only limited to the u s last week the bank of england voted 5 4 to raise rates by 25 basis points in the fight against inflation four members voted in favor of a 50 basis point increase the odds of a 50 basis point rate hike at the start of a new fed tightening cycle have moved around quite a bit roughly doubling in recent weeks before moving back down when several fed presidents including fed officials known to be more hawkish and more attuned to inflation ahead of peers on the fomc spoke last week about moving gradually even if at the same time they ruled no policy move out prematurely ideally you always want to go gradually kansas city fed president esther george told an audience at the economic club of indiana if the data say that things have evolved in a way that a 50 basis point move is required or be appropriate then i m going to lean into that if moving in successive meetings makes sense i ll be comfortable with that atlanta fed president raphael bostic said in an interview with the ft a week ago a day later bostic told yahoo finance of a 50 basis point hike in march that s not my preferred setting policy action for the next meeting the odds ticked higher again after the big jobs number on friday which defied pessimistic expectations about omicron s impact on hiring though the fed has maintained throughout covid waves that each one has proven to have less of an impact on the economy the recent rate hike history recent fed history does suggest that if the fed moves by 50 basis points it is not likely to be its first move in a hiking cycle a may 2000 increase of 50 basis points came after five bumps of 25 basis points from june 1999 to march 2000 and was the last rate increase of the cycle the 50 and 75 basis point moves in 1994 1995 may august november february came after three bumps of 25 basis points february march and april 1994 as is in the 1999 2000 rate hike cycle these larger moves marked the end of monetary policy tightening according to a review of the moves by datatrek research history says the fed leaves 50 basis point moves or greater for the middle to end of a tightening cycle but remember that chair powell has explicitly said the current environment is different from the past datatrek research s colas wrote in a recent analysis futures are putting low odds on a march 50 bp hike but that could easily change if incoming data shows inflation is still accelerating for john ryding chief economic advisor at brean capital there is a disconnect between the logical case for a 50 basis point hike and actual understanding of how this fed acts starting with the principal that the sooner the fed acts and the more aggressively it acts in the short run the less they have to do in the long run this idea was once an established principal of the central bank which past fed vice chairman alan blinder called the stitch in time philosophy in the 1990s blinder warned that the fed needed to act in anticipation of economic conditions rather than use the bunker hill wait until you see the whites of their eyes approach which is a recipe for failure by the time you see the whites of their eyes they ve already shot you right through the heart you try to save nine by stitching in time blinder said in a 1995 speech but to ryding s mind if the fed were more serious about trying to get ahead of inflation than the market already expected it would have raised rates already not only did the fed pass up the opportunity to raise rates in january which was expected but which a majority of respondents to cnbc s fed survey thought would have been the right move to make given how far behind the fed is on inflation but the fed is still buying bonds in february 30 billion worth ryding noted even with all it already knows about the economic situation if it still isn t willing to say that it is time to stop adding to the balance sheet that doesn t sound to me like a fed ready to raise by 50 basis points he said did the stock market get too hawkish the volatility in stocks and the big rebound last week led by strong earnings in some of the largest technology companies may be a reflection that wall street potentially went too far to other side of the fed monetary policy spectrum too hawkish led by the bank of america call for seven rate hikes and causing too much near term bearishness in the stock market there was good reason for a market overreaction to the fed s own hawkishness it was only last september that the fomc anticipated no rate hikes in 2022 by december only one member thought there would not be a rate hike and the median was three changes are occurring swiftly powell s non answer on a 50 basis point rate hike meanwhile doesn t say anything more than that the process has to play out among fed members powell can t say no we will not do 50 basis points unless you know every members is of that mind it s very difficult so he has to respect the process ryding said but the fact that several top fed officials seemed to downplay a 50 basis point hike last week isn t necessarily a strong signal let alone commentary ryding would define as walking back at all the fed prepares markets for bad news and at this point the market is already prepared for the idea that the central bank is leaning into the idea of doing more rather than less to tame inflation the bank also would never rule out any specific policy move ahead of time and remains data dependent and if it were to end up doing less that is not a change it would feel the need to prepare the market for in advance when it comes to market participants catching up they have a tendency to run from one side of the boat to other and that takes the market with it and that s something of what we saw i will guarantee you if there is any chance of the fed doing 50 basis points we will all be in no doubt about it ryding said the fed has other options too the financial market has too much cash that it doesn t know what to do with and has been giving back to the fed in the reverse repo market and 1 5 trillion in bank reserves more than the banks need all this liquidity has to be soaked up and lots of adjustment on the balance sheet are yet to be made and that balance sheet unwind won t occur at the glacial pace it did last time that won t be case this time ryding said which the fed has made clear is its position though details remain scant the dna of this fed the market s shifting view on a 50 basis point hike in march may continue to move around but being too bearish in the short term doesn t mean the market is not underestimating the degree of monetary restraint that will eventually be needed to rein in inflation even if the fed is of the mind to stick with a 25 basis point hike in march it will come back in may with a much better idea of where the economy is and have the option to pursue a 50 basis point hike at that point if warranted ryding says based on everything we have seen and heard from the fed to date it is much more likely that if they are inclined to go above 25 basis points at any point it isn t before may 50 is just i think out of character for this fed and they have additional strategies ryding said i don t think the adjustment is about doing more than expected at the march meeting it s fleshing out the skeletal details we have on the balance sheet ryding s forecast is four rate hikes this year and if he had to choose between three and five he would lean to five based on his inflation forecast and eventually he does think the fed becomes more hawkish just not yet to come out of the blocks with a 50 basis point rate hike is not in this fed s dna he said and until there is more recognition of the upside risk to inflation as becoming reality in the fed forecast not the base case powell said after the last fomc meeting but with the fed chair nevertheless describing the risk as tilted to the upside policy won t get tighter than expected eventually i do think the fed will have to do more than the market expects but not in the near term ryding said when the vix hit 40 before last week s stock market rebound it was a sign of stocks being oversold but that volatility will remain a feature of the market volatility has to be a theme because we ve been spoon fed for many many years for the best part of the past decade we ve never been surprised and the fed has moved very gradually but now it doesn t know what it will do it s either more now or later for powell a 50 basis point hike in march may be too soon for this fed but it remains the view of economic forecaster joel naroff that unless the inflation numbers decline sharply the fed will have to get more aggressive than expected at some point with businesses having pricing power for the first time in decades they are not likely to give it up easily which increases the potential for a significant misreading on inflation if cpi and other inflation readings stay at the current level the fed would be responsible if they started signaling we will be on top of this and the simplest way is by going 50 basis points whether in march or june he says to his mind if the fed follows through on the expectation of a 25 basis point hike in march it only means that there is a higher probability that the 50 basis point rate hike comes later i ve been thinking they need to do more than simply say the economy is different and we have a strong economy naroff said referencing fed chair powell s recent post fomc comments that were interpreted as broadly more hawkish he has provided the ability for the members who want to do more than 25 basis points to come out he said naroff thinks the 50 basis move is the right one to more quickly correct the mistakes made by the fed during the transitory inflation period they could dispel all of the questions by simply going 50 basis points he said in fact if the fed moved quicker and sooner they might be able to do a lower number of total rate hikes everyone has the belief they have to go each quarter but i m hoping the fed at some point does something that is classified as off meeting naroff said powell said there is plenty of room to move and not the hurt economy so why take three years to get to 3 when we have a strong economy and inflation that should be a message the market should have received a long time ago he said to his mind whether the fed does 100 basis points or 125 basis points of hikes this year and whether in 25 basis point increments or more is largely irrelevant the point is that this is not the end and he made that pretty clear naroff said i just think 50 basis points is a stronger statement last friday s jobs number reinforces the view that the next inflation number or two may push the fed into more of a hawkish corner but the latest fed presidents comments do show that they seem to be more unified in a go slowly posture for now but after that first move all the bets do come off and they can go in any direction they want naroff said the bottom line is more volatility as grant thornton chief economic diane swonk concluded after the fomc meeting and whether up or down stocks have remained volatile in trading since then the fed has completed its pivot from being patient to panicked on inflation its next move will be to raise rates soon after it will be looking to reduce its massive balance sheet to amplify shifts in short term rates and ease the

jin ding china daily uncertainties stemming from the us could set back the global recovery the global economy saw a relatively quick recovery in 2021 with china and the united states being among the first countries to see production returning to pre pandemic levels the problems that remain unresolved are the global governance deficit and the long term confrontation between china and the us looking ahead there are a number of risks looming though in 2022 the shift in us monetary policy could spark turmoil in financial markets as the us inflation rate is rising faster than expected the federal reserve has strengthened its resolve to curb it with its stance becoming hawkish but financial risks associated with interest rate hikes and the shrinking balance sheet are rising one of the triggers are zombie companies in the us bond market at present zombie companies account for nearly 10 percent of listed companies in the us and nearly half of the corporate bonds in the bond market are rated bbb which is the lowest level of investment grade if these bonds are downgraded to junk bonds investment funds will be forced to undersell on a large scale triggering debt risks the us stock bubble is also of concern in 2021 us stock markets repeatedly hit new highs in early november the price earnings ratio of the dow jones industrial average was about 30 nearly the highest level in its history the bubbles in the us stock market are more severe than the dot com bubbles during the last policy tightening cycle after the us federal funds target rate was increased to 1 5 percent and the 10 year treasury yield rose to 2 5 percent the stock market experienced a sharp correction meanwhile some developing countries have defaulted on their debts with the increasingly uneven global recovery the debt burden of developing countries has soared the international monetary fund predicted in october 2021 that the output of the advanced economies will return to pre pandemic levels by 2022 while aggregate output of the developing economies excluding china is expected to remain 5 5 percent below the pre pandemic forecast in 2024 the uneven distribution of vaccines and the lack of macro policy space have delayed the economic recovery of developing countries and further aggregated their debt burdens in 2020 alone the debt to gdp ratio of such countries increased by 18 percentage points the largest increase in 40 years due to the fed s monetary policy shift developing countries will face multiple shocks such as capital outflows currency depreciation and rising financing costs nearly half of all low income countries are facing debt troubles a targeted decoupling of supply chains is also in the pipeline in february the us will issue a comprehensive report reviewing and evaluating supply chains and it could roll out more targeted policies for its technological blockade and the return of key supply chains a series of laws that have been adopted by the us recently such as the infrastructure investment and jobs act and the build back better act will come into force this year and the united states innovation and competition act which is now under legislative process will probably be passed and implemented these laws are all aimed at enabling the return of supply chains while promoting the targeted decoupling in terms of products technologies industries and regions with china this year there could also be further reshaping in the supply chains due to diligence laws in the european union which is aimed at strengthening the control of human rights and climate issues in the supply chain in addition western countries may also enhance the ideological and geopolitical nature of supply chains and promote partial decoupling through the us eu trade and technology council the supply chain resilience initiative between japan australia and india the supply chain cooperation among quad nations and the anti coercion legislation in the us and the eu at the same time resource nationalism is on the rise the quick economic recovery and global energy transition have widened the gap between the supply and demand of natural resources and the bargaining power of resource rich countries has increased meanwhile with the pandemic exacerbating their fiscal crises the governments of resource rich countries are eager to increase their revenue these factors have all contributed to a significant rise in resource nationalism in the context of rising global protectionism since the onset of the pandemic key resource exporters have stepped up intervention by nationalizing resources increasing taxation prohibiting exports and stipulating that higher value added processes must be completed domestically in the coming years the mining sector could be the hardest hit by resource nationalism in the context of the energy transition the strategic importance of mineral resources including copper aluminum cobalt lithium and nickel have been reinforced resource rich countries that are highly dependent on resource exports are most susceptible to resource nationalism key countries include the democratic republic of the congo and zambia in africa peru chile and mexico in latin america and indonesia and mongolia in asia the intertwining of various risks mentioned above will likely make the global economic growth rate in 2022 significantly lower than international institutions forecasts which have been between 4 1 and 4 9 percent to be more specific if developed countries scale back their stimulus policies financial risks could be triggered and spread to the world meanwhile the intensified rivalry between major countries the abuse of sanctions by the us the intensification of geopolitical conflicts and the rise of resource nationalism may all trigger a butterfly effect in the complex global output network bringing about serious supply shocks and even stagflation with the resonance between traditional and non traditional security risks and in particular the possible mutation of the novel coronavirus and its continuous spreading the economic recovery of some countries could be interrupted the author is director of the institute of

there has been much speculation as to exactly when the gst hike will take place ever since it was announced in 2018 that the goods and services tax gst would be raised from 7 per cent to 9 per cent some time between 2021 and 2025 there has been much speculation as to exactly when it will take place and what impact it will have on singapore households and businesses the increase was held off last year as singapore grappled with covid 19 but prime minister lee hsien loong indicated in his new year message that the government will have to start moving on the hike as the economy emerges from the pandemic more details will be revealed during the budget on feb 18 meanwhile here are answers to 15 questions you may have about the gst 1 what is gst when was it introduced and why the gst is a broad based tax paid on goods or services consumed domestically including imports in other countries it is known as value added tax or vat it was introduced in 1994 at a rate of 3 per cent as part of a shift from direct taxes to indirect ones to boost singapore s international competitiveness the additional revenue collected from gst enables individual and corporate income tax rates as well as property tax rates to be kept low also a broad based consumption tax spreads costs more fairly and creates a more resilient tax base as the population ages 2 how is it calculated for businesses gst is a multi stage tax collected at each stage of the production and distribution chain output gst which a gst registered business charges on its local supplies of goods and services is collected by businesses on behalf of the government input gst refers to what a gst registered business pays on its purchases of goods and services for business purposes to determine the net gst payable by or refundable to the business the input tax paid is deducted from the output tax collected in a given period 3 how does our rate compare with other countries the current rate of 7 per cent in singapore is among the world s lowest even in asia the 2021 global average standard vat rate was around 19 per cent and around 12 per cent in asia the increase to 9 per cent will still put singapore s gst rate below the asian average 4 is anyone exempt is gst ever absorbed in singapore the sale and lease of residential properties provision of financial services import and local supply of investment precious metals and supply of digital payment tokens are exempt from gst to address its impact in particular on lower income households the government has continued to fully absorb gst on publicly subsidised education and healthcare 5 how much does gst contribute to revenue gst has on average contributed more than one fifth of the total tax revenue collected by the government over the past five years in financial year 2020 21 the inland revenue authority of singapore collected 10 3 billion in gst this made up 21 per cent of the total taxes collected and was the third highest tax type after corporate income tax 33 per cent and individual income tax 26 per cent assuming consumption patterns remain the same in the years to come a two percentage point increase in gst would add more than 3 billion a year to singapore s coffers and could overtake individual income tax as the second largest generator of tax revenue 6 when was gst first raised the gst rate was raised from 3 per cent to 5 per cent over 2003 and 2004 by one percentage point at a time and then to 7 per cent in 2007 7 why the hike this time there is never a good time to raise rates but a hike is more acceptable during a period of economic growth and renewed consumer spending the economy is on the mend and gross domestic product is expected to grow 3 per cent to 5 per cent in 2022 pm lee has said that he is cautiously optimistic about singapore s economic recovery in the year ahead 8 is there a good reason to increase gst singapore has to boost its tax revenue to fund social and healthcare spending especially given its ageing population since the gst was last raised in 2007 public expenditure has grown significantly between 2007 and 2019 government spending rose from around 33 billion to 75 billion a year social spending nearly tripled government healthcare expenditure grew from around 2 2 billion to 11 3 billion having run up cumulative budget deficits of more than 75 billion over the past two years and drawn down reserves to the tune of 53 7 billion there is also some urgency to rebuild public finances the government has to meet the constitutional requirement to balance the budget by 2025 9 why not just tax the rich it is tempting to invoke the robin hood solution of taxing the rich to pay the poor but measures that equalise opportunities such as improving access to education and additional investments in vulnerable communities are more powerful than any forced income or wealth redistribution also singapore needs to find more fiscally sustainable ways to fund its needs as a broad based tax gst is easy to administer and is a stable source of government revenue relatively free of domestic production and distribution distortions in contrast income tax can have a distortive effect on the economy as taxpayers are incentivised to take steps to avoid reaching certain levels of income and to classify their receipt of monies as not being of an income nature 10 will the hike be staggered the last gst hike almost 15 years ago was done in a staggered manner to ease in the cost burden for consumers as singapore emerged from the aftermath of the sept 11 terrorist attack in the united states in 2001 and sars but this approach causes inconvenience to gst registered businesses which have to adjust their enterprise resource planning systems and price displays a few times thus some analysts expect the gst to be raised by two percentage points at one go 11 will exceptions be made for some goods and sectors singapore has a broad based gst system with no reduced rates on essential goods this allows the tax to be administered simply without the added complication of defining which goods are essential though sectors such as food and beverage tourism and entertainment have been harder hit exceptions are not expected to be made for such sectors which have received various forms of government support during covid 19 12 won t the gst hike add to inflation and cost pressures faced by businesses and singaporeans such pressures should be countered by diversifying imports and building buffer stocks of essential goods not by postponing the hike though there are troubled parts of the economy and more vulnerable households it is more effective to support them through targeted and time bound subsidies 13 is gst regressive in theory gst is regressive as it imposes a proportionately larger burden on lower income singaporeans than higher income ones but gst forms part of singapore s overall tax and benefits system which is progressive those with higher incomes spend more hence they pay more gst and contribute more to gst revenue the permanent gst voucher scheme helps the lower and middle income with cash support and utility rebates and the elderly get medisave top ups there are other government subsidies in areas such as education housing and medical care as well as workfare and silver support schemes for the lower income the net result is that lower and middle income households receive more in benefits than the taxes they pay 14 will i be hit by the full impact of the gst hike now no a 6 billion assurance package means that all adult singaporeans will get cash payouts of between 700 and 1 600 over five years to offset at least five years of additional gst expenses for most households and 10 years worth for those living in one to three room housing board flats the gst voucher scheme which has three components cash medisave top ups and u save rebates will be enhanced when the gst rate is increased this will fully offset the gst for retiree households living in one to three room hdb flats significantly offset the gst for retiree households living in four to five room hdb flats and offset about half of the gst for lower income households with no elderly persons 15 what support did the government give in previous gst hikes the government rolled out offset packages that included cash payouts utilities conservancy and rental rebates and other subsidies the highlight of the budget 2002 gst offset package was 3 6 billion in economic restructuring shares for eligible singapore citizens aged above 21 shares worth between 600 and 1 400 were disbursed over three years the budget 2007 gst offset package comprised cash payouts called gst credits a senior citizens bonus over four years and top ups to the public transport fund for lower income households among other kinds of help

federal reserve chair jerome powell s stance on the current economy as very different than the last time the fed hiked rates raised fears about a more aggressive hawkish cycle and a potential 50 basis point rate hike as soon as march but several fed presidents came out last week with a go slow message and one said a 50 basis point rate hike is not their initial preference the risk of the fed surprising the market with more aggressive action at some point in 2022 isn t going to be ruled out and stocks are likely to remain volatile a few weeks ago when fed chair jerome powell was asked at his post fomc meeting press conference whether a 50 basis point rate hike was on table he did what a fed chair is supposed to do he wouldn t rule it out and stuck to his more general talking points which are more hawkish about the economy being stronger than the last time the fed began a tightening cycle we fully appreciate that this is a different situation if you look back to where we were in 2015 16 17 18 when we were raising rates inflation was very close to 2 percent even below 2 percent unemployment was not at our estimates of natural rate and growth was you know in the 2 to 3 percent range right now we have inflation running substantially above 2 percent and you know more persistently than we would like we have growth even in forecasts even in the somewhat reduced forecast for 2022 we still see growth higher than substantially higher than what we estimate to be the potential growth rate and we see a labor market where by so many measures it is historically tight we haven t made to your specific question we really have not addressed those questions and we ll begin to address them as we move into the march meeting and meetings after that at least five times during his press conference powell made a statement about how different the economy is this time and it was so much on his mind that his last reference to the strength of the economy was a reminder to his audience about how many times he had said something to that effect during the press conference get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters market history since world war ii says when the fed starts hiking stock returns will be on average more modest but not necessarily negative and in the months ahead of a fed rate hike the stock market does well with the greater pressure on stocks coming once the hikes actually begin this year has not followed that script with a terrible january and even though last week the s p 500 rebounded it is still down more than 5 year to date and the dow jones industrial average down by roughly 3 5 as of friday fear of a 50 basis point fed rate hike alongside a wall street scurrying into more hawkishness itself with bank of america now predicting seven rate hikes this year is one factor that has unsettled the market and introduced greater volatility for investors already prepared for a central bank at the end of an easing era but has the fear of a 50 basis point rate hike in march ever been realistic the debate isn t only limited to the u s last week the bank of england voted 5 4 to raise rates by 25 basis points in the fight against inflation four members voted in favor of a 50 basis point increase the odds of a 50 basis point rate hike at the start of a new fed tightening cycle have moved around quite a bit roughly doubling in recent weeks before moving back down when several fed presidents including fed officials known to be more hawkish and more attuned to inflation ahead of peers on the fomc spoke last week about moving gradually even if at the same time they ruled no policy move out prematurely ideally you always want to go gradually kansas city fed president esther george told an audience at the economic club of indiana if the data say that things have evolved in a way that a 50 basis point move is required or be appropriate then i m going to lean into that if moving in successive meetings makes sense i ll be comfortable with that atlanta fed president raphael bostic said in an interview with the ft a week ago a day later bostic told yahoo finance of a 50 basis point hike in march that s not my preferred setting policy action for the next meeting the odds ticked higher again after the big jobs number on friday which defied pessimistic expectations about omicron s impact on hiring though the fed has maintained throughout covid waves that each one has proven to have less of an impact on the economy the recent rate hike history recent fed history does suggest that if the fed moves by 50 basis points it is not likely to be its first move in a hiking cycle a may 2000 increase of 50 basis points came after five bumps of 25 basis points from june 1999 to march 2000 and was the last rate increase of the cycle the 50 and 75 basis point moves in 1994 1995 may august november february came after three bumps of 25 basis points february march and april 1994 as is in the 1999 2000 rate hike cycle these larger moves marked the end of monetary policy tightening according to a review of the moves by datatrek research history says the fed leaves 50 basis point moves or greater for the middle to end of a tightening cycle but remember that chair powell has explicitly said the current environment is different from the past datatrek research s colas wrote in a recent analysis futures are putting low odds on a march 50 bp hike but that could easily change if incoming data shows inflation is still accelerating for john ryding chief economic advisor at brean capital there is a disconnect between the logical case for a 50 basis point hike and actual understanding of how this fed acts starting with the principal that the sooner the fed acts and the more aggressively it acts in the short run the less they have to do in the long run this idea was once an established principal of the central bank which past fed vice chairman alan blinder called the stitch in time philosophy in the 1990s blinder warned that the fed needed to act in anticipation of economic conditions rather than use the bunker hill wait until you see the whites of their eyes approach which is a recipe for failure by the time you see the whites of their eyes they ve already shot you right through the heart you try to save nine by stitching in time blinder said in a 1995 speech but to ryding s mind if the fed were more serious about trying to get ahead of inflation than the market already expected it would have raised rates already not only did the fed pass up the opportunity to raise rates in january which was expected but which a majority of respondents to cnbc s fed survey thought would have been the right move to make given how far behind the fed is on inflation but the fed is still buying bonds in february 30 billion worth ryding noted even with all it already knows about the economic situation if it still isn t willing to say that it is time to stop adding to the balance sheet that doesn t sound to me like a fed ready to raise by 50 basis points he said did the stock market get too hawkish the volatility in stocks and the big rebound last week led by strong earnings in some of the largest technology companies may be a reflection that wall street potentially went too far to other side of the fed monetary policy spectrum too hawkish led by the bank of america call for seven rate hikes and causing too much near term bearishness in the stock market there was good reason for a market overreaction to the fed s own hawkishness it was only last september that the fomc anticipated no rate hikes in 2022 by december only one member thought there would not be a rate hike and the median was three changes are occurring swiftly powell s non answer on a 50 basis point rate hike meanwhile doesn t say anything more than that the process has to play out among fed members powell can t say no we will not do 50 basis points unless you know every members is of that mind it s very difficult so he has to respect the process ryding said but the fact that several top fed officials seemed to downplay a 50 basis point hike last week isn t necessarily a strong signal let alone commentary ryding would define as walking back at all the fed prepares markets for bad news and at this point the market is already prepared for the idea that the central bank is leaning into the idea of doing more rather than less to tame inflation the bank also would never rule out any specific policy move ahead of time and remains data dependent and if it were to end up doing less that is not a change it would feel the need to prepare the market for in advance when it comes to market participants catching up they have a tendency to run from one side of the boat to other and that takes the market with it and that s something of what we saw i will guarantee you if there is any chance of the fed doing 50 basis points we will all be in no doubt about it ryding said the fed has other options too the financial market has too much cash that it doesn t know what to do with and has been giving back to the fed in the reverse repo market and 1 5 trillion in bank reserves more than the banks need all this liquidity has to be soaked up and lots of adjustment on the balance sheet are yet to be made and that balance sheet unwind won t occur at the glacial pace it did last time that won t be case this time ryding said which the fed has made clear is its position though details remain scant the dna of this fed the market s shifting view on a 50 basis point hike in march may continue to move around but being too bearish in the short term doesn t mean the market is not underestimating the degree of monetary restraint that will eventually be needed to rein in inflation even if the fed is of the mind to stick with a 25 basis point hike in march it will come back in may with a much better idea of where the economy is and have the option to pursue a 50 basis point hike at that point if warranted ryding says based on everything we have seen and heard from the fed to date it is much more likely that if they are inclined to go above 25 basis points at any point it isn t before may 50 is just i think out of character for this fed and they have additional strategies ryding said i don t think the adjustment is about doing more than expected at the march meeting it s fleshing out the skeletal details we have on the balance sheet ryding s forecast is four rate hikes this year and if he had to choose between three and five he would lean to five based on his inflation forecast and eventually he does think the fed becomes more hawkish just not yet to come out of the blocks with a 50 basis point rate hike is not in this fed s dna he said and until there is more recognition of the upside risk to inflation as becoming reality in the fed forecast not the base case powell said after the last fomc meeting but with the fed chair nevertheless describing the risk as tilted to the upside policy won t get tighter than expected eventually i do think the fed will have to do more than the market expects but not in the near term ryding said when the vix hit 40 before last week s stock market rebound it was a sign of stocks being oversold but that volatility will remain a feature of the market volatility has to be a theme because we ve been spoon fed for many many years for the best part of the past decade we ve never been surprised and the fed has moved very gradually but now it doesn t know what it will do it s either more now or later for powell a 50 basis point hike in march may be too soon for this fed but it remains the view of economic forecaster joel naroff that unless the inflation numbers decline sharply the fed will have to get more aggressive than expected at some point with businesses having pricing power for the first time in decades they are not likely to give it up easily which increases the potential for a significant misreading on inflation if cpi and other inflation readings stay at the current level the fed would be responsible if they started signaling we will be on top of this and the simplest way is by going 50 basis points whether in march or june he says to his mind if the fed follows through on the expectation of a 25 basis point hike in march it only means that there is a higher probability that the 50 basis point rate hike comes later i ve been thinking they need to do more than simply say the economy is different and we have a strong economy naroff said referencing fed chair powell s recent post fomc comments that were interpreted as broadly more hawkish he has provided the ability for the members who want to do more than 25 basis points to come out he said naroff thinks the 50 basis move is the right one to more quickly correct the mistakes made by the fed during the transitory inflation period they could dispel all of the questions by simply going 50 basis points he said in fact if the fed moved quicker and sooner they might be able to do a lower number of total rate hikes everyone has the belief they have to go each quarter but i m hoping the fed at some point does something that is classified as off meeting naroff said powell said there is plenty of room to move and not the hurt economy so why take three years to get to 3 when we have a strong economy and inflation that should be a message the market should have received a long time ago he said to his mind whether the fed does 100 basis points or 125 basis points of hikes this year and whether in 25 basis point increments or more is largely irrelevant the point is that this is not the end and he made that pretty clear naroff said i just think 50 basis points is a stronger statement last friday s jobs number reinforces the view that the next inflation number or two may push the fed into more of a hawkish corner but the latest fed presidents comments do show that they seem to be more unified in a go slowly posture for now but after that first move all the bets do come off and they can go in any direction they want naroff said the bottom line is more volatility as grant thornton chief economic diane swonk concluded after the fomc meeting and whether up or down stocks have remained volatile in trading since then the fed has completed its pivot from being patient to panicked on inflation its next move will be to raise rates soon after it will be looking to reduce its massive balance sheet to amplify shifts in short term rates and ease the transition for the broader economy that sounds nice in theory but it has never actually been done making matters worse will be how heated the debate within the fed gets as the fomc decides how best to calibrate tightening brace yourselves for dissents and the dissonance that creates for financial markets in the year ahead swonk wrote
welcome back to diagnosis a vertical that focuses on the crossroads of health care policy and politics wednesday marks the midway point of the 60 day legislative session this is when budgets are negotiated compromises are reached on legislation and bills killed with avidity it s the time when those deeply invested in what happens in the legislature start to panic or start counting the hours and days until they can do their victory formation the pace also begins to pick up because committees will soon wrap up their work for the year and the deadline for the budget is about to appear on the horizon sometime in the next two weeks lawmakers will shift from saying there s still time to work out a deal to wait until next year i welcome your feedback questions and especially your tips you can contact me by emailing me at or call me at 850 251 2317 health plan revamp lawmakers appear poised to revamp the health insurance program used by tens of thousands of state employees as well as legislators and other top state officials by including in their budget plans to competitively bid the state s 3 1 billion program and have new contracts inked and in place for coverage in two years neither chamber is proposing any changes to the state group health insurance plans for the next benefit year starting jan 1 employee premiums would remain at their current levels but included in the house and senate budget documents released late friday are directives for the florida department of management services dms to begin the process of selecting a contractor to administer hmo and pharmacy benefit manager services for 2024 the house has included the directive in its proposed spending plan for the fiscal year 2022 2023 and authorizes the department to begin working on the procurement immediately the house also earmarked nearly 3 million for what it hopes are cost saving initiatives it has earmarked 2 1 million 900 000 of which is recurring for a cloud based data analytics solution for fraud and abuse and 600 000 for a cost benefit analysis the senate has included a revamp in its proposed bill sb 2502 also known as the implementing bill for the budget both chambers also have released conforming bills that ratify dms rules that establish nine regions across the state dms was directed to establish the regions in 2019 as part of an eleventh hour effort by the house to revamp the state health insurance plan while both conforming bills ratify the dms rules the house bill also requires dms to establish anti fraud units the house conforming bill pcb apc 22 05 would allow certain state employees who leave their jobs on or after july 1 2022 to enroll in the state group plan within two years after their departure only employees who worked at least six years for the state and were enrolled in the state group plan at their departure could qualify part time employees would not be eligible nor would those employed by the state university system the house bill also eliminates a failed attempt to revamp the state health insurance program that was long championed by the house and passed in 2017 the law directed the dms to offer state employees access to one of four health insurance plans named after metals with different actuarial values employees who chose less expensive plans than what the state paid to the premium could be used to increase their salary an actuarial analysis shows that the law if implemented could increase costs by 525 million annually lawmakers have agreed to hold the law in abeyance the house bill would strike the ill conceived program from the books that provision is not in spb 2506 the senate confirming bill to ratify the dms rules the move to competitively bid the 3 1 billion program comes as economists revised the fiscal outlook for the state employee health insurance trust fund the fund a combination of employees monthly premiums and state tax dollars is projected to have a 61 8 million deficit in the fiscal year 2023 2024 the deficit is due to a decline in health plan enrollment in the fiscal year 2021 2022 and higher than anticipated expenses for those covered data show 3 312 fewer state employees in the health plan in the current fiscal year than projected in or out should medicaid dental care continue to be a separately procured program or should it be rolled back into the state s medicaid managed medical assistance program on monday members of the house health care appropriations subcommittee will wrestle with that and other high profile issues when discussing hb 7047 the delivery of dental care is not the only issue getting attention in the house bill but it is one of the most divisive the house bill rolls the dental program back into the statewide medicaid managed medical assistance plan a move supported by florida s medicaid director tom wallace wallace told lawmakers in november that contacting one provider for dental and medical care improves the continuum of care and seems to be the best approach but tallahassee dentist astrid gonzalez who opened tiny teeth in 2017 sees things differently gonzalez contacted florida politics because she wanted to testify on the bill but had a previously scheduled surgery time in the operating room she jockeyed to get gonzalez who moved to florida from pennsylvania to be close to her parents has always practiced in a medicaid managed care system for one year she worked in florida s medicaid managed medical assistance program she has had contracts with managed dental companies for the last three years gonzalez did not know how many patients her growing business lost when the state changed how it procured dental services but she knows some children fell through the cracks switching it back she said will be unnecessarily disruptive i know i am able to provide dental care to these kids and i m certain that changing the system would cause major disruptions in the delivery care she said would it last forever no but one day a child needs to go to the dentist but can t that s why i want to be able to provide care for them the senate s version of the medicaid managed care bill keeps intact dental care the way it is currently being handled when asked about the senate s position to continue the separate dental procurement senate president wilton simpson told reporters thursday we are very comfortable with where the senate bill is meanwhile it is unclear when the senate will consider sb 1950 again its next stop is the senate appropriations subcommittee on health and human services but sen aaron bean said the subcommittee he chairs is not slated to meet again until feb 16 the agenda for that meeting has not yet been set on friday bean a republican from fernandina beach told florida politics that he was hopeful that we will eventually consider that bill ladapo and manners state surgeon general joseph ladapo will go before senators for a second time this week and it probably won t go any better than the first time around the harvard trained doctor picked by gov ron desantis to lead the state department of health was already a lightning rod for controversy because of skeptical stances on vaccines and masks and his refusal to wear a mask in sen tina polsky s office after she asked him to his reluctance to answer questions from democrats straightforwardly during his first confirmation hearing prompted all of them to storm out he will go before the senate ethics and elections committee this tuesday where republicans hold a 6 4 majority so it s highly unlikely this committee will be thumbs down on his confirmation the committee only recommends whether someone should or should not be confirmed the full senate can still vote on a confirmation even if a committee makes a negative recommendation but democrats will probably ask ladapo about the information contained in a background screening report first disclosed by the tallahassee democrat a former supervisor at the university of california at los angeles was sharply critical of ladapo and said he should not be in his current post in my opinion the people of florida would be better served by a surgeon general who grounds his policy decisions and recommendations in the best scientific evidence rather than opinions the unnamed supervisor told the investigator who did the screening the supervisor said ladapo created stress and acrimony among his co workers due to his opinions on covid 19 and who felt that his opinions violated the hippocratic oath that physicians do no harm ladapo as well as representatives of the desantis administration pushed back on the criticism when senate president simpson was asked the trilby republican on thursday quickly said i suspect that professor did not go to the university of florida either before pivoting to another question that referenced a previous jab that simpson made where he said ladapo lacked manners because he went to harvard instead of uf but simpson s sharp shift to another question signals that he doesn t want ladapo s nomination to be too much of a distraction free speech or free reign desantis is throwing his support behind bills that would prohibit state regulators from sanctioning or penalizing doctors and health care practitioners for any comments they make on social media on monday the senate judiciary committee will consider sb 1184 dubbed the health care provider freedom of speech bill the legislation aims to prevent a crackdown on doctors accused of spreading misinformation about covid 19 a trend occurring across the country the federation of state medical boards reported an uptick in complaints against licensed medical professionals for disseminating false or misleading information the organization announced that 67 of state medical boards reported an increase in complaints and 21 had taken some sort of disciplinary action we are encouraged by the number of boards that have already taken action to combat covid 19 disinformation by disciplining physicians who engage in that behavior and by reminding all physicians that their words and actions matter and they should think twice before spreading disinformation that may harm patients said dr humayun chaudhry the president and ceo of the federation said in a december statement the desantis administration disagrees and on friday posted on the governor s twitter account that physicians in florida should be able to practice medicine and express opinions without facing sanctions simply because they are not parroting the prevailing narrative of note a complaint was filed with the doh against state surgeon general ladapo but it was never pursued the bill requires the licensing board or the health department if there is no board to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the licensed practitioner s actions led to the direct physical harm of one of their patients the board and the health department could get hit with a 1 5 million fine for violating the law a staff analysis notes that the 1 5 million liability established in the bill may deter the doh and the boards from taking action against health care practitioners in their efforts to preserve the health safety and welfare of the public but republican legislators backing the bill contend doctors should be allowed to espouse views without fear of being reprimanded this cuts both ways said sen manny diaz a hialeah republican we need to protect the freedom of speech outside of the profession regardless of the political views of the doctors a similar bill has been filed in the house of representatives hb 687 was referred to four committees but has not been heard to date new recruits last week the first class of learn work program students received

investigating whether a refillable drug reservoir about the size of a grain of rice can be implanted into the eye as an alternative to anti vegf injections gene therapy is also a possibility researchers are using already proven gene therapy methods to deliver a treatment that enables the eye to make its own anti vegf medicine this is an exciting time for clinical research for age related macular degeneration that gives hope to many of our patients said rahul n khurana a retina specialist and clinical spokesperson for the american academy of ophthalmology for dry amd patients suffering

in a world long characterized by war and preparations for it religious groups have taught a variety of responses ranging from nonparticipation to defining a just war and how it could be fought morally but some religious groups and leaders have rejected the idea that warfare is a necessary part of human nature and human history in order to eliminate the war system and solve humanity s many global problems such as genocide terrorism violations of human rights and environmental degradation due to global warming they have advocated for the creation of a democratic world federal government that would create just world laws and prosecute individuals who violate them violent conflicts would be settled and global problems would be solved through a nonviolent democratic process a world constitution would make explicit the powers and limitations of the world federation the powers and limitations of national governments and the rights and responsibilities of all citizens of the world according to the teachings of baha u llah 1817 1892 and the baha i universal house of justice acceptance of the oneness of humanity is a prerequisite for establishing a world federation roman catholic bishops at the second vatican council 1962 1965 called for outlawing war by international consent and creating a universal public authority that would safeguard security justice and human rights in their encyclicals pope john xxiii pope benedict xvi and pope francis have stated that there is an urgent need for a true world political authority that would be regulated by law observe the principles of subsidiarity and solidarity promote human development manage globalization and establish the common good many individuals within religions that lack a central teaching authority have also promoted the goal of a world federation for example many liberal protestant christians and many unitarian universalists are world federalists rabbi mordecai kaplan the founder of reconstructionist judaism called for a federal united states of the world so that war and international anarchy could be eliminated many people in other religions have emphasized the need for a global system of enforceable world laws instead of the current international system that is based on unenforceable treaties between nations at the parliament of the world s religions in toronto in 2018 the hindu swami agnivesh said that instead of spending trillions of dollars on the war system the peoples of the world need to unite and create a world parliament based on an earth constitution he said that without a world government we cannot solve our major world problems many buddhists have been promoting the buddha s goal of relieving suffering for all beings through love compassion and nonviolence the japanese buddhist scholar nikkyo niwano has said that then the whole world will become one buddha land and that a world federation should be our blueprint for achieving this goal before the legal and political superstructure of a democratic world federation can be formed the world s religions have the responsibility of building a firm foundation for it by emphasizing their versions of the golden rule common ethical commandments loyalty to the human family world citizenship and stewardship of creation they need to be committed to interreligious dialogue and cooperation as well as act according to the principles of the declaration of a global ethic and the charter for compassion that have been promoted at the parliaments of the world s religions when a critical mass of people around the world agrees on this requirement then the dream of the ancient jewish prophets can finally be realized they shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks one nation shall not raise the sword against another nor shall they train for war again david c oughton s doctorate is in philosophies and theologies of peace and justice he has taught courses in the world s religions at saint louis university and other schools for many years and is a board member of citizens for global solutions education fund
by anshuman daga singapore reuters after years of struggling to emerge from the shadows of regional rivals singapore exchange is looking to establish itself as the hub for blank cheque firms riding on regulatory overhaul support by state firms and a tech boom in its back yard encouraged by the flurry of southeast asian tech start ups seeking funding and the bourse s revised rules singapore could list up to a dozen special purpose acquisition companies spacs within the next 12 18 months bankers venture capitalists and analysts say a key test for sgx will come when such companies also known as blank cheque or shell firms have to seal merger targets within two years a de spacing process already weighing on u s deals as hundreds of spacs chase targets analysts say singapore faces a challenge to get its traditionally risk averse investors interested in a new asset class especially after sgx has met with limited success in its previous attempts to shore up its equity market in contrast large international institutions have turned to hong kong for blockbuster equity listings over the past decade while a craze in spacs has fizzled out in the united states since early 2021 amid regulatory scrutiny and poor returns sgx hosted three spacs last month in their first major debut in asia the attraction is that they are simpler and typically more rewarding for startups than an ipo looking at the response for the first spacs the pipeline is very strong said eng kwok seat moey capital markets head at dbs joint issue manager on two spac ipos with credit suisse singapore spacs are likely to chase targets in fintech tech and consumer sectors bankers say valuations of targets could range between s 800 million 596 million to up to s 2 billion with dealmaking likely as early as this year the size of the opportunity of younger companies scaling up and going for listings is several times what it was many years ago and over the next decade it ll be multiples of those said ashish wadhwani a singapore based managing partner at ivycap ventures an indian firm managing about 400 million of assets last year fundraising on sgx halved to 565 million a six year low with just eight listings refinitiv data shows underlying singapore s cautious approach state investor temasek linked entities featured among cornerstone investors in two of the three spacs all of which were oversubscribed vertex venture holdings a temasek subsidiary and one of southeast asia s largest funds was the first to launch a s 200 million tech spac in january cautious start i expect the exchange and regulators to be quite careful in all these processes i don t think they will suddenly just open up the floodgates and everybody can come said chua kee lock ceo of vertex which manages 5 1 billion of assets backers of regional tech and industrial buyout fund novo tellus s 150 million spac included a temasek unit european asset manager tikehau capital which has two europe listed spacs also chose singapore for a s 170 million spac listing with co sponsors including lvmh chairman bernard arnault the latest moves could lead to more global funds playing an active role in public equity markets in singapore which is already a leading asian finance and wealth hub it s a chicken and egg situation maybe if you create this spac market then more investors will come wadhwani said spacs typically offer stock with warrants which are viewed as a key way to attract early investors still for wealthy investors such as prantik mazumdar the listing of big regional names in singapore and successful business mergers of spacs are crucial before he chooses them over directly investing in pre ipo u s tech companies unless there are exclusive opportunities in specific sectors and differentiated structures that spacs offer i m probably on the fence mazumdar said in 2010 sgx deliberated on spacs but didn t get favourable market feedback last year it launched a spac framework with a focus on scrutinising track record of sponsors it required them to invest in their spacs and unlike in hong kong sgx allowed participation from retail investors a spac listing can definitely help a start up exit and raise funds faster with less hassle said chandra tjan co founder of indonesia focussed alpha jwc ventures last year singapore also announced two funds with s 2 billion in capital for late stage funding and ipos as dealmaking surges twenty private companies in southeast asia joined the ranks of those valued at 1 billion or more in 2021 while 53 firms joined the list of those with near term potential of being valued at 1 billion data from research firm tracxn shows fundamentally the benchmark to be a sponsor in singapore is higher between the capital requirements and the willingness to embrace independent directors who will decide the de spac said neil parekh ceo of pegasus asia the tikehau backed singapore spac singapore s success as a global hub for real estate investment trusts reits could be a template to build a spac market singapore has the necessary ingredients to build a healthy spacs market and it can develop in the same way as the reit market if we keep a close watch over the quality of sponsors and maintain overall listing standards said mohamed nasser ismail sgx s head of equity capital markets 1 1 3426 singapore dollars reporting by anshuman daga editing

however recent sharp rise in bond yields may already have tightened the local financial conditions a bit too hastily for rbi s comfort we therefore expect mpc to embark on a gradual tightening cycle

policy normalization underway rbi s support to bond markets is expected to remain constrained going forward even as headline inflation remains within the rbi s target band tough as it may be rbi will

trading opportunity for traders who missed the move due to sharp recovery this view remains valid as long as we hold the sacrosanct support of 17 240 on a closing basis on the higher side 17 700 17 800 are the immediate levels to watch out for if global markets support we may see nifty surpassing these hurdles to move towards the 18 000 mark the banking remains the space to track as we expect the major contribution to come from this heavyweight basket the only disappointing factor last week was the underperformance of the individual stocks generally in a quiet market individual themes

jin ding china daily uncertainties stemming from the us could set back the global recovery the global economy saw a relatively quick recovery in 2021 with china and the united states being among the first countries to see production returning to pre pandemic levels the problems that remain unresolved are the global governance deficit and the long term confrontation between china and the us looking ahead there are a number of risks looming though in 2022 the shift in us monetary policy could spark turmoil in financial markets as the us inflation rate is rising faster than expected the federal reserve has strengthened its resolve to curb it with its stance becoming hawkish but financial risks associated with interest rate hikes and the shrinking balance sheet are rising one of the triggers are zombie companies in the us bond market at present zombie companies account for nearly 10 percent of listed companies in the us and nearly half of the corporate bonds in the bond market are rated bbb which is the lowest level of investment grade if these bonds are downgraded to junk bonds investment funds will be forced to undersell on a large scale triggering debt risks the us stock bubble is also of concern in 2021 us stock markets repeatedly hit new highs in early november the price earnings ratio of the dow jones industrial average was about 30 nearly the highest level in its history the bubbles in the us stock market are more severe than the dot com bubbles during the last policy tightening cycle after the us federal funds target rate was increased to 1 5 percent and the 10 year treasury yield rose to 2 5 percent the stock market experienced a sharp correction meanwhile some developing countries have defaulted on their debts with the increasingly uneven global recovery the debt burden of developing countries has soared the international monetary fund predicted in october 2021 that the output of the advanced economies will return to pre pandemic levels by 2022 while aggregate output of the developing economies excluding china is expected to remain 5 5 percent below the pre pandemic forecast in 2024 the uneven distribution of vaccines and the lack of

as the infrastructure investment and jobs act and the build back better act will come into force this year and the united states innovation and competition act which is now under legislative process will probably be passed and implemented these laws are all aimed at enabling the return of supply chains while promoting the targeted decoupling in terms of products technologies industries and regions with china this year there could also be further reshaping in the supply chains due to diligence laws in the european union which is aimed at strengthening the control of human rights and

power of resource rich countries has increased meanwhile with the pandemic exacerbating their fiscal crises the governments of resource rich countries are eager to increase their revenue these factors have all contributed to a significant rise in resource nationalism in the context of rising global protectionism since the onset of the pandemic key resource exporters have stepped up intervention by

georgia gubernatorial candidate stacey abrams d fired back at her likely republican opponents following criticism over a photo of herself unmasked at a school event it is shameful that our opponents are using a black history month reading event for georgia children as the impetus for a false political attack and it is pitiful and predictable that our opponents continue to look for opportunities to distract from their failed records when it comes to protecting the public health during the pandemic abrams said in a statement posted to social media advertisement advertisement georgia gov brian kemp r who is facing a primary challenge from former sen david perdue r ga in a tweet on saturday criticized the photo of abrams in a decatur elementary school stacey abrams wants state government mask mandates for georgians and their children but it looks like they wouldn t apply when she s attending a photo op the governor said purdue whom former president trump has endorsed to replace kemp also criticized abrams in a statement on sunday where is stacey s mask we all know stacey abrams hypocrisy knows no bounds perdue s statement said advertisement advertisement liberals thirst for power during this pandemic has caused enormous damage to our kids while the elite like stacey continue living their lives what is even worse is that this is a classroom in brian kemp s georgia not new york or california he added all of the children and other adults in the photo are masked in her response on sunday abrams also took aim at perdue and kemp over their public health track records one of stacey s opponents downplayed the virus while trading stock to profit off the pandemic after his private coronavirus briefings as a senator her statement said in a nod to perdue s controversial record of trading stocks during the covid 19 pandemic advertisement advertisement another of her opponents attacked mayors seeking to protect their citizens and has failed to expand access to medicaid even as rural hospitals close she said of kemp who feuded with former atlanta mayor keisha lance bottoms d over the city s mask mandate this pathetic transparent and silly attack is beneath anyone who claims he wants to lead georgia the statement added of the criticism from the gop candidates a campaign spokesperson for abrams told the atlanta journal constitution that the gubernatorial candidate encourages masking requirements for students faculty and staff members at schools view comments
the writer a los angeles freelancer is a former detroit news business reporter who blogs at starkman approved by eric starkman gov gretchen whitmer speaking friday at the train station phoyto state of michigan the writer h l mencken famously said no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american public michigan gov gretchen whitmer and ford motor co last week proved a variation of that saying no one ever got bad publicity underestimating the gullibility of the detroit area media as i was reading the detroit news fawning coverage hailing plans for a transportation innovation zone what struck me as the only significant news of the ballyhooed public private partnership was that michigan is earmarking 126 million in taxpayer money to support the iconic train station s redevelopment that s on top of the some 250 million of taxpayer money that was contributed for the renovations to create the appearance that the project was already generating results ford called in a chit with its google partner to sprinkle some silicon valley pixie dust on the effort with the announcement that the multinational technology company has proudly become a founding member of michigan central i think this is going to be a hub for research on all sorts of things that we can t even envision as we sit here today and i think we d like to continue to build out the partnership and have others come in google cfo ruth porat was quoted as saying ruth porat photo by world economic forum porat clearly does a lot of thinking that s why she gets paid the big bucks 51 million in 2020 so what exactly is google committing to as a founding member it plans to open a lab to teach computer science to high school students and partnering with local nonprofits to offer a nebulous career certification program that ford has agreed to recognize oh and the company will also provide cloud computing for the project i m confident in speculating that porat wasn t visiting detroit especially this time of year to announce a program that is of no business significance to google a more likely reason is that ford and google are planning something much bigger expanding on their already significant relationship ford and google last february announced a six year deal for in car connectivity and cloud services that ford ceo jim farley said was worth hundreds of millions of dollars the announcement was a big deal for both companies because the arrangement allowed ford to streamline its operations and eliminate jobs while giving google some credibility in the cloud computing business an area where amazon and microsoft are kicking the company s butt rising stock ford s stock popped this week after bloomberg reported that the company plans to spend more on vehicle electrification and consider a partial spinoff of its ev business ford ceo jim farley ev is all the rage on wall street and farley knows how to play to his audience on a call to discuss ford s lackluster earnings farley told investors he was already running ford s ev businesses and internal combustion engine businesses as separate companies i m struck at how different the rhythm of this digital bev business is versus ice farley said running a successful ice business and a successful bev business is not the same never mind that ford s 2 0 billion quarterly operating income fell behind tesla s 2 6 billion a likely spinoff of ford s ev business spells big trouble for michigan and detroit rest assured ford s ev headquarters won t be in michigan the company has earmarked more than 11 billion for ev manufacturing in tennessee and kentucky austin where tesla relocated its headquarters and where gm has its largest it innovation center is another possibility since 2009 gm has invested more than 2 billion in texas where it has 13 facilities and 9 000 employees rivian until recently another high flying ev company in which ford has an interest relocated its headquarters to california from plymouth more than a year ago reportedly because ceo rj scaringe believed that being a michigan based company gave the company a stodgy image establishing an ev headquarters outside of michigan would likely boost ford s stock something detroit s media loves to crow about eyes on india and mexico ford has already signaled its plans to diminish its michigan footprint the company announced last september it plans a major expansion of its white collar engineering technology and business operations workforce in india where it already has 11 000 employees ford s acclaimed ev mustang is made in mexico get the picture the michigan central depot announcement last week provided whitmer cover for her inability to attract significant investment in michigan save for gm lacking any announcement of substance whitmer shamelessly slathered on meaningless pr pablum ford is an american icon that has left its mark on michigan and the world for more than 100 years and we are proud to partner with ford and other founding members at michigan central to shape the next century of transportation solutions while reducing emissions and accelerating electrification whitmer said friday in a news release by embracing a whole of government approach in our collaboration with michigan central and the city of detroit we are writing the playbook for a new kind of partnership that keeps michigan at the forefront of mobility for generations to come together we can continue growing michigan s economy putting michiganders first and win the next century of auto manufacturing and technology development meanwhile in ohio michiganders should take note of what s going on in neighboring ohio intel announced last month it plans to invest at least 20 billion to build two chip factories just outside columbus the company said the site could be expanded to accommodate as many as eight chip factories with intel spending as much as 100 billion to build them the initial two factories will employ 3 000 workers earning an annual average salary of 135 000 the project also is expected to create 7 000 construction jobs and 10 000 indirect jobs intel has also pledged 100 million for ohio educational institutions to ensure a pipeline of talent and support research programs in the region compare that to google s commitment to launch a coding school for high school students in yet another win for ohio fuel cell maker manufacturer hyperion announced a few days ago it plans to relocate its headquarters to columbus from california and open a 65 acre plant the largest new factory in columbus in over a decade the factory is expected to create more than 680 jobs with an annual payroll of more than 58 million hyperion ceo angelo kafrantaris is yet another person with michigan ties who hightailed it out of here he graduated from the college of creative studies in detroit google co founder larry page is a university of michigan alumnus one can t blame farley for wanting to exit michigan the automotive industry has become more competitive than ever and ford needs to attract the best and the brightest and forge partnerships with companies around the world in tennessee ford can rely on the full support of the state s leaders including members of congress dearborn s congressional representative is rashida tlaib an internationally renowned antisemite who advocates a boycott of israeli companies ford and gm have critical research facilities in israel as does every major technology company what what he does not says ford is so done with michigan it didn t even bother to meet with whitmer to see if she could come up with a better deal than tennessee offered farley recently told crain s detroit business that he loves michigan but actions speak louder than words william clay ford jr photo ford motor co ford chairman william clay ford jr deserves credit for his herculean commitment to detroit including spearheading the michigan central depot redevelopment but he can t change the fact that michigan is fraught with dismal leadership on both sides of the aisle the detroit media s chamber of commerce cheerleading journalism does their readers and viewers a great disservice they stood idly by as former beaumont health ceo john fox destroyed a once prominent and proud hospital system and last week that company faded into oblivion more companies will join ford in the stampede out of michigan the story that needs to be written is how can michigan s decline be reversed and who has the political smarts and capabilities to pull it off whitmer has conclusively demonstrated she s not up to the task reach the writer at eric starkmanapproved com beaumont employees and vendors are encouraged to reach out with confidentiality assured support our reporting by becoming a deadline detroit member for as little as 3 per month
meta platforms inc has threatened to pull two of their most popular platforms facebook and instagram out of europe due to a recent european union court ruling that restricted how the company uses european users data to target online advertisements the comment was included in meta s form 10 k annual financial report for 2021 filed with the u s security and exchange commission sec on feb 2 by the company s chief financial officer david wehner facebook rebranded as meta last october in conjunction with ceo mark zuckerberg s efforts to build a metaverse platform and to include the company s broader swath of social media platforms including instagram facebook messenger and whatsapp the reason for meta s threat to pull its platforms from europe as flagged by a report by itwire s david m williams was the schrems ii decision by the eu s court of justice back in july 2020 the case originated in 2011 when an austrian attorney named maximillian schrems analyzed 1 222 pages of information facebook had collected about him and discovered details he believed he had deleted and others he had not consented to be shared in europe facebook is under the jurisdiction of ireland which it chose for tax reasons so schrems filed a complaint there with the irish data protection commissioner the court wrote williams ruled that a u s law that authorized the collection of personal data from eu subjects did not provide adequate safeguards for individual s privacy or effective means to seek redress against the us government and was therefore noncompliant with the european general data protection regulation gdpr meta is continuing to challenge that ruling as part of their required disclosures meta s form 10 k viewable here relevant section begins on page 8 lists factors that could affect their business and therefore their stock price under a section titled government regulation meta s 2021 report notes that the company is subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the united states and abroad that involve matters central to our business many of which are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that harm our business and then lists various area of regulation including privacy data use data protection and personal information biometrics encryption rights of publicity and other privacy related issues the report continues specifically citing how some of these laws and regulations include ones that dictate whether how and under what circumstances we can transfer process and or receive certain data that is critical to our operations including data shared between countries or regions in which we operate and data shared among our products and services if we are unable to transfer data between and among countries and regions in which we operate or if we are restricted from sharing data among our products and services it could affect our ability to provide our services the manner in which we provide our services or our ability to target ads which could adversely affect our financial results the report declares before leading into several sentences discussing the schrems ii eu court decision and specifically spelling out the threat to withdraw from europe altogether if a new transatlantic data transfer framework is not adopted and we are unable to continue to rely on sccs or rely upon other alternative means of data transfers from europe to the united states we will likely be unable to offer a number of our most significant products and services including facebook and instagram in europe which would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the report also notes that new or proposed laws and regulations in the u s and around the world could significantly affect our business by imposing compliance costs or causing them to decide to withdraw other products for example the report cites possible ew legislation or regulatory decisions that restrict our ability to collect and use information about minors as potentially result in limitations on our advertising services or our ability to offer products and services to minors in certain jurisdictions update 2 35 pm et feb 7 2022 a meta spokesperson sent the following comment to mediaite we have absolutely no desire and no plans to withdraw from europe but the simple reality is that meta and many other businesses organisations and services rely on data transfers between the eu and the us in order to operate global services like other companies we have followed european rules and rely on standard contractual clauses and appropriate data safeguards to operate a global service fundamentally businesses need clear global rules to protect transatlantic data flows over the long term and like more than 70 other companies across a wide range of industries we are closely monitoring the potential impact on our european operations as these developments progress have a tip we should know tips mediaite com
joe rogan s mouth has put spotify in a tough spot anti coronavirus vaccine comments and racial slurs on some episodes of his popular podcast are forcing the streaming service to weigh difficult choices spotify must decide where it stands on race relations and vaccine misinformation in a society with heightened sensitivity to both issues joe rogan has put spotify in a tough spot ap then there s the business decision about what to do with rogan s 100 million podcast which threatens the bottom line but is also a key part of the company s strategy to be a one stop shop for audio neither the streaming service nor rogan was talking yesterday but experts say spotify s management team has to choose whether to sever ties with rogan as it risks more musicians yanking their work in protest or is there some middle ground that might be acceptable to artists and subscribers whatever decision emerges won t sit well with one side or the other in an increasingly polarised country on race the choice is between keeping rogan and sending a message that society has become too woke or showing that spotify is more attuned to a multiracial society said adia harvey wingfield a sociology professor at washington university in st louis if spotify says we can t drop him he has the right to say what he wants that continues on the line where there is this implicit support to say racist things on these platforms she said the streaming site also has to decide whether offensive words are allowable elsewhere on its app where songs with racist homophobic and anti immigrant messages are available said john wihbey a northeastern university professor and specialist in emerging technologies there s some real self examination to be doing beyond joe professor wihbey said this is a big moment of reckoning for entertainment and streaming platforms to see where the window is what s over the line neil young pulled his music from spotify over the service s hosting of joe rogan content ap the bottom line question should be pretty simple for spotify said erik gordon a university of michigan business and law professor the conservative rogan stands in contrast to the much more liberal musicians who generate the bulk of spotify s profits he said they can t blow off the artists the artists make spotify professor gordon said they need to settle up with mr rogan let him go to a home that will be consistent with who he is and everybody will be better off having rogan on spotify is like having a political party with donald trump as the presidential candidate and liberal elizabeth warren as vice president it isn t going to work professor gordon said spotify reports having 406 million active monthly users up nearly 20 per cent from last year and advertising has grown largely because of podcasting the company had 31 per cent of the 524 million music streaming subscriptions worldwide in the second quarter of 2021 more than double that of second place apple music according to midia research rogan s public troubles started on january 24 when musician neil young asked to have his music removed because of concerns that rogan was promoting scepticism about the covid 19 vaccines other artists followed suit including joni mitchell and roxane gay the scrutiny only intensified when a video compilation emerged last week showing rogan repeatedly using racial slurs grammy winning artist india arie posted it on her instagram using the hashtag deletespotify the company has yet to publicly address the slurs but spotify recently removed dozens of episodes of the podcast neil young asked to have his music removed because of concerns that rogan was promoting scepticism about the covid 19 vaccines and more artists have followed amy harris invision ap spotify which reportedly paid over us 100 million 140 million to licence rogan s podcast said previously that it would soon add a warning to all podcasts that discuss covid 19 directing listeners to factual up to date information from scientists and public health experts they take this money that s built from streaming and they pay this guy 100 million but they pay us like 003 of a penny arie wrote i don t
