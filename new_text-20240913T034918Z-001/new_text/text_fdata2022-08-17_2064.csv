march 2021 disney stock could be a long term winner at current prices but there are still some risk factors to consider it s too early to call disney a cord cutting winner disney has done an admirable job of rapidly building and attracting subscribers to disney streaming and it s clear that the service is putting significant pressure on netflix however disney will also have to contend with the streaming market becoming increasingly competitive rivals including warner bros discovery and paramount global seem to be finding their footing in the space and the most valuable geographic territories for streaming subscriptions are already fairly saturated when it comes to basic streaming adoption on a sequential basis disney actually added just 100 000 subscribers in q3 and weaker pricing power in many other geographic markets means overall revenue growth for the service will be harder to deliver while disney undeniably has a strong content library and industry leading production capabilities mounting competition could limit pricing power and increase churn given that the house of mouse has invested so much into disney and pinned much of its future growth on the platform being a success that presents a major risk factor particularly in light of other challenges facing the business disney s theatrical and parks businesses are seeing strong rebounds now that pandemic related pressures have eased but the outlook for its linear media networks unit isn t as inspiring led by espn the traditional television business has actually been the company s most important performance driver over the last decade and the cord cutting issue hasn t been solved just because disney has gotten off to a strong start right now disney gets more than 8 per month in affiliate fee revenue for every north american household with a cable package including the channel about 76 million households had those cable subscriptions at the end of the last fiscal year which was down from 84 million in fiscal 2020 meanwhile disney s pared down espn streaming offering had an average monthly paid subscription price of 4 55 in q3 on a subscriber base of 22 8 million disney is also raising the price of its streaming services creating added pressure to perform well or potentially lose subscribers if the company isn t able to successfully bridge espn into the streaming space it stands to lose substantial high margin revenue and there s still plenty of uncertainty on that front should you invest in this entertainment giant disney stock isn t without risk factors but it looks like a worthwhile buy at current prices while growing in the streaming space will probably be costly and the company s traditional tv business could decline the overall business continues to look very strong disney has the best collection of franchises and production studios in the entertainment industry and synergies across its segments mean the house of mouse is much more than the sum of its parts

president joe biden signed the inflation reduction act of 2022 into law during a ceremony at the white house on tuesday august 16 the bill i m about to sign is not just about today it s about tomorrow biden said it s about delivering progress and prosperity to american families it s about showing the american and the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the talk of its demise not just for the privileged few but for all of us he added the bill includes 369 billion in investments to help battle climate change and provide energy security plus an additional 64 billion to expand expiring affordable care act subsidies for two years the legislation also provides 80 billion to the irs to pay for the spending and reduce the deficit the bill will create a 15 minimum tax on large corporations and a 1 tax on stock buybacks it will also help reduce the deficit by allowing medicare to negotiate the prices of certain prescription drugs the increased taxes and reduced medicare costs are expected to raise around 700 billion over ten years despite its name the bill is not expected to reduce inflation an analysis by the congressional budget office found that the legislation will have a negligible effect on inflation this year in 2023 the legislation could result in a 0 1 reduction in inflation or cause inflation to rise by 0 1
washington ap president joe biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he signed tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for some 13 million people who are purchasing their own health care policies through the affordable care act biggest u s investment by far in climate change the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water how to pay for all of this one of the biggest revenue raisers in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year yet money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade sinema was instrumental in doing away with other tax proposals and shaping the final plan extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which recently put out a new report on long term projections what s left behind the package nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned remains a sizable undertaking and along with covid 19 relief and the gop 2017 tax cuts is among the more substantial bills from congress in years while congress did pass and biden signed into law a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that was part of the white house s initial vision the democrats other big priorities have slipped away gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs also allowed to expire is the enhanced child care credit that was providing 300 a month during the pandemic find more local

but inflation and high gas prices are still taking a toll on profits and customer visits dutch bros bros 0 31 delivered another quarter of strong growth finally reaching 1 billion in revenue on a trailing 12 month basis but inflation is taking a toll on profit margins and on its lower income customers even as it forces the drive thru coffee chain to continuously raise prices although management raised its full year revenue guidance investors still need to take the long view when buying its stock because almost all of dutch bros gains are coming from new store openings comparable store sales fell during the quarter and though they are still above 2019 levels this period of rising prices and higher costs is going to be challenging driving growth higher the coffee shop beat analyst top line expectations of 182 million by seeing revenue surge 44 to 186 4 million as it opened its 600th store in the period the new stores are performing above expectations with an annualized unit volume auv of 2 1 million while those opened in 2020 and 2021 are generating auvs 10 above the systemwide average it indicates dutch bros business model can be successfully replicated as it expands its footprint across the country the drive thru chain currently operates in 14 states suggesting there is plenty of room for future expansion yet dutch bros came up short on the bottom line reporting adjusted profits of 0 05 per share compared to wall street s forecast of 0 07 per share even though it has been raising prices to offset the impact of inflation the coffee shop completed a second round of 3 price hikes on june 1 which followed a similar increase back in november and dutch bros is contemplating raising prices again in the back half of the current year running out of gas although you can t blame dutch bros for needing to offset its own higher expenses it s finding that its customers can t afford to pay for the increases and those with incomes below 40 000 a year are not coming back especially in california where gas prices are much higher than the national average but also in oregon lower income customers are falling off the edge dutch bros found store traffic in california for example plunged 40 among those making under 40 000 a year it may be they re still getting their morning cup of coffee but they re not coming back again as much of the drop off is occurring in the afternoon and evening as primarily a drive thru shop dutch bros is going to be particularly affected by the historically high gas prices although the national average has finally dipped below 4 a gallon that s still 25 above where it was a year ago for comparison to see what dutch bros is up against in california gasoline s statewide average is still 5 38 per gallon or 35 higher it s 4 88 per gallon in oregon at the end of last year oregon and california represented over 48 of dutch bros total locations keep your eyes on the horizon dutch bros remains upbeat however and expects total revenue for the year to reach at least 715 million an improvement over the 700 million to 715 million range it previously guided toward wall street also has a positive outlook for the coffee stock with analysts at baird barclays and piper sandler all raising their price targets on its shares ranging from 37 per share to 50 per share dutch bros stock is down 13 for the year and 46 below its recent highs while shares have more than doubled off the lows it hit back in may the drive thru chain remains a growing company but macroeconomic events may wreak havoc on performance quarter to quarter which is why investors will need to focus on the long term opportunity this growth stock represents
president joe biden wiped 3 9 billion from the student loan records tuesday more than 200 000 former students who still owe on a federal student loan from their time at itt technical institute will see their loan balances cleared whether they ve applied for forgiveness or not itt educational services closed its campuses in 2016 after years of questioning and scrutiny of its accreditation standards and recruiting processes at the time the institution had about 45 000 students across 130 campuses some of the former students were already eligible for federal student loans forgiveness but this move applies to all borrowers who took on debt attending the school between 2005 and september 2016 when the school closed this brings the total amount of loan discharges under biden to nearly 32 billion and leaves many wondering what more could be forgiven or at least if payments will remain on pause don t miss the pause has been helpful for millions after mortgages student loans make up the biggest chunk of household debt at more than 1 5 trillion according to the brookings institution at the start of the pandemic the government froze student loan repayments for most borrowers in april the white house extended the moratorium for the sixth time through to august 31 this pause will help 41 million people keep up with their monthly bills and meet their basic needs vice president kamala harris said in an announcement it will give borrowers some urgently needed time to prepare for a return to repayment a letter addressed to biden and secretary of education miguel cardona and signed by more than 100 lawmakers highlighted those positive effects of the freeze for the first time many borrowers have had the opportunity to pay down debt open a savings account purchase a home and save for retirement none of which would have been possible without the payment pause as the letter pointed out many used the break to save up to buy homes pay off credit cards or catch up on other bills resuming student loan payments would force millions of borrowers to choose between paying their federal student loans or putting a roof over their heads food on the table or paying for child care and health care the lawmakers wrote a path to forgiveness mark kantrowitz a student loans expert who s written five books about scholarships and financial aid says there are three potential paths to forgiveness regulation legislation or executive authority story continues if the president were to use executive action to cancel student debt he would face legal challenges that kantrowitz does not expect would not go biden s way and congress has not yet passed legislation for broad loan forgiveness nor does it seem poised to regulation might be the president s best bet says kantrowitz whose books include how to appeal for more financial aid the federal government offers four income driven repayment plans which set loan payments at amounts meant to be affordable to borrowers based on their incomes and family size most people forget these are also loan forgiveness plans kantrowitz says after making qualifying payments for 20 or 25 years depending on the plan borrowers can have their remaining debt eliminated those who work in public service may qualify for forgiveness after just 10 years of payments one of four plans the income contingent repayment plan gives the u s department of education broad regulatory authority such that it could be remade into a means tested loan forgiveness program says kantrowitz means testing a method of determining eligibility for government assistance is a way of addressing the concern over helping people who might not need it biden doesn t believe that that millionaires and billionaires obviously should benefit or even people from the highest income former white house press secretary jen psaki said after biden s remarks in the spring so that s certainly something he would be looking at will he or won t he one likely reason that biden hasn t followed through on his campaign proposal is the economic and geopolitical fallout of the pandemic and the war in ukraine says siri terjesen a management professor and associate dean at florida atlantic university with year on year inflation closing in on 10 policymakers who remember basic economics will want to curb further stimulus in order to bring inflation back under control she said in an email a large student loan forgiveness program would drive up inflation even faster since the beginning of 2020 biden has forgiven billions of dollars worth of student debt through other programs those include plans for borrowers who were misled by their schools those with disabilities and others who work in public service the push for more continues the majority of americans support student debt cancellation massachusetts sen elizabeth warren argued in a senate committee hearing this spring there is scarcely a working person in america who does not have a friend or family member or coworkers who is weighted down by student loan debt said warren who supports forgiving 50 000 per borrower canceling that amount would cost 904 billion and forgive the full balances of about 30 million or 79 of borrowers according to a report from the federal reserve bank of new york economists forgiving 10 000 per borrower would cost 321 billion and eliminate the entire balance for 11 8 million borrowers or about 31 adding an income cap to forgiveness proposals substantially reduces the cost of student loan forgiveness and increases the share of benefit going to borrowers who are more likely to struggle repaying their debts the report says potential problems with broad student debt forgiveness advocates of broad forgiveness argue that student loans contribute to racial and socioeconomic wealth gaps but there are better ways to reduce racial wealth gaps argues adam looney a senior fellow at the brookings institution looney posits that student loan forgiveness is regressive and only targeted debt relief policies can work to address inequities caused by federal student loan programs measured appropriately student debt is concentrated among high wealth households and loan forgiveness is regressive whether measured by income educational attainment or wealth he writes across the board forgiveness is therefore a costly and ineffective way to reduce economic gaps by race or socioeconomic status the next steps kantrowitz expects biden to make one more extension of the payment pause and interest waiver that will last until after the upcoming midterm elections while the white house has kept its cards close to its chest kantrowitz believes that loan forgiveness is likely to happen and if it happens it s likely to be limited in amount and eligibility he says biden has already ruled out canceling 50 000 worth of debt but 10 000 of forgiveness is still on the table meanwhile the issue continues to shine light on the rising costs of going to college college tuition and fees were about 170 more expensive in 2021 than in 2001 tejersen cites in a new book on reducing higher education bureaucracy the silver lining in the student debt fiasco she says is that more americans recognize the need to identify affordable college options with files from nancy sarnoff what to read next sign up for our moneywise investing newsletter to

washington president joe biden signed his party s signature climate health care and tax package into law tuesday capping off more than a year of tumultuous negotiations that saw his original proposal to congress slimmed down considerably flanked by a handful of democrats including senate majority leader chuck schumer house majority whip jim clyburn and west virginia sen joe manchin iii biden sharply contrasted his outlook for the country with that of republicans who unanimously voted against the package my fellow americans that s the choice we face we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build a future where everybody has an even shot biden said that s the america i believe in the law which passed the u s senate following a 51 50 vote and the u s house on a party line 220 207 vote totals about 750 billion in new spending though it would actually reduce the country s deficit in the long term by allowing medicare to negotiate some prescription drug prices and changing a handful of taxes sparse attendance the signing tuesday at the white house was attended by just five democrats in part because congress is in the middle of its august recess with lawmakers back in their home states campaigning ahead of the november elections reps frank pallone of new jersey and kathy castor of florida accompanied manchin schumer and clyburn but biden who returned to washington d c to sign the bill after vacationing at a south carolina beach plans to hold a second event to mark the bill s enactment on sept 6 that celebration will likely have many more democrats in attendance the bill is about showing the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the talk of its demise president joe biden no republicans voted for the package which democrats advanced using the complicated budget reconciliation process that gets around the u s senate s legislative filibuster biden said tuesday that the new law would set up americans for a better future the bill i m about to sign is not just about today it s about tomorrow biden said it s about delivering progress and prosperity to american families it s about showing the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the talk of its demise historic climate funding the law which will roll out in phases over the next few years will funnel 370 billion to clean energy programs including electric vehicle tax credits and tax incentives for energy companies to produce renewable energy biden said that the bill is the biggest step forward on climate ever it will cap medicare recipients out of pocket prescription costs at 2 000 annually beginning in 2025 and will allow the federal government to negotiate the prices of some of the more expensive medicare prescription drugs beginning in 2026 the cost of insulin for medicare patients would be capped at 35 though democrats were unable to keep a provision in the final agreement that would have capped the monthly co pay for people with private health insurance the proposals throughout the package are paid for by instituting a 15 minimum tax on corporations with incomes more than 1 billion and a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks as well as by allowing medicare to negotiate some prescription drug prices boosting internal revenue service coffers by 80 billion to increase compliance with tax laws already in place as well as the new changes is expected to bring in additional revenue helping to further offset the roughly 750 billion price tag for the package irs budget breakdown the irs funding would be divided up with 46 5 billion to bolster staff and update technology 25 3 billion for operations support 4 8 billion to update business systems and 3 2 billion for taxpayer services treasury secretary janet yellen wrote in a letter to irs commissioner charles p rettig earlier this month that the federal government s boost in funding for the agency would not lead audit rates to rise relative to recent years for households making under 400 000 annually instead enforcement resources will focus on high end noncompliance yellen wrote while the legislation named the inflation reduction act is expected to reduce the nation s deficit it likely won t have much of an impact on inflation according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office the agency s analysts wrote that the the bill would have a negligible effect on inflation during the current year and that during 2023 inflation would probably be between 0 1 percentage point lower and 0 1 percentage point higher under the bill than it would be under current law the penn wharton budget model from the university of pennsylvania had a similar assessment estimating that the law would have no meaningful effect on inflation in the near term but would reduce inflation by around 0 1 percentage points by the middle of the first decade these point estimates however are not statistically different from zero indicating a low level of confidence that the legislation would have any measurable impact on inflation the penn wharton budget model said many setbacks the legislation originally pitched by biden as a multi trillion dollar proposal dubbed build back better took more than a year to come together democrats in the u s house originally passed a 2 trillion package last november before the legislation stalled out in the u s senate amid disagreements between progressive and centrist democrats about the size and elements of the bill manchin and arizona democrat kyrsten sinema were considered significant obstacles to enacting many of the more progressive legislative goals including closing the carried interest loophole that primarily benefits wealthy hedge fund managers and providing subsidies for child care and paid family leave programs manchin and schumer a new york democrat relaunched negotiations earlier this summer following many starts and stops during the first half of the year at the time many democrats were skeptical anything would come of the closely held private talks but encouraged the two to reach a final agreement that would meet some of the party s goals the duo announced the surprise agreement on july 27 but schumer needed to make some tweaks to the bill to get sinema on board with the support of all 50 of the senate s democrats secured schumer brought the legislation to the floor for debate and an all night amendment voting session known as vote a rama earlier this month the senate passed the measure on a 51 50 vote on aug 7 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote amid uniform republican opposition the package then cleared the u s house on aug 12 after members broke their summer recess to return to capitol hill to debate and then vote on the bill promoting the new law biden and many of his cabinet secretaries are expected to travel throughout the country in the coming weeks to champion the new law ahead of the november midterm elections progressive democrats have already begun making their pitch to voters on the provisions left by the wayside telling constituents that those proposals could become law if more democrats are elected to congress later this year republicans who uniformly voted against the bill are making the opposite case during floor debate and on the campaign trail gop lawmakers say the law will increase energy costs lead to irs audits on families and small businesses and harm the economy our economy is in a fragile state as we emerge from this pandemic michigan gop rep fred upton said during floor debate while touting his support of several bipartisan packages this congress we have seen decades high inflation that is crushing main street and squeezing the middle class

batman is no stranger to challenges and intimidating foes he is gotham s protector after all territory that comes with some distinctive and larger than life enemies and threats but on the pages of dc s ongoing batman series the dark knight is currently facing a threat that is unlike anything we ve seen before something was recently revealed to be a bit more personal failsafe a robotic enemy that seems to know batman s every move and every thought even before he can think or move who is determined to shut batman down for good the most recent installment batman 126 alluded to failsafe being one of batman s own creations leading to the stunning reveal of the return of zur en arrh now ahead of batman 127 comicbook com caught up with the creative team behind this current batman run writer chip zdarsky and artist jorge jimenez as well as the belén ortega artist on the catwoman centric backup story also written by zdarsky to talk about that stunning turn of events tim drake s role in this latest challenge for batman stripping down one of dc s most complex characters and so much more chip zdarsky 1 comicbook com as a batman fan who has on more than a few occasions been called a batman obsessive i ve been loving your work on this title thus far especially that surprise with the batman of zur en arrh at the end of 126 it felt like something that brought everything to this wild new level and we get more of it in 127 why bring batman of zur en arrh into this chip zdarsky i mean like most things it just made sense because of the story i was telling i don t want to give too much away but bruce having an unsettling feeling being a bit off and the introduction of failsafe it all led me to zur i m a huge fan of the morrison run and getting to play with their elements has been incredibly fun prevnext chip zdarsky 2 one of the things that has been so enjoyable thus far is that we re getting into batman and really bruce wayne s head a great deal in a way that feels very grounded this is a batman that is both determined to do it himself but also very aware that this is bigger than just him and we see his appreciation for his family there s an especially moving part of this issue where we see bruce really confront the idea that he has a family rather than just sidekicks how did you approach this emotional core of what is an otherwise pretty bananas issue yeah it s kind of a reset that batman has to do every once in a while though this time it s through the lens of zur en arrh lurking in the back of his brain who is all about the war and soldiers batman s had a lot of sidekicks and satellite vigilantes in his life so it s hard to keep viewing that life as a one man war on crime his sense of responsibility and caring to those who have followed him down this path is growing and there are a lot of questions for him as a result of that and yeah the issue is bananas i ve really enjoyed how relentless this whole beginning has been and jorge is the perfect artist to showcase that wild energy and also the emotional beats prevnext chip zdarsky 3 tim s robin has been a big part of this story both in terms of his relationship with batman bruce and as well as his own efforts but we really see that sort of heightened in this issue why is tim the right robin for this story tim originally came in to batman s life to bring him back from the brink to balance out his darkness he s in that role again but he s grown so much since those days which makes him really fun to write as a companion to bruce dc fans know that batman infamously had a whole plan for how to stop the justice league and now it s pretty clear batman had a plan to stop himself and there s a really cool twist to that right at the end of this issue that i won t talk about because spoilers but i think people are going to love it the point here is that this story digs pretty deep into established history and lore which is awesome but what we get from this is almost a batman we ve never seen before vulnerable enough to put his trust in something else we get a very stripped down batman in this issue why did you choose this approach to the character stripped down is the best way to really dig into a character their fears their weaknesses what their core is it s been a lot of fun writing batman where he s at right now a little older maybe even a little unsure batman is highly competent the best at everything but sometimes that can just create character roadblocks you need to unsettle him once in a while prevnext chip zdarsky 4 you are also writing the catwoman backup story for this which is both connected to the main story but has something of a different tone how do you balance things between batman and catwoman yeah it s a little lighter just because selina isn t dealing with the same things bruce is currently but it s still a continuation of the story which has been a satisfying use of the backups for me and hopefully the readers a lot of the tone difference comes from belén on art as well she s amazing as i noted the catwoman backup story is its own tale but it intersects with the main batman story in that it spins out of penguin s death this final chapter of that story comes with a pretty surprising reveal that humanizes penguin in a way that i m not sure anyone ever has with the character what motivated this very specific way of approaching a character that has long been a thorn in batman s side whenever you write pre existing characters you look for things that haven t been done with them before or new ways of looking at them and their motivations with the penguin he s a fascinating character through and through and i thought his death could shed more light on who he really was and what he was going through prevnext chip zdarsky 5 how does this story change catwoman and her story at least in how you see things i mean everything i did here in our backup is based on what tini has planned for her she s in charge of catwoman with some amazing stories coming up and my hope is that what we ve done here in the backup just helps support those stories also i have one fun question for you your chipclass is the best thing i saw on the internet the week it came out and was a shot of serotonin i didn t know i needed when some of my colleagues found out i was getting to talk to you they all pretty much unanimously asked me to ask you if we could please get more chipclass sessions so i m here to humbly ask can we please get more chipclass sessions ha ha there are two more on the way they re being edited as we speak once you finish watching all three you ll basically be a marvel and dc writer prevnext jorge jimenez 1 comicbook com there s a really lovely emotional core to this issue where we see bruce really confront the idea that he has a family rather than just sidekicks the art here does just as much heavy lifting as the writing does as well there s a page where we see batman reflecting on all these memories that is just fantastic and kind of iconic what was your approach to the art in this issue particularly considering we have batman of zur en arrh who is very distinctive in the mix jorge jimenez a few months ago a friend who was a big fan of batman asked me man when will zur en arrh be back i had already read the script and knew that we were bringing this character but obviously i kept quiet lol i remember thinking inside how special this version of batman is for many readers and the responsibility i was taking on when creating these pages first i worked on a new design for this character giving it a slightly fresher and more current tone but consistent with the aesthetic that we are working on in the series and of course his way of acting his facial expression and his body language have been key elements to take into account when making the issue i remember that another essential aspect with zur en arrh is also the interaction he has with the other characters like robin i don t want to make spoilers about it but my intention is that it is clearly understood when it is bruce and when it is zur en arrh who is behind the mask prevnext jorge jimenez 2 this issue is kind of a wild ride of things visually we get a lot of action we get a lot of introspection we get different settings and a lot of facial expressions your facial expressions for the characters here are just top notch i particularly love tim s face palm moment talking with zur en arrh can you tell me a little about your approach to the art on this issue batman 127 is a journey inside bruce wayne with a perfectly executed script by chip i just remember being totally happy drawing these pages i think it has a frenetic rhythm and i wanted to adapt the visual narration to the different phases of the chapter as well as possible and yes the emotions and the expressions of the characters are very important here so that the reading flows and the reader is fully immersed i can only say that i hope you like it prevnext jorge jimenez 3 with this story having so many layers what was your collaboration with chip like for this issue working with chip both on this issue and on the others has been great he is a guy who is very clear about what he wants to show and at the same time is open to suggestions without any problem and totally respects my work everything really flows and i am very grateful to dc for having someone as great as a person and professional as a writer of this run his own trajectory defines him he also has a great sense of humor and is a lot of fun to have as a partner as for our collaboration working i think we are both comfortable with the project and i hope that is reflected in the pages of this batman thank you so much for everything prevnext belén ortega 1 comicbook com i love how visually different the catwoman story is from the main batman story but i particularly love how open visually the story looks there s a lightness and brightness with the colors but your use of space is really stunning what was your approach to the art here belén ortega when i was a child my biggest influence was manga comics and it is a style that is identified by having little mass of black and fine line usually since i work for the american market i have started to study other great references to be able to adapt my style to this market but trying to keep being me with catwoman i wanted to follow that line play with black and white and help the character move through the shadows since it s her natural environment prevnext belén ortega 2 did you have any inspirations for taking on not just catwoman here but a very specific change in a rather iconic character that i frankly didn t recognize well chip recommended me a very specific reference to redesign this character s new look but i won t reveal who although it has to do with the batman cinematic universe sometimes i like to be inspired by real actors because they help to give solidity to the characters it s a good way to stretch different angles and volumes in the face to make them all particular you won t believe this either but my inspiration for selina was also zoe kravitz my design doesn t look like her does it the idea is not to make them recognizable just to take details from here and there to compose your own prevnext belén ortega 3 what would you say was your biggest challenge and greatest reward favorite thing about the art in this issue the biggest reward is undoubtedly to be able to be in this series with this magnificent team and to draw catwoman of course the biggest challenge is to live up to it what was your collaboration with chip like on this story considering how it intersects with the main batman story the collaboration was super easy flowing and very natural i mean the whole batman team is super professional and everything works like a swiss watch it s a pleasure to work with people who are not only professional but also very polite and assertive in their personal dealings prevnext

especially heating oil which could mean higher bills this winter a challenging prospect for vermonters already feeling the effects of inflation in other areas of their lives the 2022 energy crunch the first in this country since two major supply challenges in the 1970s comes despite the fact that in part because of the controversial fracking boom america is now the world s top oil producer and is a net exporter of petroleum and gas a series of events has led to the current situation experts say the covid 19 pandemic an economic rebound reduced investment in oil and gas production after some fracking companies went bankrupt and russia s february invasion of ukraine which pushed global oil and gas prices up sharply the price for a barrel of oil reached 120 per barrel on june 6 although it has been coming down recently and stood at 90 50 on august 8 up from 68 a year earlier the high price of heating oil and propane have caused some local buyers to seek out pre buy oil and propane contracts which are also priced higher than last year and caused others to look to alternative heating sources such as wood stoves pellet stoves and heat pumps see article on page 5 about heat pumps according to steve freff hedges a long time employee of stove and flag works now working in the montpelier store the demand for wood stoves this year has been manic due to higher oil prices we ve probably seen a twofold increase in wood stove and pellet stove sales in the past year he said although the store has some stoves in stock many wood stove deliveries are scheduled a month out and some people will be waiting until january to get the wood stoves they want he said supply chain issues over the past two years have been an issue for the industry and labor shortages at stove manufacturers have also been a problem hedges said in addition to switching fuels another way to compensate for high prices is to insulate and air seal one s home efficiency vermont is offering a timely rebate of up to 75 for weatherization work for details go to www efficiencyvermont com rebates at today s prices insulating will pay for itself even faster than in recent years in september a year ago the average retail price for a gallon of heating oil in vermont was 2 77 and this month it is 4 73 according to data presented on the vermont department of public service website august 8 that s a 71 increase average retail propane prices rose a more modest 17 to 3 20 per gallon over the same time period according to the same website piped natural gas is a cheaper way to heat but in vermont it is only available in certain parts of addison franklin and chittenden counties with the gas pumped there from canada some fossil fuel customers like to pre buy their oil or propane locking in a known price although this requires paying a season s energy bill in advance however a number of local energy firms have been slow to offer a pre buy price this year because of the volatility of the market for example east montpelier based alco energy products typically offers its customers pre buy prices in the early summer but this year it held off but brian phillips owner of the company said in early august that he expected to have a pre buy price by mid august some fuel companies were charging cash customers 6 per gallon in may phillips said but prices have come down in the last month or so his firm s cash prices in early august were 4 399 per gallon for heating oil and 2 999 for propane customers who heat their homes with propane propane prices vary according to annual usage propane prices are a bit steadier than oil he said compared with last year s alco pre buy prices propane is up about 50 cents per gallon while heating oil is up more than 1 50 he said some other companies have offered pre buy rates trono fuels of barre had an oil pre buy price of 4 45 per gallon recently the offer expired august 15 although they might allow latecomers to get in on the offer the energy co op of vermont based in colchester is offering a pre buy deal through october the price may vary but it was recently 4 59 per gallon for heating oil gillespie fuels of northfield had a pre buy propane price of 3 52 per gallon that expired july 25 but they also said they might let some more customers buy at that price their pre buy heating oil price was 4 96 per gallon gillespie noted that cash buyers can get 10 cents off per gallon if they pay within 10 days oil and propane are not the only fuel prices on the rise the price for a cord of wood has risen about 10 to 15 in the last year to between 280 and 350 depending on dryness and other factors according to hedges of stove and flag works supply is tight because there are fewer people working in the woods and more people are buying wood stoves hedges said it is getting late to buy wood for this winter by contrast to other fuels prices for wood pellets have been fairly steady hedges said his store sells pellets for 295 per ton and he estimated someone using pellets as a primary heat source would use four tons or 1 200 a year stove sales at the store are split about evenly between pellet stoves and traditional wood stoves some high quality cleaner burning wood stoves qualify for a 26 federal tax credit he noted hedges had one word of caution for those returning to wood heat after a few years away have your chimney checked chimney sweeps are backed up too so that can be challenging but hedges worries that if buyers are not careful the boom in wood stove sales could lead to more chimney and house fires this winter while oil prices have been drifting down this summer partly because of concerns over a possible recession there is no telling what could happen by this winter europe is facing a much more severe energy crunch than the u s and new geopolitical shocks there or in asia could potentially send prices higher on the other hand prices could continue to drift down especially if a slower economy reduces energy demand high prices themselves can reduce demand for energy sources for example july gasoline consumption in the u s was the lowest since july 1997 except for the first pandemic year of 2020 this year s peak gasoline price of about 5 a gallon apparently caused drivers to drive less in july and the price for gas is now falling to date the growing use of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind has not been large enough to offset the nation s continuing thirst for oil propane and natural gas although the inflation reduction act just passed by congress should spur further expansion of renewable energy and help reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses that most scientists say are warming the climate the bill includes an expanded tax credit for energy efficient home improvements such as new insulation and new windows the bill also expanded and extended a federal tax credit for heat pumps biomass stoves residential solar and it includes a tax credit for battery storage systems most of the tax credits appear to take effect for work done in 2023 and beyond energy industry analysts still expect global demand for oil to remain strong in the medium term however as the u s population continues to grow and as developing countries around the globe push to adopt the kind of energy intensive economy and lifestyle prevalent in first world countries the vermont agency of human services helps pay the seasonal home heating bills of vermonters whose gross household income is equal to or less than 185 of the federal poverty level the offer applies whether you own your home or rent and pay for heat directly or as part of rent if you received fuel assistance last season you ll receive an annual review form that you will need to complete and return if you did not receive fuel assistance last winter there are several ways to apply including by phone at 800 479 6151 or online at dcf vermont gov mybenefits
the savage attack on sir salman rushdie last friday was a shocking illustration of the continuing threat to free expression within our society since that barbarous incident in new york state politicians artists authors and commentators have lined up to express their outrage and declare their support for the rights of everyone to be able to voice their opinions and tell their stories without fear but it would be easier to take those words seriously if so many of our cultural leaders especially publishers broadcasters and educators had not shamefully colluded with intolerance in the past this week they mouth their slogans about freedom but in their actions over recent years they too often have been the allies of totalitarianism hounding dissenters and enforcing groupthink they endlessly trumpet their devotion to diversity but they have only contempt for diversity of opinion shameful the cracks in the liberal facade of resolution began to show almost as soon as the mullahs of iran had issued their fatwa against rushdie in 1989 after the publication of his fourth novel the satanic verses even at the time there were many public figures who equivocated or even sided with the bigots and book burners one particularly shameful example was baroness shirley williams of the liberal democrats whose party is supposed to have the defence of liberty at its core the savage attack on sir salman rushdie last friday was a shocking illustration of the continuing threat to free expression within our society she told a bbc question time audience in 2007 that he had deeply offended muslims in a very powerful way had been protected by the british police at great expense to the taxpayer and said that giving him a knighthood was a mistake the obsession with not giving any offence to any vocal minority is now the central theme of the cultural cringe that prevails in our public life dressed up in the language of inclusion and equality this enfeebled attitude is now used to justify an accelerating surrender to extremism i think it is no exaggeration to say that because of the presence of islamist militancy we now have a de facto blasphemy law in this country when a teacher in dewsbury west yorkshire made a reference to the prophet muhammad last year during a lesson he was soon hounded out of his job by a mob of protesters and remains in hiding today no publisher would dream of touching a book like the satanic verses the fear of accusations of islamophobia prevails throughout the arts and literature building a climate of censorship in june the film the lady of heaven about the daughter of the prophet muhammad was pulled from cinemas after protests by angry muslim demonstrators but religion is just one aspect of this creeping kind of orwellian thought control it can also be found in the maniacal desire to punish any deviation from the prescribed orthodoxy on race multiculturalism or above all transgender rights as a former successful writer myself whose literary career was destroyed by the unfair accusation of transphobia i recognise only too well the devastating impact of this new style mccarthyism until this trans row exploded i had enjoyed success on both sides of the atlantic with novels written for a fantasy series under the name erin hunter in june the film the lady of heaven about the daughter of the prophet muhammad was pulled from cinemas after protests by angry muslim demonstrators but then i committed what was deemed to be a thought crime by the vociferous trans lobby my offence had been to add to my twitter page the hashtag i stand with j k rowling now joanne rowling is probably the most successful author in the history of the world a woman of incredible creativity and imagination but in our twisted world of toxic identity politics she has been turned into a figure of hate by the witch hunters of the twitter mob because she perpetrated the heresy of questioning some of the shibboleths of the trans dogma she herself is the target of continual abuse and death threats just hours after the rushdie attack a twitter user based in pakistan warned her you re next in another indicator of the hysteria generated by the trans activists scores of young well paid privileged professionals at her publishing house hachette wailed through their tears that they could not work on her next book because of her transphobia rowling s phenomenal earning power meant that her publisher and agent were willing to stand up to the cry bullies many others without her wealth have been less fortunate when i was targeted by the trans agitators for my j k rowling hashtag my agent and publisher meekly caved in and i was out in the cold frenzied i have not been able to write a book since then and have had to retrain as an hgv driver to support my family others suffered the same fate such as my friend rachel rooney ridiculously attacked for transphobia for her upbeat children s book my body is me the creator of father ted graham linehan has lost his marriage and career in the face of frenzied attacks by trans zealots because of his willingness to stand up for women s rights but it s not just the targeted writers the whole point of these mob cancellations is to intimidate other writers into silence and it works what makes this pattern all the more disgraceful is that the organisations that should be defending freedom are compliant in its erosion that is particularly true of the society of authors whose recent record on standing up for embattled writers is appalling its pusillanimity is typified by its chair best selling chocolat author joanne harris instead of battling for our rights she seems only too eager to belittle the importance of liberty as shown in an embarrassing tweet she sent in the wake of the rushdie attack and a death threat to j k rowling launching a jokey online poll she asked society members have you ever received a death threat and included the lines hell yes and show me dammit failure her insulting stance should not be a surprise given that under her leadership the society has never issued an unequivocal statement in condemnation of rowling s lethal critics authors have now sent an open letter to the society demanding that it finally take its failures seriously nor was harris forthright in her defence of writer kate clanchy who was dropped by her publisher following a row over allegations of racism contained in her memoir about teaching in an inner city school it was the president of the society author philip pullman who was forced out in the wake of the clanchy dispute while harris continued her reign of retreat her failure to speak out against violent threats is typical of the cultural establishment which has lost its sense of integrity that is why a distinguished writer and philosopher such as professor kathleen stock can be driven out of her post at sussex university by trans supporters wearing balaclavas and issuing threats of intimidation the ideologues want propaganda and compliance not art and exchange as i found in my own career ending dispute they are censorious judgmental and vicious the very last people who should be dictating the nature of our culture i can only hope that amid the darkness the attack on rushdie and death threats to rowling might act as a turning point gillian philip is an author and campaigner

one of the most tangible indicators of climate change s impact on mortgaged homes are the public and private price tags for insured risks associated with natural disasters homeowner claims related losses have outweighed premiums for private insurers in four out of the past five years according to fitch ratings and the national flood insurance program which was coming up for reauthorization at the time of this writing also has struggled financially while some studies suggest housing has weathered the impact of climate change fairly well several recent developments show the strain on insurers is growing in ways that could change that in the future particularly but not solely in areas prone to high profile disaster risks it s not just the fires and it s not even just the coastal storms it s that things are breaking that people never thought were going to said ben cohen ceo of quoll a climate data provider specializing in homeowner impacts flashpoint regions could see changes in their housing forecasts it can be tough to distinguish the impact of climate change on housing finance from macroeconomic factors and other drivers which may be why multiple recent studies show home prices holding up well in areas where events like floods and wildfires are prominent risks however with the incidence of natural disaster risk growing and insurers finding it tougher to manage within rates regulated at the state level some experts expect that could change insured losses from natural catastrophes in the united states have jumped significantly from a little above 20 trillion in 2019 to closer to 90 billion in 2021 according to a fitch analysis of data from munich re natcatservice aon and iso property claims service net written premiums for homeowners insurance policies have climbed each year over the last five years from 82 3 billion in 2017 to 103 4 billion last year but that hasn t been enough to prevent home insurers losses from outpacing premiums fitch researchers found when analyzing aggregate property casualty industry data from standard poor s global market intelligence the combined ratio used to generally measure the extent to which losses exceed premiums has come in a little above 100 every year since 2017 and the one year it didn t 2019 the ratio was 99 at the same time financial concerns from insurers regarding regions with more prominent storm and wildfire risks have caused multiple instances of withdrawn or insufficient coverage premium increases or difficulty meeting counterparty requirements that s a problem for mortgage companies who generally require borrowers to protect collateral with coverage from strong providers and must force place flood insurance if a property in a designated high risk zone lacks it the nfip which has recently added a risk based component to its pricing that has raised premiums for some borrowers covers some aspects of storm damage but not others both the nfip and private companies have exposure to the same reinsurance market as far as mortgage and housing market activity things like rising interest rates are probably a lot more consequential than homeowners insurance but when you do have market like florida where there may not be availability of coverage you need that could cause bigger problems said managing director jim auden head of fitch s u s p c insurance group storm and flood prone florida is one of multiple states that have experienced instances of insurance market disruption tied at least in part to the cost of natural disasters it has been contending with financial difficulties at insurers that led to a cut in stability ratings essential to doing business with key government related secondary market buyers of loans he noted california has had heavy exposure to wildfires and insurance rate restrictions that recently contributed to geico s recent decision to close its offices in the state also texas recently warned some coverage was falling short of the amount needed to rebuild or replace homes and oregon has rescinded a tax lot wildfire risk map it issued after consumers complained it led insurers to raise renewal rates or drop coverage the growing frequency of these kinds of developments particularly at a time when the housing market is cooling could increase awareness of climate risks and have an impact on home prices in way that it hasn t thus far i believe the combination of public policy changes and companies making a decision to not provide wildfire or flood insurance would make it more top of mind for buyers and sellers and perhaps that would then have an impact on migration patterns and home prices said danetha doe an economist with clever real estate a moving target potentially broader awareness of natural disaster risk and more aggressive public policy changes that address it could do more to mitigate rising insurance costs but given budget constraints these would likely need to be targeted efforts addressing the greatest needs a recent disaster assistance bill that has bipartisan backing was aimed at simplifying public relief with the goal of addressing the needs of low to moderate income communities the communities tend to get hit harder because they contend with multiple stressors states also have been willing to step in with backing when private insurance is shaky from time to time although not consistently and while disasters have had some common themes over time that policymakers can address their inherently unpredictable nature make them tough to anticipate with legislative measures new aspects of natural disasters are surprising insurers and government entities with increasing frequency said cohen whose company produces individualized climate risk assessments for homes flood and storm related risks have remained consistently high in recent years but wildfire risk has been more volatile fitch s data shows paradise california s wildfire damage for example brought rare distress to the usually low risk municipal bond market such that state backing of disaster risks could get less reliable and while the accuracy of flood zone prediction has improved the plight of kentuckians recently affected by heavy rainfall highlighted the fact that that sort of risk is less likely to be included in them cohen noted climate risk is happening everywhere and it s not only picking up speed but it s actually catching insurance flat footed in areas that they didn t think of as having major concerns said cohen another good example of that is there are a lot of people who don t realize a really heavy drought can destroy the foundation of your home i ve heard from a number of insurance companies that homes with this problem are popping up in drought areas that are having a systemic breakdown they never considered

washington president biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he s signing tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 percent corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided advertisement not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access

recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act

listen to this article listen to this article washington ap democrats have pulled off a quiet first in their just passed legislation addressing climate change and health care the creation of a tax on stock buybacks a cherished tool of corporate america that had long seemed untouchable under the bill companies will face a new 1 excise tax on purchases of their own shares effectively paying a penalty for a maneuver that they have long used to return cash to investors and bolster their stock price the tax takes effect in 2023 buybacks have ballooned in recent years they re forecast to reach 1 trillion in 2022 as companies have swelled with cash from sky high profits investors including pension and retirement funds like the buybacks but fiery critics of big corporations and wall street like sens elizabeth warren and bernie sanders loathe them calling the practice paper manipulation to enrich senior executives and big shareholders centrist democrats too such as senate majority leader chuck schumer have long criticized buybacks democrats say that instead of returning cash to shareholders big companies should use the money to increase employees wages or invest in the business they are hoping the excise tax it s projected to bring the government an additional 74 billion in revenue over 10 years will cause a major shift in corporate behavior but some experts are skeptical that the tax will work as intended they note that businesses have other methods for rewarding shareholders raising the prospect that legislation aimed at halting one corporate stock practice could instead facilitate another with new and unpredictable effects on the economy how it all plays out could be significant for the future landscape of big u s companies their employees and their shareholders and for the political staying power of one of the signature legislative initiatives of biden and his democratic majorities in congress where stock buybacks stand as the democratic bill becomes law buyback bonanza the major companies in the s p 500 index bought a record amount of their own stock last year 882 billion their buybacks reached 984 billion in the 12 months ended in march another record among the biggest repurchasers of stock are big tech companies such as apple facebook parent meta and google parent alphabet companies have been plowing more of their cash into buying their own stock even as they ve grappled with rising inflation higher interest rates and the potential for stunted economic growth they ve faced higher expenses for raw materials shipping and labor companies have largely been able to pass those costs on to their customers but higher prices for food clothing and everything else could threaten consumer spending with resulting crimped sales growth for many companies americans are still spending though more tepidly the latest government reports show buybacks can increase companies earnings per share because there are fewer shares universally held by shareholders the buybacks can also signal confidence from executives about a company s financial prospects what happens after the tax i hate stock buybacks schumer d n y told reporters as the legislative package advanced through congress i think they re one of the most self serving things that corporate america does instead of investing in workers and training and research and equipment that makes for appealing election year rhetoric but whether the democrats aspiration will translate into different business behavior is less clear it s an admirable policy goal says steven rosenthal senior fellow at the nonpartisan urban brookings tax policy center who calls the new excise tax on buybacks efficient fair and easily administered but will the goal be achieved rosenthal noted that in the wake of the 2017 republican tax law which gave companies a cash windfall by slashing the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 a wave of buybacks ensued after the new excise tax goes into effect companies might use some of the money they would have spent on buybacks to pay more dividends to shareholders instead he suggested the new tax puts buybacks closer to an equal tax footing with dividends rosenthal doesn t rule out though that companies decide to put some of the saved money into raising workers pay or investing in the business counterpoint the tax is not going to translate into higher pay for workers said jesse fried a professor at harvard law school who is an expert on corporate governance and investing money back into the business may not be an option he said because investment is already at very high levels and there s no indication that companies aren t pursuing worthwhile projects because they lack the cash in the end fried expects that most of the money not spent on buybacks would end up being added to the pile of some 8 trillion in cash that u s companies are sitting on a modest hit because the new excise tax will be calculated on the smaller net amount of a company s buybacks total repurchases minus shares issued during the year some companies may see it as modest hit worth taking and continue purchasing stock the tax won t apply to stock contributed to retirement accounts pensions and employee stock ownership plans after surveying its analysts about the tax rbc capital markets suggested that companies may grumble about it but it s unlikely to impact planning one thing is all but certain with the new tax scheduled to take effect jan 1 companies have a deadline for buying back their stock tax free that means a flurry of buybacks could come in the months ahead

china s covid zero could last for years because it works for xi bloomberg news aug 2 2022 a pedestrian in front of fencing surrounding a residential neighborhood placed under lockdown due to covid 19 in shanghai china on wednesday july 6 2022 shanghai launched mass testing for covid in nine districts after detecting cases the past two days fueling concerns that china s financial hub may once again find itself locked down in pursuit of covid zero photographer qilai shen bloomberg bloomberg bloomberg it s 2025 in beijing five years since the start of the pandemic and chinese president xi jinping s covid zero policy is still an inescapable part of daily life residents must get pcr tested every few days at one of the booths on nearly every street corner a personalized health code app determines who can move around the capital and where children have to test negative to go to the park something as simple as a visit to a coffee shop or supermarket can result in being locked down in your apartment not even allowed out for food which the state instead provides because a few positive cases prompt officials to restrict movement in all or parts of the city ceos assume they must deal with several shutdowns a year companies universities and cultural institutions that once thrived on contact with the rest of the world are isolated with flights into china limited and travelers still facing compulsory quarantines multinationals struggle to convince foreign staff to relocate and put up with the nuisances of covid zero that locals largely accept as their unaltering reality such a scenario where china s absolutist approach to the virus remains in place years from now until recently would have seemed far fetched other covid zero havens like singapore and australia have given up trying to stamp out the pathogen with global investors economists and a host of others expecting china to inevitably follow suit every move viewed as an easing of the policy has generated rallies in travel stocks and optimism that china would soon join the world in dropping most pandemic related restrictions but while the strategy has been tweaked around the edges optimized to staunch some of the fallout for the world s second largest economy the core premise has held fast as omicron sub variants become ever more infectious xi s resolve to avert virus fatalities is growing stronger leading many experts to warn that covid zero could continue well beyond 2022 all of us may have underestimated how strong the chinese state s will is in continuing with its so called dynamic zero covid policy said tianlei huang a research fellow at the peterson institute for international economics a washington based research group everything must serve the utmost goal of achieving zero covid for xi unlike most global leaders the political risks of opening up are still far greater than the benefits missteps in early 2020 to minimize and in some cases obscure the initial outbreak in wuhan undermined the social contract that underpins the chinese communist party s legitimacy an acceptance of one party rule in return for competent governance that keeps the public safe and improves overall quality of life to win back trust xi used powers largely unavailable to democratic leaders to keep the virus out and limit fatalities and it s worked while questions persist about the reliability of chinese data the country has reported just 5 226 covid deaths since the pandemic began compared with more than 1 million in the us china s success gave xi s government ammunition to fire back at international criticism over the virus s origins as donald trump repeatedly blasted china during the 2020 us presidential campaign beijing decried the soaring death counts in america and europe using them to showcase the superiority of communist party led rule it s also made the policy popular among many chinese who have been willing to put up with unpredictable lockdowns and the ubiquitous testing now required in major cities as the price of being protected the fact outbreaks and the covid zero disruption that follows them haven t touched everyone in the vast country has also emboldened xi covid zero oasis chongqing shows why xi keeps locking down the conundrum now for xi however is that china has staked so much on avoiding virus fatalities it can t exit the pandemic as other countries have by accepting greater death as a reality of living permanently with covid many elderly people in china remain vaccine holdouts in early july about 30 of shanghai s seniors still hadn t received even one dose and hong kong s experience earlier this year showed what could go wrong as omicron tore through nursing homes giving the under prepared city the world s highest death rate in march china s low elderly vaccination rate shows key vulnerability given the size of china s population the stakes are even higher more than a million people might die if china which has little natural immunity were to abandon covid zero according to an analysis by researchers at shanghai s fudan university the absenteeism and economic chaos seen in western countries after they reopened would also pale in comparison to what china might experience from the chinese leadership s perspective hong kong s exceptionally high death rate in the spring provides stark proof of that possible scenario j stephen morrison yanzhong huang and scott kennedy wrote in a commentary published june 27 for the center for strategic and international studies a washington based research group the trade off for xi in going all out to quash covid is slower economic growth which has traditionally been the prime concern of party officials economists surveyed by bloomberg news predict china s gross domestic product will grow at 4 this year down from 8 1 in 2021 and below the official target of about 5 5 the consumer and services sectors have been battered by two years of restrictions and shutdowns with curbs crippling domestic tourism and slashing incomes premier li keqiang has repeatedly warned of a grave jobs situation often a recipe for civil unrest in democracies and single party regimes alike china s overeducated and underemployed young people foreign business groups say companies are looking to divert investment away from china and move headcount to other parts of asia to avoid disruption like that seen during shanghai s two month lockdown earlier this year for lance a biotech executive in beijing the specter of covid zero has altered the way he socializes and consumes the capital was under threat of lockdown for much of may and june with work from home orders in place and restaurants shuttered amid an outbreak of some 2 000 cases lance who asked to be identified only by his first name due to the risks of criticizing xi s signature policy now makes most of his purchases online rather than risk going to the store the work i do means i need to socialize a lot but i barely go anywhere these days he said affluent and well educated chinese like lance will be looking to exit if covid zero continues longer term according to amy gadsden associate vice provost for global initiatives at the university of pennsylvania and a former special adviser on china to the us state department living cut off from the world is not the future they signed up for she said it s going to be hard to retain talent and it s going to be hard to lure talent rich chinese worth 48 billion are struggling to flee covid zero yet so far xi is unmoved in fact he s doubling down in a recent address from wuhan heavy with symbolism xi repudiated the west s embrace of herd immunity saying the consequences of lying flat against the virus would be unimaginable for china even if there are some temporary impacts on the economy we will not put people s lives and health in harm s way he said in june in the city where covid first emerged the epidemic response measures he added are correct and effective and must be upheld unwaveringly coming after china reduced the number of days travelers need to spend in quarantine the comments jolted financial markets reinforced a month later by the politburo the communist party s top leadership the unequivocal commitment to covid zero has led to a reassessment for some who expected the country to reopen once xi secured a third term at the once in five year party congress due to be held later in 2022 covid zero will remain in place for at least another year because it s now inextricably tied to xi said joerg wuttke president of the european union chamber of commerce in china during a july 20 webinar sponsored by the peterson institute my guess is china can at the earliest open up late 2023 he said officials are in a deep hole and they keep digging still beijing does have tools at its disposal to ease some of the economic pain from prolonging covid zero indefinitely including spending more on infrastructure and supporting the property market said wei lit yew lecturer in the department of government and international studies at hong kong baptist university the government has also found ways around some of the policy s most disruptive measures factories were able to resume operations during shanghai s intensive two month lockdown by using closed loops systems where workers are consistently tested and only allowed to go from their company run dormitory to the plant and back that enables exports to be maintained china is counting on the fact that the world needs china more than china needs the world yew said and while some companies may be threatening to leave plenty of others are increasing their bets foreign direct investment into china during the first six months of 2022 rose to 723 billion yuan 112 billion on track for another record year tesla inc which saw its shanghai factory shuttered for three weeks during the lockdown reopened using a closed loop and is now expanding the plant planemaker airbus se is also investing in more china capacity chinese health advisers have outlined potential exit strategies saying over the months that opening up hinges on improved vaccination rates increased access to antivirals and greater capacity at hospitals yet progress in these areas has been slow with mixed messages from government officials some experts have flagged boosting icu capacity as key to china being able to normalize but there s been nothing said publicly about bolstering acute care exiting covid zero risks inundating china s unprepared hospitals while china has approved pfizer inc s covid anti viral pill it hasn t permitted foreign made mrna vaccines shown to have higher efficacy rates than its home grown inactivated shots the politburo s recent reinforcement of covid zero suggests china will continue to prioritize it over economic growth australia new zealand banking group ltd senior china economist betty wang and senior china strategist zhaopeng xing wrote in a report published july 29 it appears to us that any change in the zero covid policy will only happen when authorities are convinced that mutations are less virulent and vaccines and medicines are proven to be more effective they wrote both are unlikely to happen in the near term the biggest challenge for xi could still come from how long china s 1 4 billion people are willing to be shut off from the world in june a report that mistakenly indicated beijing would keep strict virus controls in place for the next five years spurred backlash online in china prompting authorities to swiftly edit the article shanghai s lockdown was met with protests and heavy criticism online another wild card is the virus itself while china has been largely successful in reducing cases even after omicron hit the lackluster elderly vaccination rate still makes it vulnerable to an even more contagious variant that is also more virulent that s a major risk in a political system in which displaying an aura of competence is absolutely essential to maintain the faith of the chinese public said rajan menon director of the grand strategy program at defense priorities a think tank in washington the bet they re taking is that somehow covid zero will defeat the virus things will open up some day and economic losses can be recouped menon said what if that bet is wrong what is then their plan b menon said that is not clear to me or them they have bet the house on covid zero

show the courage to build a future where everybody has an even shot biden said that s the america i believe in the law which passed the u s senate following a 51 50 vote and the u s house on a party

changing a handful of taxes sparse attendance the signing tuesday at the white house was attended by just five democrats in part because congress is in the middle of its august recess with lawmakers back in their home states campaigning ahead of the november elections reps frank pallone of new jersey and kathy castor of florida accompanied manchin schumer and clyburn but biden who returned to washington d c to sign the bill after vacationing at a south carolina beach plans to hold a second event to mark the bill s enactment on sept 6 that celebration will likely have many more democrats in attendance no republicans voted for the package which democrats advanced using the complicated budget reconciliation process that gets around the u s senate s legislative filibuster biden said tuesday that the new law would set up americans for a better future the bill i m about to sign is not just about today it s about tomorrow biden said it s about delivering progress and prosperity to american families it s about showing the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the talk of its demise historic climate funding the law which will roll out in phases over the next few years will funnel 370 billion to clean energy programs including electric vehicle tax credits and tax incentives for energy companies to produce renewable energy biden said that the bill is the biggest step forward on climate ever it will cap medicare recipients out of pocket prescription costs at 2 000 annually beginning in 2025 and will allow the federal government to negotiate the prices of some of the more expensive medicare prescription drugs beginning in 2026 the cost of insulin for medicare patients would be capped at 35 though democrats were unable to keep a provision in the final agreement that would have capped the monthly co pay for people with private health insurance the proposals throughout the package are paid for by instituting a 15 minimum tax on corporations with incomes more than 1 billion and a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks as well as by allowing medicare to negotiate some prescription drug prices boosting internal revenue service coffers by 80 billion to increase compliance with tax laws already in place as well as the new changes is expected to bring in additional revenue helping to further offset the roughly 750 billion price tag for the package irs budget breakdown the irs funding would be divided up with 46 5 billion to bolster staff and update technology 25 3 billion for operations support 4 8 billion to update business systems and 3 2 billion for taxpayer services treasury secretary janet yellen wrote in a letter to irs commissioner charles p rettig earlier this month that the federal government s boost in funding for the agency would not lead audit rates to rise relative to recent years for households making under 400 000 annually instead enforcement resources will focus on high end noncompliance yellen wrote while the legislation named the inflation reduction act is expected to reduce the nation s deficit it likely won t have much of an impact on inflation according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office the agency s analysts wrote that the the bill would have a negligible effect on inflation during the current year and that during 2023 inflation would probably be between 0 1 percentage point lower and 0 1 percentage point higher under the bill than it would be under current law the penn wharton budget model from the university of pennsylvania had a similar assessment estimating that the law would have no meaningful effect on inflation in the near term but would reduce inflation by around 0 1 percentage points by the middle of the first decade these point estimates however are not statistically different from zero indicating a low level of confidence that the legislation would have any measurable impact on inflation the penn wharton budget model said many setbacks the legislation originally pitched by biden as a multi trillion dollar proposal dubbed build back better took more than a year to come together democrats in the u s house originally passed a 2 trillion package last november before the legislation stalled out in the u s senate amid disagreements between progressive and centrist democrats about the size and elements of the bill manchin and arizona democrat kyrsten sinema were considered significant obstacles to enacting many of the more progressive legislative goals including closing the carried interest loophole that primarily benefits wealthy hedge fund managers and providing subsidies for child care and paid family leave programs manchin and schumer a new york democrat relaunched negotiations earlier this summer following many starts and stops during the first half of the year at the time many democrats were skeptical anything would come of the closely held private talks but encouraged the two to reach a final agreement that would meet some of the party s goals the duo announced the surprise agreement on july 27 but schumer needed to make some tweaks to the bill to get sinema on board with the support of all 50 of the senate s democrats secured schumer brought the legislation to the floor for debate and an all night amendment voting session known as vote a rama earlier this month the senate passed the measure on a 51 50 vote on aug 7 with vice president kamala harris casting the tie breaking vote amid uniform republican opposition the package then cleared the u s house on aug 12 after members broke their summer recess to return to capitol hill to debate and then vote on the bill promoting the new law biden and many of his cabinet secretaries are expected to travel throughout the country in the coming weeks to champion the new law ahead of the november midterm elections progressive democrats have already begun making their pitch to voters on the provisions left by the wayside telling constituents that those proposals could become law if more democrats are elected to congress later this year republicans who uniformly voted against the bill are making the opposite case during floor debate and on the campaign trail gop lawmakers say the law will increase energy costs lead to irs audits on families and small businesses and harm the economy our economy is in a fragile state as we emerge from this pandemic michigan gop rep fred upton said during floor debate while touting his support of several bipartisan packages this congress we have seen decades high inflation that is crushing main street and squeezing the middle class

president joe biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he signed tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws u s president joe biden c signs the inflation reduction act with l r sen joe manchin d wv senate majority leader charles schumer d ny house majority whip james clyburn d sc rep frank pallone d nj and rep kathy catsor d fl in the drew angerer getty images expand voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for some 13 million people who are purchasing their own health care policies through the affordable care act biggest u s investment by far in climate change the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water how to pay for all of this one of the biggest revenue raisers in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year yet money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade sinema was instrumental in doing away with other tax proposals and shaping the final plan extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which recently put out a new report on long term projections what s left behind the package nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned remains a sizable undertaking and along with covid 19 relief and the gop 2017 tax cuts is among the more substantial bills from congress in years while congress did pass and biden signed into law a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that was part of the white house s initial vision the democrats other big priorities have slipped away gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs also allowed to expire is the enhanced child care credit that was providing 300 a month during the pandemic ___ associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report
