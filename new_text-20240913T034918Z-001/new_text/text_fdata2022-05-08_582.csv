opinion editor s note star tribune opinion publishes a mix of national and local commentaries online and in print each day to contribute click here the hellish war in ukraine has set loose another apocalyptic horseman famine the swiftness of many deaths by combat has obscured the many more deaths that may come slowly not from war but from the interaction of markets for food and oil despite an emerging transition away from fossil fuels the force that still drives the flowering grains of the world s breadbaskets is oil oil still powers the engines that plant and harvest the fertilizer that makes grain grow and the trucks and barges and ships that deliver food to the hungry these markets together define the capacity of much of the world to feed itself nitrogen fertilizer for example is mainly produced from ammonium nitrate derived from natural gas other petroleum based products fuel herbicides and pesticides protecting crops from yield losses due to weeds and insect infestation disruptions in supply chains thus affect food grains directly but also create delivery issues with oil based plant nutrients and chemicals while american aid to ukraine has increased from hundreds of millions of dollars to a proposed 33 billion in military and humanitarian assistance and while nato s resolve has stiffened in the face of russian aggression and atrocity none of this responds directly to the combined food and energy challenges that are leading to famine russia s invasion has also triggered a set of policies which taken together compound and worsen the lives of hundreds of millions of people struggling with food insecurity especially children russia and ukraine combined account for about 30 of global wheat exports roughly equivalent to the united states and canada ukraine also accounts for half of global sunflower oil exports a major source of cooking oil around the world russia and belarus are major global fertilizer exporters and black sea ports are a major source of foods and fertilizers for african asian and middle eastern destinations russia s invasion has effectively blocked these critical supplies causing scarcity spiking prices and exacerbating food insecurity for hundreds of millions of people who even in good times spend half or more of their meager incomes on food they have no cushion for the price increases they now face poor farmers struggling for self sufficiency will also lack the fertilizers they need to feed their own families this year and next not only will millions be malnourished or worse because of this war their suffering will spill into the streets causing civil unrest across many countries in total these indirect casualties will number in the tens or hundreds of millions unfortunately many countries including china have already reacted by banning exports of food and fertilizer which will only serve to destabilize markets further in late april the world bank reported that trade disruptions due to the war in ukraine would keep commodity prices high and rising into 2024 we should act now to avoid the worst of these consequences many americans may not want to hear this difficult message and it will take time to come to terms with it just as it has taken time to formulate our collective response to the russian invasion among the actions needed by the u s and its western and asian allies suspend requirements to blend biofuels freeing up corn and soybeans and the fertilizers used to produce them for use in producing food for the world s hungry and starving permit temporary use of conservation reserve acres here and set aside acres in western europe to produce crops helping restore more adequate food reserves especially where these acres are not protecting lands highly vulnerable to erosion or flooding avoid export taxes and controls that divert grain from malnourished people to livestock feed unwinding the 40 plus protectionist actions taken since the start of the war including china s hoarding of corn stocks and indonesia s limits on palm oil exports provide funding for a global food financing facility to help poor countries maintain critical food imports by borrowing on easy terms maintain and expand our domestic snap wic school meals and other feeding programs to ensure the nutritional needs of our own people agricultural production is among america s strongest technological suits and greatest powers in taking these actions the u s can regain a position of global respect and influence beyond military might and reinforce its ties to allies by showing what it can help do for others in the face of the current food crisis america can also begin to retrieve its international legitimacy and leadership carlisle ford runge is a distinguished mcknight university professor of applied economics and law at the university of minnesota robbin s johnson is a former vice president for corporate affairs at cargill

sink or swim is the uk really likely to go into recession the bank of england has woken up at last for months the rising danger that inflation might reach double digits has been worrying anyone with any memory of the catastrophic levels it reached in the 1970s and 1980s you will have read about that here in this column but the bank s economic forecasters clung to the hope that inflation could be contained even as recently as february the line was that inflation might reach 7 per cent this spring but then would fall back now they have panicked and about time too last week the bank duly increased interest rates to 1 per cent that was expected but what shook the financial markets were two warnings one was that inflation might go above 10 per cent the other was that the uk economy might go into recession i think they will probably turn out to be right about the first but wrong about the second to be fair the bank of england is far from alone in underestimating inflationary pressure the federal reserve in washington is realising that it has made a similar mistake and its half point increase in rates last week has led to wild gyrations on the markets the dollar has shot up no surprise there but us equities have been all over the place first they soared then they plunged london markets have been caught in the backwash with shares off quite a bit and the poor old pound getting clobbered by the bank of england s pessimism predictions bank of england governor andrew bailey warned of the potential for above 10 inflation and a possible recession as he increased the base rate to 1 this week the european central bank has yet to come to terms with inflation there but eventually it too will have to raise rates so it was a bumpy week and one that raises a string of questions my top two are why did the central banks get it so wrong and is the uk really likely to go into recession economists will argue over the answer to the first for years but in the spirit of journalism being the first rough draft of history here goes after the banking crash of 2008 the central banks flooded the world with money and brought interest rates down to the floor that saved the world economy from a really serious recession and was the right thing to do when clever people find they have been far too optimistic their instinct is to make sure they don t fall into that trap again hence this warning of possible recession in the uk they expected the policy eventually to result in higher inflation i remember a very good briefing at the bank of england setting that out but it didn t or at least there was some inflation in asset prices but not in current prices why so little inflation probably a combination of china s massive manufacturing capacity holding down goods prices and india s high tech industries holding down service industry costs remember it was the high point of outsourcing there was also a fair degree of slack in the labour market in most of europe and the us which helped hold down wages in the west the rise in asset prices increased wealth inequalities but that seemed a price worth paying to crank up the economy so since the policy seemed to work when the pandemic struck they did it again they had been lulled into complacency but this was a different crisis it was a shock to the world s ability to supply goods not a seizure of the banking system we could not get the things we wanted to buy so we bid up the price of everything as the economy reopened we bid things up more cash and confidence soaring house prices have made many britons asset rich and lots have also kept hold of savings built up during lockdown writes hamish mcrae even ahead of the invasion of ukraine supply of everything including energy was tight there was already a huge inflation problem by the autumn of last year but the war has made it even worse the complacency has now gone and when clever people find they have been far too optimistic their instinct is to make sure they don t fall into that trap again hence this warning of possible recession in the uk it will be a nail biting time but i think that will turn out to be wrong for three reasons first many people still have savings money they could not spend in lockdown not everyone is in that fortunate position but in aggregate consumers are cash rich and consumption is 65 per cent of the economy they are also asset rich thanks to soaring house prices that gives them confidence that cash and confidence will support overall demand second the job market is still very strong with the largest number of unfilled vacancies ever it will probably weaken a bit but it will take a long time to do so and finally the service based uk economy has been very good not only in creating jobs the point above but shrugging off disruptive blows it will need all its resilience in the months ahead but i think we may squeak by without a recession
the u s has the highest rate of maternal mortality in the developed world yet these deaths of women from causes related to pregnancy or childbirth are almost invisible when a new or expectant mother dies her obituary rarely mentions the circumstances her identity is shrouded by medical institutions regulators and state maternal mortality review committees her loved ones mourn her loss in private the lessons to be learned from her death are often lost as well the inability or unwillingness of states and the federal government to track maternal deaths has been called an international embarrassment to help fill this gap propublica and npr have spent the last few months searching social media and other sources for mothers who died trying to understand what happened to them and why so far we ve identified 134 pregnancy and childbirth related deaths for 2016 out of an estimated u s total of 700 to 900 together these women form a picture of maternal mortality that is more racially economically geographically and medically diverse than many people might expect their ages ranged from 16 to 43 their causes of death from hemorrhage to infection complications of pre existing medical conditions and suicide we were struck by how many perished in the postpartum period by the number of heart related deaths by the contributing role sometimes played by severe depression and mood disorders and by the many missed opportunities to save lives propublica and npr plan to expand our 2016 photo gallery as we find more women and hear from more families if you know of someone who died please tell us here meanwhile we highlight 16 women with portraits of their lives and deaths their stories are a reminder of just how much is lost when a mother dies examined together these private tragedies point to a much bigger public health problem and underscore the potential repercussions for women and families as republicans in congress push to revamp the health care system and roll back medicaid january 26 amanda rose kotrba amanda rose kotrba never got over the frightening birth of her son back in 2008 late in her third trimester she had developed a problem with her placenta the organ that supplies nutrients to the developing fetus and lost most of her amniotic fluid resulting in an emergency cesarean section seven years and a couple of miscarriages later she was pregnant again she was scared her mother connie holyfield said she kept telling me that she was scared amanda was no shrinking violet feisty and headstrong is how connie described her 30 year old daughter she worked as a security guard and had a side business cleaning apartments in the orange park florida complex where she and her longtime boyfriend lived with their son she didn t have private health insurance or a car but medicaid covered her maternity care and provided transportation to prenatal appointments other times connie would drive her toward the end of her ninth month amanda s visits to the doctor and the emergency room became more frequent she started having some bleeding some back pain and some stomach pain connie said she kept telling me she didn t feel right amanda worried that her placenta was failing again but the doctors and nurses who examined her always sent her home on sunday jan 24 amanda was overcome by searing pain when connie arrived at the hospital her daughter was undergoing another emergency c section amanda had suffered a placental abruption the organ had become detached from the walls of the uterus and major bleeding her newborn daughter had a collapsed lung and amanda was so ill she could barely glance at the baby after a few hours she seemed to rally then when connie went to take a photo of the baby to bring back to her room amanda texted her more blood as connie was signing consent forms for more emergency surgeries amanda gasped mom i m not gonna make it she died 36 hours later her body so ravaged that her mother said she didn t even look like the same person february 24 emily cook dyches emily cook dyches her husband eric and their fifth child trey thirty nine year old emily cook dyches of salem utah was the mom who learned your kids names and asked about them when she saw you her husband eric wrote last year she was the neighbor with the untidy house and smiling children she was the mom who worried about not measuring up but always put her best foot forward emily and eric met in third grade and married while attending brigham young university in 1998 she taught elementary school for a few years and worked as a piano instructor and photographer but her most important job she believed was raising her kids teaching them not only practical life lessons but more importantly eternal lessons centered on how one can progressively become more like the savior in word and deed as her obituary put it after she nearly died delivering her fifth baby trey in march 2015 she recovered physically but emotionally she was never the same when breastfeeding proved difficult her anxiety about trey s health went through the roof eric said she was worried about him developing and growing and surviving she began having panic attacks i ve heard it described that it s like you re in a jetliner and you feel like the jetliner s going down eric said the attacks were so bad he took her to the emergency room a couple of times but the medical system is just not equipped to handle that type of emergency antidepressants helped and emily s condition seemed to stabilize for a time but in retrospect eric said she wasn t fully there even though i thought we were functioning at a pretty good level when trey was about nine months old she came to me and essentially just said it s coming back emily agreed to check into a psychiatric hospital and stayed for 11 nights as she and eric later learned their insurance wouldn t have covered visits to an outpatient facility anyway the experience was very similar to incarceration eric said emily couldn t even wear an underwire bra for fear she might use the wire to harm herself still she got better and the first couple of weeks after she was discharged felt to eric like a second honeymoon then she regressed on feb 24 after spending the day with her parents she had a panic attack during a car ride her father pulled the car to the side of the freeway to console her but before he could stop her she opened the door and ran into oncoming traffic according to researchers in georgia michigan and other states mental health disorders have become a leading contributor to maternal deaths among white women in the months after childbirth eric doesn t believe his wife was trying to harm herself she was disoriented she wasn t sure where she was going he does believe she needed more help than her family and community could provide a few weeks after her death he started a foundation in her honor the emily effect to help other women suffering from perinatal mood disorders with a special focus on improving maternal care in utah march 2 brittany haefke at 23 brittany haefke was a stay at home single mom with a 6 year old daughter and a 3 year old son she d struggled with depression and drugs over the years chronicling her ups and downs in her diaries according to her mother deneen haefke but her kids helped keep her grounded nothing made her happier than playing ball with them or teaching them to ride their bikes you could just see the joy in her face deneen said you couldn t rip her away from them just hours after the birth of her third child cole on feb 11 2016 brittany had so much trouble breathing that doctors put her on oxygen she was so swollen deneen said she still kind of looked like she was pregnant the hospital staff ran some tests but when brittany heard the results she was so upset that she checked out and refused to tell her mother what the doctors had said back at the home the family shared in floral city florida brittany withdrew into herself she did not even try to bond with deneen said her swelling grew worse and she started having chest pains i asked her every day please let me take you to the doctor she would refuse one morning brittany called her mother from a friend s house she was on her way to the hospital and didn t think she d be coming home she died a few hours later from pregnancy induced heart failure the diagnosis deneen believes that doctors had given her three weeks before the condition is often treatable but recovery can be long and uncertain and brittany s medicaid benefits were set to expire a couple of months after she delivered her final journal entries reflected that she was tired of fighting i think she gave up on life deneen said her mother buried the diaries with her

hemorrhage obstetric bleeding is one of the most common causes of maternal deaths in the u s 70 percent of such deaths are preventable researchers in california have found in kira s case her family contends the medical team delayed treatment too long her abdominal cavity filled with blood and she died 12 hours after giving birth charles sued the hospital and doctors this past spring in los

husband joe and sons jackson top and hayden amy bartlett was the yellowstone national park spokeswoman who went on the news to explain why it was a stupid idea to take selfies with a giant bison or why scientists were sure the mega volcano under the park was not about to blow yellowstone wasn t just her job it was her life she met and married her husband jerry there made her home on the park s montana border and named her kids jackson for the wyoming resort town to the south of the park hayden for the valley and ella faith for the geyser ella was born may 7 2016 at 41 amy was thrilled to finally have a daughter but a week after going home while jerry was putting the boys to bed amy suddenly began feeling strange pain in her neck and jaw a galloping heartbeat extremely high blood pressure readings on her home monitor first she called her mother then a friend who was coordinator of emergency medical services for the park they told her the same thing her symptoms sounded like a heart attack she needed to get to the hospital right away amy and jerry both had ems training so they recognized the symptoms too but amy was in excellent health it was the middle of the night and they lived more than an hour away from the medical center in bozeman a long way to go for a false alarm amy opted to phone one more person an on call doctor at the hospital who suggested she rest a few minutes then re measure her blood pressure as she lay down and began nursing jerry snuggled into bed beside her at first he thought she had fallen asleep then he realized she had stopped breathing an autopsy revealed a spontaneous coronary artery dissection or scad in which one of the main arteries to the heart suddenly splits once mistakenly thought to be quite rare scad is now recognized as one of a series of heart conditions that may be triggered by pregnancy hormones even in women who are otherwise healthy the condition isn t preventable but if he and amy had ever heard of it jerry said they might have been able to save her life neither of us wanted to believe this could be happening to her he said may 17 krystine toledo gonzalez krystine toledo gonzalez with her husband luis krystine toledo gonzalez loved to dance and hang out with friends things i would never ever do if it wasn t for her said her husband luis she was always pushing me to do more we pushed each other they met in miami in the mid 2000s and moved to georgia a few years later to work and raise a family he was a manager at costco wholesale she was a part time post operative nurse in the northside hospital system and took care of their three kids ages 2 to 16 krystine had given birth to her youngest child by emergency c section something she didn t want to go through again when she found out she was expecting another baby she was determined to have a vbac vaginal birth after cesarean many ob gyns and hospitals refuse to perform vbacs because of concerns that the uterus could rupture so she had to go to northside s main hospital in atlanta which delivers 15 000 babies a year more than any other medical center in the u s krystine had a slight fever but the delivery went fine then doctors discovered that she had developed a cold sore so they decided to put her in isolation for a few days luis said when she began complaining of pain in her abdomen the first assumption was that she was having indigestion gas trapped in her gut because she wasn t able to walk around as much as she wanted the pain worsened and her condition deteriorated by the time she was diagnosed with a staph infection luis said doctors couldn t save her she died at the age of 30 six days after her daughter was born northside hospital shares in the loss of krystine toledo gonzalez the hospital said in a statement privacy laws prevent us from providing any comments or additional information may 27 lynn aguibitin welker lynn welker shortly before the birth of her daughter savannah angel lynn aguibitin welker didn t realize she was pregnant until her fifth month for a very good reason she d had her fallopian tubes tied after the birth of her second child at 38 she worked in the preschool at mission college in santa clara calif she was a great teacher passionate about doing that said her husband eric who met her in high school in the early 1990s when they were both in junior rotc at school and at home she was constantly making music and art she wanted her daughter 8 year old jordan and son noah 5 to think crazy whimsical ideas eric said she was very much about raising kids who can see the potential in things finding out she was pregnant again was a nice surprise he said then two weeks later an ultrasound revealed that the baby had hypoplastic left heart syndrome a severe congenital defect that would require open heart surgery soon after birth lynn started to blame herself a little bit eric said she had chronic high blood pressure and though doctors tried to reassure her she worried that her anti hypertensive medication might have hurt the baby for the next few months she and her physicians did what they could to give the baby the best chance at a healthy life on may 27 2016 lynn had a c section at the university of california san francisco medical center and neonatal specialists whisked away the fragile newborn savannah angel lynn seemed fine then she crashed and doctors couldn t bring her back according to the autopsy she had major blockages in her arteries that had gone unnoticed for years leading to a massive coronary the news was better for savannah after two surgeries she s strong and healthy beginning to crawl and babbling her first words da da and ma ma ma ma she s doing great eric said it s been a good example of resilience for me to see june 15 laura lenss laura lenss a 38 year old architect in seattle was like a renaissance woman her older sister kristina lenss said she was absolutely an expert at every single thing she did whether it was architecture or building furniture or cooking or illustrating or making clothes or making movies you name it motherhood was laura s most absorbing project she had one son 3 year old henry and was eagerly awaiting the arrival of his brother whom she planned to name wally at her final prenatal appointment her doctor suggested an induction that day laura texted kristina that she was in the hospital eating a salad and then she would have the baby labor went extremely quickly less than an hour kristina said laura suffered a third degree tear in her perineum or vaginal area but told her sister she wasn t worried the same thing had happened with henry back home with the baby after one night in the hospital she was so excited kristina said she said i m just so in love he s perfect he s beautiful soon though laura was complaining about severe pain in her neck and shoulders in a photo taken at wally s first pediatric appointment on june 14 she looked swollen and exhausted that night laura was so self conscious about her bloated appearance that she didn t want to facetime with her family she made an appointment with her doctor for the next morning but when her parents came to pick her up they took one look and called 911 she died on the operating table a few hours later from complications of a strep a infection that began in her perineal wound we ve been crying ever since kristina said we cry every day june 30 larissa icemen at 25 larissa icemen was sweet but shy the result her mother in law roberta russette thought of growing up in rough circumstances in minneapolis s native american community at big gatherings she often kept to herself and at home she focused on her kids she was pregnant with her fourth child on the morning of feb 6 2016 in her 38th week her husband landen took her to university of minnesota masonic children s hospital for what they expected would be another smooth delivery soon after they arrived larissa began vomiting and went into cardiac arrest doctors delivered her healthy son by emergency c section then rushed her to another hospital where she underwent surgery for an amniotic fluid embolism a rare complication believed to occur when amniotic fluid or other fetal material sometimes as tiny as a fingernail or a hair enters the mother s bloodstream triggering a massive allergic like response the embolism caused larissa s heart to stop several times depriving her brain of oxygen when her condition stabilized she was transferred to a nursing home she couldn t walk or talk but she responded to her caregivers and family enough to give them hope she would have these really fighting moments these bright spots roberta said then she would slip all of a sudden she would get an infection out of nowhere she languished for almost five months we didn t speak about it roberta said we just knew she wasn t going to fight anymore july 13 amanda eva garcia amanda garcia with daughters zoey in car seat and june twenty six year old amanda eva garcia lived in texas where maternal deaths have increased sharply in recent years one of 16 siblings she came from a really hard life said zak tiemann her boyfriend since 2011 she was sweet natured and excitable with a raucous laugh that burst out of nowhere little things put a big smile on her face she especially doted on her 9 year old daughter june and their 2 year old zoey her mom abilities were so good zak said she was the best mom i ve ever seen amanda didn t earn enough in her assembly line job making foam food containers to afford insurance so like more than half of women who give birth in texas she got her care through medicaid after delivering her third daughter zayleeana by c section on july 5 2016 she and the kids went to stay with zak s mom while he picked up work in san antonio 35 miles away a couple of days after leaving the hospital amanda s stomach started to ache she lost her appetite she wasn t eating her food she was just throwing it in the trash zak said she turned pale and complained of feeling hot even though to zak s touch her body felt real real cold eight days after giving birth she could no longer stand up an ambulance took her to guadalupe regional medical center where doctors told zak that her organs were failing she passed away a couple of hours later august 14 sheriah freitas sheriah freitas met her husband deitton a soldier in the u s army at a walgreens in hawaii where she was working in the cosmetics department he loved her beautiful eyes they re like blue and green and gray with brown in them and her big personality she was fierce she was strong minded and confident pregnant with her first child at 25 she appeared to be doing exceptionally well we went to every appointment every ultrasound everything was perfect deitton said still he couldn t help fretting especially after they received transfer orders to fort benning georgia thousands of miles from their families i just worried about my wife all the time sheriah went into labor three weeks early on aug 13 2016 but the couple was more excited than concerned we were making jokes all day deitton said then the mood shifted doctors said labor wasn t progressing properly and that sheriah needed a c section after the surgery she held baby luther they d settled on his name while she was in labor for a few minutes then she began to bleed uncontrollably sheriah had developed an amniotic fluid embolism doctors don t know how to predict or prevent them up to 80 percent of mothers who develop amniotic fluid embolisms die soon sheriah went into cardiac arrest deitton held her hand and prayed while doctors worked frantically to revive her he was still clutching her hand when she died september 4 audrey lockett labranche audrey lockett labranche was a dynamo with a huge smile a constantly changing assortment of colorful hairstyles and vast reserves of energy ambition and faith she was the founder and proprietor of labranche s childcare center in chicago heights illinois which provided care for 60 kids at a time from babies in diapers to latch key tweens as well as support for their harried parents under the name audrey cher she had a side career as a christian neo soul funk singer and songwriter and released her debut solo album the intro last year her busy household included her husband of 21 years a teenage son and daughter and 7 year old twins i m overwhelmed with love thanks she posted on facebook last summer pregnant with her fifth child i m thankful for my life s journey and i would not trade anything for the path i walked to get to where i am today her final pregnancy felt especially improbable in 2015 audrey had developed multiple blood clots that traveled to her lungs and nearly killed her after months of medication and rest she d made a complete recovery then as she announced on facebook in january 2016 god decided to surprise us the pregnancy was anything but easy audrey was 39 overweight and had thyroid disease she was on blood thinners to prevent clots but she experienced frequent braxton hicks contractions uterine contractions that mimic labor that made her uncomfortable and worried that the clots might be coming back late in the pregnancy after a falling out with her longtime ob gyn she switched to a new doctor it was stressful to have to go under the care of someone who did not know her history her mother kathleen lockett said but after that things seemed to proceed smoothly and baby mathias was born by c section in late august 2016 weighing eight pounds a couple of days after returning home audrey started complaining of a headache and problems with her c section incision at the local hospital she was told that her sinuses were probably acting up kathleen said the headache grew worse and on friday sept 2 audrey s husband marcus reported on facebook that she had been rushed to a trauma center in chicago my wife has suffered severe hemorrhaging in her brain that has left her in a lifeless state he was determined to stay hopeful satan is a confirmed fool if he thinks this will shake my faith but on sept 4 he acknowledged that audrey still hadn t shown any signs of improvement she died that afternoon september 6 marlene dominguez hicks marlene dominguez hicks with husband alex and daughters alyssa left and alana marlene dominguez hicks 33 was the pride of her filipino immigrant parents valedictorian of her high school class b a from stanford m d from meharry medical college in nashville she and her family husband alex daughters alyssa and alana were living in houston where she was in a radiology program at the university of texas health science center and looking forward to the birth of alex jr two weeks before the baby was due she could still run up the stairs of her town house declaring to her husband i feel great in her maternity photos taken around the same time she wore a long white dress a crown of flowers and a radiant glow she spent labor day at the park and the zoo with her husband and kids alex urged marlene slow down if you need to but she insisted she was fine the next day she made her rounds as usual she figured she might as well work up to the end since her job was conveniently located in the hospital where she planned to give birth after dinner the girls were in bed and alex was downstairs when he heard what sounded like books falling off a shelf he found marlene lying on the bathroom floor unconscious blood trickling from her mouth paramedics did their best to revive her but by the time they reached the hospital she was gone doctors couldn t save the baby either he d been without oxygen too long the diagnosis was peripartum cardiomyopathy a type of heart failure that is induced by pregnancy and can strike from the middle of the second trimester into the postpartum period it is treatable but the symptoms fatigue swelling shortness of breath mimic the normal discomforts of pregnancy and so are often ignored once considered quite uncommon peripartum cardiomyopathy is now estimated to cause about 11 percent of maternal deaths and can have a genetic component that weighs on alex s mind when i take the girls to the doctor i m always going to ask him or her to check their hearts november 18 joonyper light joonyper light and her newborn son monte joonyper light was many things a punk rocker a college student a jewelry crafter a budding businesswoman she was also a 21 year old heroin addict with a history of bipolar disorder and depression who was trying hard to change her life when she found out she was pregnant she got even more adamant about beating her addiction and entered a drug treatment program her fiancé matt stock said but the emotional ups and downs of pregnancy led to even more of a struggle getting clean in springfield missouri meant starting over with a whole new group of friends she didn t have too many support systems she felt alone felt bad about me being really her only true support system and putting everything on me as difficult as the prenatal period was matt said joonyper was terrified of postpartum she would always tell me i don t know how i m going to deal with this i m scared of how i m going to be during that phase their son monte born in september 2016 lit up her life matt said still with matt working full time installing solar panels there was just not a whole lot of time for her to get to her rehab he said meanwhile she worried about taking medications like antidepressants that would get in her breast milk she would act fine on the outside but be hurting on the inside the stress and depression became just too much for her to handle he said matt came home one night in november to find joonyper on the bathroom floor dead of an overdose she wasn t unique maternal mortality review committees in texas colorado and philadelphia have found that overdoses linked to mood disorders make up an increasing number of maternal deaths this was a relapse this was not an ongoing thing matt wrote on facebook a couple of days later also i need help i really don t know how to deal with this december 1 christen vogel christen vogel and her husband daniel christen vogel 21 and her mother pamela gore were as close as some sisters they lived two hours apart in north carolina but they talked several times a day and pam regularly drove to camp lejeune where christen s husband was a marine to attend her daughter s prenatal appointments i was looking forward to being not a grandma but a pamma pam said the only shadow of a problem emerged in christen s 38th week she texted her mom to say she didn t want to come home for her maternity photo shoot because she was afraid she might go into premature labor she told her husband she had a headache and when he urged her to see a doctor she said she would try taking some medicine first on the night of nov 30 christen got out of bed and decided to take a bath that was her soothing measure pam said if she had a headache she d get in the bath if she had a stomach ache she d get in the bath when her husband woke up around 5 00 the next morning he found her unresponsive in the tub neither she nor the baby survived the question no one seemed able to answer was why her heart and other organs were normal an autopsy showed the only substances in her bloodstream were caffeine and acetaminophen the final death certificate listed the cause of death as undetermined the lack of finality was devastating for pam who started a gofundme campaign this past april to pay for an independent pathologist to review the records i have two other daughters who have hopes of having families in their future she wrote if this was caused from something that we could have prevented i need to know donors eventually contributed more than 3 300 but she s still looking for a pathologist willing to take the case what we did to compile our list of women who died from pregnancy and childbirth related causes propublica scoured social media primarily public posts on facebook and twitter and the crowdfunding sites gofundme and youcaring and then verified the women s basic information using obituaries and public records other names came to us through patient advocacy organizations and through a call out shared by propublica and npr we identified more than 450 deaths since 2011 including 134 in 2016 we then worked with a team of graduate student journalists from new york university to reach out to family members for additional information in many cases persuading family members to participate in our project was hard as we learned loved ones are often too consumed with grief and sometimes with guilt to tell their stories they may feel a social stigma and prefer to keep the circumstances to themselves or they re counseled by lawyers to stay silent although many women s photographs were widely distributed on gofundme and other public sites we decided only to publish pictures of women whose family members gave their permission or whose stories had been previously told in news articles how we defined a maternal death we used the same definition as the centers for disease control and prevention the death of a woman during pregnancy or within one year of the end of pregnancy from a pregnancy complication a chain of events initiated by pregnancy or the aggravation of an unrelated condition by the physiologic effects of pregnancy who we didn t find while social media allowed us to find many women whose stories would have been lost in the past this method falls short at capturing women who live and die on the margins including homeless women and undocumented immigrants black expectant and new mothers who die much more often than whites are less likely to have their stories told on social media it also can be difficult to determine whether the deaths of women in the later postpartum period are related to childbirth

kingdom park in breckenridge is pictured on wednesday july 28 2021 summit county is exploring a variety of strategies to help mitigate the widespread housing issue one of which is learning about the work of boulder based nonprofit thistle michael yearout for the summit daily news when silverthorne mobile home parks cottonwood court and d d sold to riverthorne llc many community members voiced concern for the residents that lived in the two parks and the residents feared whether or not they would be able to stay within summit county earlier this year the developer and the residents reached a confidential agreement that was reportedly satisfactory to each of the residents but the events of what happened still left some community leaders shaken considering there are a few more mobile home parks located within county limits swan meadow village kingdom park and farmers korner we re deeply troubled about what happened in silverthorne said summit county commissioner tamara pogue at a commissioners work session meeting on tuesday may 3 it does seem a bit frustrating given all of our efforts to create new affordable housing in summit county that we lost some that s why the summit board of county commissioners listened to a presentation from thistle a small nonprofit based in boulder that works with resident owned communities usa to help residents of mobile home parks purchase their communities and maintain those units as affordable housing andy kadlec program director for the nonprofit attended the meeting along with mountain dreamers representatives peter bakken and javier pineda bakken said in an email that there are currently no plans to purchase any of the county s mobile home parks and that this presentation was meant to educate how else the community could protect existing affordable housing units during his presentation kadlec said thistle and resident owned communities usa have helped residents purchase six different mobile home parks including two in canon city one in longmont one in durango one in boulder and one in leadville juan carlos and karla gricelda stand in front of their home in d d mobile home park 780 blue river parkway on wednesday jan 26 2022 last year the park sold to riverthorne llc which is planning to develop the property residents of the park have to relocate by this summer ashley low for the summit daily news the goal is to transition these parks from private ownership to resident owned communities residents living in mobile home parks own their homes but they do not own the land their homes sit on if the land sells to a developer who otherwise wants to remove the homes and use the land for a new project such as the case in silverthorne the residents that own their homes are forced to relocate thistle s role is to help residents at parks like these purchase their communities it works like this when a community is put up for sale a representative from thistle contacts the seller and then contacts the residents at that park from there the representative helps the residents form a cooperative elect an interim board review possible financing options some of which are available through resident owned communities usa and help the residents through the purchasing process after the purchase the land operates as a cooperative corporation and each resident that owns their home has a right to membership members continue to own their homes individually and each has an equal share of the land beneath the entire neighborhood thistle in turn maintains a 10 year agreement where its representatives help the residents manage a budget and track various capital improvements realistically residents don t have an opportunity to sell the park and make money off of it kadlec said if they for some reason they would want to sell the park they are restricted by their corporation articles and bylaws to sell it to another nonprofit or government entity that would maintain the use of the community s affordable housing stock kadlec noted that this process essentially takes the mobile home park off the market permanently of the 291 resident owned communities resident owned communities usa has helped convert across the country kadlec said none have been foreclosed on or sold back to a commercial operator kadlec said there are many benefits to this kind of model residents who live in mobile home parks have never had control or power they are always under the thumb of somebody else who decides what the lot rent is how the trees are trimmed how the rules are enforced in the community kadlec said we re really switching that and giving them the opportunity to create a community that they want to live in while this may be the case kadlec pointed out some reluctance his organization has faced with private owners he noted that in one instance a park in durango was sold in 2010 for 7 million then again two years later for 9 5 million then again three years later for 14 million before residents finally bought it pogue noted that in past years the county has tried purchasing one of the county s parks and but that its offer was not received the reality is that investors are aware of the option here to make a lot of money and really how lucrative it can be to purchase these parks kadlec said you get direct cash flow and there s little investment you have to make into the homes themselves or managing the infrastructure of the land you can keep them together with duct tape and tweezers as long as you want and make a lot of money off of it between summit county s three remaining mobile home parks there are about 240 homes all of which provide affordable housing to community members javier pineda community organizer for mountain dreamers told the commissioners that

zuma press inc alamy stock photo ekaterina zhuravskaya polish president andrzej duda hopes the two nations will live together on this land and build common happiness polish president andrzej duda has expressed hope that there will be no border between poland and ukraine in the future calling the two nations fraternal speaking in warsaw on may 3 the day poland celebrated its constitution day duda said he envisaged a time in which the two nations would live together on this land building and rebuilding our common happiness and common strength that will allow us to resist every danger in his address the polish president apparently echoed a remark made by his ukrainian counterpart volodymyr zelensky in early march when he said effectively we no longer have a border with poland with a friendly poland the ukrainian head of state highlighted how welcoming warsaw had been to ukrainian refugees not asking them about their nationality religion or how much money they have this fact was mentioned by the polish president too during his speech on tuesday he thanked his fellow countrymen and women for showing their kindness to ukrainian refugees without being prompted by any politicians by any clergy by anyone duda again cited volodymyr zelensky who recently said that in view of what the poles have done the whole history is not important the polish president concurred with this assessment arguing that today s solidarity between the two nations dwarfed all the conflicts of the past duda spoke of the opportunity which today s crisis offered for rebuilding a true community in our part of europe which would be able to defend itself against any attack he went on to suggest that besides poland and ukraine other nations such as lithuania latvia and estonia should also band together the polish president added that it was warsaw s responsibility to build neighborly ties and brotherhood between our nations he also pledged to help ukrainians to rebuild their country when the war is over speaking about anti russia sanctions duda acknowledged that the punitive measures against the kremlin came at a price for those imposing them causing economic crashes crashes in the energy market in the fuel market as well as inflation that affects our wallets which makes our lives more difficult the polish president insisted however that the international community had no other option but to go ahead with the sanctions regardless to force russia to stop its aggression we have to survive this we have to pursue a responsible policy we have to deal with it duda told his compatriots he condemned the brutal aggression of the russian power on an independent sovereign state an independent and sovereign nation the russian official described this as an obvious fact citing a recent statement by the head of russia s foreign intelligence service poland had earlier dismissed the allegations made by moscow s top spy that it planned to take over a portion of ukrainian territory calling it a russian information operation aimed against warsaw and washington meanwhile warsaw however insists the exercise has nothing to do with the conflict in the neighboring country in an interview with associated press on thursday belarusian president alexander lukashenko too alleged that politicians in poland were harboring plans to occupy western ukraine that is they have the partition of ukraine in mind
why we won t have a recession the uk economy will need all its resilience but we may squeak by says hamish mcrae the bank of england has woken up at last for months the rising danger that inflation might reach double digits has been worrying anyone with any memory of the catastrophic levels it reached in the 1970s and 1980s you will have read about that here in this column but the bank s economic forecasters clung to the hope that inflation could be contained even as recently as february the line was that inflation might reach 7 per cent this spring but then would fall back now they have panicked and about time too last week the bank duly increased interest rates to 1 per cent that was expected but what shook the financial markets were two warnings one was that inflation might go above 10 per cent the other was that the uk economy might go into recession i think they will probably turn out to be right about the first but wrong about the second to be fair the bank of england is far from alone in underestimating inflationary pressure the federal reserve in washington is realising that it has made a similar mistake and its half point increase in rates last week has led to wild gyrations on the markets the dollar has shot up no surprise there but us equities have been all over the place first they soared then they plunged london markets have been caught in the backwash with shares off quite a bit and the poor old pound getting clobbered by the bank of england s pessimism predictions bank of england governor andrew bailey warned of the potential for above 10 inflation and a possible recession as he increased the base rate to 1 this week the european central bank has yet to come to terms with inflation there but eventually it too will have to raise rates so it was a bumpy week and one that raises a string of questions my top two are why did the central banks get it so wrong and is the uk really likely to go into recession economists will argue over the answer to the first for years but in the spirit of journalism being the first rough draft of history here goes after the banking crash of 2008 the central banks flooded the world with money and brought interest rates down to the floor that saved the world economy from a really serious recession and was the right thing to do when clever people find they have been far too optimistic their instinct is to make sure they don t fall into that trap again hence this warning of possible recession in the uk they expected the policy eventually to result in higher inflation i remember a very good briefing at the bank of england setting that out but it didn t or at least there was some inflation in asset prices but not in current prices why so little inflation probably a combination of china s massive manufacturing capacity holding down goods prices and india s high tech industries holding down service industry costs remember it was the high point of outsourcing there was also a fair degree of slack in the labour market in most of europe and the us which helped hold down wages in the west the rise in asset prices increased wealth inequalities but that seemed a price worth paying to crank up the economy so since the policy seemed to work when the pandemic struck they did it again they had been lulled into complacency but this was a different crisis it was a shock to the world s ability to supply goods not a seizure of the banking system we could not get the things we wanted to buy so we bid up the price of everything as the economy reopened we bid things up more cash and confidence soaring house prices have made many britons asset rich and lots have also kept hold of savings built up during lockdown writes hamish mcrae even ahead of the invasion of ukraine supply of everything including energy was tight there was already a huge inflation problem by the autumn of last year but the war has made it even worse the complacency has now gone and when clever people find they have been far too optimistic their instinct is to make sure they don t fall into that trap again hence this warning of possible recession in the uk it will be a nail biting time but i think that will turn out to be wrong for three reasons first many people still have savings money they could not spend in lockdown not everyone is in that fortunate position but in aggregate consumers are cash rich and consumption is 65 per cent of the economy they are also asset rich thanks to soaring house prices that gives them confidence that cash and confidence will support overall demand second the job market is still very strong with the largest number of unfilled vacancies ever it will probably weaken a bit but it will take a long time to do so and finally the service based uk economy has been very good not only in creating jobs the point above but shrugging off disruptive blows it will need all its resilience in the months ahead but i think we may squeak by without a recession

tech sector these two charts are a steal from kevin muir the macrotourist and show 1 the very sharp rally in s p futures and 2 the very sharp tumble in the usd during the fed press conference on wednesday the relative strength of the leading indices hides the relative weakness of many individual stocks particularly speculative issues which were aggressively bid higher during the peak stocks only go up mania bond yields surge higher bond yields surged higher this week the us 10 year treasury hit a 4 year high at 3 12 the canadian 10 year also hit 3 12 but that was an 11 year high as the

pension funds start buying bonds the s p 500 dividend yield is 1 5 while the us treasury 10 year bond yield is more than double that at 3 12 that s the widest spread in more than eleven years and may

year high the us dollar index touched a new 20 year high this week soaring us interest rates and expectations that the fed will remain more aggressive than other central banks helped drive the strength in the greenback as did a safety bid in a world beset with uncertainty as i have noted previously trends in the currency markets often run way further than seems to make any sense they are self sustaining before turning on a dime and going the other way the swiss franc which often catches a bid in times of trouble has taken a swan dive since the end of march it has dropped for five consecutive weeks against the usd down 7 and six consecutive weeks against the euro i don t know why this has happened perhaps markets expect the swiss national bank to keep interest rates low relative to the fed and the ecb precious metals fall on rising interest rates and a strong usd sharply rising nominal and real interest rates and a surging us dollar are usually a toxic combination

on trading poor liquidity across markets exacerbated recent wild intraday price swings as investors and traders have been backing away from the markets due to hard to quantify risks there is the uncertainty about the consequences of a war in europe but there is also an existential sense that a new era may be dawning with the winding down of globalization the fracturing of so many supply chains the surge in inflation interest rates and the usd and possibly the end of the bull market in stocks see the heisenberg report for an excellent 5 minute read on the possible end of the doomsday momentum machine my short term trading i started this week flat and was determined to be cautious given the recent choppy price action the looming fed risk and the fact that i would be travelling thursday and friday in vancouver for the celebration of life of a dear old friend i took some small positions in both the s p and cad monday and tuesday looking for a bounce but was stopped for small losses on all trades i was flat from tuesday s close through friday s close i missed the wild wednesday thursday action and my p l was down less than 0 5 on the week i won t indulge in the temptation

in this week s days to cover chart the big 4 traders are short about 112 days of world silver production down about 6 days from last week s cot report the 5 through 8 large traders are short an additional 50 days of world silver production unchanged from last friday s report which ted pointed out on the phone yesterday for a total of about 162 days that the big 8 are short down 6 days from last week s cot report that 162 days that the big 8 are short represents just about five and a half months of world silver production or 347 0 million troy ounces of paper silver held short by the big 8 commercial traders in the cot report above the commercial net short position in silver was reported by the cftc at 196 6 million troy ounces as mentioned in the previous paragraph the short position of the big 4 8 traders is 347 0 million troy ounces so the short position of the big 4 8 traders is larger than the commercial net short position by 347 0 196 6 150 4 million troy ounces up 33 4 million troy ounces from last week s cot report 6 680 comex contracts the number of long contracts purchased by ted s raptors during the past reporting week the reason for the difference in those numbers is that ted s raptors the small commercial traders other than the big 8 are net long silver by that amount 150 4 million troy ounces 30 080 comex contracts as per the first paragraph above the big 4 traders in silver are short around 112 days of world silver production in total that s 28 days of world silver production each on average down 1 5 days from last friday s report the traders in the 5 through 8 category are short 50 days of world silver production in total about 12 5 days of world silver production each on average and unchanged from last week s cot report the big 8 traders are short 50 4 percent of the entire open interest in silver in the comex futures market which is up a bit from the 49 6 percent they were short in the last cot report and that s because of a huge drop in silver o i because of spread trade liquidation during the reporting week and once whatever market neutral spread trades are subtracted out that percentage would certainly be over the 55 percent mark in gold it s 46 2 percent of the total comex open interest that the big 8 are short down a bit from the 47 9 percent they were short in last friday s cot report and a tiny bit over the 50 percent mark once their market neutral spread trades are subtracted out in gold the big 4 are short 56 days of world gold production down 3 days from last friday s cot report the 5 through 8 are short 31 days of world production unchanged from last week for a total of 87 days of world gold production held short by the big 8 and obviously down 3 days from last friday s cot report based on these numbers the big 4 in gold hold about 64 percent of the total short position held by the big 8 down about 2 percentage points from last friday s cot report the concentrated short position within a concentrated short position in silver platinum and palladium held by the big 4 commercial traders are about 69 79 and 75 percent respectively of the short positions held by the big 8 the red and green bars on the above chart silver is down about 1 percent from last week platinum is up about 4 percentage points from a week ago and palladium is unchanged week over week the status quo remains unchanged the big 4 8 traders are sitting there like a lump and very firmly stuck on the short side in both gold and silver although they did improve that situation during the reporting week in both silver and gold but only the big 4 in each it was almost all a raptor affair once again especially in silver and it s been that way for a very long time now as i keep pointing out and will mention again the big 4 8 shorts will never be able to extricate themselves fully from the short side if that was ever their intent particularly the big 4 at some point they re going to have eat the lion s share of the short positions that they currently hold the only way that they can do that is to go into the market and buy longs or deliver physical metal but only if the long holders are in a position to accept delivery ted says that a lot of them aren t so unless the powers that be at the cftc and cme group have something nefarious up their sleeves or they re bailed out by the likes of the exchange stabilization fund the u s treasury or the fed their potential loses can only be imagined think lme nickel times 20 or more according to ted but i very much doubt that it will be allowed to happen especially for the too big to fail bullion banks in the big 4 category as i ve said before what happened on the lme involving the nickel market will most likely be a template for what will occur over at the cme group at some point as they rush to protect the big shorts on any runaway price activity to the upside as that s their primary function but as of this moment there are no upside daily limits as to how high gold and silver prices can rise in the comex futures market however the circumstances in silver have been altered by an unimaginable amount by ted s discovery of the approximately 1 billion troy ounce physical short position in silver that bank of america appears to hold in the otc market along with the big increase in goldman s derivatives position in silver in that market as shown in the latest occ report for q4 2021 which ted figures is a long position he has also come to the conclusion that bofa is short about 30 million troy ounces of gold in the otc market as well the situation regarding the big 4 8 shorts in silver gold continues to be far beyond obscene twisted and grotesque and as ted correctly points out ad nauseam its resolution will be the sole determinant of precious metal prices going forward as always nothing else matters

went along with that except for ten of them why would you give joe biden more power when he s already shown how horrible he is at everything advertisement i had some questions at the time where does that leave us with our supplies if biden has the authority to give them weapons from our stocks and how are we ensuring the aid is getting where it s supposed to be going now some u s officials are expressing concern about our stockpiles being depleted with us giving away so many weapons there are concerns among us officials about shipping so many arms to ukraine that us stockpiles are depleted from wp pic twitter com 0bineiww9a byron york byronyork may 7 2022 from washington post biden has requested an additional 33 billion in ukraine aid nearly two thirds of which would be dedicated to security spending kirby has said that package should carry ukraine through another five months of fighting congress has not yet approved the funding and there are concerns about how quickly defense contractors would be able to meet the government s demands to replenish u s stockpiles to ship ukraine what it needs this is pretty unprecedented the amount of munitions that are being used right now the pentagon s acquisition chief bill laplante told reporters friday so where does that leave us if we are suddenly attacked and what if china takes this particular opportunity knowing we are funneling a ton of weapons to ukraine to invade taiwan now i don t think they re going to in the face of things not going well for russia after invading ukraine but we need to account for any eventuality they may decide that now is the time while we are so committed elsewhere advertisement secretary of defense lloyd austin tried to assuage the concerns of senators austin did not expand on what those minimum levels are but sen roy blunt r mo noted the u s has sent roughly 5 000 javelins and 1 400 stingers to ukraine comprising 33 and 25 of their respective stockpiles sen john boozman r ark described the state of the missile inventory as very thin blunt and sen jon tester d mont said they were concerned that supply chain issues and cold production lines could limit the pace of replenishment they pressed austin and army gen mark milley the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff on how quickly the weapons could be restocked austin told senators that it was not only possible to replace some of the stockpiles within a year but we will do that defense industry experts told the senate armed services committee last month that pandemic related issues with hiring and supply chains as well as the long term neglect of production capacity could delay replenishment of some weaponry by up to five years and if bad actors are listening and act within that one year or five years this process seems an incredibly bad idea if you drill down into the 33 billion biden is asking for austin reveals that part of that money is not only going to ukraine and to help pay to replace our stockpiles but also to pay to replace the weapons that other countries are giving ukraine funding the restocking effort will require the passage of the 33 billion supplemental ukraine aid package that the white house sent congress last week he said about 16 billion of the requested funding would go to the defense department including 6 billion to procure additional weapons and systems for ukraine and another 5 billion for drawing more weapons from u s inventories this will help us to not only replenish our stockpiles but also replace some of the capability we ve asked our partners and allies to provide austin said advertisement so we re not only depleting our stockpiles we re paying to build up the stockpiles of other countries then the other question was how do we know that the weapons are getting where they re supposed to be going wasn t this the country that joe biden accused of having a lot of corruption when he was talking about why he threatened the prosecutor javelins and stinger missiles are easily transportable how do we make sure they aren t being laundered out the back door for other purposes several senators called for the pentagon to be more transparent and watchful as it steps up its weapons deliveries to ensure that equipment is moving to ukraine s front lines sen patty murray d wash said she repeatedly heard from those involved in logistics that diversion and hoarding issues have kept weapons ammunition and armor from reaching some front line units are we making sure that none of these weapons are falling into the wrong hands is there any way to even do that tester asked you re going to love austin s response to that question he said it was difficult to track weapons once they were moved into ukraine we have to depend on the ukrainians at this point to do the right thing and make sure that they are prudent and careful about how they issue these weapons out and account for these weapons he said oh that s so reassuring seriously we re giving them our weapons but not checking where they re going and we just gave joe biden the imprimatur to give them anything out of our stockpiles republicans are you paying attention to what you are doing here what are you thinking
star parker lending money is not as they say rocket science according to the federal reserve bank of st louis in the last quarter of 2021 of the total of all outstanding business loans from all commercial banks 1 08 were delinquent per the federal reserve bank of new york as of second quarter 2021 a little more than 2 of the 1 4 trillion outstanding in auto loans were delinquent yet in the student loan market totaling around 1 6 trillion not that different from the total size of the auto loan market an average of 15 are in default at any given time per the education data initiative it should be clear what the problem is auto lenders make sure that those to whom they lend can and will pay back the loan they are careful because if the borrower defaults the lender loses but if president joe biden or sens elizabeth warren or bernie sanders decide that it is not fair that there are americans without new cars and managed to get government guarantees for auto loans is there any doubt that there would be a dramatic rise in defaults on car loans those lending wouldn t care who they lend to because they wouldn t take the loss on a default you and i we taxpayers would as we will if biden and his party have their way to wipe out student loans of course wipe out is not the right terminology debts don t get wiped out they just get transferred to someone else in the case of government guarantees that someone else is taxpayers the concept of student loans backed by the government is another child of the allegedly compassionate 1960s doesn t it make sense to help the less fortunate obtain funds to pay for college but as many theologians and philosophers have noted the greatest charitable act is to help another individual take control of their own life teaching personal responsibility is the most valuable gift that one can provide another our american compassion our moral compass has gone awry a child growing up in america today looks around and finds himself or herself in a nation where debt is larger than the entire economy and still growing but just as inflation shows that the costs of fiscal irresponsibility cannot be hidden so the costs of teaching our youth that personal responsibility is irrelevant cannot be hidden it manifests in the destructive behavior we see now the wall street journal reported that one student loan adviser told them i m seeing them say i m going to take out more loans now and go buy gamestop stock with it because it s going to get forgiven anyway a new gallup survey reports 32 of currently enrolled students pursuing a bachelor s degree report they have considered withdrawing from their program for a semester or more in the past six months thirty six percent attribute this to financial reasons but 76 attribute to emotional stress of course the universities love this what business wouldn t think the government subsidizing purchase of its product is a great idea per the american enterprise institute from january 2000 to december 2021 college tuition costs increased 175 and college textbook costs increased 150 over the same period the consumer price index for all items increased 65 5 prices of cars household furnishings and clothing remained relatively unchanged and cellphone services were down 40 computer software down 71 and television sets down 97 per education data initiative highest default rate 26 33 is among arts and humanities majors attending nonselective schools can anyone really think such loans make sense we need to help our youth who want education to get it but it must be done prudently teaching our youth that they don t need to pay back debts is not a good start misguided efforts by biden and his party to cancel obligations on student loans should be vigorously opposed star parker is president of the center for urban renewal and education and host of the weekly television show cure america with star parker

ritual began soon after the march 2021 purchase of nguyen s brooklyn building by a shadowy real estate firm called greenbrook partners which told residents they had to leave by june 30 some neighbors moved out but nguyen and tenants from four other units sued the financially connected greenbrook one of several investor backed rental housing firms to draw scrutiny in washington we have to fight back said nguyen who has helped organize tenants in other buildings that belong to greenbrook which has more than 150 properties in brooklyn and queens most bought during the pandemic this has been my home for 13 plus years it s a wonderful community and i want to stay here it s also the right thing to do said nguyen 39 a trained attorney who works on labor organizing for an ngo nguyen and other activists back a pending tenant protection bill in the new york state legislature the battle comes as rising rent adds to today s historic inflation surge with horror stories abounding of landlords in the unregulated portion of new york s rental market seeking increases of 30 percent or higher the market has bounced back and that has led to rent increases and lease renewals that are really burdensome for tenants said charles mcnally director of external affairs at the furman center a new york university urban policy research organization it s a really difficult market for renters and the inflationary pressures for owners are real as well suboptimal tenant greenbrook was one of the actors highlighted in a february event organized by senate democrats where nguyen described herself as a suboptimal tenant for such firms their goal is maximizing profit not the stability that comes with a long term tenant she told the panel housing experts told senators that a frequently changing cast of shell companies and subsidiaries appearing on official ownership documents hinders accountability for tenants people protest rent increases and aggressive evictions in april 2022 in brooklyn andrea renault afp they also said some of the firms target traditionally non white areas where home values have risen steeply the rental firms defenders say restrictions on landlords can discourage needed investment and that the industry is being scapegoated for the housing affordability problem a complex issue with many factors they also point to estimates that wall street backed firms comprise a tiny stake of the us rental housing stock figures that housing experts say are based on outdated pre pandemic data recent news reports abound of the shift in cities such as atlanta and jacksonville where wall street backed rental firms snap up available stock pricing out some first time homeowners good cause eviction greenbrook tenants have also garnered support from leading new york politicians including senate majority leader chuck schumer and state senator jabari brisport who led a rally last month where greenbrook was booed fight fight fight housing is a human right the group chanted in

emergency cash has been suffering from paltry returns and high inflation ten or so banks have raised yields on savings accounts just since mid april according to bankrate the highest yielding accounts could pay more than 2 by the end of the year if the federal reserve continues on its path of raising its benchmark interest rate quickly banks are starting to pay a higher return on your cash good news for savers who ve seen their stockpiles languishing from a gruesome combination of low interest rates and high inflation however some banks are moving faster than others some particularly traditional brick and mortar shops may not budge for a while at least 10 banks have raised interest rates on their high yield savings accounts or money market deposit accounts since mid april according to data compiled by bankrate get san diego local news weather forecasts sports and lifestyle stories to your inbox sign up for nbc san diego newsletters they include american express national bank barclays bank capital one cit bank colorado federal savings bank discover bank luana savings bank marcus by goldman sachs sallie mae bank and tab bank according to bankrate a handful of others increased yields earlier in 2022 the rates are still relatively low none yet pays over 1 most are in the range of roughly half a percent up to 0 80 according to bankrate data but the highest yielding accounts pay about 10 times more than the national average which is 0 06 according to greg mcbride chief financial analyst at bankrate and consumers returns are likely to climb steadily higher as the federal reserve continues to raise its benchmark interest rate to curb inflation the central bank cut that rate to rock bottom levels in the early days of the covid 19 pandemic to help prop up the economy if the fed ends up being as aggressive as they re expected to be the top yielding savings accounts could clear 2 later this year mcbride said it s the only place in the world of finance where you get the free lunch of higher return without higher risk he added it s pure gravy emergency savings guido mieth digitalvision getty images financial advisors often recommend savers park their emergency funds in these types of accounts funds are safe deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation and liquid they can be accessed at any time savers should aim to have several months of household expenses handy in the event of job loss or another unforeseen event financial advisor winnie sun co founder of sun group wealth partners in irvine california recommends saving at least six months of crucial living expenses shelter food and medication costs plus an additional three months for each child in the household more from personal finance here s what the fed s half point rate hike means for your money as mortgage rates rise should you buy a home or rent rising interest rates mean higher costs for car loans consumers don t need to move all their funds either they can keep managing their day to day finances their checking accounts for example at their current bank to avoid the hassles of switching and open an account at a new bank solely for emergency funds mcbride said not every bank is raising their payouts or doing so at the same pace largely the ones that have increased their account rates some have done so multiple times in 2022 are online banks or the online banking divisions of traditional brick and mortar banks they have lower overhead costs and may use the allure of higher rates to compete with traditional shops which hold the lion s share of customer deposits and are in no hurry to increase payouts mcbride said when the federal reserve raises its benchmark interest rate known as the fed funds rate it increases the cost of borrowing loans become more expensive for consumers and businesses banks earn money on loan interest as the federal reserve raises its benchmark rate banks accrue more revenue from higher loan interest payments and may therefore find themselves better positioned to pay a larger yield on customer savings the central bank hiked its benchmark rate by a half a percentage point on wednesday the largest increase in more than two decades however this seesaw effect won t necessarily be true for all institutions due to another factor banks use deposits to loan money to other customers but customers flooded the u s banking system with cash to an unprecedented degree in the early months of the pandemic due partly to cash hoarding and the flow of government payments like stimulus checks as a result most banks may not see the need to pay higher savings account rates to attract deposits and fuel their loan machine inflation getty images even as a handful of banks increase payouts consumers are still struggling to keep pace with inflation the consumer price index a key inflation gauge jumped 8 5 in march 2022 from a year earlier the fastest 12 month increase since december 1981 as a result money is losing its value at an elevated rate overall you re still way below levels of inflation said sun a member of cnbc s advisor council of high yield savings account rates however she added sometimes we have to be comfortable receiving less of a return for less savers may opt for different approaches with emergency savings depending on their household situation sun said for example individuals who don t want to open a separate high yield savings account at another bank can perhaps replicate those returns on emergency cash account by investing 5 to 10 depending on one s risk appetite in a simple balanced fund split between stocks and bonds she said this investment is subject to market risk though in an emergency savers would tap the cash and not the invested assets to the extent possible individuals who don t have the financial capacity to fund both an emergency savings and retirement account can also consider a roth individual retirement account sun said in the event of an emergency investors can tap their roth ira contributions as a last resort doing so doesn t carry a tax penalty though withdrawing investment earnings might in a few cases such as withdrawing before age 59½ roth iras also carry annual contribution limits

columns if president biden cancels the nation s 1 75 trillion college student loan debt there s one guy who ll still pay it back me it s not that i couldn t use 20k which is the balance on my wife s grad degree we have a shabby kitchen last redone during the first reagan administration and i could stock a slideshow with pics of all the low end high mileage clunkers i ve driven over the last 20 years when a neighbor s teenage daughter accidentally backed into one of my rust buckets last summer all i could do was laugh and say you put a scratch in one of my dents but i digress i ll repay the federal loans because that was the deal we made with uncle sugar we knew the terms and understood the risk at 6 8 percent interest in my house we piled student loan debt on top of mortgage and other debt due to the battering we took during the great recession in 2008 mrs mullane lost her job and my employer gave me a 10 percent haircut on my salary our finances were tighter than a kardashian s red carpet getup my wife decided to switch careers and teach but the job she wanted required a masters the program was outrageously overpriced as is all college tuition there was no guarantee she d get the job and if she didn t we d be stuck with debt we could barely service every financial scenario said don t do it but we ve been in tighter spots plus we re melting pot americans with an abiding faith in the promise of this great country which rewards optimism ambition and hard work so we threw a hail mary and got the win hail marys and a belief that things will work out have always done us right today we re fine we can repay the debt take vacations and drive better cars the open secret is so can the people who hold most of that 1 7 trillion in student loans it s remarkable that the college debt crisis gets so much press given that just 13 percent of the country owes on student loans gallup the polling outfit reports that in four surveys on the most important problems facing the country only one respondent said college debt that guy is probably a ceo making good money mullaneweedishness in bellmawr n j i say that because the university of chicago studied who d benefit most from loan forgiveness and surprise it s affluent college educated professionals who owe almost 60 percent of all u s college loan debt they took the bigger loans got the better paid jobs and can afford to repay the dough they borrowed from the federal treasury the report concludes we find that college loan forgiveness policies are highly regressive with the vast majority of benefits accruing to high income individuals by regressive they mean it will hurt lower income americans say the people who tend the ceo s lawn detail her tesla manicure her nails haul away her trash and daycare her kids the affluent professional class with c suite career aspirations offload their college debt onto the worker bees that their corporations employ on the shop floor the bees pay for it in higher taxes and chronic inflation that s the bigger reason i ll repay college debt forgiveness even if biden settles on just 10k per loan sticks it to every non college worker though i have a college degree a temple owl the working class and blue collar middle class are the people i know and love best they re my friends my in laws my family my oldest kid is an electrician college debt forgivenesswhite house considering an income cap for student debt forgiveness plan during the great recession the political class spent 700 billion of our dough bailing out bankers remember tarp who were losing their french cuffed shirts on their reckless corrupt investments but there were no bailouts for levittowners losing their homes to foreclosure from banker induced recessionary job losses i went to the county sheriff s auctions people cried i wrote about it critics like me repeated a line back then corporations privatize their profits and socialize their losses that s the practical effect of biden s college loan forgiveness given its biggest beneficiaries affluent college graduates privatize the profits of their well paid careers obtained through government loans leveraged to acquire their college credentials but they socialize their chunk of the 1 75 trillion to levittown pa and willingboro n j and places like them i don t oppose all college debt forgiveness the terminally sick disabled vets the working poor i d be happy to discharge their student loans also i d forgive the loans of working stiffs who sold a pursue your passion bill of goods on college borrowed 40k 50k 60k for a degree that taken to the job market rewards them with 15 an hour in retail discharge that kind of predatory debt back to the colleges and universities responsible if we can confiscate the yachts and property of foreign oligarchs profiting from war we can raid the billions held in endowments by universities profiting from the sale of worthless degrees should biden zero out student loan balances i ll just pay it into my kids iras which they ve had since last year like the trump biden covid stim checks it s not my money it s theirs if they continue to save and invest in 40 years they

driving the sixth generation ford explorer leads one to wonder how long ford can delay rolling out the seventh iteration of america s top selling suv since rolling into showrooms in 1990 the explorer has been at the vanguard of the movement that took american families out of cars and into sport utility vehicles initially modeled on ford s compact ranger pickup the explorer debuted with best in class interior volume and up to six seats indeed in many ways explorer s history is emblematic of how that market has grown and developed in its first three years ford sold nearly three quarters of a million more power more luxury an eddie bauer version and more capability such as full time all wheel drive followed seeing the public s enthusiastic reception ford quickly developed a larger more powerful version based on the f 150 pickup in 2011 explorer abandoned truck like body on frame construction for a more carlike unibody platform thus putting explorer dead center in the crossover suv market that now dominates the american market troubled past on the plus side the explorer has been a leader in innovation and family safety it was the first to offer a center mounted taillight and standard rear antilock brakes on the downside explorer has had a series of embarrassments most notable was a finger pointing fiasco with firestone over tire failures that killed 148 people and injured 525 in some 3 000 rollover accidents there also has been a seemingly never ending list of mechanical failures transmission problems paint and body failures and a host of under the hood bugaboos continued the give explorer a lousy reputation for durability indeed 253 000 2020 2022 models were recalled last week because a design flaw can allow the vehicle to roll away even while in park it was the second recall for the latest generation explorer new in 2020 in february the national highway traffic safety administration recalled 18 366 explorers and lincoln aviators because a fuel filler tube could detach and cause a fire critics pan it indeed reliability issues are cited by virtually every major rating service none of which puts explorer in the top tier of a crowded market niche consumer reports for example rates explorer 13th among 14 midsize suvs giving it a score of 47 the top rated kia telluride which sells for thousands of dollars less scored 97 the top selling toyota highlander rated an 88 the hyundai palisade 87 mazda cx 9 84 and chevrolet traverse 83 rounded out the top five traverse cr seriously not the toyota venza honda pilot or nissan murano car and driver rated the explorer 12th out of 24 midsize suvs in a separate evaluation c d noted that the explorer finished at the bottom on the skidpad and in the slalom there was good news for all those police officers who work in explorers every day it has the best brakes u s news and world report which combines the reviews of dozens of automotive journalists puts explorer 16th of 22 vehicles in its class you can check them all i also recommend kelly blue book and edmunds com and you will see some real differences in opinion most auto writers are men who tenaciously cling to their teen identities and are smitten with big block high output engines thus the hopelessly outdated fuel guzzling dodge durango occasionally cracks the top 10 and the button downed conservative highlander occasionally does not no there there but the explorer never does and there is widespread agreement about that with everyone but buyers when first i drove our tester an xlt with a premium options group and sport appearance package i took note of the chintzy interior materials been a long time since i ve seen a rat fuzz headliner the uninspired handling the below average ride and the hard flat seats and the general lack of refinement i also noted the growly engine and uncertain transmission my instinct is to be fair and i thought well ok perhaps this is a budget model then i opened the window sticker 45 305 as the kids say omg let me carefully step by step and with all due consideration evaluate the value proposition here no our tester came with come 13 000 miles on it under even moderate acceleration it felt like and sounded like a three year old rental car of course auto critics are hardly the final judge of these things explorers continue to record strong sales in the first quarter of 2022 despite supply chain issues that for a time shut down production explorer was second in sales to only the highlander at 63 537 units explorer outsold telluride by a more than 2 1 margin according to goodcarbadcar change is coming full disclosure i happen to own a few shares of ford stock but i am not saying these things because i am mad about losing so much money last week on the contrary i think ford is a smart long play and i am impressed that in the short term ceo jim farley is maximizing profit from internal combustion engine stock while transforming ford into an electric car maker not completely electric one hastens to add in march farley split ford into two units ford blue to handle conventional drivetrains and ford model e for the electric side it s not like he s hedging his bets ford also operates an extensive commercial truck business as well as selling heavy duty pickups the mass and workload of larger vehicles make it difficult to build electric versions with acceptable range capacity remaking a company that can do both is painful while ford is pouring billions into building factories and forming partnerships to build chips and batteries it is also reducing investments and headcounts in other areas last week it announced it was terminating more than 500 engineers in the meantime it is in silicone valley recruiting new talent i kind of was watching the management team struggle with this transformation farley said in a public appearance in march from 7 to 8 they were working on chip supply from 9 to 10 they were trying to find lithium and nickel from 10 to 11 they were working back on emission control for a super duty he said you just can t ask people to do that many different things a new explorer is not something left for the new kids to design ford has an electric explorer and lincoln aviator nearly ready for production in december however it put those plans on hold saying it needed the capacity at its cuautitlán plant in mexico home of the soldout mustang mach e in april the mach e reached a new sales record and ford said it plans to sell 200 000 units a year by 2023 the explorer and aviator are to enter production at a yet to be determined location in december 2024 ford said in a memo to suppliers ford also recently began production of the mach e in china perhaps by the time it finally rolls out the new explorer the public will be ready to accept an e version ford delivers on promise to offer more rugged off road capable suvs and trucks by introducing the new explorer timberline the first timberline series

hold on as russian forces tighten their grip on the city s last redoubt advertising read more a smattering of ukrainian units making their last stand are sheltering in the labyrinth of soviet era bunkers and tunnels snaking beneath the sprawling steelworks along with an untold number of wounded and dead combatants details about the chaotic final defence and desperate efforts to tend to the wounded have been painstakingly pieced together by military medic yevgenia tytarenko whose husband and colleagues remain trapped inside the factory lots of soldiers are in serious condition in the hospital they are injured with no medicine food and water are running out said tytarenko who remains in regular contact with people inside the azovstal plant i ll be standing until the end tytarenko s husband and medic mykhailo texted to her on friday in a message shared with afp for weeks russian forces have pounded the steelworks by land air and sea while attempting to breach its defenses that have led to fierce firefights at the facility commanders have issued their final goodbyes to loved ones as supplies dwindle and the russians close in while the possibility of extracting the fighters looks increasingly unlikely said tytarenko commanders have already said their farewells to their wives one of them messaged his wife don t cry we ll be back home in any case alive or dead said tytarenko tytarenko described a chaotic and complex operation inside azovstal with fighters battling the russians while also shepherding civilians along with the bodies of those killed to different parts of the plant the azov regiment a former far right battalion turned national guard unit renowned for the mettle of its fighters are leading the defence of the steelworks azov telegram channel afp without refrigeration the bodies of the dead have been packed in plastic bags and are rotting but the fighters remain committed to preventing them from falling into the hands of the russian forces almost everywhere they are carrying corpses with them said tytarenko they deserve to be evacuated those who are alive injured and dead on saturday ukrainian authorities said that the remaining women children and elderly civilians had been evacuated from azovstal sparking fresh questions about what the future would hold for the fighters there ukraine s president volodymyr zelensky suggested on friday that diplomatic options were being mulled to rescue the ukrainian soldiers but offered few details blood and steel but for the families of mariupol s defenders the war has unleashed a devastating toll according to tytarenko the 34 year old fled mariupol on february 24 as russia launched its invasion into ukraine and began shelling the port city near the border the attack came just two days after she married her husband mykhailo who pushed his pregnant wife to leave as the russian military began to clobber mariupol her fellow medics stayed behind where they cobbled together the bare bones field clinic inside the heavily fortified steel factory after russian forces targeted hospitals across mariupol according to georgian national daviti suleimanashvili like tytarenko s husband suleimanashvili is a member of the azov regiment a former far right battalion turned national guard unit renowned for the mettle of its fighters who are leading the defence of the steelworks suleimanashvili said he was treated in the hospital in march after being hit by tank fire during a battle in mariupol s streets the azovstal steel plant is mariupol s last holdout satellite image 2022 maxar technologies afp it was there that suleimanashvili had his left leg amputated as doctors feverishly treated dozens of other wounded patients in the facility that lacked basic sanitation medical equipment and heating it s very hard to do any medical treatment there suleimanashvili told afp by phone conditions there are zero suleimanashvili said he was among the lucky few who were evacuated from mariupol by a trio of ukrainian helicopters that made it past russia s air defences in late march at least two other attempts to airlift out the wounded were thwarted by russian firepower according to suleimanashvili it was a miracle i only saw those kind of things in films suleimanashvili said of his evacuation final stand but for all the ongoing horror taking place at azovstal for some being on the outside is unbearable rolana bondarenko said dozens of her close friends and fellow azov fighters are among the hundreds holding out at the plant along with her son the 54 year old was one of the first members to join the azov regiment when it was founded in 2014 following russia s annexation of crimea and the outbreak of the moscow backed insurgency in ukraine s far east bondarenko said her son is now one of the many bodies being moved inside azovstal after he was killed in april for weeks russian forces have pounded the steelworks by land air and sea while attempting to breach its defenses that have led to fierce firefights at the facility andrey borodulin afp he s laying in a black bag and rotting there and it s not only him there are hundreds of others said bondarenko by phone in germany where she relocated last year for medical treatment but even after losing her son bondarenko said she presses on to support her fellow fighters who continue to push back against the russians everyday she sends texts and light hearted emojis to her friends on the inside to help keep their spirits up while they in turn have tried to shield bondarenko from the hardships they face insisting that the defenders fighting resolve remains strong even still many of the fighters in azovstal have lost between 15 and 20 kilograms 33 and 44 pounds in recent weeks with diminishing food stocks rationed among the military units civilians and wounded according to bondarenko i d like to be with them there now she said through sobs if i died there it would be with my

at 2308 on friday march 8 1996 a short distance south from the point where the west coast main line diverges at stafford into its birmingham and trent valley routes a mossend willesden freight train operated by transrail was making its way southbound towards wolverhampton a defective axle caused ten of its 23 wagons to derail either side of the track sending two of them tumbling into the path of a birmingham to glasgow travelling post office tpo train travelling in the opposite direction amid the tangled wreckage it is hard to believe now that the death toll was not much higher one person died and it easily could have been had the tpo s locomotive not mercifully come to rest on a bank just inches short of the side of a row of houses residents of adjacent cul de sac the russetts unaware of just how fortunate they d been emerged to a thick cloud of gas as several wagons laden with liquid carbon dioxide emptied their contents across the crash site transrail had been acquired from british rail only weeks earlier by wisconsin central transportation as part of the privatisation of all br s freight operations initial crash reports and the subsequent investigation were to raise serious questions over standards for wagon maintenance throwing the decision by john major s government to privatise the railways firmly back under the spotlight of public scrutiny at the time the crash was the most serious to occur since railtrack had assumed responsibility for rail infrastructure from br in 1994 and it was just two months before it was opened up to private investors on the stock exchange critics of privatisation would go on to portray rickerscote as an example of why taking the railways out of public ownership was in their view to the detriment of safety and maintenance on that fateful day the transrail freight had left mossend yard near glasgow at 1440 arriving at warrington arpley yard at 2038 here it was routinely examined by the duty rolling stock technician who found nothing of concern made up of 23 wagons hauled by two class 37s 37071 37207 it passed a lineside hot axle box detector just north of stafford at 2255 which detected nothing amiss meanwhile heading north was a tpo operated by rail express systems also recently acquired by wisconsin central transportation hauled by a class 86 86239 it comprised nine mk 1 royal mail parcel vans and sorting carriages it had been driven empty from london euston to coventry where mail was loaded and six royal mail employees joined the train a further stop was made at birmingham new street for mail and to pick up an additional 14 sorting staff at 2304 the transrail freight cleared trent valley junction and accelerated under clear signals along the up fast at the point where the line is joined by the up slow birmingham line and where three lines converge into two the driver noticed his train s air brake apply automatically bringing it from 35mph to a stop travelling northbound the tpo s driver graham massey was braking from 90mph to comply with the 60mph speed restriction at trent valley junction when he saw a dark object appear in front of him on his track seconds later the force of the collision split the freight train into three portions the two locomotives and leading eight wagons did not derail and suffered little damage but the following eight were strewn across the line one had contained aviation fuel but was fortunately empty the other seven were filled with pressurised carbon dioxide now leaking as a thick white pall across the shallow cutting two wagons loaded with starch lay derailed to the rear while the final five remained upright and on the tracks the tpo s class 86 absorbed much of the impact as it was forced up the bank and onto its side its leading edge almost touching the end wall of a terraced set of houses in the russetts the following four coaches concertinaed together and lay astride the two tracks while the remaining five managed to stay in position for the postal workers many of whom were on their feet as they busily sorted mail the crash threw them across carriages or down their entire length inflicting cuts bruises and whiplash injuries remarkably driver massey was able to crawl to safety through the side window of his cab despite suffering a broken leg and severe pelvic injuries
sometimes nothing is a real cool hand in the movie classic cool hand luke the convict luke played by paul newman explains that to his fellow inmates after winning the pot in a hand of poker without even a pair of deuces president joe biden should take notice for right now nothing is the hand he is looking at going into the 2022 election with the economy the predominant issue the last business day of april brought disquieting news for democrats nasdaq caps worst month since 2008 blared saturday s lead headline in the wall street journal dismal data fuel stagflation fears ran the top headline in the financial times market plunge reflects alarm of pain ahead blared the new york times subhead decline in april was worst in two years trajectory in question as markets tank again said page one of the washington post to what was the post referring nasdaq had closed down over 4 the dow jones industrial average was down over 900 points on the day the s p 500 was off 3 6 friday raising april s loss to nearly 9 of its value not since world war ii has the s p begun a year with a worse performance this bloodbath in the markets is piled atop an 8 5 inflation rate and a shrinkage of 1 4 in the gdp over the first quarter if a similar decline follows in the second quarter the economy on which biden s party stands or falls in november will officially be in recession with biden s disapproval rating already running 10 points higher than his 42 approval the economic issue could bring an even larger rout of house democrats than would be normal at the midterms the issue now ranked second as a national concern is the crisis on the border where 2 million illegal migrants crossed over in biden s first year and the gotaways who evaded every u s official while sneaking in are estimated in the hundreds of thousands some 8 000 migrants now cross the u s border every day and according to the biden administration itself half again that many will be crossing daily if title 42 which enables border authorities to turn back migrants into mexico for health concerns is lifted this month third in voters concern is the explosion in violent crime especially mass killings that involve four victims dead or wounded not including the perpetrator this year mass killings are nearly matching the record number set in biden s first year there was a time when mass murder like the st valentine s day massacre in chicago by the al capone gang or charlie starkweather s murderous rampage across the great plains in 1958 were rare events now people shooting up malls trains and subways and running down people with cars and trucks are daily occurrences biden is not responsible for the explosion of carjackings and mass killings or cop shootings but his party has come to be identified with its left wing s campaign to defund the police and refocus on the root causes of crime the social conditions said to produce criminals rather than the criminals themselves the republican party has come to be identified with solutions that involve more police more prosecutors and more prison cells and inmates which increasingly is where the country is at in addition to the issues turning against the democrats biden has himself become a drag on the party his low poll numbers verbal foot faults visible frailty and perceived cognitive decline all handicap efforts to portray him as a strong engaged and decisive leader the wild card in biden s poker hand is the war in ukraine biden has funneled 3 7 billion into the ukrainian war effort and sent javelin and stinger missiles and lately heavy artillery he is pressing congress for an additional 33 billion 20 billion of that in military aid over the next five months of this fiscal year thus far the u s political class in this capital has been largely united and supportive of the ukrainians but dissent is rising why it is being asked are we so focused on the eastern borders of ukraine when the southern border of the united states is being breached illegally by 200 000 invaders every month and thousands more gotaways some of whom are sex traffickers drug dealers terrorists and members of mexican cartels the future of the united states is not likely to be altered in a significant way by who eventually controls mariupol or the sea of azov but more than 2 million migrants every year walking into the united states at will cannot but have an impact on the future character and composition of the nation that has lost control of its border is whether moscow controls luhansk and donetsk which it did for the duration of the cold war and for decades before more important to us than whether the america we grew up in becomes more of a third world than a western nation copyright 2022 creators com photo by jay godwin lbj library public domain

among the works that first brought henry kissinger to academic acclaim was a world restored his 1950s book about how the greatest diplomats of europe met at the congress of vienna to restore order to a continent shattered by the napoleonic wars the balance of power peace these men achieved lasted with the significant exception of the franco prussian war of 1870 1871 for the full century from 1815 to 1914 writing in the wall street journal friday kissinger declared that it is now an imperative that the world s leaders even as they deal with the raging pandemic begin to make the transition to the post coronavirus order failure to do so could set the world on fire yet the ingredients kissinger considers essential for establishing that new world order appear like ventilators to be in short supply sustaining public trust asserts kissinger is crucial to international peace and stability but how do we trust again our adversary china after its criminal cover up of the menace and magnitude of the virus unleashed in wuhan how do we trust again this regime that was until recently blaming the coronavirus on u s army troops visiting wuhan observing governments thrashing about in the crisis the phrase that comes to mind is not public trust as much as every nation for itself on monday the wall street journal described europe s recent behavior thus eu countries unilaterally shut borders and hoarded vital medical gear leaving people stranded far from home grocery stores struggling to stock shelves and hospitals desperate to save critically ill patients when italy and spain reeling from some of the world s most deadly outbreaks urged their richer and healthier northern neighbors to help dutch politicians brushed off the appeals as new signs of southerners mismanagement last week the eu s court of justice ruled that poland hungary and the czech republic broke eu law by refusing to relocate refugees during the migrant crisis in 2015 the three nations offered no apologies last month greece used force to stop syrian refugees from entering its territory according to human rights watch greek troops and armed men at the greece turkey land border sexually assaulted robbed and stripped asylum seekers and migrants driving them back into turkey the eu has stayed largely silent when donald trump s issued his jan 31 travel ban on those who had recently been in china candidate joe biden denounced trump for hysterical xenophobia and fearmongering biden now thinks trump did the right thing even lifetime liberals can put ideology on the shelf when the voice of the people is loud and clear enough we must struggle to heal the wounds to the world economy said kissinger yet the crisis has revealed that a prominent feature of this global economy is that china controls the production of medicines essential to keeping americans alive do we want to continue that dependency says kissinger the world s democracies need to defend and sustain their enlightenment values and safeguard the principles of the liberal world order but did not march 2020 prove the superior wisdom of alexander hamilton every nation ought to endeavour to possess within itself all the essentials of national supply today borders are everywhere being strengthened as nations compete ferociously for n95 masks and ventilators authoritarian rulers are seizing broader powers the claims of family faith tribe nation and country seem ascendant over all the founding legend of modern government writes kissinger is a walled city strong enough to protect the people from an external enemy this pandemic has produced a revival of the walled city in an age where prosperity depends on global trade and movement of people kissinger calls the concept of the walled city an anachronism a legend but is the idea of the nation state whose principal duty is the defense of the health safety and security of the unique people who created it the legend or is the real legend the myth the idea of some new world order of countries traveling and trading happily with one another in a federation of the world in this coronavirus crisis we can see clearly now no longer as through a glass darkly as in most wars it is to the men of action not the men of words to whom the people turn to governors not legislators or members of congress who are taking action as states outbid one another for critical medical equipment as for donald trump suddenly the elites are berating him for being insufficiently dictatorial trump they rail did not move swiftly enough to invoke the defense production act he failed to use its authority to dictate to u s companies what they must produce he did not shut down the country quickly enough he failed to issue orders soon enough to governors who delayed shutting down their states people are dying it is now said because trump did not immediately become the autocrat that progressives were denouncing him for being during the impeachment hearings two months ago
by charles kenny the director of technology and development and a senior fellow at the center for global development and scott morris the co director of sustainable development finance and a senior fellow at the center for global development as usual u s assistance pays everyone except governments actually providing services to the world s poor in recent weeks u s president joe biden made good on the promise he made at last year s g 7 summit in cornwall england to launch a set of infrastructure investments in developing countries under the banner of build back better world b3w his administration has rolled out new initiatives on digital connectivity child care infrastructure and health facility electrification three areas that are surely important to global development progress but sadly consistent with every major u s aid initiative of the past 20 years b3w appears to channel virtually all its funds through a washington bubble of agencies contractors and nongovernmental organizations providing hardly a cent of bilateral aid to developing country governments whether you are a softhearted advocate for development or a hardened hawk aiming to contain china that s a huge mistake the united states the world s largest aid donor directs its spending to just about everybody except the governments of developing countries it pays the u s military to provide emergency relief services subsidizes private firms to invest in infrastructure projects funds ngos to deliver aid in the health education and humanitarian sectors and pays billions of dollars to private consulting firms within spitting distance of the white house to provide so called technical assistance according to our calculations of the 51 billion in u s aid tracked by foreignassistance gov in fiscal 2020 about 40 percent was spent by the u s government itself to buy goods and pay salaries for example another 20 percent was administered by u s based firms and nonprofits a little more than 30 percent went to international organizations the united nations and other multilateral bodies and international ngos of the small remainder foreign firms and nonprofits mostly based in recipient countries received just above 5 percent that leaves partner country governments in the developing world the recipients of just 3 9 percent of u s aid spending take out jordan which receives a large part of u s bilateral development aid and that drops to a mere 0 7 percent today s proponents of foreign aid particularly on capitol hill are typically at pains to emphasize how little aid goes directly to other governments the prevailing attitude is that it s too risky to direct grants and loans to foreign governments with lending the fear is that countries will default on their debt as has frequently happened in the past but the u s government is averse to bilateral grants as well fearing corruption and incompetence it didn t help the cause of direct bilateral aid in washington when in 2020 the world bank released a study that found disbursements to highly aid dependent countries coincided with increased financial flows into tax havens expand your perspective with unlimited access to fp subscribe now that said the study estimated that in these particularly poor and weakly governed developing countries 5 percent of world bank assistance leaked offshore compared to other leakage rates such as for oil windfalls in oil dependent states that is actually quite low the study s authors note that the difference may be due to the fact that foreign aid is generally subject to monitoring and control by the donors considering the increasingly strong evidence of the positive effects of direct bilateral aid such as the growth impact of world bank support to poor country governments and reductions in child mortality as a result of u s aid to weakly governed states we considerably overestimate the risks of direct support whatever your development priority may be trying to work around rather than through governments is fighting with one hand and three more fingers tied behind your back the aid architecture that has come to replace government to government support in the united states carries its own set of risks these include beltway bandits putting profits over people and private sector deals that show little impact and it leaves out an indispensable partner for development progress and for providing the public goods and services that sustain human and environmental wellbeing governments are responsible for 83 percent of infrastructure investment in developing countries provide the vast bulk of health and education services set policies and write regulations today s u s aid architecture provides next to no finance to directly influence or support government activities whether your development priority is renewable energy or pandemic preparedness trying to work around rather than through governments is fighting with one hand and three more fingers tied behind your back the disconnect between washington s financing tools and the global south s development needs is only getting worse the covid 19 pandemic has exploded deficits even as rich countries are pressuring poor ones to bear new budget burdens by tackling climate change problems for which they bear little responsibility and developing countries are acutely vulnerable to movements in financial markets interest rate increases in the united states are already increasing debt service obligations and shutting some governments out of international finance altogether kenya

of life hurt he added it doesn t matter who you are you are feeling this economy the national shortage which experts say stems from pandemic related supply chain issues has worsened in recent months

whose administration has provided more than 4 billion to ukraine since he was elected with plans to shell out billions more in the coming months in six states more than 50 of baby formula is out of stock banks a republican wrote across the country the price of formula is up nearly 20 percent from last year he went on also noting the current inflation crisis that has emerged in the little more

strong words over social media this week in regards to the shortage parents already have to worry about higher gas prices expensive groceries and higher utility bills and now no baby formula on the shelves thanks biden the politician wrote even democrats are pleading the president take action with us senator jack reed of rhode island sending a letter to biden last month urging his administration to take action to address the shortage this recent baby formula shortage is causing a lot of stress for new parents and it can be hard to find a specific brand at local stores reed wrote but the good news is there is plenty of baby formula to go around we just need to get it to those in need i want to ensure the federal government is doing its part being proactive and helping new moms and dads and solve this issue said reed the politician then poised a series of questions to the president which have since remained unanswered 1 what steps have your agencies taken to minimize the impact of the immediate shortage reed wrote 2 when do your agencies expect baby formula inventory to be back to sufficient levels and 3 what measures should be taken in the long term to minimize the supply chain disruptions for what is an essential product for many families even democrats are pleading the president take action with us senator jack reed of rhode island sending a letter to biden last month urging his administration to take action to address the shortage meanwhile parents across the country have also taken to social media to plead for political action and more media coverage to address the shortage posting pictures of barren store shelves as the shortage continues to worsen if the msm can talk about the toilet paper shortage ever sic hour they should be talking about the baby

mom in new york told wktv earlier in the week that she went to five different stores and still failed to find any formula i cried in the store because i couldn t find what she needed the emotional mom told the outlet tuesday ashleigh olsen of jacksonville florida said her 9 month old is limited to a specific formula she orders straight from the manufacturer as her son could face an allergic reaction to others but there is no word on when it will be available again luckily i stocked up last time so today when i opened my last can that kind of lit my fire a little bit olsen said in the midwest kassidi hillard who has a 2 month old who needs similac pro advance told wdrb she has looked at every store in indiana and here in kentucky and haven t found her formula at not one store it s kind of stressful cause if you can t find formula it s like they can t eat nothing else hillard said they can t have baby food they can t have hard food they can t have what we eat so it s really it s not an easy thing to go through in texas emily pyeatt 22 wrote on facebook that she recently went to eight stores in search of formula for her 8 month old this is the scariest thing i ve ever experienced she wrote on march 30 how are we supposed to feed our children when there s no formula on the shelves she later told the washington post that as she was down to her last three cans she has been easing her son onto more solid foods as she does not produce enough milk to breastfeed it was a very heartbreaking decision to stop and i think it s upsetting for someone to say that pyeatt said adding i pray for the women who have babies who are not old enough for solid food danielle arzola 27 also of texas told the post that when she tried to switch formula brands her 6 month old got sick

meantime experts say parents should not dilute their baby s formula try to make their own formula at home or try to replace it with cow s milk doing so is not nutritionally comparable with breast milk or infant formula according to brian dittmeier senior director of public policy at the national wic association and could cause nutrient deficiencies that can have a profound impact on an infant s growth and development he said any parents who are struggling to find formula can contact their local wic agencies and food banks for help locating some in their communities the infant nutrition council of america is also encouraging parents to keep a 10 day to two week supply of formula at home but is urging them not to stockpile products as the shortage continues and experts say there is no end in sight the president has yet to comment on or address the shortage
on wednesday the s p 500 stock index jumped 3 as if all was right with the world on thursday stocks collapsed with the tech heavy nasdaq index plunging 5 as if the end of times was in sight things friday were only slightly better the s p fell again but only by 0 6 and the nasdaq lost 1 4 it was the fifth consecutive weekly decline in the s p 500 its longest streak of losses since june 2011 if you are looking for patterns in the market s wild swings the answer is simple the financial markets are coming to grips with a stunning policy change by the federal reserve over the past two decades financial markets may have become so accustomed to encouragement from the fed that they just don t know how to react now that the central bank is doing its best to slow down the economy but the fed s intentions are evident if you read and listen fed chair jerome powell said unequivocally during a news conference wednesday that the central bank was really and truly committed to driving down inflation a transcript of powell s words is available on the fed site so is the text of the fed s latest policy statement check for yourself the fed is willing to increase unemployment in the united states if that is what s required to get the job done and while they would much prefer that the united states doesn t fall into a recession fed policymakers are willing to take the heat if the economy falters this may be hard to accept and for a good reason pretty much since the start of the great financial crisis that began in 2008 the loose monetary policy of this very same federal reserve has repeatedly propelled financial markets to giddy heights by reducing short term interest rates to virtually zero and by buying trillions of dollars in bonds and other securities the central bank kept the financial system from freezing up and then some it stimulated business activity effectively lowered the yields of a broad range of bonds and encouraged investors to take risks that drove up the stock market these extraordinarily generous policies are at least partly responsible for the current burst of inflation the most serious episode of rising prices since the 1980s yet at its latest policymaking meeting wednesday the fed made it more obvious than ever that it has shifted its policy in a fundamental way that is understandably extremely difficult for financial markets to digest this is a very big change and the markets are having trouble processing it said robert dent senior u s economist for nomura securities no wonder the markets have been swerving wildly falling one day rising the next but trending downward since the beginning of the year because the risks that the economy faces and that the fed faces are so great and because the responses by the fed could be so significant you re seeing swings that are very big every day dent said swings that a year or 24 months ago would have been highly unusual are now the norm yet the current situation is anything but normal the covid 19 pandemic has left millions of casualties worldwide and it s not over from the narrow viewpoint of economics the pandemic threw supply and demand for a vast range of goods and services out of whack and that has baffled policymakers how much of the current bout of inflation has been caused by covid 19 and what can the fed possibly do about it then there are the continuing lockdowns in china which have reduced the supply of chinese exports and dampened chinese demand for imports both of which are altering global economic patterns on top of all that is the oil price shock caused by russia s war in ukraine and by the sanctions against russia until late last year the fed said that the inflation problem was transitory its response to an array of global challenges was to flood the u s economy and the world with money it helped to reduce the effect of the 2020 recession in the united states and it contributed to great wealth creating rallies in the stock and bond markets but now the fed has recognized that inflation has gotten out of control and must be significantly slowed this is how powell put it wednesday inflation is much too high and we understand the hardship it is causing and we re moving expeditiously to bring it back down he said we have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of american families and businesses but its tools for reducing the rate of inflation without causing undue harm to the economy are actually quite crude and limited he later acknowledged in response to a reporter s question we have essentially interest rates the balance sheet and forward guidance and they re famously blunt tools he said they re not capable of surgical precision as if that were not scary enough for an operation as delicate as the fed is attempting he added no one thinks this will be easy no one thinks it s straightforward but there is certainly a plausible path to this and i do think there we ve got a good chance to do that and you know our job is not to rate the chances it is to try to achieve it so that s what we re doing well fine the fed needs to make the attempt but given the precariousness of the situation the high volatility in financial markets is exactly what i d expect to see the federal reserve is committed to continuing to raise the short term interest rate it controls the federal funds rate to well above 2 25 only a few months ago that rate stood close to zero and wednesday the fed raised it to the 0 50 to 0 75 range the fed also said it would begin reducing its 9 trillion balance sheet in june by about 1 trillion over the next year and it continues to issue cautionary forward guidance warnings of the kind that powell made wednesday watch out he was essentially saying financial conditions are going to get much tougher as tough as needed to stop inflation from becoming entrenched and deeply destructive the fed will be using blunt instruments on the u s economy there will be damage inevitably people will lose their jobs when the economy slows there will be pain even if it isn t intended in the financial markets short term traders are unable to make sense of all this the day to day shifts in the markets are about as informative as the meandering of a squirrel but for those with long horizons the outlook is straightforward enough a period of wrenching volatility is inescapable this happens periodically in financial markets yet those very markets tend to produce wealth for people who are able to ride out this turbulence it is important as always to make sure you have enough money put aside for an emergency then assess your ability to withstand the effect of nasty headlines and unpleasant financial statements documenting market losses cheap broadly diversified index funds that track the overall market are being hit hard right now but i m still putting money into them over the long run that approach has led to prosperity count on more market craziness until the fed s struggle to beat inflation has been resolved but if history is a guide the odds are that you will do well if you can get through it this

the last time i wrote in labor notes i described the captive audience listening sessions that starbucks corporate had attempted to use against me and my co workers who are trying to unionize our hopewell starbucks in central new jersey see how we turned the tables on starbucks union busters march 2022 after corporate failed spectacularly in our first one they decided to cancel the second saying they had no new information to share with us we haven t had any since even though many of us have requested another as we have plenty of information to share with them instead starbucks corporate decided to skip to the next tactic in its playbook one on one meetings between one barista and a manager or multiple managers the idea seemed to be that separating us would break our solidarity and make it easier to lie to us but once again they found hopewell baristas ready to see through their lies push back and support each other for our first round of one on ones these meetings were framed as reviewing our benefits basically they intended to tell us how great our benefits are and that they could take them away they want us to think we stand to lose all these incredible benefits if we unionize we know we wouldn t actually but they genuinely think we re dumb enough to fall for thinly veiled threats a venti cup of bright and early one day our manager met with nye a barista she must have thought would be easily intimidated and offer little pushback she boldly told this partner lies she hadn t even tried with others including a clumsy analogy i m sure she was very proud of if you think about it you ve got a venti cup full of benefits she said condescendingly to make room for more you d have to empty some out first right nye responded by asking point blank are you saying you ll take away my benefits our manager saw her mistake backed off with a no of course not and moved on during my own one on one our manager began by saying she couldn t find the paper she had her written questions on throughout the meeting she mentioned this repeatedly and kept pausing to think it was such odd behavior i had to assume it was some tactic the union busting experts had taught her what else could it be i was wrong i later found out that she actually had lost her questions because she d accidentally handed the sheet corporate had given her to the barista in the meeting before mine this sheet had detailed guidelines on how to run a one on one automating heartwarming moments through directions like add a personal story here share your favorite starbucks memory and help barista set up a benefit they showed interest in at another meeting our store manager and a partner resources manager an hr executive followed those very guidelines and attempted to help a barista olivia set up her 401k they tried a few times and had some technical errors unsurprising to any partner who has tried to set up benefits support labor notes become a monthly donor give 10 a month or more and get our fight the boss build the union t shirt then they gave up and awkwardly told her that they guessed she would have to call the company number on her own time that was weeks ago and they still haven t checked in with olivia or helped her find answers for some reason i cannot explain beyond corporate incompetence management also decided these meetings were the right occasion to inform partners who are under 18 that they are not eligible for many of the best benefits including starbucks stocks and a 401 k they also don t get any other benefits to compensate for this but we ve since discussed addressing it ourselves in our future contract negotiations a six cent raise we were prepared for the one on ones one barista paul started off his meeting by responding to the manager s how are you with pretty good everyone s feeling strong about unionizing scott just got fired and hamilton starbucks just filed scott was our former district manager who had bragged about his past experience union busting in philadelphia paul also brought up that the tenured raises that managers had bragged about in meetings had gotten him an entire six cent an hour increase our manager looked upset and said that sounds wrong she searched through her computer for a few minutes to find the numbers realized paul was correct and uncomfortably admitted so in a fortuitous bit of timing two baristas came to the back at this moment to get their coats so paul announced to them hey i did only get a six cent raise they expressed their disgust while our manager looked anywhere but at them in one of her final one on ones our manager chose exactly the wrong barista to try a classic union busting lie on if you guys unionize i won t be able to help you out on the floor to be clear this is something our manager never does in the first place i d be able to speak to an unhappy customer she said but i wouldn t be able to for example remake their drink if you ve worked at a starbucks or really any food service job you understand how laughable a scenario it is in which a manager bothers to do something as plebeian as remaking a drink this barista just said honestly this store could run itself without a manager corporate had sprung the one on ones on us with little notice likely hoping we wouldn t have time to prepare for them as we had for the store meetings as one of my co workers put it starbucks separated us to try to level the playing field they didn t take into account the months of long hours we ve worked together day after day struggling together to successfully run a busy store with the few resources the company chooses to give us in the nearly three years i ve worked at starbucks the resourcefulness and teamwork i ve seen in my co workers have been truly staggering unfortunately for corporate hopewell baristas had built such solidarity and trust through the shared obstacles and stress starbucks itself has put us through that we were already ready sara mughal is a shift supervisor and member of starbucks workers united at the hopewell starbucks in pennington new jersey all other starbucks workers names used in this article

austin texas texas gov greg abbott has said he would challenge a 1982 u s supreme court ruling requiring states to offer free public education to all children including undocumented migrants known as plyler v doe the ruling overturned a texas law that denied funding for state education to children who were legally admitted to the u s but not citizens of texas this week abbott told conservative radio host joe pagliarulo that it is time for texas to again limit the state s responsibility to educate non citizens i think we will resurrect that case and challenge this issue again because the expenses are extraordinary and the times are different than when plyler versus doe was issued many decades ago abbott said abbott made his comments as many republicans celebrated the publication of a draft opinion indicating that the supreme court s conservative majority is ready to revoke the landmark case establishing the right to abortion known as roe v wade addressing illegal immigration has been a major campaign issue for conservatives including abbott who last year launched a border security initiative known as operation lone star illegal immigration was having an impact on the public school system in texas pagliarulo stressed stating we are talking about public tax dollars public property tax dollars going to fund these schools to teach children who are 5 6 7 10 years old who do not even have remedial english skills this is a real burden on communities the challenge put on our public systems is extraordinary abbott replied blaming plyler v doe for forcing texas to bear that burden during an unrelated event held in houston abbott said he was concerned about the expected increase in migrants entering texas if the biden administration ends title 42 a trump era public health policy that expedited removal of migrants at the border including asylum seekers that leads to education obligations as well as other obligations that are simply unsustainable and unaffordable he said abbott s comments were swiftly criticized by democrats including white house press secretary jen psaki who said denying public education to kids including immigrants to this country i mean that is not a mainstream point of view there are a few paths for abbott to pursue to challenge plyler v doe a possibility would be for the legislature to pass a bill similar to the statute that was overturned in 1982 though civil rights groups would likely launch legal challenges that could return the issue to the supreme court the legislature s next regular session will begin in january 2023

the indices are very scary and hope of redemption or renewal in the immediate pretty thin the fault lines have become more visible the union appears greatly cracked if not badly broken mending it will take time a long time as embers of ethnic and religious suspicions across the land have become red hot the international monetary fund imf as of february this year projected that 92 6 per cent of accruable revenue to the country in 2022 will be spent servicing accumulated debts by september last year it stood at 76 per cent which meant every 76 kobo of every one naira realised by government in the year went into payment of interests on loans imf also released a gloomy forecast that public debt will grow in 2022 by 117 8 per cent on a year to year basis with inflation projected to average 14 3 per cent at the moment the total debt stock of nigeria is projected by the debt management office dmo as recently as march 2022 to rise from n39 55 trillion that is by december 2021 to n45 trillion following plans to borrow n6 39 trillion to finance deficit in this year s budget travelling within the country has become a taboo particularly in some northern parts of the country whether by train or road kidnappers and blood sucking terrorists are on the prowl the list of scary statistics is longer than has been presented above in spite of the frightening situations and a fast deteriorating economy as many as 40 politicians are crowding the presidential race track in both the governing all progressives congress apc and the opposition peoples democratic party pdp a few others in smaller parties are equally sprinting to replace president muhammadu buhari whose job expires on may 29 next year with the gloom that stares the citizens and future of the country in terms of revenue generation what then is the attraction for these presidential athletes is it a case of lust for office without commensurate commitment to the responsibilities attached to the office or genuine intention to repair the badly damaged environment and psyche of the mass impoveroshed nigerians appetite to wield presidential power for the sake of doing so watchers of happenings in the polity have strongly debated how the borrowed presidential system of government makes whoever is the president of the country a dictator this observers say might be one of the factors inducing the unbridled appetite in joining the presidential race in fact one common censure against nigeria s presidential democracy is not just its expensiveness on account of needlessly duplicated bureaucracies but also the fact that it gives whoever is the president the opportunity to wield the power of life and death over the various aspects of national life of course this is aided by the 1999 constitution which donates 68 awesome powers to the president in the exclusive list making the federal government the only federating unit that takes decisions on the items listed therein the pseudo federal structure also makes the operation of the system awkward in nigeria when compared to the political realities in india or the united states where presidentialism was borrowed appraising the presidential system which the country first operated between 1979 and 1983 a former minister of education and ex ambassador to germany professor tunde adeniran then a senior lecture at the political science department in the university of ibadan in a paper entitled four years of presidential democracy in nigeria said by adopting the presidential system of democracy nigeria has thus added the challenge of operating an untested presidential system to the task of running a federal system of government the rapidity of events the bewildering array of political realities socio economic paradoxes and indeed the actors forces and pressures on the nigerian scene are rather intriguing and challenging also speaking on why the presidential system is not suitable for nigeria an associate professor in the department of history obafemi awolowo university ile ife adetunji ogunyemi listed four major inherent demerits of the system regardless of the historionics of the presidential system of government and the comparative advantage between it and the parliamentary system i posit that four different debilities if you like demerits of the model do not recommend presidentialism to the nigerian environment the first is that it is utterly expensive i don t need to stress that the second one is that it makes the president almost like a dictator he is in charge of virtually all the powers particularly appointive power by which if the president becomes nepotistic as we have today in nigeria the country can either go into implosion or atrophy as a result of that nepotistic disposition i give you an example section 153 of the 1999 constitution created 14 federal executive bodies these bodies are the ones in charge of the country there is no aspect of the nigeria life that can escape these bodies without deference to anybody or even to the state from where they come it is the president that appoints members of these bodies these bodies are the code of conduct bureau the council of state the federal character commission the federal civil service commission the federal judicial service commission the independent national electoral commission the national defence council the national economic council the national judicial council njc and so on one single human being appoints people into these bodies i have calculated it when you put all the appointees of the president in the country alone together they are 6 111 only the president alone appoints this much without anybody filtering what happens when such awesome power falls into the hand of a nepotistic president as we have now the country is going to go into an implosion or there will be such division and hate that the country will almost atrophy the third thing about demerit of nigeria s presidential system is that it tends to emasculate the governors the use of the armed forces and the suppressive apparatus of the state is also part of the reasons why the presidential system of government should not be used in nigeria one of nigeria s highly celebrated historians j s cookey in 1982 highlighted the disadvantages of the presidential system and warned that except the country practices rotational presidency there was no way the idea of presidentialism won t lead to nepotism in an ethnically charged country like nigeria when a single person seizes the jugular of the power centre in the country and he is a nepotistic person god will help such a country avenue to raise election funds for parties with nomination and expression of interest forms for presidential aspirants sold at n40m and n100m respectively in pdp and apc the parties are in for a bounty cash harvest to prosecute the 2023 elections newspaper reports have put the interim amount realised by the two major parties from forms at about n50b this has also fuelled speculations about the possibility of the parties and their chiftains masking their spending on the elections under the guise of purchasing forms with a view to circumventing the financial limit set in the new electoral act although some apc chieftains have justified the whopping n100m for forms as a strategy to separate pretenders from contenders the weight of the argument against such defence has been too strong to demolish the independent national electoral commission inec has said it would deploy technology and work in concert with strategic partners to monitor closely what candidates spend at election and see to the compliance of the provisions of the electoral act from n1bn limit in the former law campaign spending limit for presidential candidate has been raised to n5b just as that of governorship candidate has gone up from n200m to n1b the same 500 per cent increase applies to other offices despite this increase critical commentators feel the new limits are not realistic in view of how heavily monetised the electoral processes are becoming and the current value of the naira according to ogunyemi the limits set are not realistic and completely not in sync with the value of the naira and the reality of the economy if anybody wants to contest in nigeria he will need to be relevant in 774 sub units of the country that is 768 local government and six area councils in fct it is practically impossible for a presidential candidate not to print 30 million posters and each poster with colour separation is about n37 but even if it is n30 and he will print such posters in igbo hausa kanuri yoruba attires meaning it will be in at least 27 attires of the major ethnic groups in the country when you multiply that by 30million it is already more than n2billion for posters alone the candidate will do an advertising brief of about four months and aired about seven times on radio and on television with one exposure being between n75 000 and n150 000 that is another n3billion for advertising alone there are people who are called footsoldiers such as party agents and even agents against agents because your agents can collaborate with the agents of other parties to rob you so there will be provision for a policeman for a policeman and at least three agents per polling booth if you pay your agents n40 000 and the opposition is paying them n100 000 do you think they will support you for anybody to contest as president of the country the fellow will need a minimum of n30billion over the years candidates have found ways to short circuit the law by permitting their political parties to spend the extras for them political parties can spend an unrestricted amount of money on their candidates but it is only the candidate that is prevented from spending more than n5billion for a presidential election they will just divert what they have into the spending of their parties and claim they are not the ones doing the spending after the parties will be doing the spending on behalf of the candidates so the provisions on spending limit can easily be circumvented and of course they have been circumventing the law they said nobody can donate more than n10million what if the person donates through his proxies n10m in 1 000 places so that law is not implementable it is part of the utopia in our system inec should concentrate more on the veracity authenticity and the veracity of election results rather than nosing into how much a candidate should spend or not spend giving his own perspective on the attraction for the 40 presidential hopefuls jostling for one position chairman of the ikeja branch of the nigerian bar association nba dr monday ubani said the attraction is too much they know that as president there will be too much money at their disposal and there are no checks and balances in the system and as long as there are no checks and there is unhindered access to the treasury we will not be able to get it right in our political system the moment they get there the passion is how to grab as much as they can not about performing in the interest of the people which they are not interested in a system that does not check what a governor or a president takes out of the system is a very faulty system this is why we will keep on having desperation in the political system you will see how the political class will mess up the new electoral act in 2023 because of desperation and what they can get the unfortunate thing is that we are not addressing this area you are asking a candidate to pay n100m in order to pick a form he probably goes a borrowing or he steals tell me how many aspirants who genuinely want to change things in nigeria that will easily raise n100m and everything about that person is legitimate and is not a thief and has not held any public office before to ask a legitimate business man who wants to change the country to pick just form alone for n100m and we are not talking about campaign where people will be demanding money from him you will find out that our system is a very corrupt system which the system itself encourages we may not have the best at the end of the day what we will have as people who will be in charge are clear armed robbers who will see n100m as chicken change and will just pay it and probably get back into the system to steal more from the poor so it is a useless system we are running claims expensive forms were bought by friends groups not a few of the aspirants have claimed that the cost of the forms was borne by either their friends or associates or groups who identify with their aspiration and have faith in their capacity to govern the country better but ubani thinks otherwise if not that god is a very merciful god the moment they open their mouths to tell those lies god will just strike them dead they are the ones providing the money and telling us that it is their friends that are raising the money they think that we are fools who can be deceived if not that god is very kind immediately they open their mouth to tell such lies god will strike them dead but god is merciful he allows liars and the righteous to thrive until the final judgment day are there some of these aspirants that can redeem nigeria while nigerians are not enamoured of many of those offering themselves as presidential materials some of them have enjoyed positive reviews from the various segments of the nigerian society even for those in that category the challenges according to observers are daunting to ubani one two of the motley lot possess the qualities nigerians want in the next president he said from among those who are parading themselves now and i don t know who is coming tomorrow if you ask me i have only two people from those who have actually indicated interest one in apc and one in pdp who if you give them power they will be able to change the system i won t name these individuals all others are just joining the crowd the elections next year questions have been raised on whether there will be a change in the voting among the common people apart from the 1998 1999 elections which ushered in the current fourth republic with a record turnout of 69 1 per cent subsequent elections have witnessed a persistent drop in the voter turnout but will there be a change in next year s transitional election will voters realise that poverty has been weaponised by the political class and consequently shun the money bait of the politicians and vote their conscience will inec live up to its billing of making the election backed by a new electoral act which favours e transmission of results a watershed in the history of the country the nba chairman explains how change can come about in the elections the history of changes is dependent on the people if nigerians want real change you will see what they will do he however fears the new election law would be circumvented by the political class restructuring as a task for next president many stakeholders including various ethnic nationality groups and the very senior lawyer chief afe babalola have called for the postponement of the elections to pave the way for a transition government that will midwife the process for a new government after the extant wobbly structure must have been cured of its glaring defects through restructuring asked if there is a prelude to the restructuring being clamoured for especially with the current efforts at amending the 1999 constitution ubani agrees with those who described the step as mere tokenism what they are doing is a patch patch method we need a new people s constitution yes they patch patch they are doing can bring about some changes but the changes won t be fundamental because the 1999 constitution is faulty even if you make corrections to some sections of the constitution there are many other sections that are very flawed and give so much power to certain places where power is not supposed to be given so we need a people oriented constitution a constitution that people will really sit down and give themselves and some of the things that are wrong will be corrected the local government system for instance is clearly flawed we have more local government councils which collect so much money from the system if you go to the north they have more local government areas yet development is not reaching down to the grass roots they just collect their allocations and share them we need to restructure the system to stop that practice where the local government councils are taking so much and there is no accountability so the patch patch stuff will not take us far we need a holistic system change and only a people s constitution can bring it about and enhance the functionality of the system i am not ignorant of some of the minor changes that they are making now we can t make gargantuan progress with such patch patch method many declarers few

welcome to britain may 2022 and one of the most toxic and dangerous economic moments i can recall last week the bank of england forecast inflation exceeding 10 and predicted negligible growth for the next two years toppling into months of recession accompanied by the savage squeeze on living standards this is serious enough but less remarked and of as much importance is the 10 devaluation of sterling over the past three months this is a reaction to the economic trap britain is in intensified by the implosion of our eu trade post brexit and the brexit induced fall away in inward investment if sterling s fall continues the bank of england s policy choices will be even grimmer at the moment it hopes that interest rates will peak at a manageable 2 5 before inflation starts to fall back to 2 in 2025 but that depends on an end to sterling s decline if the bank has to reassure the financial markets about its determination to contain inflation and staunch the pound s continuing weakness why would anyone buy it interest rates could yet climb higher brexit tories neither understand modern capitalism nor how to manage it the economy will be forced into deeper recession with already visible strains in parts of the property market becoming more intense the markets would be more reassured if it were clear that the government had a strategy a programme a plan the problem the government is clueless hanging on to two quasi religious shibboleths it cannot shed in its eyes the hard brexit it negotiated is a sacred achievement that can imply only opportunity not crisis its faults cannot be acknowledged second thatcherism has such standing that any purposeful action to address the economy s weaknesses is deemed unconservative the government s economic understanding is thus childlike free markets low regulation low taxes balanced budgets and cheap disposable labour as the alchemy to drive 21st century economic growth the uselessness of these attitudes has been in plain sight over recent weeks called to brainstorm responses to the cost of living crisis ministers suggested enlarging the number of children carers can look after urging people to claim benefits for which they are entitled and making mot tests biennial really meanwhile checks on eu imported products at our borders are to be deferred until the end of 2023 with no reciprocal relaxation of uk exports to the eu to ram home our weakness boris johnson was reduced to pleading with softbank the owner of our hi tech jewel arm to float the company in london rather than new york this is the 40bn acquisition made weeks after brexit to tory and brexiter applause a sign that britain remained open for business those of us who warned it was opportunistic asset stripping and softbank s promises worthless were dismissed as remoaners over attached to project fear expect arm to float in new york rather than in diminished brexit london the markets need to see a confidence creating plan to restore economic growth animating investment and productivity brexit tories neither understand modern capitalism nor how to manage it ensuring that inflation does not become self feeding and entrenched requires more than interest rate hikes and boosterish bluster the markets need to see a confidence creating plan to restore economic growth animating investment and productivity the working population need to know the government will have their back to protect living standards for the duration of the cost of living crisis thus heading off aggression over wage claims that could trigger a wage price spiral there is neither while the new german government is vigorously pursuing a twin track strategy of driving to net zero and creating a new digital economy that impresses the markets we possess nothing levelling up creating globally competitive cities in every region and nation could have been such a strategy one that plausibly could double gdp over a generation it should be made front and centre of the government s economic policy along with a drive to net zero instead it was vetoed by the chancellor holding on to his piggy bank to protect tax cuts in 2024 nor is there any strategy on the cost of living there is more than enough scope even before windfall taxes the office for budget responsibility projects that in three years the government will have exceeded its target of a balanced budget by 31bn the chancellor could make a targeted annual cash payment of 500 to each of the 10m hard hit households reliant on benefits to absolve them of the choice between food heat and clothes if he had to do it for the rest of this parliament the total bill would be 10bn comfortably affordable and allowing millions to breathe more easily the industrial strategy should be revived and renewed but focused on the new economy of intangibles where intellectual property knowledge digitisation brands and human capital are king we need to build institutions ranging from a smarter competition authority to better banks and investors who get the intangible revolution and how to drive it on reality must prevail about where economic opportunity lies modern economies are densely interrelated with supply chains that cross borders britain has too few corporate primes that lead their sector but it does have lots of medium size companies whose business is being part of a wider supply chain membership of the single market with common regulatory standards used to make that easy now as ulrich hoppe director general of the german british chamber of commerce said last week brexit britain is being cut out of these supply chains because the hassle of meeting common standards is too great out of the eu and strategy free deindustrialisation is accelerating across the midlands and north yet presiding over this is a directionless government fiercely protected by its press whose sole purpose has become maintaining the prime minister in office rather than address these weaknesses future parliamentary time is to be consecrated to pursuing its vendetta against channel 4 and the bbc those whom the gods would destroy to coin a phrase they first make mad

these passive income powerhouses sport an average yield of 7 45 while there are a number of moneymaking investing strategies buying dividend stocks just might be the best back in 2013 j p morgan asset management a division of money center bank jpmorgan chase issued a report comparing the performance of companies that initiated and grew their payouts to publicly traded companies that didn t pay a dividend over a 40 year stretch 1972 2012 the dividend stocks mopped the floor with the non dividend payers 9 5 annualized return vs 1 6 annualized return because income stocks are often profitable and time tested they re just the types of businesses we d expect to increase in value over time in other words it s not a matter of if dividend stocks can make you money it s determining which dividend stocks to buy if steady annual dividend income that can put inflation in its place is what you re after ultra high yield energy stocks could be your answer the following three passive income juggernauts average a 7 45 yield which means you can generate 7 500 in annual income by investing roughly 101 000 split equally enterprise products partners 6 9 yield the first energy powerhouse that can help investors rake in the cash while taming historically high inflation is oil and gas stock enterprise products partners epd 1 86 though its 6 9 yield is the low water mark on this list the company has raised its base annual payout in each of the past 23 years for some investors the idea of putting their money to work in oil stocks may not be appealing just 25 months ago the energy sector was in a state of shock as the covid 19 pandemic led to global lockdowns and a cratering in crude oil demand in fact west texas intermediate futures briefly hit negative 40 a barrel but epd i m referring to enterprise products partners ticker symbol here as an abbreviation for the company is an entirely different beast whereas drillers and explorers were pummeled by the historic demand drawdown epd was fine that s because it s an integrated midstream company in plainer terms it s an energy middleman it controls more than 50 000 miles of transmission pipeline has 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity operates 23 natural gas processing facilities and manages 19 deepwater docks handling natural gas liquids the beauty of the midstream operating model is very simple it s predictable utilizing volume based commitments from drillers epd is able to forecast its annual cash flow with incredible accuracy this is important as it allows the company to outlay capital for new infrastructure as well as make acquisitions epd currently has 10 major infrastructure projects under construction totaling 4 6 billion all but two of these projects will be fully operational within the next 20 months if you need even more convincing consider this at no point during the pandemic did enterprise products partners distribution coverage ratio fall below 1 6 the distribution coverage ratio describes the amount of distributable cash flow from operations relative to what was paid to shareholders a figure below 1 would imply an unsustainable payout with epd nowhere near this danger zone and oil and gas prices now soaring it s safe to say this supercharged payout is rock solid alliance resource partners 7 14 yield a second ultra high yield energy stock that can help income seekers generate 7 500 in annual payouts is coal producer alliance resource partners arlp 0 85 following its recent 40 quarterly dividend hike alliance resource partners is parsing out a 7 1 yield as recently as the fourth quarter of 2020 coal stocks were a dumpster fire and that s putting it nicely between july 2018 and august 2020 coal price per ton plummeted almost 60 weakened demand from covid 19 coupled with supply chain challenges and labor shortages proved to be a perfect storm for much of the industry at one point even alliance resource partners was forced to shelve its dividend due to economic uncertainty but that s all a distant memory historically high commodity inflation has sent the per ton coal price up 600 since august 2020 and that s after a modest pullback with management expecting high inflation and robust coal prices to persist throughout 2022 the company aims to increase its distribution by 10 to 15 per quarter for the remainder of the year if its share price were to stay the same income investors would be looking at a yield of around 10 or possibly higher what makes alliance resource partners tick is its forward thinking management team well over 90 of 2022 s estimated coal production is already spoken for via volume and price commitments further around 55 of next year s output if similar to 2022 is locked in during the first quarter the company booked commitments all the way out to 2025 similar to epd this is a way for alliance resource partners to maintain a transparent outlook for its operating cash flow in addition to its coal operations the company also has oil and gas royalty interests without getting too deep into the weeds the higher oil and natural gas prices head the likelier it is that alliance resource partners will recognize more adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda from this royalty segment during the first quarter the company s adjusted ebitda from its oil and gas segment rose 139 from the prior year period after years of underperformance things couldn t be any better for alliance resource partners antero midstream 8 31 yield the third ultra high yield energy stock that can bring in the green and crush inflation is midstream natural gas operator antero midstream am 1 80 among the three stocks listed here antero s 8 31 yield is the highest similar to epd antero midstream benefits from the predictability of the contracts it signs with parent company antero resources ar 2 65 the former provides gathering compressing processing and water delivery for the latter knowing well in advance how much operating cash flow the company can expect in a given year allows antero midstream to outlay capital for new infrastructure projects without compromising its profitability or distribution interestingly antero midstream slashed its quarterly distribution by 27 last year i say interestingly because the price for natural gas had improved significantly from the previous year and the company had no trouble covering its distribution however there s a very good reason for this reduction parent company antero resources plans to increase its drilling on antero midstream s acreage the latter purposefully reduced its dividend to shift additional capital to new infrastructure projects through the midpoint of the decade in announcing the move antero midstream estimated that it would generate 400 million in incremental free cash flow by 2025 the company is effectively trading a small amount of near term distributions to generate significantly more operating cash flow over the long run one reason to make this move is that it ll likely help push antero midstream s share price higher even though i m pounding the table on the yields for these passive income juggernauts their valuations can easily expand over time but the other impetus behind this move is to shore up the company s balance sheet antero midstream has reduced its net debt by over 1 6 billion since the end of 2019 and will likely end 2022 with a leverage ratio below 1 while you re not going to get the dividend hike potential with antero midstream that you have with epd and alliance resource partners this company still packs a punch for income investors

yet their stocks are getting slammed for it companies don t earn profits just by magic first they have to invest in products services and infrastructure to provide useful goods and or services for customers the more useful the product or service and the more difficult that product or service is to replicate the more a company and its shareholders stand to benefit today there are three household name tech giants investing billions of dollars in massive projects that could pay off hugely in the future however with the market concerned about interest rates and the economy these stocks are getting punished for that very spending today but for long term investors a beaten down stock with a big potential future revenue stream spells opportunity amazon is building a massive e commerce infrastructure amazon com amzn 1 35 sold off after its recent earnings report revenue was in line with guidance but operating income declined year over year as amazon s costs soared in its e commerce business before the pandemic hit amazon had been investing in its logistics infrastructure to provide free one day delivery down from its previous two delivery promise for prime customers that was a huge undertaking then when the pandemic hit amazon had to turbocharge its spending on infrastructure to satisfy all the demand for its regular two day service given rising labor and fuel costs amazon s costs and capital expenditures soared over the next two years amazon doubled the size of the fulfillment network that it had taken nearly 30 years to build prior to covid 19 on the q1 conference call with analysts amazon said it had gone from undercapacity during the pandemic to overcapacity today as e commerce demand corrected back to its prior course while that s pressuring margins in the near term it also means that amazon s logistics platform is ready to shine management said the company was only now just getting delivery speeds back to pre covid levels now that amazon has built out this massive logistics network it should have a huge advantage over rivals if you can get free shipping to your door in one day or even the same day you ll have even less of an impulse to visit a store especially if fuel prices stay this high that could lead to increased sales in the second half of the year moreover amazon just opened up buy with prime to online merchants off the amazon platform giving independent e commerce companies access to its fast free shipping payments infrastructure and free returns amazon s delivery network now rivals those of a fedex or ups and it can probably undercut their prices since it will be using spare capacity from shipping its own goods since revenue is decelerating in the first half of the year over difficult comparisons amazon s margins are down however profits should inflect upwards when revenue grows again since amazon won t be spending as much that could happen as soon as prime day in q3 or the holiday shopping season in q4 meta platforms what s in a name the market has also punished meta platforms meta 2 28 formerly known as facebook for a massive project into which it s plowing billions of dollars every quarter late last year facebook ceo mark zuckerberg announced the company would be changing its name to meta platforms while investing billions to build out the metaverse a catchall term for a new digital world that feels like reality in combination with the name change meta platforms began to break out results from the metaverse focused reality labs segment this exposure showed that reality labs is burning about 3 billion every quarter today investors really don t want to see companies spending billions of dollars on a futuristic vision with an uncertain payoff on the recent conference call zuckerberg said his is laying the groundwork for what i expect to be a very exciting 2030s when this is like when this is sort of more established as the primary computing platform at that point i think that there will be results along the way for that too but i do think that this is going to be a longer cycle meta platforms will be releasing a version of its horizon metaverse operating system this year and it will likely monetize more opportunities along the way last quarter sales of oculus headsets were 695 million up 30 over the past year meta is also likely to realize platform fees from sales of digital goods in its metaverse over the next few years the company s ambitions leave me torn while i think the metaverse may be an enormous opportunity of these three stocks meta platforms is the most likely to cause disappointment will the metaverse be widely adopted as the next major computing platform as zuckerberg says or will it just be a niche application for gamers and tech enthusiasts at this point it s hard to say intel is attempting the biggest comeback in semiconductor history meanwhile the market has really soured on intel intc 1 74 in recent years that s because intel used to make the best and fastest chips in the world but a few years ago taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corp tsmc passed it at the leading edge that gave intel s rivals a chance to leapfrog chipzilla to produce the most advanced power efficient chips on the market tsmc doesn t produce its own chips but rather acts as a third party manufacturer for most of the world s leading chip designers under new ceo pat gelsinger intel is now embarking on an ambitious quest not only does the company hope to catch up to tsmc on leading edge technology for its own chips but gelsinger also wants intel to become an outsourced foundry to other designers too rivaling tsmc given that more and more large tech companies are now designing their own custom chips for specific applications that makes a lot of sense can intel pull it off again it s uncertain what the payoff will be but as of last quarter it already had a 1 billion revenue run rate producing chips for third parties gelsinger also said on the recent earnings call that the company had engaged 10 qualified anchor clients to produce chips once it has built out its foundries intel is beginning construction on multibillion dollar fabrication plants in arizona and ohio and across europe and it jump started its foundry ambitions recently announcing the purchase of third party foundry tower semiconductor for 5 4 billion intel will be spending 27 billion in capital expenditures this year and will likely ramp those investments over the next few years as it builds out a large manufacturing ecosystem outside of asia where most of chip production occurs today the company will have to raise subsidies from governments to do so but it seems momentum for legislation will lead it to pass both in europe and the u s if i had to bet i would say intel pulls it off but this will be a very expensive undertaking and the payoff won t be for years still it appears gelsinger and new chief financial officer david zinsner are believers each bought around

management a division of money center bank jpmorgan chase issued a report comparing the performance of companies that initiated and grew their payouts to publicly traded companies that didn t pay a dividend over a 40 year stretch 1972 2012 the dividend stocks mopped the floor with the non dividend payers 9 5 annualized return vs 1 6 annualized return because income stocks are often profitable and time tested they re just the types of businesses we d expect to increase in value over time in other words it s not a matter of if dividend stocks can make you money it s determining which dividend stocks to buy if steady annual dividend income that can put inflation in its place is what you re after ultra high yield energy stocks could be your answer the following three passive income

feet of natural gas storage capacity operates 23 natural gas processing facilities and manages 19 deepwater docks handling natural gas liquids the beauty of the midstream operating model is very simple it s predictable utilizing volume based commitments from drillers epd is able to forecast its annual cash flow with incredible accuracy this is important as it allows the company to outlay capital for new infrastructure as well as make acquisitions epd currently has 10 major infrastructure projects under construction totaling 4 6 billion all but two of these projects will be fully operational within the next 20 months if you need even more convincing consider this at no point during the pandemic did enterprise products partners distribution coverage ratio fall below 1 6 the distribution coverage ratio describes the amount of distributable cash flow from operations relative to what was paid to shareholders a figure below 1 would imply an unsustainable payout with epd

weakened demand from covid 19 coupled with supply chain challenges and labor shortages proved to be a perfect storm for much of the industry at one point even alliance resource partners was forced to shelve its dividend due to economic uncertainty but that s all a distant memory historically high commodity inflation has sent the per ton coal price up 600 since august 2020 and that s after a modest pullback with management expecting high inflation and robust coal prices to persist throughout 2022 the company aims to increase its distribution by 10 to 15 per quarter for the remainder of the year if its share price were to stay the same income investors would be looking at a yield of around 10 or possibly higher what makes alliance resource partners tick is its forward thinking management team well over 90 of 2022 s estimated coal production is already spoken for via volume and price commitments further around 55 of next year s output if similar to 2022 is locked in during the first quarter the company booked commitments all the way out to 2025 similar to epd this is a way for alliance resource partners to maintain a transparent outlook for its operating cash flow in addition to its coal operations the company also has oil and gas royalty interests without getting too deep into the weeds the higher oil and natural gas prices head the likelier it is that alliance resource partners will recognize more adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda from this royalty segment during the first quarter the company s adjusted ebitda from its oil and gas segment rose 139 from the prior year period after years of underperformance things couldn t be any better for alliance resource partners antero midstream 8 31 yield the third ultra high yield energy stock that can bring in the green and crush inflation is midstream natural gas operator antero midstream am 1 80 among the three stocks listed here antero s 8 31 yield is the highest similar to epd antero midstream benefits from the predictability of the contracts it signs with parent company antero resources ar 2 65 the former provides gathering compressing processing and water delivery for the latter knowing well in advance how much operating cash flow the company can expect in a given year allows antero midstream to outlay capital for new infrastructure projects without compromising its profitability or distribution interestingly antero midstream slashed its quarterly distribution by 27 last year i say interestingly because the price for natural gas had improved significantly from the previous year and the company had no trouble covering its distribution however there s a very good reason for this reduction parent company antero resources plans to increase its drilling on antero midstream s acreage the latter purposefully reduced its dividend to shift additional capital to new infrastructure projects through the midpoint of the decade in announcing the move antero midstream estimated that it would generate 400 million in incremental free cash flow by 2025 the company is effectively trading a small amount of near term distributions to generate significantly more operating cash flow over the long run one reason to make this move is that it ll likely help push antero midstream s share price higher even though i m pounding the table on the yields for these passive income juggernauts their valuations can easily expand over time but the other impetus behind this move is to shore up the company s balance sheet antero midstream has reduced its net debt by over 1 6 billion since the end of 2019 and will likely end 2022 with a leverage ratio below 1 while you re not going to get the dividend hike potential with antero midstream that you have with epd and alliance resource partners this company still packs a punch for income investors

medical researchers say listening to music stimulates structural changes in areas of the brain responsible for verbal memory language skills and focused attention stock photo julie stillman was 55 years old when a blood vessel in her brain suddenly burst the hemorrhagic stroke left her unable to compose a simple sentence a hard blow for a woman who built a career in book publishing it also robbed her of the ability to speak properly but not the ability to sing now 69 stillman is one of several dozen stroke and brain injury survivors who lift their voices in joy as part of the aphasia choir of vermont there are a handful of such choirs springing up around the world giving stroke survivors and people living with dementia or other brain injuries a chance to tap into one of the few means of communication left to them to hear that clarity and volume it s like magic said stillman s husband jeff nagle whose last fluid conversation with his wife took place 14 years ago on the phone an hour before he found her on the floor of their home it s amazing to see this happen roughly one third of people who survive strokes have aphasia a speech disorder that makes it difficult to express or understand language resulting from damage done to the brain but scientists have long known that even when people with certain types of aphasia lose the ability to speak they often are able to sing a phenomenon attributed to the different regions of the brain responsible for producing music and language studies of this phenomenon and of how music affects the brain have led to the development of a variety of music supported therapies such as melodic intonation therapy which trains stroke survivors to communicate rhythmically to build stronger connections between brain regions other therapies focus on listening to music or teaching people to play musical instruments such as the keyboard or drums a growing body of research shows these types of therapies can play an important role in helping stroke survivors heal as early as 2008 researchers published work in the journal brain that showed just listening to music for an hour each day improved memory and attention as well as mood during the early stages of stroke recovery a follow up to that study in 2014 provided insights as to how and why listening to music stimulated structural changes in the areas of the brain responsible for verbal memory language skills and focused attention digging deeper investigators were able to show vocal music was superior to instrumental music or listening to audiobooks in stimulating the brain changes that led to memory and language recovery karen mcfeeters leary the speech language pathologist who founded vermont s aphasia choir knew stroke survivors could sing from her studies of speech pathology seniors in nursing home making music with rhythm instruments as musical therapy stock photo when we would evaluate people with stroke or speech impairment we always checked their ability to sing said leary who also is a singer and songwriter stillman and nagle were among the first to join when leary launched the choir in 2014 with just 11 singers who had had strokes and their spouses and caregivers since then the group has more than doubled in size she recruits through stroke support groups and the university of vermont which has a speech and language pathology program and an outpatient clinic much to her surprise the choir quickly turned into something much bigger than an opportunity for people to express themselves through song it helped establish a community for people who had become socially isolated because of their condition they lose friendships sometimes spouses leary said it s very lonely but through the choir they find others who understand what they re going through the shared experience that s the big thing she said i ve seen some very very depressed individuals absolutely find themselves again and blossom the choir has been a wonderful support group in a different way than what we had in speech therapy said nagle we ve made a lot of friends and through those friendships they ve expanded stillman s ability to resume some of her old hobbies such as a love of boating another choir member introduced them to an adaptive kayaking group in which stroke survivors and others with physical disabilities use special equipment that allows them to paddle with one arm they are now active participants in both groups enjoying a social life they never thought they d see again nagle also believes his wife s language abilities improve during choir season which lasts from march until june when it culminates with a free public concert researchers like pablo ripollés say it s possible the daily music engagement is making a difference as an assistant professor of psychology and associate director of new york university s music and audio research laboratory in new york city ripollés was one of a group of investigators who identified how listening to music changes brain structure in stroke survivors scientists know providing a rich environment can stimulate the brain and promote healing following a stroke ripollés said his research has focused on using music to provide that enrichment especially during the early stages of recovery when people are limited in what they can do there is one thing you can do for those patients even when they are in bed he said maybe they cannot move very well but you can provide an enriched environment by having them listen to music music therapy s benefits can vary and how much damage a stroke has caused to the brain affects how well it can recover we have good evidence that music therapy works in people who have not had catastrophic brain injuries ripollés said maybe a major one but not a catastrophic one more research is needed to see if music therapy can be more effective than traditional speech therapies he said but in the meantime stroke survivors can listen to their favorite music or join a choir if one is available in their area this is something you can do on your own and for free ripollés said it s not going to harm you and it might do you some good if you have questions or comments about
