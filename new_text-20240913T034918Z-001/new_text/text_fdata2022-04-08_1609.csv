washington ap as the federal reserve intensifies its efforts to tame high inflation its top officials are casting their aggressive drive in a new light as a blow against economic inequality that thinking marks a sharp reversal from the conventional view of the fed s use of interest rates normally the steep rate hikes the fed is planning for the coming months would be seen as a particular threat to disadvantaged and lower income households these groups are most likely to suffer if rate hikes weaken an economy cause unemployment to rise and sometimes trigger a recession instead some of the most dovish fed officials who typically favor low rates to nurture the job market are now going out of their way to point out ways in which inflation falls hardest on poorer americans curbing high inflation they argue is a fairness issue the burden of high prices is particularly great for households with more limited resources lael brainard an influential member of the fed s board of governors and a longtime interest rate dove said in a speech tuesday that is why getting inflation down is our most important task brainard noted that food and energy together account for one quarter of the price spikes that have driven inflation to 40 year highs poorer americans spend about one fourth of their incomes on groceries and transportation she said while wealthier households spend less than one tenth members of congress from both parties generally agree that the fed must tackle the surge in inflation by steadily raising rates which will make many consumer and business loans costlier indeed most economists have said the fed has waited too long to do so and now runs the risk of having to tighten credit too fast and derailing the economy last month the fed raised its key rate from near zero to a range of 0 25 to 0 5 still some democrats have expressed concern that higher rates will slow hiring significantly even while unemployment for black workers for example remains higher than that for whites we clearly have a long way to go when it comes to making sure everyone has a good quality job sen sherrod brown an ohio democrat said last month at a hearing on jerome powell s nomination for a second four year term as fed chair hiking up interest rates too early can depress job growth tim duy chief u s economist at sgh macro advisers and some other analysts say the fed is right to highlight the damage that inflation can do to americans ability to afford basic needs such as food gas and rent but they also suggest that some recent fed comments have exaggerated the notion that inflation worsens economic inequality nathan sheets global chief economist for citi and a former fed economist notes for instance that inflation reduces the burden of debt which can disproportionately benefit lower income americans wages typically rise to keep up with inflation but mortgages and other debts usually carry fixed interest rates making them easier to pay off brainard s speech this week was one of the starker examples of the fed s argument that inflation can exacerbate inequality brainard who has been nominated for the fed s no 2 role and is part of powell s inner circle said that lower income households defined as the poorest one fifth spend 77 of their income on necessities including food and housing by contrast the richest one fifth spend just 31 of their incomes on those categories likewise mary daly president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco and long a dovish voice on the fed s policymaking committee surprised fed watchers this week when she declared that inflation is as harmful as not having a job i understand that if you have a job but you can t pay your bills or i feel like i can t save for what i need to do then that s keeping you up at night daly said in remarks to the native american financial officers association brainard in her speech noted that poorer people often pay higher prices for the same item higher income households for example can afford to make bulk purchases or to stock up on an item when it s being sold at a discount thereby lowering their cost per item and when inflation rises brainard said households that buy name brand cereals can switch to cheaper store brands but poorer consumers that are already buying cheaper items can t make an equivalent price lowering switch powell himself began shifting his rhetoric in this direction last winter during testimony to congress duy said when the fed chair mentioned the harsh impact that inflation inflicts on disadvantaged americans powell hadn t raised that concern in previous testimony in september it was a notable change for the powell fed which has focused on inequality in the job market more than its predecessors in august 2020 the fed updated its policy framework to specify that its goal of maximum employment was broad and inclusive this meant the fed would consider unemployment rates for black and hispanic workers rather than just headline figures in setting its interest rate policies the central bank also said it would no longer raise rates in anticipation of higher inflation but would wait until higher prices actually materialized brainard had highlighted one reason for taking a more patient approach in a speech in february 2021 in those remarks she said that raising rates to pre empt inflation may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic challenges powell and other fed officials say their goal now is to reduce inflation by slowing but not stopping growth reducing high inflation is important to keep the economy expanding they say and ultimately to keep unemployment low for now sheets suggested the fed can raise rates without worrying too much about hurting the job market because its benchmark rate is so low fed officials don t think their key rate will start to restrain growth until it reaches about 2 4 the minutes from the fed s most recent meeting in march released wednesday showed that the officials want to expeditiously reach that level and economists expect them to do so by the end of this year at that point if inflation is still too high the fed might have to raise rates further to a point where layoffs occur and the risks of a recession rise that s when it will get sticky and challenging for the fed when those short run trade offs arise sheets said

company announcement copenhagen denmark april 8 2022 genmab a s nasdaq gmab announced today an award in the binding arbitration of two matters arising under its license agreement with janssen biotech inc janssen relating to daratumumab the arbitral tribunal issued an award on april 7 2022 deciding both issues in favor of janssen genmab has the right to seek review of the award which it must do within a limited period of time such review should conclude with the issuance of a final award prior to the end of 2022 genmab is currently considering its options the first issue concerned the question as to whether janssen s obligation to pay royalties on sales of licensed product extends in each applicable country until the expiration or invalidation of the last to expire relevant genmab owned patent or the last to expire relevant janssen owned patent covering the product as further defined and described in the license agreement as to that issue the tribunal determined by majority opinion that janssen s obligation to pay royalties to genmab on sales of licensed product in each applicable country extends through the expiration or invalidation of the last to expire relevant genmab owned patent covering the product or use thereof but not the relevant janssen owned patent the relevant genmab owned issued u s european and japanese patents will expire in the late 2020s and early 2030s the second issue concerned the question as to whether genmab is required to share in janssen s royalty payments to halozyme therapeutics inc for the halozyme enzyme technology used in the subcutaneous formulation of daratumumab marketed as darzalex faspro in the u s the royalties janssen pays to halozyme represent a mid single digit percentage rate of subcutaneous daratumumab sales janssen reduced its royalty payments to genmab by what it claims to be genmab s share of janssen s royalty payments to halozyme beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and has continued to do so through december 31 2021 as to that issue the tribunal ruled by majority opinion that janssen is permitted to continue reducing its royalty payments to genmab as an offset against a share of janssen s royalty payments made to halozyme therapeutics inc genmab had already assumed that janssen would continue to withhold what it claims to be genmab s share of janssen s royalty payments to halozyme as a reduction to estimated 2022 revenue in its guidance as of february 16 2022 and as such our 2022 financial guidance remains unchanged in accordance with the license agreement the arbitration was

fed casting its inflation fight as battle against inequality file lael brainard president joe biden s nominee to be vice chair of the federal reserve speaks during an event in the south court auditorium on the white house complex in washington on nov 22 2021 the senate banking committee approved brainard s nomination to serve as the fed s vice chair on wednesday march 16 2022 ap photo susan walsh file washington ap as the federal reserve intensifies its efforts to tame high inflation its top officials are casting their aggressive drive in a new light as a blow against economic inequality that thinking marks a sharp reversal from the conventional view of the fed s use of interest rates normally the steep rate hikes the fed is planning for the coming months would be seen as a particular threat to disadvantaged and lower income households these groups are most likely to suffer if rate hikes weaken an economy cause unemployment to rise and sometimes trigger a recession instead some of the most dovish fed officials who typically favor low rates to nurture the job market are now going out of their way to point out ways in which inflation falls hardest on poorer americans curbing high inflation they argue is a fairness issue the burden of high prices is particularly great for households with more limited resources lael brainard an influential member of the fed s board of governors and a longtime interest rate dove said in a speech tuesday that is why getting inflation down is our most important task brainard noted that food and energy together account for one quarter of the price spikes that have driven inflation to 40 year highs poorer americans spend about one fourth of their incomes on groceries and transportation she said while wealthier households spend less than one tenth members of congress from both parties generally agree that the fed must tackle the surge in inflation by steadily raising rates which will make many consumer and business loans costlier indeed most economists have said the fed has waited too long to do so and now runs the risk of having to tighten credit too fast and derailing the economy last month the fed raised its key rate from near zero to a range of 0 25 to 0 5 still some democrats have expressed concern that higher rates will slow hiring significantly even while unemployment for black workers for example remains higher than that for whites we clearly have a long way to go when it comes to making sure everyone has a good quality job sen sherrod brown an ohio democrat said last month at a hearing on jerome powell s nomination for a second four year term as fed chair hiking up interest rates too early can depress job growth tim duy chief u s economist at sgh macro advisers and some other analysts say the fed is right to highlight the damage that inflation can do to americans ability to afford basic needs such as food gas and rent but they also suggest that some recent fed comments have exaggerated the notion that inflation worsens economic inequality nathan sheets global chief economist for citi and a former fed economist notes for instance that inflation reduces the burden of debt which can disproportionately benefit lower income americans wages typically rise to keep up with inflation but mortgages and other debts usually carry fixed interest rates making them easier to pay off brainard s speech this week was one of the starker examples of the fed s argument that inflation can exacerbate inequality brainard who has been nominated for the fed s no 2 role and is part of powell s inner circle said that lower income households defined as the poorest one fifth spend 77 of their income on necessities including food and housing by contrast the richest one fifth spend just 31 of their incomes on those categories likewise mary daly president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco and long a dovish voice on the fed s policymaking committee surprised fed watchers this week when she declared that inflation is as harmful as not having a job i understand that if you have a job but you can t pay your bills or i feel like i can t save for what i need to do then that s keeping you up at night daly said in remarks to the native american financial officers association brainard in her speech noted that poorer people often pay higher prices for the same item higher income households for example can afford to make bulk purchases or to stock up on an item when it s being sold at a discount thereby lowering their cost per item and when inflation rises brainard said households that buy name brand cereals can switch to cheaper store brands but poorer consumers that are already buying cheaper items can t make an equivalent price lowering switch powell himself began shifting his rhetoric in this direction last winter during testimony to congress duy said when the fed chair mentioned the harsh impact that inflation inflicts on disadvantaged americans powell hadn t raised that concern in previous testimony in september it was a notable change for the powell fed which has focused on inequality in the job market more than its predecessors in august 2020 the fed updated its policy framework to specify that its goal of maximum employment was broad and inclusive this meant the fed would consider unemployment rates for black and hispanic workers rather than just headline figures in setting its interest rate policies the central bank also said it would no longer raise rates in anticipation of higher inflation but would wait until higher prices actually materialized brainard had highlighted one reason for taking a more patient approach in a speech in february 2021 in those remarks she said that raising rates to pre empt inflation may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic challenges powell and other fed officials say their goal now is to reduce inflation by slowing but not stopping growth reducing high inflation is important to keep the economy expanding they say and ultimately to keep unemployment low for now sheets suggested the fed can raise rates without worrying too much about hurting the job market because its benchmark rate is so low fed officials don t think their key rate will start to restrain growth until it reaches about 2 4 the minutes from the fed s most recent meeting in march released wednesday showed that the officials want to expeditiously reach that level and economists expect them to do so by the end of this year at that point if inflation is still too high the fed might have to raise rates further to a point where layoffs occur and the risks of a recession rise that s when it will get sticky and challenging for the fed when those short run trade offs arise

2021 contact an attorney to discuss your rights james maro esq 484 270 1453 or email at abbvie s alleged misconduct abbvie is one of the world s largest pharmaceutical companies the company s revenues will come under significant pressure in the coming years when its best selling drug humira will lose patent protection in 2023 accordingly abbvie s future revenue and earnings depend in large part on its ability to develop new sources of revenue to offset humira s lost sales rinvoq an anti inflammatory drug manufactured by abbvie and used to treat rheumatoid arthritis ra and other diseases by inhibiting janus kinase jak enzymes was touted as one such drug rinvoq was initially approved in the united states to treat only moderate to severe ra however abbvie was actively pursuing additional treatment indications and in 2020 asked the u s food and drug administration fda to approve rinvoq for the treatment of several other diseases as is relevant here rinvoq is similar to other jak inhibitor drugs including xeljanz manufactured by pfizer inc when the fda approved xeljanz in 2012 for the treatment of ra it required an additional safety trial to evaluate xeljanz s risk of triggering certain serious side effects beginning in february 2019 the fda repeatedly warned the public that the safety trial indicated that xeljanz s use could lead to serious heart related issue cancer and other adverse events notwithstanding the similarities between rinvoq and xeljanz during the class period defendants assured investors that rinvoq was far safer than xeljanz and not subject to the same regulatory risks however investors began to learn the truth about rinvoq s significant risks on june 25 2021 when abbvie revealed that the fda was delaying its review of expanded treatment applications for rinvoq due to the safety concerns associated with xeljanz on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 1 76 per share or approximately 1 5 from a close of 114 74 per share on june 24 2021 to close at 112 98 per share on june 25 2021 then on september 1 2021 the fda announced that final results from the xeljanz safety trial established an increased risk of serious adverse events even with low doses of xeljanz as a result the fda determined that it would require new and updated warnings for xeljanz and rinvoq because rinvoq share similar mechanisms of action with xeljanz and may have similar risks as seen in the xeljanz safety trial the fda also indicated that it would further limit approved indications for rinvoq as a result of these safety concerns on this news the price of abbvie common stock declined 8 51 per share or more than 7 from a close of 120 78 per share on august 31 2021 to close at 112 27 per share on september 1 2021 after the class period on december 3 2021 abbvie announced that the fda had updated rinvoq s label to require additional safety warnings and limit marketing of rinvoq to only its use after treatment with other drugs has failed on january 11 2022 defendants admitted that these changes to rinvoq s label would negatively impact sales forcing the company to reduce its long term guidance for rinvoq s sales in 2025 the complaint alleges that throughout the class period the defendants made materially false and or misleading statements about the company s business and operations specifically defendants misrepresented and or failed to disclose that 1 safety concerns about xeljanz extended to rinvoq and other jak inhibitors 2 as a result it was likely that the fda would require additional safety warnings for rinvoq and would delay the approval of additional treatment indications for rinvoq and 3 therefore defendants statements about the company s business operations and prospects lacked a reasonable basis as a result of the defendants wrongful acts and omissions and the significant decline in the market value of abbvie s securities abbvie investors have suffered significant damages what can i do abbvie

likely keep pace and as demand for mortgages rises so will mortgage interest rates the bond market because bonds are a lower risk type of investment demand for bonds can increase when investors are wary of other investment vehicles or fearful of the overall state of the economy increased demand for bonds causes their price to rise and their earnings called their yield to fall when bond yields fall consumer interest rates generally do as well including mortgage interest rates when investors feel more confident about the economy demand for bonds declines bond prices drop and yields rise and

jobless claims drop to lowest in 50 years washington the number of americans filing first time claims for unemployment benefits fell to 166 000 last week the best reading in more than 50 years and one that shows a labor market that has essentially recovered from the two year shock of the coronavirus pandemic however the government revised the way it estimates seasonality in the data which it cautioned may lead to one time larger revisions than usual still the reading will do nothing to dissuade the federal reserve from raising interest rates at a hasty pace throughout the year as it switches from prioritizing employment to fighting inflation that process is already underway with the central bank having raised interest rates by 25 basis points last month and with markets pricing in a 50 basis point hike next month and in june the fed is also expected to begin reducing the 9 trillion it has on its balance sheet at a monthly pace of 95 billion beginning in may both moves should have the effect of tightening the supply of money and making it more costly to borrow thereby slowing the economy as the fed reduces bond holdings the treasury will need private investors to buy more government bonds to roll over the federal debt and finance new borrowings comerica bank chief economist bill adams wrote on wednesday all things equal more bond supply tends to push bond prices lower and bond yields higher but while monetary policy will be pushing longer term interest rates up the business cycle will be pushing them down economic growth will slow as inflation eats into consumer spending power and businesses finish rebuilding inventories adams added oil prices will likely stabilize once the russia ukraine conflict cools as economic growth slows and commodity prices come back down wage growth and inflation should cool as well these factors are likely to mostly offset the fed reducing the size of its bond holdings limiting the rise of longer term interest rates source u s news story date april 8 2022

duluth for the first time in eight years drinkers who crack a can of one of bent paddle brewing s flagship beer brands will have a new view in hand the lincoln park brewery has redesigned the cans and boxes containing each of their five core beers venture pils 14 degree amber black ale cold press black and bent paddle s best selling beer bent hop ipa on thursday morning the new bent hop cans were being literally rolled out in their first run at bent paddle s production brewery at 1912 w michigan st to celebrate the occasion five bent paddle staffers donned outsize boxes reflecting the new branding among them were laura mullen and karen tonnis two of the brewery s four co founders bent paddle brewing co co founder laura mullen in the company s lincoln park brewery thursday steve kuchera duluth news tribune we just were thinking that it needs a refresh said mullen though she noted they loved the former art it was classic for our brand and that s why we kept many of the colors lucas kackman bent paddle s in house graphic designer created the new look the new cans reward sharp eyed customers who are familiar with duluth and the north shore though the art doesn t feature any human built local landmarks like bridges or lighthouses each beer variety will come clad in a can depicting an actual point on the lake superior shoreline we experimented with several artistic styles before landing on the clean and sophisticated appearance of the mid century postmodern landscape art style said kackman in a news release the solid color flowing shapes allow us to easily change locations for each individual brand while maintaining a grouped brand family appearance for all five styles each box on the bottom has the geo coordinates of a beach that kind of represents the beer explained mullen by way of example she cited the 14 degree amber design it depicts iona s beach known to tourists as the pink beach north of two harbors that beer was formerly known as 14 esb it s still the same beer but it s got a new name said mullen advertisement stacks of cans bearing the old design left for bent paddle s india pale ale sit next to cans with the new design thursday steve kuchera duluth news tribune there have been some other subtle naming tweaks the beer formerly known as bent hop golden ipa now has a can reading bent hop india pale ale that can s green on white artwork reflects the hills of duluth as seen from park point albeit scrubbed of buildings in kackman s stylized design the venture pils is brighton beach said mullen the black ale is black beach and the cold press black is the split rock area lifestyle dave hoops column how breweries got through pandemic and looking forward many of us in the brewing industry are so grateful for the massive support that came our way during the pandemic so many deaths and sickness is very heart wrenching some of the new designs have already arrived in liquor stores said mullen albeit only on boxes since the company is committed to using all of its existing packaging stock rather than discard it there will be some overlap between old and new we have all new boxes so those will be in liquor stores straight away she said but some of them might have old cans in them that ll just be for a couple of months bent paddle will showcase the new can designs which will also be reflected in redesigned tap handles later this year at the craft brewers conference in may the national conference will be convening in minnesota for the first time and bent paddle will be supplying the official commemorative beer distributed to all attendees at the minneapolis convention center bent paddle employee isaiah jorgensen reaches for a six pack of ipa bearing the company s new design thursday steve kuchera duluth news tribune we pitched it because of the water of lake superior said mullen many of these brewers have never had beer with it it s a dark czech lager called land of 10 000 lagers and because we brewed it it will be available in the taproom starting in may later in may bent paddle will hold their first festiversary celebration since 2019 after a pause due to the covid 19 pandemic tonnis said she and her colleagues have been excited to watch the progress of the lincoln park neighborhood where they opened in 2013 we took a leap of faith when we moved into this building said tonnis and we just had dreams of the main street emerging into a lovely downtown a second place for tourists and locals to hang out in addition to downtown or canal park it has been amazing to watch it blossom liz olson the neighborhood s state representative is one of the sponsors of a bill advancing through the legislature that would revise the state s liquor laws to among other things lift the growler cap currently forcing breweries to stop selling growlers from their taprooms when their production reaches 20 000 barrels before the pandemic we were hitting about 17 000 barrels said mullen now we re closer to 15 000 just through the pandemic so we were kind of on that trajectory to hit 20 000 at some point in the next few years and we would love to not have to stop selling growlers and crowlers to the public from our taproom
vancouver bc thenewswire april 7 2022 global energy metals corporation tsxv gemc otc gblef fse 5ge1 global energy metals the company and or gemc a company involved in investment exposure to the battery metals supply chain is pleased to announce that the company intersected nickel copper and cobalt mineralization during its phase one drilling at the at the lovelock cobalt nickel copper project lovelock and or the project located in the prolific iron oxide copper gold iocg belt of the stillwater range in nevada usa commenting on the drill program timothy strong project devlelopment manager said our understanding of the copper cobalt and nickel mineralization in the extensive iocg system at lovelock continues to improve as a result of the 2021 drilling program three of the target areas tested on this limited initial drill campaign have yielded intersected mineralization of the key battery metals targeted which will require follow up testing including excellent results from the areas adjacent to and under the historical mine in addition there are still multiple areas yet to be tested and through the newly entered partnership with goldspot discoveries gemc is underway on working on prioritizing new targets for a second phase drill program gemc is pleased with the preliminary widely spaced drill holes it was able to complete prior to the end of the year having intersected mineralization at select targets and gaining valuable technical information for future programs importantly elevated values of cobalt nickel and copper were intercepted in three of the holes which targeted possible mineralization beneath the historical mine workings surface sampling mapping and geophysical surveying identified a number of potential mineralized areas on the property this limited drilling program was planned to test several of these anomalies including those around the vicinity of the former producing lovelock mine electrical chargeability anomalies were identified from the initial induced polarization survey conducted in 2017 eight reverse circulation drill holes were designed to penetrate prospective anomalous zones seven of the originally planned drill holes were completed before the end of the year details for each hole are included in table 1 click image to view full size figure 1 topographic base map showing 2021 rc drill hole locations lovelock mine workings and interpreted faults lovelock prospect churchill county nevada the company is also pleased to provide a first set of sample analyses that have been received from the project laboratory american assay laboratories of sparks nevada all of the drill holes intersected humboldt mafic complex hmc formations altered diorite and gabbro greenstone volcanics boyer ranch formation quartzite and a few aplite dikes were encountered in the drilling and described in detail in the drill hole logs strong propylitic alteration of hmc units and silicification of the boyer rocks were evident in all of the drill holes according to these results three of the seven holes intersected mineralized rock most notable were holes lco212 lco214 and lco215 drilled at the lovelock mine zone the area directly correlated with old workings that supported underground mining of high grade cobalt nickel and copper these holes intersected wide zones of mineralization with cobalt nickel and copper in what has become a high priority area for further exploration laboratory analysis of drill cutting samples returned anomalous concentrations of cu co ni as and sb across intervals in three of the seven holes completed anomalous ag and hg concentrations are also present in the samples analyzed intervals containing anomalous concentrations of copper cobalt nickel and associated elements are summarized in table 2 click image to view full size table 2 lovelock project 2021 drill hole sample highlights analytical results clearly show mineralization in the interval from 44 21 to 60 meters hole depth 145 to 195 feet in lco215 mineralization in lco212 and lco214 is more subtly evident in the results in lco214 the 9 15 meter 30 feet interval from 41 16 to 50 77 meters 135 to 165 feet returned significantly higher concentrations of metals than the intervals above and below likewise the 10 67 meter 35 feet interval from 19 83 to 30 77 meters 65 to 100 feet in lco212 in lco212 the drill intersected a void at a hole depth of from 10 67 to 15 24 meters 35 to 50 feet the bottom elevation of this void corresponds to the elevation of the deepest workings of the historical nearby lovelock mine the void may represent an exploratory drift by the former operators to the west side of the main fault looking for an extension of mineralization that was being extracted from the mine the highlighted lco212 interval is immediately below the void encountered during drilling and may be suggestive of mineralization nearby in all three highlighted drill hole intercepts mineralization occurs above each drill hole intersection with the main fault likely the primary target identified by the ip survey the analytical results from drilling suggest the presence of primary cu co ni sulfides arsenides and antimonides described in the literature as having been present in the original material from which cobalt was produced historically the secondary oxidation products of this primary mineralization may also be present in the samples these oxides are present on the waste dumps at lovelock mine elevated concentrations of copper cobalt nickel arsenic and antimony in the samples indicates the presence of mineralization similar to that describe in the literature and observed on the waste dumps of the lovelock mine all drill holes provided valuable information in what until now has been a drill deficient area this new data will now be factored into our conceptual model of the distribution of mineralization and the controls on the types of mineralization on the property lovelock mine project the lovelock mine project is prospective for copper cobalt and nickel in an exhalative deposit associated with intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks of the jurassic age humboldt mafic complex the rocks around the lovelock mine consist of altered diorite gabbro and associated altered andesite basalt and metasedimentary rocks of the boyer ranch formation the boyer consists of quartzite composed almost entirely of aeolian quartz arenite the boyer is interfingered with the humboldt volcanics the majority of the first pass drilling program at the end of last year was focused on confirming intersections of cobalt nickel copper bearing vein that correlates with historical underground mining and mapped superficial cobalt nickel copper occurrences the drill program was directed at several target areas within the property the lovelock mine zone and targets generated through surface sampling mapping and a high power induced polarisation ip ground geophysical survey which were subsequently prioritized by a follow up surface geochemical program and airborne magnetic survey several of these anomalies were targeted for the initial drilling program

well of course he s an active investor elon musk doesn t take a 9 2 percent interest in a company like twitter simply for passive income i ve met musk many times and let me tell you he makes the perpetually whirling dervish who was steve jobs look like a slacker at any one time musk is busy on space rockets new autonomous car technology brain implants challenging the russian autocrat vladimir putin to a wrestling match or calling elizabeth warren senator karen so he was never going to sit on the sidelines of the fight over twitter he s been hinting at it for weeks while quietly snapping up shares of the social media site possibly in violation of securities law so it should come as no surprise that musk was compelled to change his designation from passive investor on monday to an active one days later bloomberg s excellent matt levine had a ball explaining it all in a column this week calling it a fun surprise part of the fun was that a 13g is a form that is used by passive investors who do not plan to meddle with the company s management and that doesn t sound like elon musk activist investors are supposed to use the more detailed schedule 13d but musk checked the passive investor box fun choice not so fun presumably for those who sold before musk disclosed his big buy of his preferred social network his delayed disclosure finally injected some life into twitter s inert stock which has failed to keep pace with peers skyrocketing share prices whether accidental clever sleight of hand unfettered greed mongering or an egregious violation depending on how you feel about musk the suspect disclosure is right on brand when it comes his dismissive relationship with the securities and exchange commission it has yet to take any action of substance when it comes to musk except a very serious face scolding about his tweets and i suppose we shouldn t expect the s e c to step in here either with any force at this point it s as much their fault as musk s
amman car prices are witnessing a notable rise accompanied by a shortage in supply according to jihad abu nasser representative of the automobile sector at the jordan free zone investor commission the prices of hybrid cars have witnessed a 20 per cent increase of roughly jd2 000 to 3 000 part of this is due to the 10 per cent increase on hybrid car customs which raised their prices jd1000 to 1500 he told the jordan times the repercussions of the covid 19 pandemic increasing production costs and the closure of ports as well as the disruption of supply chains have doubled freight rates thereby increasing hybrid car prices an additional jd1000 to 1500 he added abu nasser also noted that car prices overall have been undergoing a yearly increase caused by the pandemic traditionally car prices drop because newer models are introduced to the market nowadays the opposite of that is happening due to the slowed production and inventory shortage he said the issue of silicon chips shortage which has taken a hard hit on the auto manufacturing industry during the covid 19 pandemic is a main factor disrupting production according to abu nasser he noted that these chips are essential in manufacturing all types of electronic devices including cars in the first half of 2020 when the overall consumer demand for cars declined during lockdowns the focus shifted to producing other items such as laptops and smartphones as the demand for these items increased with most people working and studying remotely said abu nasser many automakers cut orders for these chips when the pandemic hit because their production was on pause but when auto demand rebounded after the lockdowns were lifted they were faced by a shortage in silicon chips he added abu nasser also noted that over the past year the prices of all cars have increased no less than 10 per cent he added that the prices of american cars in particular have witnessed a 50 per cent increase and european cars a 20 per cent increase jordan imports cars from the us europe gulf countries including kuwait the uae saudi arabia and qatar and from the east asian market mainly south korea and china according to abu nasser who noted that most of these auto markets are currently near a standstill however he said that imports from china to jordan have increased notably in the past two years as 25 per cent of cars imported in 2022 were mainly electric cars from china while in 2020 only 1 per cent of cars were imported from china in previous years the demand for electric cars was low due to the scarcity of charging stations in the kingdom however the batteries of the latest electric cars counter this issue as they can last up to 300 to 500 kilometres said abu nasser he added that their customs are stable at 10 per cent whereas the customs duty for hybrid cars now stands at 55 per cent reaching its cap the clearance of cars in general dropped by 30 per cent compared to 2021 added abu nasser pointing out that during the first three months of 2022 roughly 3 000 cars were cleared a month whereas at the same time last year around 5 000 cars were cleared each month currently the stock of hybrid cars in the zarqa free zone is only 10 000 while it usually reaches around 30 000 to 40 000 cars according to abu nasser however stagnation during winter is somewhat normal he said predicting a gradual increase in cars imports and clearance numbers in the upcoming months during summer when demand is usually at its best

why do mortgage rates fluctuate here are some of the most common reasons why mortgage rates move frequently employment patterns the employment rate is an indicator of demand for mortgages when more people are unemployed fewer people will be looking to get a mortgage and buy a home and that lower demand will push interest rates down when the employment rate improves demand for mortgages will likely keep pace and as demand for mortgages rises so will mortgage interest rates the bond market because bonds are a lower risk type of investment demand for bonds can increase when investors are wary of other investment vehicles or fearful of the overall state of the economy increased demand for bonds causes their price to rise and their earnings called their yield to fall when bond yields fall consumer interest rates generally do as well including mortgage interest rates when investors feel more confident about the economy demand for bonds declines bond prices drop and yields rise and interest rates tend to follow federal reserve system the fed as it s commonly called is the united states central bank but it doesn t actually set mortgage rates rather multiple things the fed does

with money from china going into legitimate local businesses and government coffers via taxes have we in fact ended up with the best of both worlds chinese money without chinese influence don t count on it for starters beijing is only in the early stages of its campaign of economic coercion on current geopolitical settings they will be meting out the punishment to australia for years to come more to the point the money from mining is just one way in which whether we like it or not china has come to influence every aspect of political life the economy national security the environment and on and on in an era of great power competition the entire system has become khaki coloured over the last year far reaching announcements on national security and defence have been landing almost weekly and incredibly mostly pass with little immediate controversy nuclear powered submarines homemade ballistic missiles government backed takeovers of pacific telcos and undersea internet cables the public underwriting of critical minerals projects advertisement all these expensive initiatives which will need decades of work and multiple governments to bed down are driven by the rise of china and its push for regional dominance at the expense of the existing us led order any one of them either because of the public subsidies they entail or the pronounced tilt they require to washington could once have blown up politics and taken years to resolve these days largely because both sides of politics have internalised the logic of the contest with beijing momentous decisions announced to splashy headlines are absorbed rapidly into the bureaucracy some such as the nuclear subs deal will require little appreciated near wartime levels of commitment and funding both to develop and then maintain a massive step up in industrial skills and knowhow it is no wonder that scott morrison has so far struggled to muster the intensity needed to turn his coming showdown with anthony albanese into a khaki election in an era of great power competition the entire system has become khaki coloured these projects underscore the fact that australia is not in a short sharp conflict with china but along with allies is plunging into a complex decades long competition advertisement that brings us to the more salient point about the coming election neither party wants to talk about deficits and budget repair for good reason because both the coalition and labor are making a long term commitment to a much larger state on top of defence and intelligence the purview of national security has been extended to areas where it once played little role in universities science supply chains and research without anyone acknowledging it it may eventually encroach on the composition of the immigration program all this means not just a larger state but a more intrusive secret and meddlesome one as well which of itself is also a by product of chinese influence for decades western democracies led by the us embraced trade and engagement with china on the assumption that beijing would become more liberal in fact the opposite has happened china hasn t become more like us we have become more like china australia will have to fund its growing national security commitments alongside similarly large outlays in social spending on health which has a higher floor because of the pandemic aged care and the national disability insurance scheme australian politics may end up like the us where budget negotiations are perennially hamstrung by the trade off between republicans who resist cuts to the pentagon and democrats who protect social outlays advertisement the result is that in recent decades in the us the share of taxes has remained relatively stable while spending keeps going up resulting in higher deficits the us dollar has stayed strong throughout as its global reserve status shields it from the kinds of judgements that financial markets inflect on smaller countries australia does not enjoy such luxuries australia needs not just a large state but ironically like china itself a strong one as well perhaps that a message that our political leaders should start selling to the public soon they can either pretend that a new era of geopolitics won t require a bigger government and a whole host of reforms that will be needed to ensure it can be funded or they can embrace deficits as far as the eye can see and wait for any adjustment to be forced on us
pervomaisk ukraine the grain ukraine produces is found everywhere much of the bread in the middle east is made from it much of what aid organizations distribute to stave off famine in yemen is made from it much of what feeds chinese livestock that in turn feeds people worldwide is made from it even with a calamitous war about to enter its seventh week ukraine is on track to harvest most of its vast grain fields this summer though there are mounting concerns that war related supply shortages may reduce output by as much as a third the country has 30 million tons of wheat in storage too last year was a record wheat producing year for the whole country said dmytro grushetskyi an industrial farmer with nearly 30 000 acres of cropland near the central city of uman who also runs an agricultural data company that monitors harvests in ukraine russia and neighboring countries ukraine is actually full of grain our stocks are full but now we can t get the grain out he said putting his finger on the problem that may lead to an enormous spike in grain prices and exacerbate hunger around the world which means ukrainian farmers and the rest of the world are screwed all of ukraine s black sea ports are closed off to the world by a russian blockade that includes floating mines a battleship the ukrainian navy scuttled to avoid capture is blocking access to grain stores at the country s biggest port in odessa and after 20 years of investment in farm to port infrastructure wheat exported by train is just a tiny fraction of what is exported by sea advertisement without export income ukraine s giant industrial agriculture economy is grinding to a halt threatening bankruptcy for farmers and increasing the likelihood that the global grain market and other food supplies that depend on it will see increasingly worse scarcity even in the unlikely event that the conflict ends soon david beasley executive director of the u n world food program wfp told the u n security council that food prices are already skyrocketing a third of the world population relies on wheat as a dietary staple anger over rising food prices has always been a major underlying cause of civil unrest the world over the war s knock on effects on energy and fertilizer supplies are already rippling through agricultural supply chains raising prices of basic goods for nearly everyone on the planet advertisement countries such as egypt the biggest importer of ukrainian wheat last year as well as lebanon pakistan and others get most of their wheat from ukraine the country produces about a fifth of the world s high grade wheat and 7 percent of all wheat the wfp buys half of its grain from ukraine grushetskyi has more than 2 million worth of wheat trapped in storage and like other farmers across the country he worried that without being able to sell any of it he won t be able to pay workers buy seed fuel and fertilizer maintain equipment or pay outstanding bills putting the future of his company in peril a trader he works with at the odessa port oleksandr chumak laid out the industry s despondency in plain terms there is nothing else to do but give the grain away to the army or as humanitarian aid ukraine thankfully will not starve he said but if we are talking about global food security well that is already a fragile system climate change supply chain chaos and now this war in six months time poor people will starve to death i don t think the world understands that yet for their own sakes movement of food through the black sea must be negotiated advertisement for ukrainian farmers however there are more immediate problems share this article share it took just two hours on the first morning of russia s invasion of ukraine for its forces to occupy the 55 square miles of volodymyr khvostov s industrial scale farms which raise wheat rapeseed sunflowers and dairy animals in the country s highest yielding region between the crimean peninsula and the

department of agriculture júlia ledur the washington post key canals that irrigate millions of acres have been damaged in fighting the diesel that fuels tractors and other equipment is increasingly unavailable across the country either because it was once obtained from russia or because russia has bombed local fuel storage sites key moments in the agricultural calendar fertilizing tilling and soon planting are passing while farmers struggle to source essential supplies and while others have left to go fight farm employees are exempt from conscription but many have joined out of a sense of duty we are still planning to harvest even if it will be difficult khvostov said but if we don t defeat the russians by then it won t matter to the rest of the world agricultural officials in ukraine expressed worry that while their country s army seems to be holding russia s army back from achieving its most ambitious goals russia might win in a long war against ukraine by crippling its agricultural economy a collapse of industrial farming would be disastrous for ukraine in just about every way imaginable and because russia is also one of the world s biggest grain producers it stands to gain exactly where ukraine loses advertisement it s a secret weapon in the war said andrii dykun chairman of the ukrainian agri council make ukraine go bankrupt make the world buy from russia of course the world will buy from them rather than starve russia has already slashed its wheat prices to make its product more attractive on the global market though it has also threatened to limit agricultural exports to countries it considers hostile to its invasion of ukraine russian food exports have not yet come under western sanctions and some of the united states largest agribusinesses including cargill continue to operate in russia american and german companies are still operating in russia so while the u s sanctions russia they are financing them at the same time dykun said the west will make us die slowly this way advertisement because agriculture is so integral to ukraine s economy farmers have been lionized by their fellow citizens their role seen almost as essential as soldiers and many farmers have seen it as their duty to harvest as much grain as possible not just for their country s sake but for the world s it s a half joke but maybe the west should give us armored tractors said bogdan lukiyanchuk a farmer agronomist and host of growex a youtube channel for ukrainian farmers at a gathering at his home on the outskirts of pervomaisk north of the city of mykolaiv which has come under intense russian shelling in recent weeks lukiyanchuk posed for a photo with an automatic rifle i sleep with one i take another out into the fields with me just in case he

elon musk appears to have violated a 50 year old law when he purchased 9 2 of twitter s stock to become the largest shareholder in the company according to a report by the washington post musk was legally required to notify the securities and exchange commission when he surpassed a five percent stake in the company which he did on march 14 but instead he filed the required forms on monday april 4 david kass a finance professor at university of maryland s business school told the post that musk s late filing netted him an additional 156 million when he purchased the stock it was trading at around 39 a share when his purchase was made public twitter shares jumped to more than 50 a share he may have also misled the sec on the required disclosure forms by claiming that he would be a passive investor which meant he had no plans to make changes or try to influence the company on tuesday it was announced that musk would be joining twitter s board of directors he also tweeted that he planned to make significant improvements to twitter in coming months after he was appointed to the board musk filed a different form indicating his role was changing from a passive investor to an active investor even if the sec determines that musk violated the law he would only be subject to a relatively small six figure fine the sec could try to go after the 156 million he earned due to the late filing but legal experts believe that is a longshot the sec would have to be really angry with him to try that because they would have a good chance of a court rejecting that argument adam pritchard a professor of securities law at university of michigan s law school said

vietnam electric car leader guan xuan applied for ipo north american factory to be built at the same time vietnamese electric car maker vinfast announced on its website on thursday that it had filed an application form for registration with the securities and exchange commission sec the company has not yet determined the size of the stock offering depending on the market and other conditions and ipo is expected to take place after sec completes the review process the announcement said vinfast the electric car business of vingroup group vietnam s richest man is vietnam s largest carmaker vinfast said in a december statement that the company has been working with consultants to prepare for a u s listing in the second half of 2022 it is reported that vinfast s ipo is likely to raise about 2 billion which will be the largest ipo in the history of a vietnamese company if successful the carmaker will also become one of the few vietnamese companies to list in the united states the largest listing in vietnam is vinhomes jsc s ipo case in 2018 when vietnam s largest commercial property developer raised 1 4 billion in the domestic market it is worth mentioning that vinhomes jsc is also a subsidiary of vingroup there are also reports that vinfast is exploring a round of financing to raise 500m to 1 billion ahead of its us listing north american factories will also be built at the same time the listing comes as vinfast plans to open an electric car factory in north carolina which is expected to be operational in 2024 on march 29th us president joe biden tweeted and the white house issued a message to celebrate the establishment of vinfast in the united states vinfast will invest 4 billion in the north american plant to create more than 7000 jobs the statement said while biden boasted that it was the latest case in which economic strategy works vinfast aims to start delivering cars in the united states canada france germany and the netherlands by the end of 2022 and its vf8 and vf9 electric suv will cost between 41000 and 61000 the vf e34 the first domestic all electric car produced by vinfast began to be delivered to customers in december the all electric suv model is priced at 690 million vietnamese dong about 194000 yuan and has a maximum range of about 300km earlier this month peter kremsky chairman of the economic committee of the slovak parliament suggested that vinfast could consider slovakia as its next investment location
finance gets a mixed report card in this week s report from the intergovernmental panel on climate change on how far the world has got in mitigating climate change well mostly bad finance flows for the investments needed this decade to keep global warming to 1 5 c are still only a third to a sixth of what they need to be meanwhile more public and private money is still going to fossil fuels than to climate change adaptation and mitigation the covid pandemic and russia s invasion of ukraine have opened a new energy world order said francisco blanch bank of america s head of global commodities research this week greens agree with him but not on what it consists of bofa foresees europe s pivot away from russian gas sparking a wave of investment in us shale and liquefied natural gas infrastructure there are signs it has already begun for all his climate consciousness president joe biden desperate to bring down energy costs is unlikely to stand in the way this runs directly counter to the recommendations from the international energy agency and the ipcc that no more investment in fossil fuel infrastructure is needed even to hit 2 c global emissions have to peak by 2025 and fundamentally that means oil gas and coal consumption must fall what are capital markets doing about it the bond market is busying itself with a wave of sustainability linked bond issuance the hopes of enel when it introduced the product in 2019 that sustainable issuers would obtain large interest savings with the instrument have faded one bank estimates investment grade companies issuing slbs saved 2bp last year in euros and 1bp in sterling abn amro puts it at about 3bp in euros but says greeniums are inconsistent but this has not put off issuers at all enel pernod ricard sanofi and čez are just some of the companies that have issued them in the past 10 days several of them for the first time these deals are not increasing the flow of finance to climate mitigation closing the huge investment gap the ipcc shines a light on commercially viable projects in the developed world can get financed with or without fancy bonds the gaps are for investments that are not commercially attractive including because of regulatory barriers and harmful subsidies or in capital poor regions but slbs can address the climate crisis in a different way they are driven by communication issuers wanting to inform investors including shareholders about their sustainability plans and show that they mean business this communication has to become two way the precise pricing of slbs will not ultimately drive change what could is making sure the targets issuers adopt are stringent enough global emissions must halve by 2030 companies not on track for that are part of the problem some will need to go still faster the prospect of issuing an slb does not for most companies determine how it sets its sustainability targets they grow out of much more fundamental industrial and investor relations considerations but slb issues are an important forum for talking about the targets and getting feedback on them investors that refuse to buy an unambitious bond will hardly be noticed in the maelstrom of a deal but if they tell the issuer so they will get attention and investors that comment publicly will be remembered across the market the most important thing bond investors can do to help with climate change is demand fast and meaningful transition from issuers this should apply to all borrowers of any kind slb issuers which have raised the topic themselves are a good place to start

sandy areas had much more clarity so he fished a bit there it was a slow pick but he managed a couple hits one was a 25 inch bass that took his slow sinking sebile magic swimmer tim got out the following night in a similar region he fished the top of the flood and picked a bunch of bass to 20 inches on rubber shads and 1oz white green bucktails later in the tide he found some slightly larger

is looking for deck hands to work this summer if you re looking to make the big bucks give him a call at 631 830 3881 must be personable and able to tie good knots long island fishing forecast i launched my boat this week for the first time this year the banks have begun to lose their luster as i ve been skunking regularly at so many fresh waterbodies all it takes is a warm day or two to bring those fish into the shallows setting the bank bites aflame however that weather comes quite scarcely this time of year the warmest days are typically stifled by cloud cover and rain keeping the nearshore water with their muddy bottoms a bit too chilly for the fishes liking the boat opens up a whole new world of possibility all the juiciest structures you can hit are rarely accessible from the bank some of the waters i hit have no access besides a boat launch so you really can t fish that water effectively unless you launch a vessel mine s a ghetto rowboat salvaged from the jones beach lifeguard corps back in the 1970 s it gets the job done yellow perch were chewing heavily all week on all the waters i hit they seem to be targeting anything buggy or wormy specifically i bet a ned rig would crush it i ve been using small ⅛ ounce jigs with squirmy wormy strands tied onto the end and wooly buggers when i m throwing the fly rod olive wooly buggers have been getting hammered in particular i managed a bunch of bass on olive too fish were taking it every single cast when i found them stacked up in certain holes switch it up to a larger wormy soft plastic offering if you want to leave behind the panfish and focus on the larger species chris albronda gave me the heads up on that he guided cristina dacosta earlier this week to her personal best largemouth bass the fish took a dark colored senko off the bottom i started throwing black senkos when i caught my fill of large yellow perch the other day i got fewer hits but everytime that thing splashed in a new area of water it would get inhaled before it even got to the bottom the fish were absolutely ravenous for it i ve been taking the gopro along and will continue to do so i ll release videos for two recent sessions i filmed on the boat check em out on my youtube south fork salt amendment 7 comments are due by next friday april 15 check out the american saltwater guides association for any info details guidance you might need in order to submit a useful comment here is a link to their public comment guide striped bass amendment 7 public comment guide make sure to check that out this week if you haven t already done so it is absolutely imperative that you send in a comment to protect the striped bass the future of the fishery depends on these comments we submit so get it done please don t sleep on it don t sleep on the fish either every passing day brings greater promise for a freshwater hog be it a bass a perch a carp catfish or pickerel work the flood for tidal creek stripers especially when big swells push a lot of water into the back this creates stronger moving tides currents stripers love that right now we have a heavy east swell that is flooding the ocean beaches this is a perfect opportunity for baybound fish to feed and for antsy anglers to get out and bend the rod whatever you re up to do it safely and respectfully expect some reports of big fish for next week i m gonna go ahead and try to manifest something here i m going to catch a big bass this week if you get any trophies hit me up and i ll feature them here thanks and tight lines
executive summary the department of labor dol recently issued a release that warns about cryptocurrency use in 401 k plans the release raises a number of concerns including troubling implications for fiduciary duties with respect to brokerage windows and whether it is appropriate for dol to target specific asset classes the risks and rewards of cryptocurrency and its role in investment portfolios are currently being hotly debated in many arenas that debate has now come to the forefront with respect to cryptocurrency as an investment option in 401 k plans on 9 march 2022 president biden issued an executive order on ensuring responsible development of digital assets the executive order 1 the executive order sets out policy objectives to 1 protect consumers investors and businesses in the united states 2 protect the united states and global financial stability and mitigate systemic risk 3 mitigate the illicit financial and national security risks posed by misuse of digital assets 4 reinforce united states leadership in the global financial system 5 promote access to safe and affordable financial services and 6 support technological advances that promote responsible development and use of digital assets one day after president biden issued the executive order dol issued compliance assistance release no 2022 01 on 401 k plan investments in cryptocurrencies the release 2 in the release dol takes the unusual step of signaling its disfavor with a particular asset class cryptocurrency as a plan investment normally dol stays neutral with respect to particular asset classes as a whole 3 with the understanding that a fiduciary has a duty to evaluate investment options prudently depending on the particular facts and circumstances while the executive order s policy objectives seek to balance consumer protection and risk mitigation with ensuring the benefits of financial innovation are enjoyed equitably by all americans the release takes a much more one sided approach the release goes through a number of risks and challenges that cryptocurrency may pose to retirement account participants such as its speculative and volatile nature complexity valuation difficulties custodial and recordkeeping concerns and evolving regulatory environment these risks are not necessarily unique to this asset class the release fails however to balance the discussion of risks with an acknowledgment that a fiduciary may also consider possible benefits to a retirement investor of a portfolio that has a small allocation to cryptocurrency the release mainly cautions fiduciaries about offering cryptocurrency as an investment option in a 401 k plan s investment menu however dol also cautions fiduciaries responsible for allowing investments in cryptocurrency through brokerage windows4 that they should expect to be questioned about how they can square their actions with their duties of prudence and loyalty the reference to brokerage windows raises additional concerns a plan fiduciary has duties to prudently select and monitor a brokerage window provider in the same way it is required to prudently select and monitor any plan service provider however while a plan fiduciary has duties to prudently select investment options known as designated investment options that form the main menu of investments available through the plan investments through a brokerage window are not considered designated investment options 5 and a plan fiduciary typically has only limited duties with respect to such investments plan fiduciaries considering cryptocurrency in 401 k plans should proceed with care and consistent with evaluating any asset class plan fiduciaries should ensure they use a prudent process in their decision making including identifying the relevant information to consider including the risks and challenges described in the release considering the relevant information consulting experts when necessary and documenting their process dol s targeting of a specific asset class as it does in the release raises a number of concerns erisa sets the legal standard for a fiduciary to determine whether any particular investment is appropriate for a specific plan in addition the implications of the release with respect to brokerage windows are troubling it is untenable and contrary to existing guidance for plan fiduciaries to be held responsible for investments made through brokerage windows we expect industry pushback on the release 1 executive order on ensuring responsible development of digital assets although erisa and retirement plans are not explicitly mentioned in the executive order the secretary of labor is included among the other agency secretaries with respect to the need for interagency coordination in implementing the executive order the executive order provides that within 180 days of the executive order the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the secretary of labor and the heads of other relevant agencies shall submit a report to the president on the implications of developments and adoption of digital assets and changes in financial market and payment system infrastructures for united states consumers investors businesses and for equitable economic growth 2 compliance assistance release no 2022 01 401 k plan investments in cryptocurrencies 3 we note that dol did recently express its views on private equity strategies in defined contribution plans in a similar manner to the release cautioning that plan level fiduciaries are not likely suited to evaluate the use of private equity investments in designated investment alternatives in individual account plans except in a minority of situations u s department of labor supplement statement on private equity in defined contribution plan designated investment alternatives 4 erisa does not define a brokerage window however it is generally understood to be an investment option in a participant directed 401 k plan that gives participants the capabilities to buy and sell investment securities through a brokerage platform 5 dol attempted to classify certain brokerage window investments as designated investment options via sub regulatory guidance found in field assistance bulletin 2012 02 however after intense industry pushback dol removed the controversial guidance

democrats are in a hate affair with corporate profits and stock buybacks and their misguided obsession could well cause oil and gasoline prices to stay higher than they otherwise would you ve probably heard some ranting recently about stock buybacks the term for when a public company repurchases shares of its own stock on the open market democratic lawmakers and lefty pundits have been condemning oil companies among other firms for raking in record profits and using that cash for buybacks rather than plowing every available dollar into additional investment why do democrats hate buybacks so much the antipathy dates at least in part to the trump tax cuts in 2017 there was a debate about slashing corporate tax rates advocates argued that tax cuts would attract more capital into u s markets which businesses would then use to finance new investments in factories equipment and technology these investments would make workers more productive supporters said ultimately leading to gangbusters growth and higher wages this miraculous phenomenon was called capital deepening advertisement at the time some of us argued that access to capital wasn t the issue holding back investment interest rates had been low since the great recession and stock valuations were high most companies had little difficulty finding financing what mattered was the availability of profitable things to invest in without stronger demand and additional customers some of us predicted the additional cash befalling companies through tax cuts would likely get returned to investors in the form of buybacks and dividends follow this author catherine rampell s opinions follow that s pretty much what happened after the republican bill passed there was no sudden burst in investment but there was an unprecedented wave of share buybacks if the goal of cutting corporate taxes was really to encourage companies to invest in new projects and not a fig leaf for upward redistribution of wealth then companies using the money to repurchase shares was a policy failure the government gave up a lot of tax revenue and budget deficits widened with little corporate investment to show for it advertisement somewhere along the way democrats lost the plot instead of being merely the symptom of a failed tax policy buybacks themselves became the villain to many democrats soon they proposed legislation to ban buybacks they excoriated companies for returning cash to shareholders early in the pandemic when some of those businesses could not legally operate and they ve done so again since the economy has largely reopened share buybacks themselves aren t necessarily bad particularly when the alternative is wasting investor money on private jets wild parties or terrible acquisitions democrats insist however that there is a non wasteful alternative use of companies mounting profits investment in a house hearing on wednesday lawmakers berated oil executives for you guessed it too high profits and too many buybacks democrats complained these companies should funnel their cash into expanding output advertisement this makes about as little sense as when republicans promised capital deepening in 2017 the issue is not whether oil executives deserve sympathy they don t it s that as in 2017 it is hard to convince companies to undertake risky investments they don t think will be profitable as i have written before there are real hurdles to investment in fossil fuels unrelated to president biden s climate agenda the number of rigs in operation has been rising but there still aren t enough it will take months to get more into position and ultimately pumping oil by then prices may have collapsed which would lead these investments to become unprofitable this is precisely what happened in several bust cycles including in 2020 when prices briefly went negative and it s why investors are pressuring firms to be cautious about their pace of expansion today advertisement yelling at companies to stop their buybacks won t cause them to increase investment or oil output in fact some policy measures democrats are considering ostensibly to discourage firms from returning so much cash to shareholders would do the opposite progressives have been threatening to impose a tax on excess profits they ve proposed a windfall profits tax that actually functions as an excise tax it would take half the difference between the price of a barrel of brent crude today and the average inflation adjusted price from 2015 to 2019 with prices hovering around 100 per barrel this would effectively add about 17 to the cost of each barrel for oil producers this sort of thing makes risky investments look even less attractive and could cause producers to reduce oil output that s what happened the last time congress enacted a similarly structured windfall profits tax it is also the opposite of what s needed to bring prices down today advertisement
the cradle china incidentally has amassed large stocks of virtually everything rublegas or american lng hypersonic geoeconomics the stunning spectacle of the european union eu committing slow motion hara kiri is something for the ages like a cheap kurosawa remake the movie is actually about the us detonated demolition of the eu complete with the rerouting of some key russian commodities exports to the us at the expense of europeans it helps to have a 5columnist actress strategically placed in this case astonishingly incompetent european commission head ursula von der leyen with her vociferous announcement of a crushing new sanctions package russian ships banned from eu ports road transportation companies from russia and belarus prohibited from entering the eu no more coal imports over 4 4 billion euros a year in practice that translates into washington shaking down its wealthiest western clients puppets russia of course is too powerful to directly challenge militarily and the us badly needs some of its key exports especially minerals so cue to the coming catastrophic economic consequences felt by europeans in their daily life but not by the wealthiest five percent we have germany facing the returning ghost of weimar hyperinflation blackrock president rob kapito said in texas for the first time this generation is going to go into a store and not be able to get what they want zoltan poszar former ny fed and us treasury guru current credit suisse grand vizir has been on a streak stressing howof what he calls bretton woods iii although what s being designed by russia china iran and the eurasia economic union is a post bretton woods poszar remarks that wars historically are won by those who have more food and energy supplies in the past to power horses and soldiers today to feed soldiers and fuel tanks and fighter jets poszar notes how our current bretton woods ii system has a deflationary impulse globalization open trade just in time supply chains while bretton woods 3 will providethe implications are of course overwhelming what s implicit ominously is that this state of affairs may even lead to wwiii the russian roundtable valdai club has conducted an essential expert discussion on what we at the cradle have defined as rublegas the real geoeconomic game changer at the heart of the post petrodollar era alexander losev a member of the russian council for foreign and defense policy offered the contours of the big picture but it was up to alexey gromov chief energy director of the institute of energy and finance to come up with crucial nitty gritty russia so far was selling 155 billion cubic meters of gas to europe each year the eu rhetorically promises to get rid of it by 2027 and reduce supply by the end of 2022 by 100 billion cubic meters gromov asked how and remarked any expert has no answer most of russia s natural gas is shipped over pipelines this cannot simply be replaced by liquified natural gas lng the risible european answer has been start saving as in prepare to be worse off and reduce the temperature in households gromov noted how in russia 22 to 25 degrees in winter is the norm europe is promoting 16 degrees as healthy and wearing sweaters at night the eu won t be able to get the gas it needs from norway or algeria which is privileging domestic consumption azerbaijan would be able to provide at best 10 billion cubic meters a year but that will take 2 or 3 years to happen gromov stressed how there s no surplus in the market today for us and qatar lng and how prices for asian customers are always higher the bottom line is that by the end of 2022 europe won t be able to significantly reduce what it buys from russia they might cut by 50 billion cubic meters maximum andan important development is that russia changed the logistical supply chains to asia already that applies for gas and oil as well you can impose sanctions if there s a surplus in the market nowon oil shipments gromov also commented on the key issue of insurance insurance premiums are higher before ukraine it was all based on the free on board fob system now buyers are saying we don t want to take the risk of taking your cargo to our ports so they are applying the cost insurance and freight cif system where the seller has to insure and transport the cargo that of course impacts revenues an absolutely key issue for russia is how to make the transition tooriginating in the russian bovanenkovo and kharasavey gas fields in yamal in northwest siberia which will reach full capacity only in 2024 and first the interconnector through mongolia must be built we need 3 years to build this pipeline so everything will be in place only around 2025 on the yamal pipeline most of the gas goes to asia if the europeans don t buy anymore we can redirect and then there s the arctic lng 2 project which is even larger than yamal the first phase should be finished soon it s 80 percent ready an extra problem may be posed by the russian unfriendlies in asia japan and south korea lng infrastructure produced in russia still depends on foreign technologies that s what leads gromov to note that the model of mobilization based economy is not so good but that s what russia needs to deal with at least in the short to medium term the positives are that the new paradigm will allow more cooperation within the expansion of the international north south transportation corridor instc andonly and is set to increase cooperation with russia in the framework of their strengthened strategic partnership it was up to chinese energy expert fu chengyu to offer a concise explanation of whyfu chengyu showed how a lengthy tricky process depends on four contracts between the gas developer and the lng company between the lng company and the buyer company between the lng buyer and the cargo company which builds vessels and between the buyer and the end user each contract he pointed out takes a long time to finish without all these signed contracts no party will invest be it investment on infrastructure or gas field development so actual delivery of american lng to europe assumes all these interconnected resources are available and moving like clockwork fu chengyu s verdict is stark this eu obsession on ditching russian gas will provoke an impact on global economic growth and recession they are pushing their own people and the world in the energy sector we will all be harmed it was quite enlightening to juxtapose the coming geoeconomic turbulence the eu obsession in bypassing russian gas and the onset of rublegas with the real reasons behind operation z in ukraine completely obscured by western media and analysts a us deep state old pro now retired and quite familiar with the inner workings of the old oss the cia precursor all the way to the neocon dementia of today provided some sobering insights the whole ukraine issue is over hypersonic missiles that can reach moscow in less than four minutes the us wants them there in poland romania baltic states sweden finland this is in direct violation of the agreements in 1991 that nato will not expand in eastern europe the us does not have hypersonic missiles now but should in a year or two this is an existential threat to russia so they had to go into the ukraine to stop this next will be poland and romania wherefrom a completely different geopolitical perspective what s really telling is that his analysis happens to dovetail with zoltan poszar s geoeconomics the idea that nuclear war is unthinkable is a myth if you look at the firebombing of tokyo against hiroshima and nagasaki more people died in tokyo than hiroshima and nagasaki these cities were rebuilt the radiation goes away and life can restart the difference between firebombing and nuclear bombing is only efficiency nato provocations are so extreme russia had to place their nuclear missiles on standby alert this is a gravely serious matter but the us ignored it
on 6 april 2022 the united states imposed a new round of sanctions on russia in response to its continued actions in ukraine k l gates covered previous rounds of sanctions in alerts on 24 february 25 february 15 march and 25 march as part of a coordinated effort with the g 7 and european union president biden issued an executive order on 6 april 2022 the order that imposes a ban on all new investment in russia as well as a ban on the provision of certain services to russia furthermore the u s department of the treasury s office of foreign assets control ofac broadened the scope of blocking sanctions to include two of russia s largest banks russian politicians and their families and five russian vessels this alert provides an overview of the new sanctions and their implications ban on new investment in russia the order entitled prohibiting new investment in and certain services to the russian federation in response to continued russian federation aggression bans all new investment in russia by u s persons wherever located in this context u s persons are u s citizens and permanent residents wherever located persons located in the united states whatever their nationality entities organized in the united states including foreign branch offices and their employees and entities located in the united states including u s subsidiaries and branch offices of non u s companies the order does not define the term investment but in other contexts ofac has interpreted the term investment broadly to include any transaction that constitutes a commitment or contribution of funds or other assets or a loan or other extension of credit to an enterprise this would include among other things loans extensions of credit assumptions or guarantees overdrafts currency swaps purchases of debt securities loan purchases sales of financial assets subject to an agreement to repurchase renewals or refinancings whereby funds or credits are transferred or extended to a borrower or recipient issuance of standby letters of credit and drawdowns on existing lines of credit in the past ofac has also treated the deferral of payments for goods and services as an extension of credit this action expands upon prior restrictions on new investment in russia s energy sector detailed in our alert of 15 march by banning all new investments in russia regardless of sector according to a white house press statement new investment is now barred in all russian industry sectors in order to make sure that the mass exodus from russia that we re seeing from the private sector which is now over 600 multinational companies and growing that it will endure although the order pertains only to new investments parties with existing business in russia must exercise caution to ensure any activities related to prior investments do not constitute new investments for purposes of the action prohibited services the order also prohibits the exportation reexportation sale or supply directly or indirectly to any person in russia from the united states or by a united states person wherever located of certain services the services subject to this prohibition will be identified by ofac after consultation with the u s department of state we anticipate that ofac will publish guidance on this issue shortly it is important to note that u s persons are prohibited not only from providing certain services and making new investments contrary to the order but they are also strictly prohibited from facilitating such transactions and activities by non u s persons facilitation includes among other things u s persons providing any approval financing guarantee transportation insurance business or legal planning or other means of support it also includes u s persons referring prohibited transactions to non u s persons and the alteration of policies and procedures to permit non u s persons to conduct transactions prohibited for u s persons blocking

all wealthy countries consume large amounts of electricity gertler et al 2016 electricity demand in poorer countries is projected to increase dramatically over the coming decades as households become richer and purchase electric appliances wolfram et al 2012 however electricity blackouts remain ubiquitous in the developing world gertler lee and mobarak 2017 blackouts are costly reducing firm productivity allcott et al 2016 cole et al 2018 increasing production costs steinbuks and foster 2010 fisher vanden et al 2015 and lowering household income burlando 2014 several factors contribute to the high frequency of blackouts in developing countries the complex system of generators and wires that provides electricity to consumers is only as strong as its weakest link voltage spikes and grid disruptions occur more frequently in places where infrastructure quality is poor mcrae 2015 low income countries may also struggle to meet electricity demand due to limited electricity generation capacity as in ghana s dumsor crisis dzansi et al 2018 however in india consumers face frequent power outages despite relatively high quality infrastructure and an ample supply of power plants in our new paper jha et al 2022 we identify a novel explanation for india s power outages when the cost of purchasing electricity rises utilities choose to buy less from power plants thereby restricting the amount of power that reaches consumers indian utilities choose when to provide power in almost every setting demand falls as prices rise thus it may sound obvious that utilities would choose to buy less power when the cost of power rises however in high income countries regulations force electric utilities to buy enough electricity to satisfy the demand of all consumers regardless of cost as a result if someone wants to turn their lights on the utility is legally obliged to sell them the electricity that lets them turn their lights on in developing countries like india such regulations are weak or non existent when an indian utility faces a high cost of purchasing wholesale electricity to meet the demand of retail consumers say on a hot day when inefficient power plants must fire up to produce the electricity to operate air conditioners the utility can choose to purchase less electricity this results in blackouts where indian households may not be able to use their air conditioners and have no way of communicating to the utility how much they would be willing to pay to use their air conditioners in figure 1 the downward sloping line in purple is the indian wholesale demand curve as prices increase utilities demand less electricity from the market the vertical line in light blue is what wholesale electricity demand looks like in the us or most of europe utilities are mandated by regulators to purchase enough electricity from the wholesale sector to satisfy all electricity demand regardless of the wholesale price finally the supply curve in black documents that the quantity of electricity supplied increases with prices it is a step function because different power plants can have very different marginal costs of producing an additional unit of electricity by intersecting supply and demand we can see the trade off inherent to mandating that all electricity demand must be satisfied on the one hand more electricity is supplied to end users on the other hand wholesale electricity prices are higher under this mandate likely leading to higher prices faced by end use consumers as well figure 1 wholesale electricity demand in india with versus without regulatory mandate note prices and quantities are subscripted e under elastic demand and i under inelastic demand a regulatory mandate requiring that all demand be satisfied would shift the market from the elastic equilibrium to the inelastic equilibrium resulting in higher wholesale prices and quantities using detailed administrative data on the indian power sector we show that indian utilities choose to purchase less electricity when their procurement costs rise we digitised thousands of supply and demand curves from the indian energy exchange iex the largest wholesale power market in india where utilities submit bids to purchase the electricity they resell to consumers across all hours of the day utilities demand is downward sloping with an average elasticity greater than one this implies that if the wholesale electricity price increases by 1 utilities will respond by decreasing the quantity of power they provide to consumes by more than 1 we also investigate what happens to the quantity of electricity supplied to consumers when power plants shut down due to equipment malfunctions thereby raising the aggregate costs of electricity supply we estimate that the quantity supplied in a state decreases when more power plants in that state have equipment failures even when other power plants are available to generate power plant incentives also lead to blackouts our results imply that india could reduce blackouts by making its existing fleet of power plants available to generate more often doing so would require addressing ongoing inefficiencies in indian electricity supply on a typical day roughly 27 of the country s non renewable generating capacity is down for outage see figure 2 many of these outages are due to technical issues like equipment failures however for a substantial share of outages plants cite economic factors including rigid contracts that restrict their ability to sell electricity to buyers other than the single utility specified in their contract allowing sellers and buyers to trade contracted positions based on current economic conditions would incentivise low cost plants to avoid discretionary outages on days when their electricity is especially valuable we find that this could increase the quantity of power supplied in the day ahead market by up to 13 figure 2 daily share of generating capacity on outage note this figure plots daily outage rates from 2013 2019 the denominator is total generating capacity of fossil fuel and nuclear power plants the numerators are total capacity that is unavailable to generate for any reason all outages for equipment related reasons equipment and for non technical economic reasons discretionary what if indian regulators eliminated blackouts imposing a regulatory mandate that utilities must supply power to all consumers may seem like an obvious policy solution as illustrated in figure 1 enforcing such a full demand mandate will increase both the quantity supplied to end users and wholesale electricity prices potentially imposing an extremely high financial burden on utilities to eliminate every blackout in a perfect world the economists answer is simple consumers should be stacked from highest to lowest willingness to pay for electricity and power plants should supply consumers until the marginal cost of producing an additional unit exceeds the next consumer s willingness to pay else the utility can fall into a trap where non payment undermines access one way to benchmark the average consumer s willingness to pay is to note that many indian consumers currently pay roughly 13 000 36 000 rs mwh to purchase and run diesel backup generators 1 our results suggest that if indian regulators imposed a mandate forcing utilities to prevent all blackouts the cost to utilities per mwh would be 2 7 times greater than the costs of diesel backup generation however the costs would be much more reasonable if indian regulators also enacted contracting reforms to eliminate discretionary outages at power plants since more low cost power plants would be available to generate electricity in a world without discretionary outages the costs of a regulatory mandate would be comparable to the costs of purchasing and operating a diesel backup generator lessons going forward electricity blackouts continue to impose major costs on firms and households around the developing world there are many causes for these blackouts including limited electricity generating capacity and failing distribution infrastructure we provide a new explanation for blackouts utilities choose to purchase less electricity from the wholesale sector when procurement costs are high leading to less electricity reaching end users improving the profitability of utilities through reforms in the retail sector is a challenge in many developing countries where electricity theft and bill non payment remains prevalent khanna and rowe 2021 our results suggest that reforms to wholesale supply which lower wholesale prices such as alleviating restrictions on the financial trading of contracted positions jha and wolak 2019 may more cost effectively reduce blackouts reforms of this nature are becoming increasingly important as developing countries transition towards renewable energy wind and solar resources have very low operating costs but produce only intermittently when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining if suppliers contracts are not flexible enough to respond to large fluctuations in wind solar generation andersen et al 2019 reducing the incidence of

chelsea logistic and infrastructure holdings widens net loss to p3 9b in 2021 chelsea booked a net loss of p3 9 billion in fy21 which is 18 worse than the net loss it booked in 2020 amid the full weight and chaos of the original covid lockdown that crippled demand for the company s passenger tanker and tugboat businesses chelsea said that its consolidated revenues were down 4 in fy21 with declines in those same business segments one bright spot was chelsea s freight segment which was up 30 y y freight s performance has now exceeded its pre covid levels another was chelsea s logistics segment which grew 41 and brought in p519 million in revenues logistics accounted for 12 of chelsea s revenue in fy21 up from 9 in 2020 philstar reported that chelsea pinned the blame on its degrading profitability on nonrecurring items that include things like selling assets below book value chelsea said that it is encouraged by pockets of recovery in the industry the company recently had its application to increase its authorized capital stock from p2 billion to p3 5 billion approved by the sec earlier this week chelsea is owned by dennis uy friend of president duterte and financier of duterte s 2016 campaign for the presidency the company conducted its ipo in 2017 after uy consolidated a number of logistics companies that had been owned under phoenix petroleum the company stapled infrastructure to its name in 2019 to signal its intent to more broadly participate in president duterte s build build build infrastructure development program then bought and held a significant share of dito telecommunity along with udenna corp mr uy s private holdco and china telecom mb bottom line regardless of business performance which if we re being honest has not been very good the biggest issue with chelsea for me has always been its lack of consistency or predictability as barkadans will know i m a huge fan of the logistics business so i was excited to see chelsea enter the market a few years ago as something of a pure if a little disjointed logistics play covering people products and energy then they started throwing out unsolicited bids to develop regional airports then they acquired a massive stake in what would become dito telecommunity the company has been an absolute frankenstein of business interests in the five years it s been on the pse early on investors were quite excited in chelsea the shares traded at a peak of p10 72 share back in late 2017 but they promptly lost over half of their value over the next year to p4 80 share in late 2018 there was a recovery through 2019 to the p8 50 share region but the covid crash in 2020 sent the price down p2 08 share while most companies have recovered from that intense selling pressure chelsea has only continued to slip into the red the stock is down to p1 53 share which puts it down 86 from its 2017 high down 82 from its 2019 recovery and down 26 from its covid crash low it s been sometimes hilarious to read chelsea earnings reports with its traditional logistics business units talking in detail about small operational issues with tugboats and passenger ferry engine maintenance all while participating in some of the highest profile telecommunications transactions in the country s history and basically saying just about nothing about that at all the news that chelsea is looking to raise money to fund current and future projects and working capital is actually a good contrast to our discussion above is this like cebu landmasters where its potential equity raise is backed by the tailwind of massive demand for its products and services or is this more like a company selling parts of itself to meet its obligations and keep operations going why dump more money into a company that seems as though it is only used as a helper cell for udenna s broad spreadsheet of infrastructure dreams will chelsea even have the same pull for these airports ports and whatever else now that uy s friend is coming to the end of his term in office lots of questions here if the equity raise is public and not a private placement to udenna or some other affiliate it will be very interesting to see how chelsea pitches this to investors merkado barkada is a free daily newsletter on the pse investing and business in the philippines you can subscribe to the newsletter or follow on twitter to receive the full daily updates merkado barkada s opinions are provided for informational purposes only and should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell any particular stock these daily articles are not updated with new information so each investor must do his or her own due diligence before trading as the facts and figures in each particular article may have changed

an employee of lin an rural commercial bank counts banknotes at the bank s branch in xitianmu area in hangzhou zhejiang province on feb 25 2020 ï¼ photo by hu jianhuan for china dailyï¼ draft legislation seeks to strengthen real economy anchor expectations china s new draft law on financial stability has proposed a comprehensive framework of financial risk prevention that will help navigate the world s second largest economy through the rising economic and financial headwinds at home and abroad experts said on thursday as the fundamental legal basis of china s efforts to fend off major financial risks the new legislation will serve to enhance financial resilience strengthen the real economy and anchor market expectations they said the draft law released on wednesday outlined a cross agency mechanism for maintaining financial stability it orders establishment of a fund for ensuring financial stability calls for cooperation among different financial regulators and local authorities and sets out punishments for financial institutions regulators and individuals failing to perform their duties in terms of preventing financial risks it is necessary to set up such a mechanism to safeguard the bottom line of preventing major financial risks especially given the complex economic and financial situation at home and abroad the people s bank of china the country s central bank said in a statement when releasing the draft in its statement the central bank said that although a number of laws had previously been issued to govern the financial system there remains a lack of systematic arrangements in terms of maintaining financial stability with relevant provisions scattered in different sets of law and an absence of rules in relation to some key issues liu junhai director of the business law center at renmin university of china said the new law is highly important as it will play a key role in financial risk prevention and coordinated actions by different authorities in this regard the new law will enhance the efficiency of financial risk prevention by reducing uncoordinated steps by different authorities hence reinforcing the development basis for the financial system and providing the real economy with more solid financial support liu said the draft law comes amid growing economic pressures at home and abroad a covid 19 surge and a real estate downturn have put more strains on the finances of real estate developers smaller businesses and local governments while external headwinds such as geopolitical uncertainties and monetary tightening in developed economies are on the rise economic data has reflected the more complex external environment official data showed on thursday that china s foreign exchange reserves fell to 3 188 trillion at the end of march down 0 8 percent from a month earlier due to a stronger u s dollar and a fall in international bond markets dong dengxin director of the wuhan university of science and technology s finance and securities institute said the new law will improve china s ability to guard against cross border and cross sector financial risks and help anchor market expectations notably the fund for ensuring financial stability proposed in the draft law will help stem the spread of risks in the initial stage of a financial crisis by smoothing market fluctuations and bailing out struggling financial institutions he said the draft law which is available for public comment until may 6 said the fund will be used as spare capital to handle major financial risks and will be financed by financial institutions and financial infrastructure operators the central bank is allowed to provide liquidity support for the fund if necessary apart from promoting coordinated steps among authorities in terms of risk resolution the law will also encourage major shareholders of financial institutions to improve their internal risk management dong added also to anchor expectations and bolster the economy china pledged more fiscal and monetary support on wednesday it was decided at an executive meeting of the state council to postpone the old age insurance premium payments of hard hit enterprises and to set up re lending facilities to support technological innovation and elderly care services experts added that the country s decision to roll out a law and a fund to ensure financial stability is in line with international practices as major economies have developed similar mechanisms after the 2008 global financial crisis the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was passed in the united states in july 2010 to better scrutinize non banking financial institutions meanwhile the u s treasury department can use the exchange stabilization fund created in 1934 to mitigate instability in credit securities and foreign exchange markets
as the federal reserve intensifies its efforts to tame high inflation its top officials are casting their aggressive drive in a new light as a blow against economic inequality that thinking marks a sharp reversal from the conventional view of the fed s use of interest rates normally the steep rate hikes the fed is planning for the coming months would be seen as a particular threat to disadvantaged and lower income households these groups are most likely to suffer if rate hikes weaken an economy cause unemployment to rise and sometimes trigger a recession instead some of the most dovish fed officials who typically favor low rates to nurture the job market are now going out of their way to point out ways in which inflation falls hardest on poorer americans curbing high inflation they argue is a fairness issue the burden of high prices is particularly great for households with more limited resources lael brainard an influential member of the fed s board of governors and a longtime interest rate dove said in a speech tuesday that is why getting inflation down is our most important task get tri state area news and weather forecasts to your inbox sign up for nbc new york newsletters inflation rose 7 9 in february 2022 the the biggest rise in the consumer price index in 40 years the labor department reported but what exactly is inflation and what is causing it brainard noted that food and energy together account for one quarter of the price spikes that have driven inflation to 40 year highs poorer americans spend about one fourth of their incomes on groceries and transportation she said while wealthier households spend less than one tenth members of congress from both parties generally agree that the fed must tackle the surge in inflation by steadily raising rates which will make many consumer and business loans costlier indeed most economists have said the fed has waited too long to do so and now runs the risk of having to tighten credit too fast and derailing the economy last month the fed raised its key rate from near zero to a range of 0 25 to 0 5 still some democrats have expressed concern that higher rates will slow hiring significantly even while unemployment for black workers for example remains higher than that for whites we clearly have a long way to go when it comes to making sure everyone has a good quality job sen sherrod brown an ohio democrat said last month at a hearing on jerome powell s nomination for a second four year term as fed chair hiking up interest rates too early can depress job growth tim duy chief u s economist at sgh macro advisers and some other analysts say the fed is right to highlight the damage that inflation can do to americans ability to afford basic needs such as food gas and rent but they also suggest that some recent fed comments have exaggerated the notion that inflation worsens economic inequality nathan sheets global chief economist for citi and a former fed economist notes for instance that inflation reduces the burden of debt which can disproportionately benefit lower income americans wages typically rise to keep up with inflation but mortgages and other debts usually carry fixed interest rates making them easier to pay off the u s is dealing with the coronavirus pandemic a worker shortage and soaring prices nbclx political editor noah pransky breaks down what s causing these complex issues and what the biden white house is able to do about them brainard s speech this week was one of the starker examples of the fed s argument that inflation can exacerbate inequality brainard who has been nominated for the fed s no 2 role and is part of powell s inner circle said that lower income households defined as the poorest one fifth spend 77 of their income on necessities including food and housing by contrast the richest one fifth spend just 31 of their incomes on those categories likewise mary daly president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco and long a dovish voice on the fed s policymaking committee surprised fed watchers this week when she declared that inflation is as harmful as not having a job i understand that if you have a job but you can t pay your bills or i feel like i can t save for what i need to do then that s keeping you up at night daly said in remarks to the native american financial officers association brainard in her speech noted that poorer people often pay higher prices for the same item higher income households for example can afford to make bulk purchases or to stock up on an item when it s being sold at a discount thereby lowering their cost per item and when inflation rises brainard said households that buy name brand cereals can switch to cheaper store brands but poorer consumers that are already buying cheaper items can t make an equivalent price lowering switch powell himself began shifting his rhetoric in this direction last winter during testimony to congress duy said when the fed chair mentioned the harsh impact that inflation inflicts on disadvantaged americans powell hadn t raised that concern in previous testimony in september it was a notable change for the powell fed which has focused on inequality in the job market more than its predecessors in august 2020 the fed updated its policy framework to specify that its goal of maximum employment was broad and inclusive this meant the fed would consider unemployment rates for black and hispanic workers rather than just headline figures in setting its interest rate policies the central bank also said it would no longer raise rates in anticipation of higher inflation but would wait until higher prices actually materialized brainard had highlighted one reason for taking a more patient approach in a speech in february 2021 in those remarks she said that raising rates to pre empt inflation may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic challenges powell and other fed officials say their goal now is to reduce inflation by slowing but not stopping growth reducing high inflation is important to keep the economy expanding they say and ultimately to keep unemployment low for now sheets suggested the fed can raise rates without worrying too much about hurting the job market because its benchmark rate is so low fed officials don t think their key rate will start to restrain growth until it reaches about 2 4 the minutes from the fed s most recent meeting in march released wednesday showed that the officials want to expeditiously reach that level and economists expect them to do so by the end of this year at that point if inflation is still too high the fed might have to raise rates further to a point where layoffs occur and the risks of a recession rise that s when it will get sticky and challenging for the fed when those short run trade offs arise sheets said

grindhouse at fifteen how quentin tarantino and robert rodriguez changed b movie culture when grindhouse hit theaters on april 6 2007 quentin tarantino and robert rodriguez were already cultural icons both directors had just come off of two huge hits with kill bill and sin city for their follow up they literally doubled down on their hollywood clout to make a double feature that would recreate the experience of spending an entire night at the drive in rodriguez was up first with his star studded action horror hybrid planet terror followed by tarantino s killer car slasher death proof fake trailers from edgar wright rob zombie eli roth and jason eisener split up the two films along with 70s wraparound intros that served as a time warp to the heydey of 42nd street audiences however didn t respond and grindhouse wound up severely underperforming at the box office both directors misjudged the marketplace but in doing so they wound up creating a new industry of cool that took the exploitation films of the seventies and repackaged them for the 21st century i was at the austin texas premiere of grindhouse on march 28th 2007 i watched along with both directors and the entire cast including mary elizabeth winstead danny trejo and kurt russell the sold out audience that night was completely enraptured especially an entire section of the bad ass roller derby league the texas rollergirls who all screamed everytime one of their own appeared on screen the vast majority of filming for planet terror and death proof took place in austin so every hometown shout out and local landmark was met with cheers planet terror that was probably the audience reaction that robert rodriguez had in mind when he suggested the entire concept to tarantino who immediately signed on we were the horror geeks that grindhouse was made for not mainstream moviegoers who had never seen a roger corman movie before there was also a re education going on allowing tarantino and rodriguez to introduce genre fans to forgotten exploitation films and the drive in icons that used to light up the theater marquee turning so many new fans onto the biker movies and horror schlock of the seventies led to more repertory theaters screening and preserving films from the drive in era grindhouse was released in 2 600 theaters and only made half its budget back but it gave a much needed jolt to independent movie theaters and launched a massive straight to dvd empire the ripple effect of grindhouse s unintended success can still be felt today especially in countless throwback horror trailers that mimic the gritty film stock style that tarantino and rodriguez paid homage to the quentin tarantino presents banner was also created to promote neo biker grindhouse films like 2008 s hell ride starring starring larry bishop michael madsen dennis hopper and david carradine drive in films were back even if mainstream audiences didn t buy into the experience that both tarantino and rodriguez tried to recreate miraculously even two of the fake trailers in grindhouse actually became real films hobo with a shotgun from jason eisener is now a canuxploitation classic rodriguez eventually made machete and machete kills with danny trejo to date there have probably been more films made copying the grindhouse aesthetic than all the rip off versions of pulp fiction dolled out in the late nineties and aughts maybe if we re lucky edgar wright might get around to making his fake trailer don t into a reality judging by wright s tweet on the grindhouse 15th anniversary there may be a glimmer of hope the 15th anniversary of grindhouse must mean it s also a happy 15th of the trailer don t based on the terrifying bestseller shot on 35mm and then kicked around the edit parking lot to achieve authentic scratches and dirt perhaps the most fun i ve had shooting anything pic twitter com vviumxhiai edgarwright edgarwright april 6 2022 or tarantino could write the book that don t is fictitiously based on turning it into an actual bestseller

elon musk appears to have violated a 50 year old law when he purchased 9 2 of twitter s stock to become the largest shareholder in the company according to a report by the washington post musk was legally required to notify the securities and exchange commission when he surpassed a five percent stake in the company which he did on march 14 but instead he filed the required forms on monday april 4 david kass a finance professor at university of maryland s business school told the post that musk s late filing netted him an additional 156 million when he purchased the stock it was trading at around 39 a share when his purchase was made public twitter shares jumped to more than 50 a share he may have also misled the sec on the required disclosure forms by claiming that he would be a passive investor which meant he had no plans to make changes or try to influence the company on tuesday it was announced that musk would be joining twitter s board of directors he also tweeted that he planned to make significant improvements to twitter in coming months after he was appointed to the board musk filed a different form indicating his role was changing from a passive investor to an active investor even if the sec determines that musk violated the law he would only be subject to a relatively small six figure fine the sec could try to go after the 156 million he earned due to the late filing but legal experts believe that is a longshot the sec would have to be really angry with him to try that because they would have a good chance of a court rejecting that argument adam pritchard a professor of securities law at university of michigan s law school said

as the federal reserve intensifies its efforts to tame high inflation its top officials are casting their aggressive drive in a new light as a blow against economic inequality that thinking marks a sharp reversal from the conventional view of the fed s use of interest rates normally the steep rate hikes the fed is planning for the coming months would be seen as a particular threat to disadvantaged and lower income households these groups are most likely to suffer if rate hikes weaken an economy cause unemployment to rise and sometimes trigger a recession instead some of the most dovish fed officials who typically favor low rates to nurture the job market are now going out of their way to point out ways in which inflation falls hardest on poorer americans curbing high inflation they argue is a fairness issue the burden of high prices is particularly great for households with more limited resources lael brainard an influential member of the fed s board of governors and a longtime interest rate dove said in a speech tuesday that is why getting inflation down is our most important task inflation rose 7 9 in february 2022 the the biggest rise in the consumer price index in 40 years the labor department reported but what exactly is inflation and what is causing it brainard noted that food and energy together account for one quarter of the price spikes that have driven inflation to 40 year highs poorer americans spend about one fourth of their incomes on groceries and transportation she said while wealthier households spend less than one tenth members of congress from both parties generally agree that the fed must tackle the surge in inflation by steadily raising rates which will make many consumer and business loans costlier indeed most economists have said the fed has waited too long to do so and now runs the risk of having to tighten credit too fast and derailing the economy last month the fed raised its key rate from near zero to a range of 0 25 to 0 5 still some democrats have expressed concern that higher rates will slow hiring significantly even while unemployment for black workers for example remains higher than that for whites we clearly have a long way to go when it comes to making sure everyone has a good quality job sen sherrod brown an ohio democrat said last month at a hearing on jerome powell s nomination for a second four year term as fed chair hiking up interest rates too early can depress job growth tim duy chief u s economist at sgh macro advisers and some other analysts say the fed is right to highlight the

on groceries and transportation she said while wealthier households spend less than one tenth members of congress from both parties generally agree that the fed must tackle the surge in inflation by steadily raising rates which will make many consumer and business loans costlier indeed most economists have said the fed has waited too long to do so and now runs the risk of having to tighten credit

in the first test of a state s board diversity requirement a los angeles county superior court judge has entered summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff in crest v padilla who challenged the constitutionality of california s law requiring california based public companies to have at least one director on their boards from an underrepresented community defined as an individual who self identifies as black african american hispanic latino asian pacific islander native american native hawaiian or alaska native or who self identifies as gay lesbian bisexual or transgender in its april 1 2022 decision the court concluded that the law known as assembly bill 979 and codified at california corporations code 301 4 violated the equal protection clause in california s constitution in particular the court reasoned that the law utilized race sexual orientation and gender based classifications because it impose a duty on corporations to use such categories in the selection of their board members and to have a specific number of directors who are members of certain listed races or else have certain listed sexual orientations or gender identities use of these classifications required the defendant california s secretary of state to prove that the law was justified by a compelling state interest and narrowly tailored to accomplish its goal while remedying past discrimination in board selection could potentially constitute a compelling state interest the court concluded that the defendant had not properly defined a sufficiently specific arena in which discrimination is to be remediated instead the law applied across all industries in california the defendant also failed to present sufficient evidence of past discrimination the court said while it presented evidence that straight cis gender white males are overrepresented on public company boards relative to the population as a whole it failed to show a disparity between the demographic make up of the qualified talent pool and those who hold positions in the targeted arena as for the argument that businesses benefit from having a diverse board the court concluded that this sort of generic interest in healthy business constitute a compelling state interest this court also concluded that even if the defendant had shown that remediating past discrimination in board selection was a compelling state interest the california legislature had failed to narrowly tailor the law to that goal for example instead of mandating appointment of directors from underrepresented communities the legislature could have required companies to disclose the racial sexual orientation and gender identity make up of their boards or change the assertedly subjective secretive and insular process by which they select directors because the legislature did not consider these less restrictive means the court concluded that the law could not survive constitutional scrutiny the court s decision is the first to address the constitutionality of board level diversity requirements legal challenges are also pending against the state s law requiring every california based public company to have at least one woman on its board senate bill 826 california corporations code 301 4 as well as nasdaq s listing rule requiring companies to disclose board level diversity statistics and by certain dates to either have a diverse director or explain why they do not it remains to be seen whether california s secretary of state will appeal the ruling or whether other courts will follow its reasoning regardless of the ultimate outcome of the crest case the ruling should have little effect on those companies that already have or were planning to add members of underrepresented communities to their boards as the court observed corporations are and have always been free to act themselves to increase their own diversity nothing in this ruling requires them to change course download pdf

income americans wages typically rise to keep up with inflation but mortgages and other debts usually carry fixed interest rates making them easier to pay off the u s is dealing with the coronavirus pandemic a worker shortage and soaring prices nbclx political editor noah pransky breaks down what s causing these complex issues and what the biden white house is able to do about them brainard s speech this week was one of the starker examples of the fed s argument that inflation can exacerbate inequality brainard who has been nominated for the fed s no 2 role and is part of powell s inner circle said that lower income households defined as the poorest one fifth spend 77 of their income on necessities including food and housing by contrast the richest one fifth spend just 31 of their incomes on those categories likewise mary daly president of the federal reserve bank of san francisco and long a dovish voice on the fed s policymaking committee surprised fed watchers this week when she declared that inflation is as harmful as not having a job i understand that if you have a job but you can t pay your bills or i feel like i can t save for what i need to do then that s keeping you up at night daly said in remarks to the native american financial officers association brainard in her speech noted that poorer people often pay higher prices for the same item higher income households for example can afford to make bulk purchases or to stock up on an item when it s being sold at a discount thereby lowering their cost per item and when inflation rises brainard said households that buy name brand cereals can switch to cheaper store brands but poorer consumers that are already buying cheaper items can t make an equivalent price lowering switch powell himself began shifting his rhetoric in this direction last winter during testimony to congress duy said when the fed chair mentioned the harsh impact that inflation inflicts on disadvantaged americans powell hadn t raised that concern in previous testimony in september it was a notable change for the powell fed which has focused on inequality in the job market more than its predecessors in august 2020 the fed updated its policy framework to specify that its goal of maximum employment was broad and inclusive this meant the fed would consider unemployment rates for black and hispanic workers rather than just headline figures in setting its interest rate policies the central bank also said it would no longer raise rates in anticipation of higher inflation but would wait until higher prices actually materialized brainard had highlighted one reason for taking a more patient approach in a speech in february 2021 in those remarks she said that raising rates to pre empt inflation may curtail progress for racial and ethnic groups that have faced systemic challenges powell and other fed officials say their goal now is to reduce inflation by slowing but not stopping growth reducing high inflation is important to keep the economy expanding they say and ultimately to keep unemployment low for now sheets suggested the fed can raise rates without worrying too much about hurting the job market because its benchmark rate is so low fed officials don t think their key rate will start to restrain growth until it reaches about 2 4 the minutes from the fed s most recent meeting in march released wednesday showed that the officials want to expeditiously reach that level and economists expect them to do so by the end of this year at that point if inflation is still too high the fed might have to raise rates further to a point where layoffs occur and the risks of a recession rise that s when it will get sticky and challenging for the fed when those short run trade offs arise sheets said
