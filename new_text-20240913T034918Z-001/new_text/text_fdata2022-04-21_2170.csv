proposal includes transitional housing addiction treatment and other services the covid 19 pandemic exacerbated a housing crisis across colorado as previously affordable enclaves saw rental costs and home prices soar and as a resort town homebuying spree shut out low and middle income workers from mountain communities meanwhile homelessness in urban areas became more visible when the streets emptied of workers and tourists job loss economic upheaval and an addiction crisis all driven in part by the pandemic left more people unhoused low wage earners hospitality workers families with young children and people of color who disproportionately face barriers to health care and homeownership were financially impacted while high earners saw their wealth grow in denver the number of people at shelters who were experiencing homelessness for the first time grew by 99 according to cathy alderman public policy officer at colorado coalition for the homeless alderman joined gov jared polis and several democratic state lawmakers at the capitol on monday to talk about what they hope will be a salve for colorado s homelessness crisis 200 million in federal money aimed at adding transitional housing permanent housing with wraparound services and a substance use treatment and vocational training facility new investments the affordable housing transformational task force established last year was charged with finding ways to spend 400 million from the american rescue plan act that congress passed in spring 2021 lawmakers on the task force whose work was informed by housing and homelessness experts on a subpanel of which alderman served as vice chair produced a final report with specific dollar figures for most of their priorities such as a revolving loan fund for housing developers grants to help nonprofits and local governments add affordable housing and support for resident owned mobile home communities but the final report published in january did not contain an agreed upon funding range for two priorities that would specifically address homelessness one of those was transitional or long term housing members of the task force and subpanel had agreed on the importance of setting aside some amount of money to develop and build such housing for people leaving jail prison hospitals and homeless shelters people fleeing dangerous home environments and unhoused people with mental illness and substance use disorders they did not however assign a specific dollar amount to this recommendation likewise the task force s final report recommended awarding grants for new permanent housing with supportive services for the homeless population and people with disabilities but it did not include a specific amount of funding for permanent supportive housing now polis administration is making a total of 200 million in federal relief funding available for these two recommendations on top of the 400 million originally allocated toward affordable housing rep steven woodrow a denver democrat said at the news conference the money will come from a cash fund lawmakers designated for economic recovery and relief under the plan revealed monday the largest chunk of funding 105 million would go toward converting existing properties into transitional or long term housing the bill to do that must pass the state legislature before the funding can be awarded another 50 million will be made available for the permanent supportive housing recommendation from the task force through a separate bill being introduced this week that will be led by rep iman jodeh an aurora democrat this funding would be awarded to a supportive housing developer in the denver aurora metro area the supportive housing development would include addiction treatment behavioral health care and workforce training for people experiencing homelessness stella watts a graduate of the bridge house ready to work program touted such a workforce solution to help people experiencing homelessness deal with issues like substance use disorders and find successful employment they provide everything that you need to get your life back and they start from the day that you walk into the door watts who spoke at the news conference said of ready to work they show compassion toward you and then they offer a work first solution to help end homelessness repurposing ridge view polis and the lawmakers who spoke monday also made mention of plans to repurpose the former ridge view youth services center which closed in 2001 senate bill 22 211 which was formally introduced monday would use 45 million in economic recovery and relief money to convert ridge view into a facility serving adults suffering from addiction who lack stable housing the arapahoe county campus would provide substance use disorder treatment as well as medical care vocational training and transitional housing the goal as explained in the bill text to have individuals leave the ridge view supportive residential community in active recovery and improved health so they can transition to stable housing and community based supports as well as employment where possible this legislation is sponsored by sens rhonda fields an aurora democrat and nick hinrichsen a democrat from pueblo along with rep alex valdez a denver democrat by repurposing the ridgeview campus the state in partnership with local communities can focus on reducing homelessness supporting addiction recovery access and access to behavioral and mental health support polis said he stressed such an investment from the state was unprecedented and that it would be up to local communities to develop their own solutions to homelessness costs challenge housing access some of the other recommendations from the housing task force including grants for local governments to expand their housing stock and a loan program to help preserve affordable mobile home communities are well on their way to becoming law but the cold hard reality is that some number of coloradans will likely continue to find themselves unable to access housing in the years to come despite the state and federal investments colorado s home prices rose by an average of 20 3 in 2021 slightly outpacing national rates according to the march economic forecast by nonpartisan legislative council staff while real estate values have surged statewide the federal housing finance agency reports the fastest rates of appreciation in pueblo 23 8 percent colorado springs 22 3 percent and grand junction 22 1 percent the forecast noted pandemic supply chain disruptions a construction industry labor shortage and skyrocketing lumber costs continue to present barriers to homebuilders in denver average monthly rent on a two bedroom apartment was 1 817 in march according to data from apartment list that s up nearly 15 from a year ago colorado springs saw average monthly rent grow more than 12 over the same time frame to 1 443 in march in aurora the average cost of renting a two bedroom apartment was 1 734 up 15 4 year over year we ve seen the impacts that the cost of housing is having across our state state sen julie gonzales a denver democrat said at the news conference monday this pandemic hit our communities hard particularly working class coloradans and communities of color to read more stories from colorado newsline visit www

long before joe biden became the democratic nominee for president questions were being raised even by other dems and their media allies about his mental acuity this was thanks in large part to repeated instances of him appearing confused and disoriented while on the campaign trail and later when his handlers hatched the basement hideout plan to try and contain biden as much as possible after the start of the wuhan virus outbreak in 2020 advertisement those questions have only continued since he was sworn into office most often after troubling incidents like the bizarre behavior demonstrated by biden at certain points during the white house easter egg roll on monday are caught on tape and go viral on social media it s even gotten so bad for biden that even some polls show a majority of voters have questions about his mental fitness to lead the country when asked about it at the time jill biden scoffed calling it ridiculous in addition to that the biden apologists in the msm are now actually gaming out 2024 presidential contender scenarios on the democrat side all based on the rumors that biden who will be 80 in november either will step down at the end of his term or will be rejected by democratic voters the second time around considering his approval ratings continue to fall and in the process drag house and senate democrats with him with all of that in mind we turn to fresh reporting from the washington post about how sen bernie sanders i vt has made it known privately that he s considering a run for president in 2024 in the event that biden decides to bow out in the event of an open 2024 democratic presidential primary sen sanders has not ruled out another run for president so we advise that you answer any questions about 2024 with that in mind says the memo from faiz shakir a close sanders adviser who was his campaign manager when he ran in 2020 the memo was shared by a person with direct knowledge of its contents on the condition of anonymity because it was not released publicly and confirmed by a second person with direct knowledge of the contents advertisement lest anyone wonder about the authenticity of the memo a spokesman from sanders senate office seemed to confirm it in a statement while it s frustrating this private memo leaked to the media the central fact remains true which is that senator sanders is the most popular officeholder in the country said sanders spokesman mike casca when asked for comment casca and the memo based that assertion on a recent poll per a recent report biden signaled to his former boss ex president barack obama that he had full intentions of running for reelection in 2024 but speculation is running rampant that biden may be holding out on an official announcement as to his future plans until he knows what former president donald trump will do democrats and biden himself reportedly believe he is the only one who would be able to beat trump in a possible 2024 rematch all of that said republicans have got to be salivating and who could blame them over a scenario involving a biden retirement where he passes the torch to vice president harris who is just as unpopular as he is at this point in their white house tenures then enter sanders onto the scene who actually has a pretty convincing case that democrats stole the 2016 nomination from him due to queen hillary considerations and then in 2020 was more or less abandoned after democrats began to fret that his nomination would ensure trump would get reelected advertisement so if biden does retire and sanders throws his hat in the ring to challenge kamala expect the admitted socialist to be loaded for bear because he s got a lot of grievances to air with his party also his supporters are some of the most rabidly faithful and vindictive people you will ever come across so they will support him every step of the way that includes former congresswoman and 2020 democratic presidential candidate tulsi gabbard a longtime sanders supporter who is shall we say not exactly fond of harris nor the dnc meanwhile kamala likely would try and paint herself as the sane alternative to sanders who with his support for socialism would indeed be a disastrous choice for democrats going into the general election season considering they ve blamed such labels for election losses in recent years assuming harris could make it past sanders and the other potential contenders after all the infighting that will leave her politically bruised with the hurt feelings on the sanders side potentially further complicating her already uphill battle to ascend to the oval office throne considering her own dismal track record will follow her everywhere she goes there are a lot of what if s and hypotheticals and will he or won t he parts to all of this to be sure but one thing for certain is that you should stock up on the popcorn ahead of 2023 as things could get reeaaaally interesting about 10 months from now advertisement

investorplace stock market news stock advice trading tips on paper quantumscape qs however wall street is demonstrating the power of this supposed relevance in strange ways qs stock is intriguing undoubtedly but it remains a speculative wager source michael vi shutterstock com if you re a stakeholder of quantumscape nyse qs you really couldn t ask for a better catalyst for the underlying investment what with the collision of climate change and political pressure boding well for the electric vehicle industry irrespective of whatever else is going on qs stock should be able to drive higher based on these two factors alone just to bring everyone up to speed no quantumscape isn t an ev maker what the company does however is specializing in the research and development of solid state batteries presently evs though becoming wildly popular among the broader consumer base are still prohibitively expensive for most households but ssbs could change the paradigm with high performance high range and cheaper power units that would be a dramatic upside catalyst for ev integration naturally this scenario is also incredibly enticing for qs stock then you have russia s unsettling decision to invade ukraine and the power dynamics of hydrocarbon hegemony has shifted favor even more so toward ev integration as myriad academic sources explained our western allies in europe are heavily dependent on russia sourced fossil fuels a pivot to alternative transportation while not the end all be all would provide a welcome transition so why is qs stock generally underperforming here s where our hearts and minds don t necessarily correspond with reality quantumscape 17 26 wall street shows no love for qs stock you don t need access to newspapers the digital kind but the analog variety will work just as well to understand how present global dynamics help the case for qs stock instead you merely need to pull up to your local gasoline station at time of writing the national average gas price is 4 10 a gallon again that s an average meaning that folks in california are paying 5 70 a gallon arizona is looking at 4 57 a gallon which golden state residents would find cheap under the circumstances that s how macabre things have gotten therefore anything related to the integration and rollout of evs should be on fire in the market just like oil stocks are making a killing we re talking the entire supply chain from ev manufacturers to infrastructure networks to innovation focused entities like quantumscape anything that will help consumers get their hind ends away from combustion cars and into evs should be a positive but that s not what we re seeing for instance qs stock is down 42 during the trailing year volkswagen otcmkts vwagy which is pivoting to electric is down 32 over the same frame as well chargepoint nyse chpt has declined by 19 let s be fair qs stock has jumped over 27 since the eve of russia s special military operation nevertheless on a year to date basis qs is down yes down 23 you need to focus on realities honestly whether you are interested in qs stock or not it should be concerning that a big oil firm like exxon mobil nyse xom is up 38 ytd it benefitted from inflation the return to the office and the war in ukraine and it s keeping these gains at least as of this writing unfortunately this circumstance suggests that everyone bull bear and indifferent needs to focus on realities while qs stock is incredibly compelling on an aspirational long term basis we don t know if the narrative will actually pan out true the yale school of the environment points out that european leaders have basically fast tracked their renewable energy strategies but the immediate grand scale discussion is really not centered on solar panels and wind turbines rather it s zeroing in on other sources of hydrocarbons since the new normal i ve been hearing that sometimes incoherent masses of the internet scream about wanting facts well those are the facts as much as we all love clean renewable energy and saving the dolphins and whatever the fact is that we are incredibly dependent on fossil fuels and that s probably why qs stock isn t performing up to par for most investors it might be too aspirational to be worth the risk time for energy realism don t treat this story as a takedown on qs stock in my heart of hearts i hope quantumscape finds the magic formula for the ssb it would be game changing for the ev industry however the issue is that wall street doesn t find this proposition to be likely since market actors act rationally most of the time if the proposition was much more sensible you d see more demand for qs stock so the conclusion is as follows if you re a risk taker you might view quantumscape as an opportunity that the masses have yet to appreciate in that case qs stock is a steal but if you re risk averse you might want to think carefully about it on the date of publication josh enomoto did not have either directly or indirectly any positions in the securities mentioned in this article the opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer subject to

america is running out of military munitions and can t replace them for years due to industrial decline and supply chain collapse just as russia has now completed the test firing of its global icbm sarmat missile system which can reach any target anywhere in the world with a dizzying array of re entry nuclear vehicles alarm bells are being sounded over america s rapid depletion of munitions due to the russia ukraine conflict the us pentagon has shipped thousands of javelin anti tank weapons to ukraine along with millions of rounds of ammunition artillery shells rockets drones and troop transport vehicles leading to a sudden drop in the available stockpiles of such equipment should us forces need to defend the homeland general mark milley the chairman of the u s joint chiefs of staff told congress that the west has delivered 60 000 antitank weapons and 25 000 anti aircraft weapons to kyiv the pentagon is now laying plans to rush additional artillery coastal defense drones and other materiel to ukraine reports bloombergquint com pentagon officials say that kyiv is blowing through a weekâ s worth of deliveries of antitank munitions every day it is also running short of usable aircraft as russian airstrikes and combat losses take their toll ammunition has become scarce in mariupol and other areas this is presenting western countries with a stark choice between pouring more supplies into ukraine or husbanding finite capabilities they may need for their own defense will take years to rebuild weapons stockpiles even worse we ve now learned that many of these systems are extremely difficult to replenish requiring years of manufacturing to restore supplies while javelin missiles for example have been sent to ukraine by the thousands the united states can only manufacture about 1 000 units a year under current circumstances see below contributing to the alarming problem is the supply chain collapse that appears to be spreading rapidly making it difficult if not impossible for weapons manufacturers to source materials and parts that are needed for their products in addition many weapons system suppliers are single source suppliers meaning there is zero redundancy in the military supply chain for that component or weapon even worse many of these single source suppliers rely on microchips or other parts from china or taiwan meaning that such parts may be impossible to get during a world war and finally wrapping up the dismal reality of the situation america s industrial capabilities have plummeted over the last two decades combined with the fact that so few americans want to carry out anything resembling work there is no ability for america to repeat its world war ii feat of out producing the third reich and the japanese empire in the 1930s and 40s america carried a strong work ethic and an outstanding industrial output capacity based largely on domestic sourcing of steel for example today america has collapsed into a nation with very little domestic manufacturing and almost no remaining work ethic the primary thing produced by america is fiat currency debt notes which obviously can t replace steel other american exports include libtard cultural insanity pedophilia grooming big tech censorship and orwellian tracking technologies in essence america produces very little other than debt misery and insanity plus quite a lot of food crops when fertilizer is available you can t print your way to military readiness as analysts are now coming to realize you can t print munitions and weapon systems yes you can print money and make believe you have an abundant economy a rising stock market and high currency velocity but those are all fictions based on currency counterfeiting by the central bank military weapons on the other hand have to be manufactured out of real things copper steel electronics gunpowder aluminum etc and these real things are increasingly difficult to acquire largely due to the west s insanely stupid economic sanctions against russia which have for the most part backfired against western nations and caused extremely stubborn supply chain disruptions you also can t simply outsource your domestic weapons production to other countries since the entire point of domestic production is to have factories that can create weapons for national defense when you re in the middle of a global war the united states having outsourced nearly all manufacturing to china and other nations has but a shadow remaining of its post world war ii manufacturing capabilities printing more money won t solve this problem which means fake president joe biden has no idea what to do in fact that top two solutions being pursued by the white house under the resident in chief joe biden is to 1 print more money and 2 shut down domestic infrastructure the results are nothing short of catastrophic america is dismantling its ability to manufacture weapons for national defense and china is no doubt watching all of this rather closely projecting the collapse of america s military readiness signaling the perfect storm of circumstances for china to invade the continental united states russia is also watching america burn through its weapon systems russia s take on all this is demonstrated by sputnik news which recently published an article us running out of javelin anti tank missiles to send to ukraine report from that article the united states and its allies have sent up to 17 000 anti tank weapons to ukraine over the past month and a half having transferred about a third of its inventory of javelin missile systems to ukraine the pentagon may be running out of stocks critical for the security of the homeland and possible us wars abroad center for strategic and international studies researcher mark cancian has calculated that same report concludes that replacing those javelin missiles will take 3 4 years with current production averaging about 1 000 javelins a year the pentagon assures that up to 6 480 can be made per year in an emergency however cancian says this production rate would take years to reach given the 32 month delivery time from when a missile is ordered and the time that itâ s delivered â this means that it will take about three or four years to replace the missiles that have been delivered so far if the united states delivers more missiles to ukraine this time to replace extends â he stresses a similar situation exists with stinger anti aircraft missiles which are also being sent to ukraine in large numbers depleting america s stockpiles see the full csis report here us military weapons are outdated and largely ineffective against russia s modern advanced weapon systems the other holy crap factor in all this is the fact that the us military industrial complex due to its corruption laziness and virtue signaling incompetence where many of the qualified cis gendered people were fired and replaced by woke pretenders who play the role of victims is utterly incapable of designing new effective weapon systems you know because math is racist america is largely churning out the same outdated designed from decades ago with no design improvements whatsoever idiocracy is now ruling the us military why do f 35 fighter aircraft keep falling out of the sky why do us navy ships lose all controls and drift at sea why are us soldiers thrust into conflicts with sub par equipment that barely functions the answer is because the pentagon is far more concerned with being gay and transgender than being prepared to defend america the woke mentality has transformed the leadership of the us armed forces into libturd soy boy snowflakes who have forgotten the entire reason for their very existence they want the military to be a wokeified social experiment rather than an effective fighting force this is why america is terrified to actually face off against russian forces in ukraine russia has already established near total air superiority in ukraine russia s artillery equipment is far more modern and effective than is america s as the russian systems have a much faster fire cycling rate and far more accurate targeting of where the shells actually hit russia s hypersonic missiles can t be stopped by anything from the usa or nato which means russia can strike targets at will and there s nothing nato can do to stop it now russia s new sarmat 2 icbm system which can carry up to 15 independent re entry vehicles mirv units some of which can include hypersonic glide vehicles that evade every anti air defense system the usa has in its inventory and then there s russia s s 500 anti aircraft defense systems these systems are so advanced and effective that they can shoot down aircraft low earth orbit satellites cruise missiles and hypersonic missiles america and nato have nothing that even comes close to the s 500 in effect america cannot defeat russia in a war this is becoming rather obvious in ukraine where us intelligence us weapons and us satellite systems are running the entire theater of operations for the ukrainians yet the ukraine military is still getting stomped russia is just weeks away from a decisive victory in the donbas region and there s absolutely nothing any nato country can do to stop them short of launching nuclear weapons it turns out that america s priorities have led this nation down the path of self destruction instead of building a military as a capable fighting force the pentagon is far more concerned with organizing gay helicopter crews and paying for the transgender sex change surgeries of active duty soldiers the insanity has reached the point of mass dysfunction even clinical insanity our pentagon is now run by mentally ill lunatics who will get american soldiers slaughtered on the battlefield when there s an actual war with russia which seems to be coming get the full story on all this in today s situation update podcast brighteon com 6d3e4d16 3cb9 40e3 a476

toronto april 20 2022 prnewswire led by the shareholder association of research and education share a group of investors representing us 2 7 trillion in assets under management is urging meta platforms shareholders to support moves to establish an independent board of directors and address long standing governance and oversight gaps at the company by determining what content people see on their social media feeds meta the parent company of facebook and instagram wields outsized influence if left unchecked this influence will continue to have significant impacts on the welfare of users the stability of society and the long term position of the company with this in mind a group of shareholders has written to meta board members calling on fundamental reforms to the governance of the company they say these reforms are needed to protect shareholders rights and safeguard the company and its investors from increasing financial regulatory legal and reputational risks considering the myriad risks meta platforms is facing the board of directors must establish an effective system of accountability and oversight to protect users welfare and shareholders long term value said sarah couturier tanoh manager of shareholder advocacy at share this starts by nominating truly independent directors and implementing the right governance reforms before regulators are required to step in meta claims its board committees are composed entirely of independent directors but the group has called this into question in a public challenge filed with the us securities exchange commission the group notes that board member marc andreessen was sued in 2016 for allegedly assisting meta ceo mark zuckerberg to implement a stock structure that gave him even more power board member peggy a alford was appointed just two years after being hired as chief financial officer and head of operations for the chan zuckerberg initiative mr zuckerberg s personal charity the shareholders asked the board not to re nominate marc andreessen and peggy a alford as directors in a letter sent privately to the board chair in march their letter stated that these two board members along with additional departing member peter thiel should be replaced by three new highly qualified independent directors mr andreessen and ms alford however were re nominated by the company director independence ensures the board represents the interests of all shareholders not entrenched management we urge all shareholders to withhold their votes from mr andreessen and ms alford said anthony schein director of shareholder advocacy at share the letter also proposed to separate the role of ceo and board chair both of which are currently occupied by mark zuckerberg a combined chair and ceo role weakens the key checks and balances of sound corporate governance given the lack of board independence as well as mounting regulatory and public scrutiny of the company this arrangement is particularly imprudent it is the ceo s role to run the company and it is the board chair s role to provide independent oversight of the ceo said illinois state treasurer michael frerichs there is an inherent conflict of interest when the same person occupies both roles finally this group of shareholders is asking the meta board to do away with its dual class share structure that sees one class of shares having greater control and voting rights than the class of shares offered to the general public under this existing structure mark zuckerberg owns only 14 of meta shares but controls 58 of the company s voting shares a shareholder proposal filed in 2020 requested the board of directors eliminate this dual class structure this request received 88 2 support from independent shareholders ironically the existing dual class structure of meta allowed the board to ignore these voters given the company s response to recent controversies and its inaction to implement widely supported governance related proposals we are not confident that the current governance structure serves the long term interests of the company or its stakeholders including investors said caroline boden director of shareholder advocacy at mercy investment services implementing the responsible governance best practices outlined in the letter would be a step in the right direction to ensuring that meta is equipped to assess prevent and mitigate risks now and into the future as a shareholder storebrand asset management believes that meta platforms must strengthen their accountability and adopt the best corporate governance practices this will allow the company to better address various challenges not least with respect to human rights and users data privacy risk meta needs a governance reform to develop a path forward that builds trust with users and society at large said from kamil zabielski head of sustainable investment at storebrand asset management meta has such an outsized influence on societies globally through its platforms said judy byron op northwest coalition for responsible investment the effects of poor governance gaps in accountability and irresponsible behavior will be felt well outside the four walls of the company michael connor executive director of open mic a nonprofit organization that works with shareholders on tech accountability issues said meta s track record on so

april 20 2022 the california medical association cma filed an amicus brief in the u s district court for the northern district of california in a case that will shape the boundaries of california s prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine known as the corporate bar the corporate bar is a broad and robust law that touches on nearly every aspect of the delivery of medical care by physicians and other licensed professionals it springs from a fundamental public policy to protect and preserve the independence of physicians professional judgment in the care of their patients free from external forces that can interfere with the physician patient relationship the allegations in this case american academy of emergency medicine physician group aaempg v envision healthcare corp touch on a different burgeoning area of corporate bar enforcement because california law permits medical corporations to practice medicine only if physicians have a controlling ownership interest there are massive efforts in the industry for lay entities such as envision to align with the physician owners of such medical corporations such friendly medical corporation arrangements are common and in many cases can be desirable because they enable medical corporations to access and take advantage of needed capital and market resources however in some instances the friendly alignment between a lay entity and a medical corporation can cross over into prohibited territory wherein the lay entity gains undue influence or control over the medical corporation aaempg filed a lawsuit against envision alleging that it violated california laws barring corporations from practicing medicine when it took over staffing of the emergency department at placentia linda hospital in august the suit alleges that various policies or practices by envision have direct and indirect effects on physicians and the way they deliver medical care aaempg also alleges that envision gains influence or control over medical corporations that deliver medical care through placement of its executives in officer and director positions on those medical corporations or through stock holding and transfer restrictions on the physicians that own the corporations cma s amicus brief sought to provide the court with a thorough picture of how envision s business model threatens not just the physicians involved in the lawsuit but if left unchecked could provide a roadmap for corporate entities to similarly disempower physicians in every corner of the state the brief provided historical and systemic context to the corporate bar that is essential to the court s understanding of the importance of this issue for the health care landscape in california the importance of cma s voice on this complex issue was underscored by the court s rare acceptance of an amicus brief at the federal district court level for more details see cma s brief here

photo credit pathdoc shutterstock while much of the economy has fared better than expected during the covid 19 pandemic racial and ethnic minorities have faced enormous challenges over the past two years entering the pandemic non white households were more likely to be poor and to work in professions that would increase their risk of exposure to covid 19 and their risk of unemployment during the pandemic when covid 19 hit non white households faced greater economic hardship with less certainty about their ability to pay for essential expenses like food and housing now with inflation on the rise prices for food energy transportation and housing are taking a disparate toll on non white households a recent wall street journal poll found that 35 of minority respondents were experiencing inflationary pain compared to 28 of white respondents these conditions have combined to make it more difficult for racial and ethnic minorities to keep up with major household expenses one of the most significant of those expenses is rent according to survey data from the u s census bureau racial and ethnic minority renters have struggled much more than their white counterparts to keep up with their regular rent payments minorities were around twice as likely to report being behind on rent payments as white renters over the second half of 2021 and beginning of 2022 around one in five minority renters reported being behind on payments compared to just one in 10 white renters these disparities are also apparent in different groups confidence in their ability to pay rent in recent months 38 8 of white renters have expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to pay rent compared to 46 5 of asian renters 62 8 of black renters and 62 9 of hispanic or latino renters but there are also gaps between racial and ethnic minority categories in terms of ability to pay rent despite having similar rates of confidence in the ability to pay rent 25 6 of black renters are behind on payments compared to 18 9 of hispanic or latino renters interestingly minority groups struggles with rent vary substantially across states some states with small non white populations like vermont utah and west virginia have lower shares of minorities behind on rent payments but more diverse states like arizona and nevada also have fairly low figures and the list of states with the most minority renters behind on rent includes both lower cost states like louisiana and wyoming and expensive states like new york at the metro level however diverse cities with higher housing costs appear to be areas where minority renters are most at risk of falling behind on their payments this could quickly become a widespread crisis in many cities with high populations of renters especially from minority backgrounds for example nearly one in three minority renters was behind on rent payments in 2021 in new york city a location with one of the highest shares of renters of any city and where minorities are much more likely to rent than white residents in new york and other cities where minority renters are struggling hundreds of thousands of residents could be at risk of losing their housing the data used in this analysis is from the u s census bureau s household pulse survey to determine the locations with the most minorities behind on their rent researchers at construction coverage calculated the share of minority renters who were not current on their payments in the second half of 2021 for all available u s metropolitan areas and states minority renters were those defined as not non hispanic white here are the major u s metropolitan areas with the most minorities behind on their rent major metros with the most minorities behind on rent photo credit harold

three months ended march 31 2022 net interest income was 6 0 million an increase of 664 thousand or 12 5 from the quarter ended march 31 2021 the increase in net interest income was primarily due to an increase in the interest income on investments and a decrease in interest expense on deposits and borrowings partially offset by a decrease in interest income on loans we improved our asset mix by utilizing some of the excess cash on our statement of financial condition to purchase high quality investments resulting in an increase in the average balance and yield on investments we also originated 25 2 million of new loans including 20 7 million of commercial loans that were offset by significant payoffs primarily in the residential portfolio in addition we experienced a 310 thousand

41 1 from the three months ended march 31 2021 the decrease was primarily due to a 160 thousand net gain on sale of other real estate owned during the three months ended march 31 2021 and a 236 thousand unrealized loss on equity securities recorded during the three months ended march 31 2022 these decreases to non interest income were partially offset by a 149 thousand increase in earnings

months ended march 31 2022 non interest expense totaled 5 3 million an increase of 805 thousand or 17 9 from the three months ended march 31 2021 the increase in non interest expense was primarily due

toronto april 20 2022 prnewswire led by the shareholder association of research and education share a group of investors representing us 2 7 trillion in assets under management is urging meta platforms shareholders to support moves to establish an independent board of directors and address long standing governance and oversight gaps at the company by determining what content people see on their social media feeds meta the parent company of facebook and instagram wields outsized influence if left unchecked this influence will continue to have significant impacts on the welfare of users the stability of society and the long term position of the company with this in mind a group of shareholders has written to meta board members calling on fundamental reforms to the governance of the company they say these reforms are needed to protect shareholders rights and safeguard the company and its investors from increasing financial regulatory legal and reputational risks considering the myriad risks meta platforms is facing the board of directors must establish an effective system of accountability and oversight to protect users welfare and shareholders long term value said sarah couturier tanoh manager of shareholder advocacy at share this starts by nominating truly independent directors and implementing the right governance reforms before regulators are required to step in meta claims its board committees are composed entirely of independent directors but the group has called this into question in a public challenge filed with the us securities exchange commission the group notes that board member marc andreessen was sued in 2016 for allegedly assisting meta ceo mark zuckerberg to implement a stock structure that gave him even more power board member peggy a alford was appointed just two years after being hired as chief financial officer and head of operations for the chan zuckerberg initiative mr zuckerberg s personal charity the shareholders asked the board not to re nominate marc andreessen and peggy a alford as directors in a letter sent privately to the board chair in march their letter stated that these two board members along with additional departing member peter thiel should be replaced by three new highly qualified independent directors mr andreessen and ms alford however were re nominated by the company director independence ensures the board represents the interests of all shareholders not entrenched management we urge all shareholders to withhold their votes from mr andreessen and ms alford said anthony schein director of shareholder advocacy at share the letter also proposed to separate the role of ceo and board chair both of which are currently occupied by mark zuckerberg a combined chair and ceo role weakens the key checks and balances of sound corporate governance given the lack of board independence as well as mounting regulatory and public scrutiny of the company this arrangement is particularly imprudent it is the ceo s role to run the company and it is the board chair s role to provide independent oversight of the ceo said illinois state treasurer michael frerichs there is an inherent conflict of interest when the same person occupies both roles finally this group of shareholders is asking the meta board to do away with its dual class share structure that sees one class of shares having greater control and voting rights than the class of shares offered to the general public under this existing structure mark zuckerberg owns only 14 of meta shares but controls 58 of the company s voting shares a shareholder proposal filed in 2020 requested the board of directors eliminate this dual class structure this request received 88 2 support from independent shareholders ironically the existing dual class structure of meta allowed the board to ignore these voters given the company s response to recent controversies and its inaction to implement widely supported governance related proposals we are not confident that the current governance structure serves the long term interests of the company or its stakeholders including investors said caroline boden director of shareholder advocacy at mercy investment services implementing the responsible governance best practices outlined in the letter would be a step in the right direction to ensuring that meta is equipped to assess prevent and mitigate risks now and into the future as a shareholder storebrand asset management believes that meta platforms must strengthen their accountability and adopt the best corporate governance practices this will allow the company to better address various challenges not least with respect to human rights and users data privacy risk meta needs a governance reform to develop a path forward that builds trust with users and society at large said from kamil zabielski head of sustainable investment at storebrand asset management meta has such an outsized influence on societies globally through its platforms said judy byron op northwest coalition for responsible investment the effects of poor governance gaps in accountability and irresponsible behavior will be felt well outside the four walls of the company michael connor executive director of open mic a nonprofit organization that works with shareholders on tech accountability issues said meta s track record on so many critical governance and social issues is appalling the company would be well advised to listen and listen hard to the excellent advice these shareholders offer about share share is a leader in

interest income the company s net interest margin contracted from 3 16 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 to 3 10 for the quarter ended march 31 2022 the decrease was the result of earning assets

value of junior subordinated debentures trups of 999 000 was recorded compared to a loss of 1 033 000 for the same period in 2021 the change in the fair value of trups reflected in noninterest income

offs totaled 61 000 for the quarter ended march 31 2022 as compared to net loan charge offs of 348 000 for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the reduced provision recorded during the quarter is attributed to lower net charge offs decreases in nonperforming assets and lower loan portfolio growth rate partially offset by a qualitative adjustment for economic uncertainty resulting in an increase in required reserves the qualitative adjustment is attributed to higher inflation anticipated magnitude of interest rate hikes in 2022 and 2023 and the increased likelihood of a recession for the quarter ended march 31 2021 the provision recorded was attributed to growth of the loan portfolio and net charge offs recognized in the student loan portfolio the company s allowance for loan loss totaled 1 06 of the loan portfolio at march 31 2022 compared to 1 07 at december 31 2021 the decrease in the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross loans is primarily the result of a change in loan mix resulting from purchases of residential mortgage loans during the first quarter the reserve required on the residential mortgage loan segment is lower than reserves required for

with a little help from sen jon tester in the form of 150 000 in american rescue plan act funds a band of local ranchers intends to rustle a larger share of the cattle market away from the nation s four major meat packing companies during a press conference at the downtown helena office of old salt co op llc tester touted the contribution of federal dollars to the private business comprised of five founders across three montana ranches as a way to inject more competition into the industry expand markets for montana ranchers and open up opportunities for montana consumers to eat some of the best meat in the world the u s department of agriculture reported in 2018 that four companies cargill and tyson foods and brazillian companies national beef packing co and jbs sa accounted for about 85 of all cuts of beef bought and sold in country that year that s not competition tester said that is a situation where you can have four people literally go out on a golf course and determine what they re gonna charge the consumer tester noted the heightened visibility of the issue exacerbated by the global pandemic and covid related closures of large meat packing plants that drove up costs it s a system by the way that hasn t worked and it hasn t worked for a hundred years he said one way in which those companies maintain a stranglehold on the cattle market is with their large scale meat processing capabilities old salt plans to use the arpa funds to help with a proposed 6 million expansion of the business into the processing side of the industry president cole mannix said in an interview april 6 that his family began ranching in the blackfoot valley in the middle of the 19th century mannix has no official involvement in the day to day operations of mannix beef other than as head of old salt the one time cooperative turned corporation the family help found the partnering ranches sieben live stock company in cascade county j bar l ranch in sweet grass county and mannix beef in nearby powell county opened old salt outpost inside last chance gulch s gold bar in october mannix said the unassuming burger joint serves as a great way to introduce the old salt brand to the local market but more importantly establishes a direct connection to local consumers and their wallets if the company is able to follow through with its plan to build a meat processing plant nearby mannix said it would be much better positioned to market cuts of home grown beef to montanans at prices that can compete with the grocery store chains we d like to control our own destiny a little bit better he said during wednesday s press conference to do that to build relationships with customers we have a chance of actually knowing and who have a chance of actually knowing the landscapes where this food is coming from we need processing so that we can have confidence in the quality of the product and so that we can just you know get enough margin to operate a successful company while coronavirus aid relief and economic security act dollars were meant to prop up businesses pummeled by the pandemic tester said these arpa dollars coming directly from the federal government are intended to get the economy going again there is an absolute demand for more competition in the marketplace and part of that is making sure we can allow the little guys to grow and get bigger and be able to compete he said he said forthcoming senate bills will help ensure that once smaller outfits like old salt obtain a larger share of the market the big guys can t come in and undercut em and put em out of business one such bill the cattle market transparency act of 2021 tester said would install a special investigator within the department of agriculture to make sure the big guys are much more transparent with what they re doing he said both that bill and the cattle price discovery and transparency act also first introduced last year are set for a senate committee hearing next week tester said he is confident both will see the light of day based on recent vote counts senate majority leader chuck schumer has offered me a vote on the special investigator bill he said the spot pricing bill is the second one and i think they re going to be connected and we ll get them both i think they re both important for the folks in production agriculture meanwhile the local little guys are growing mannix said at least two more montana ranches will join the old salt fold in the coming months in total 30 montana businesses including 17 meat processing projects will be partially funded through this wave of arpa dollars

financial year comes from three fundamental factors according to parekh we ran a very successful strategy over the last four years and now we are embarking on a strategy to support the next several years he said infosys gained momentum in recent years on the back of its cloud based services and digital deals amid intense competition for the digital pie of clients businesses its focus on this space helped during the pandemic when businesses were forced to adopt work from anywhere the share of digital in overall revenue stood at 59 2 at the end of fiscal 2022 up from 26 8 in fiscal year 2018 the number of clients with contracts worth 100 million and above increased to 38 as of march from 20 at the end of the financial year ending 2018 infosys is the winner of the company of the year in the et awards for corporate excellence 2022 last week the 87 billion dollar company exceeded market expectations with its revenue guidance for the fiscal on the back of strong demand for technology services according to parekh the geopolitical uncertainties have not impacted the demand environment and infosys large clients across north america and europe continue to have discussions on cloud based large transformation deals however the company s forecast of operating margins in the range of 21 23 disappointed the street which expects larger rival tata consultancy services to declare margins of between 26 28 tcs does not offer a forecast of its revenue and earnings pointing out that with resumption of business travel and a partial return to office the company has had to factor these costs into its guidance parekh said the key to all this is making sure that our capabilities are at the forefront and making sure that employees are well looked after and then being realistic about what is going to happen in the last financial year infosys recorded unprecedented levels of attrition at 27 7 much higher than 17 4 for tcs while even smaller rivals like mindtree and lti have reported lower numbers parekh said the company has now started rolling out its annual wage hikes with effect from april and is also working on something actively to stem the steep rise in the heightened attrition he did not provide a range in which salary hikes will be given out only saying that details of the new initiatives will be revealed later on the other hand tcs has said that it will offer hikes equal to or above the ranges of 6 8 offered in fy22 because we ve seen a decline of five points in attrition in this q4 we believe that things will start to look better in the coming quarters said parekh the company hired over 85 000 freshers last fiscal and expects to bring in about 50 000 freshers in the current financial year as we go through the year we will see how the demand is and we will make adjustments to college graduate hiring parekh added responding to the complaint by a pune based labour union nascent information technology employees senate on the non compete agreement clause in infosys employment contracts parekh said the practice has been in vogue for quite a long time now and its main objective is to protect the intellectual property and other business interests of clients our employees will work with other companies as and when they choose to so that is not the constraint from our perspective at all he said et reported on tuesday that the labour union has raised a complaint against the company with the central labour ministry about a clause in offer letters that prevents them from accepting job offers from specific competitors infosys s deal wins at 9 5 billion large deal total contract value for the 2022 fiscal were 33 lower than the previous year however parekh said this year with 40 net new deals for fy22 and 48 net new deals for the quarter march quarter the company has good visibility on the deal pipeline whether it s the one above 100 million or above 50 million they have significantly gone up over the last several years and that is an approach that shows that our clients have more and more confidence in giving us different types of work not just one he added noting that while wage inflation has an immediate impact compared to price hikes clients are factoring in these concerns during pricing discussions our view is that over time the balance comes back and that s why we are quite comfortable that we will remain a high margin business he said throwing light on the company s approach to government projects after its fractious engagement on the income tax portal parekh said that over seven crore returns have been filed on the portal a large number of returns have been processed and a large number of refunds have already been made over one crore statutory forms have been filled out he pointed out today there is a tremendous amount of progress working jointly with the department our approach remains very much the same which is to support the digital agenda for the government parekh said that over the last four years there has been tremendous stability within the company with industry leading growth and its one infosys strategy having worked well so at this stage we plan no organizational element changes said the infosys ceo

the charts and the history as interpreted by larry williams suggest one crazy thing which is that inflation could soon peak and the stock market s bottoming and due for a nice broad rally given from here to the end of june the mad money host said this methodology can t tell you the size of a potential move but it s surprisingly reliable when it comes to predicting the market s overall direction he added cnbc s jim cramer on wednesday said inflation could peak and the market could recover soon leaning on chart analysis from legendary market technician larry williams the charts and the history as interpreted by larry williams suggest one crazy thing which is that inflation could soon peak and then the second crazy thing which is the stock market s bottoming and due for a nice broad rally given from here to the end of june given his track record though it wouldn t surprise me if he s right on both the mad money host said get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters of course his forecast also suggests we ll get a pullback going into august with stocks rebounding again as we approach the end of the summer he added this methodology can t tell you the size of a potential move but it s surprisingly reliable when it comes to predicting the market s overall direction to explain william s methodology cramer first explained that according to the technician there are two ways of approaching inflation sticky consumer price index this measures the cost of a basket of important items that change price slowly this measures the cost of a basket of important items that change price slowly flexible consumer price index this measures the cost of a basket of important items that change price rapidly in the chart below the sticky price cpi is in orange while the flexible price cpi is in black williams noticed that the flexible cpi is at a record high and in the zone where inflation usually peaks cramer said the below chart shows the three month rate of change for the core flexible cpi in black with the 12 month rate of change in brown going back to 2016 the flexible consumer price index is often a reliable leading indicator for the sticky consumer price index according to williams cramer said meaning that after flexible goods prices start climbing stickier goods start catching up this chart shows the flexible price cpi peaked last year this tells larry that we might already be turning the corner on inflation it s just not obvious to anyone on the surface yet cramer said also noteworthy is that inflation has historically stayed above 2 5 for about 29 months on average before dropping according to williams inflation has held above 2 5 for 14 months meaning we might already be halfway through cramer said williams also observed that the cpi has a dominant five year cycle which suggests that it should peak around the middle of this year and keep tumbling through 2025 cramer said here is the chart showing the cycle the advance decline line a cumulative indicator measuring the number of stocks that are increasing daily compared to the number of stocks that are decreasing is yet another tool williams uses cramer said williams sees it as a terrific way to get a real sense of the stock market s internal strength but he also likes to use the advance decline line to make cyclical projections cramer said if you can get a sense of where the advance decline line might be headed then you ll know when broad based rallies or declines are most likely to occur for williams this is a more stable way to take the temperature of the market than looking at a particular index he added here is a chart of the advance decline line going back to may 2021 williams cyclical forecast is in red as he sees it the dominant short term cycle in the advance decline line has lasted for about 60 days although there s also a yearly cycle of about 240 days the red line here combines both of those cycles to give us a forecast cramer said he added that the forecast suggests to williams that it s time for the advance decline line to go higher which would mean a major broad based rally in the stock market that could carry into may and possibly into the end of june sign up now for the cnbc investing club to follow jim cramer s every move in the market disclaimer questions for cramer call cramer 1 800 743 cnbc want to take a deep dive into cramer s world hit him up mad money twitter jim cramer twitter facebook instagram questions comments suggestions for the mad money website madcap cnbc com

article continues below this ad jeff mikula manistee director of the department explained more about the item in the budget mikula said that was actually two separate requests that we had two years ago one was to upgrade both the men s and women s bathrooms at the public works he said that facility is 50 years old and all those fixtures are 50 years old so our staff has already repainted everything and done everything internally that we can this would have been for new fixtures sinks faucets toilets partitions we had a separate request for all the flooring in the offices and in the bathrooms he noted the flooring items and the repairs in the bathrooms were combined into one item on the city budget those are kind of combined together to get that 35 000 total but if you walk in our office as you can see painting them feel so good anymore they re peeling and pulling off the floor and so that was the extent of the two projects mikula said advertisement article continues below this ad city budget ed bradford made changes that were previously requested by council members at the april 12 work session those items included a freeze on a 0 5 mil refuse millage increase for pfas

offset that we ll be taking 2022 marijuana proceeds from the excise tax of the michigan regulation and taxation of marihuana act and putting that towards the amount of revenue that would have been lost in the water and sewer fund bradford said that would be 45 000 of water and about 108 000 for the sewer last year he said we would then restrict 100 000 of the remaining marijuana proceeds are used towards the future pfas expenses which is about the same amount of money as the 0 5 mil raise bradford said the optional budget discussion scheduled for april 26 was waived the budget is expected to be formally accepted at the next manistee city council meeting at 7 p m at council chambers at city hall on may 3
u s women own just 32 cents in financial assets on the dollar compared to men so when women make mistakes with their money they often feel the impact more significantly than men do according to sallie krawcheck co founder and ceo of ellevest a digital investment platform for women that recently raised 53 million in series b funding with women representing two thirds of its investors on a relative basis women have less money than men said krawcheck who was the former head of bank of america s global wealth and investment management and was frequently referred to as the most powerful woman on wall street the disparity is due to many factors from the gender pay gap women earn 83 cents on the dollar compared to men to different investment approaches for example men tend to have a higher risk tolerance when it comes to investing in contrast women are more attracted to goal based investing and investing to make a positive impact that s great explained krawcheck but it can also mean women simply aren t as confident making decisions about where to put their money krawcheck has made her share of money mistakes in the past too and she hopes other women can avoid her missteps on their own financial journeys once you ve had the kind of can t believe i had it career that i ve had and see that women stuck in marriages because they don t have enough money to leave and stuck in jobs that aren t fulfilling you know that you need to apply your experience and find a way to be part of the solution krawcheck said here s what krawcheck has learned 1 don t outsource the management of your money to your spouse despite krawcheck s career on wall street right out of college she left the management of her family finances to her husband when she was in her early 20s the couple took on traditional gender roles where he oversaw their money and she was in charge of putting dinner on the table and planning their social calendar that worked for awhile until her first marriage ended in a divorce and she realized she had a lot less money saved than she thought i discovered my then husband was having an affair with my now ex friend and it was the worst week of my life krawcheck said on top of it all i had to find out how much money i had and i couldn t even trust the person who had been managing it krawcheck s advice is to get involved in your finances know what s in your bank accounts and your retirement accounts discuss your short and long term financial goals and review them periodically at the very least make sure you re keeping an eye on your retirement money and if you re working that you re making deposits and getting the company match krawcheck said stay engaged in your finances together and don t leave it all up to your partner 2 never accept a job offer on a handshake in her 40s krawcheck was offered what seemed like a dream job at a prestigious bank but there was only one problem there wasn t a contract the company s management and hr department discussed krawcheck s compensation bonuses and benefits and they made a deal on a handshake then just a couple months later the ceo left the company and there was no written record of the bonuses and other benefits that krawcheck was promised over the years her bonuses diminished in value due to company losses and the stock shares that she bought to demonstrate her commitment to the company also went down i joke that i basically paid to work there krawcheck said in hindsight krawcheck knows that she should have listened to her gut instinct when she had her doubts and should have requested the job offer in writing 3 when seeking funding pitch the right people if you find yourself on an entrepreneurial path at some point in your career and seek out investors for funding it s important that you learn your audience and intentionally seek them out krawcheck advised she learned that lesson the hard way spending too much time pitching the wrong people in the case of raising funding for ellevest krawcheck admitted that she wasted too much time trying to convince people that share a different world view about why it s so important to equip more women with the right tools that will lead them to financial wealth you just can t get over a lifetime of internalized biases and points of view in a one hour meeting krawcheck said instead find your people and speak to them even if it seems unconventional or different krawcheck found most of the support for funding from women who understood first hand how important ellevest s mission is and why they should get behind it we took an unconventional approach for an unconventional company krawcheck said

interest rates and yields tables in this release non interest income for the quarter ended march 31 2022 non interest income decreased 560 000 to 9 2 million when compared to the quarter ended march 31 2021 primarily as a result of the following items net gains on loan sales net gains on loan sales decreased 1 6 million compared to the prior year quarter the decrease was due to a decrease in originations of fixed rate single family mortgage loans during the 2022 period compared to the 2021 period fixed rate single family mortgage loans originated are generally subsequently sold in the secondary market these loan originations increased substantially when market interest rates decreased to historically low levels in 2020 and 2021 as a result of the significant volume of refinance activity in 2020 and 2021 and as market interest rates have moved higher in the first quarter of 2022 mortgage refinance volume has decreased and loan originations and related gains on sales of these loans have decreased substantially net gains on loan sales decreased 1 6 million compared to the prior year quarter the decrease was due to a decrease in originations of fixed rate single family

of sale and atm fees point of sale and atm fees increased 606 000 compared to the prior year period this increase was almost entirely due to increased customer debit card transactions in the 2022

increase related to normal annual merit increases in various lending and operations areas in 2022 many of these increases were larger than in previous years due to the current employment environment in addition the new phoenix loan office was opened in the first quarter of 2022 lastly certain loan origination compensation costs were deferred under accounting standards in the 2021 period that

for the quarter ended march 31 2022 was 59 62 compared to 56 33 for the same quarter in 2021 in the three months ended march 31 2022 the higher efficiency ratio was primarily due to an increase in non

ended march 31 2022 decreased 121 8 million or 2 2 compared to the three months ended march 31 2021 primarily due to a decrease in net loans receivable partially offset by increases in investment

were at or below the statutory federal tax rate of 21 due primarily to the utilization of certain investment tax credits and to tax exempt investments and tax exempt loans which reduced the company s effective tax rate the company s effective tax rate may fluctuate in future periods as it is impacted by the level and timing of the company s utilization of tax credits the level of tax exempt investments and loans the amount of taxable income in various state jurisdictions and the overall level of pre tax income state tax expense estimates evolved throughout 2021 as taxable income and

photo credit pathdoc shutterstock while much of the economy has fared better than expected during the covid 19 pandemic racial and ethnic minorities have faced enormous challenges over the past two years entering the pandemic non white households were more likely to be poor and to work in professions that would increase their risk of exposure to covid 19 and their risk of unemployment during the pandemic when covid 19 hit non white households faced greater economic hardship with less certainty about their ability to pay for essential expenses like food and housing now with inflation on the rise prices for food energy transportation and housing are taking a disparate toll on non white households a recent wall street journal poll found that 35 of minority respondents were experiencing inflationary pain compared to 28 of white respondents these conditions have combined to make it more difficult for racial and ethnic minorities to keep up with major household expenses one of the most significant of those expenses is rent according to survey data from the u s census bureau racial and ethnic minority renters have struggled much more than their white counterparts to keep up with their regular rent payments minorities were around twice as likely to report being behind on rent payments as white renters over the second half of 2021 and beginning of 2022 around one in five minority renters reported being behind on payments compared to just one in 10 white renters these disparities are also apparent in different groups confidence in their ability to pay rent in recent months 38 8 of white renters have expressed a lack of confidence in their ability to pay rent compared to 46 5 of asian renters 62 8 of black renters and 62 9 of hispanic or latino renters but there are also gaps between racial and ethnic minority categories in terms of ability to pay rent despite having similar rates of confidence in the ability to pay rent 25 6 of black renters are behind on payments compared to 18 9 of hispanic or latino renters interestingly minority groups struggles with rent vary substantially across states some states with small non white populations like vermont utah and west virginia have lower shares of minorities behind on rent payments but more diverse states like arizona and nevada also have fairly low figures and the list of states with the most minority renters behind on rent includes both lower cost states like louisiana and wyoming and expensive states like new york at the metro level however diverse cities with higher housing costs appear to be areas where minority renters are most at risk of falling behind on their payments this could quickly become a widespread crisis in many cities with high populations of renters especially from minority backgrounds for example nearly one in three minority renters was behind on rent payments in 2021 in new york city a location with one of the highest shares of renters of any city and where minorities are much more likely to rent than white residents in new york and other cities where minority renters are struggling hundreds of thousands of residents could be at risk of losing their housing the data used in this analysis is from the u s census bureau s household pulse survey to determine the locations with the most minorities behind on their rent researchers at construction coverage calculated the share of minority renters who were not current on their payments in the second half of 2021 for all available u s metropolitan areas and states minority renters were those

integration of propx logistics and software solutions improved frac operations in the first quarter liberty wireline completed the longest ever lateral length and deepest measured depth well onshore in north america multiple operational pumping records including 75 hours of continuous plug and perf pump time we entered 2022 with the right people asset base and strategy to execute in a tightening frac market and we are pleased to deliver strong first quarter results this quarter demonstrated the benefits of our vertical integration strategy as we successfully navigated an operationally challenging environment commented chris wright chief executive officer last year we expanded our services to include wireline and became a major sand producer obtaining two large mines in the permian basin we enhanced our technological advantages through the acquisition of propx with wet sand handling and industry leading last mile proppant delivery solutions together with our ongoing development of digifrac electric fleets these advancements provide customers with differential frac services the integration of our acquisitions in 2021 came at a short term financial cost but these actions are already paying significant dividends in 2022 liberty revenue increased 16 sequentially as we leveraged our vertically integrated portfolio to better mitigate the early quarter impacts of sand and logistics challenges notably in the permian basin we are encouraged by the progress we ve made in the first quarter looking ahead our collaborative approach with our customers and continued investment in innovation positions us well for the future continued mr wright outlook restrained global investment since the last oil and gas downturn has led to supply challenges at a time where worldwide demand for energy is growing and expected to surpass pre pandemic levels in 2022 relatively low and declining oil and gas inventories have led to persistent upward pressure on commodity prices even prior to the russian invasion of ukraine although russian export volumes of oil and gas have been only modestly impacted so far uncertainty regarding potential future impacts of sanctions and buyer aversion to russian hydrocarbons presents significant risk to future supply and demand balances the modest below stated plan increases in opec supply and release of global emergency oil reserves are simply not enough to supply a rebounding world economy north american oil and gas are critical in the coming years tight oil and natural gas markets coupled with geopolitical tensions in many key oil and gas producing regions have all eyes on north american supply the north american economy is proving more resilient to today s global challenges in significant part due to a secure supply of natural gas north america is well positioned to be the largest provider of additional oil and gas supply that powers the global economy and enables the modern world the frac services market is seeing robust activity improvement and a tightening of the supply demand balance drilled but uncompleted well inventory has stabilized after a steep continuous decline from pandemic elevated levels available frac capacity is nearing full utilization as demand has increased and supply is limited due to continued equipment attrition labor shortages supply chain constraints and very low investment in recent years as the market tightened last fall our customers recognized that the unfolding recovery would increase the importance of having the highest quality partners able to navigate turbulent times and deliver operational excellence today s operational challenges include labor shortages sand supply tightness and logistics bottlenecks liberty customers are seeing differential execution in this difficult environment in part due to vertical integration from our onestim and propx acquisitions in the second quarter we expect approximately 10 sequential revenue growth driven by increased activity and continued incremental improvement in net service price these factors are expected to drive higher margins in the second quarter partly offset by ongoing inflationary pressures commented mr wright in keeping with our company s expanded scope we are updating our name to liberty energy energy enables everything we do and our passion is to energize the world our many technical innovations and investment in vertical integration sets us up nicely to continue creating additional value for our customers and liberty we continue to invest in the early part of this cycle to grow our competitive advantage and capitalize on strategic opportunities to benefit our shareholders over the long term continued mr wright first quarter results for the first quarter of 2022 revenue increased 16 to 793

management does not consider in assessing ongoing performance our board of directors management investors and lenders use ebitda and adjusted ebitda to assess our financial performance because it allows them to compare our operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of our capital structure such as varying levels of interest expense asset base such as depreciation depletion and amortization and other items that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period we present ebitda and adjusted ebitda because we believe they provide

affecting more than 83 000 people globally cf is a progressive multi organ disease that affects the lungs liver pancreas gi tract sinuses sweat glands and reproductive tract cf is caused by a defective and or missing cftr protein resulting from certain mutations in the cftr gene children must inherit two defective cftr genes one from each parent to have cf and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test while there are many different types of cftr mutations that can cause the disease the vast majority of people with cf have at least one f508del mutation cftr mutations lead to cf by causing cftr protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of cftr protein at the cell surface the defective function and or absence of cftr protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs in the lungs this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick sticky mucus chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients the median age of death is in the early 30s about trikafta elexacaftor tezacaftor ivacaftor and ivacaftor in people with certain types of mutations in the

netflix had their q1 earnings call recently and they re reporting findings they haven t seen in over a decade according to a report via the wrap subscriber numbers were shown to have declined by 200 000 globally in q1 this large netflix subscriber loss is the first time this has happened to the streamer in over a decade this also caused their stock to dip by 20 in a letter that was released to shareholders netflix said streaming is winning over linear as we predicted and netflix titles are very popular globally however our relatively high household penetration when including the large number of households sharing accounts combined with competition is creating revenue growth headwinds the service previously predicted it would gain 2 5 million net subscribers in its first quarter of 2022 but with this reported loss it may see a global paid subscriber loss of two million for the second quarter a reason being cited for the potential loss has been password sharing with people from outside the household netflix has made it clear in the past that they want to crack down on password sharing and it s something that they re not letting up on as they reveal exactly how many households are actually swapping the login information in that same report netflix revealed that about 100 million households are sharing passwords while this has worked out for people who have friends that are willing to share their info it has caused a major problem for the platform because of this they re working on ways to stop password sharing as much as they can we ve always tried to make sharing within a member s household easy with features like profiles and multiple streams while these have been very popular they ve created confusion about when and how netflix can be shared with other households there s a broad range of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing so while we won t be able to monetize all of it right now we believe it s a large short to mid term opportunity netflix has been toying with the idea of monetizing password sharing which means subscribers are given an opportunity to share the platform with other people outside the household for a price they kicked off testing in latin america last month but it still remains to be seen if this will work globally and if it will fix their subscription bleeding what is certain is that netflix is taking these losses seriously and they re going to do whatever it can to get back on an upward trajectory another reason that some are suspecting could be the cause of subscriber erosion is content beyond ryan reynold s the adam project q1 didn t see game changing additions that would get users excited the upcoming season of stranger things and the highly anticipated debut of the sandman were delayed due to covid 19 so that did have some impact on their planned schedule the platform also said that it suffered a 700 000 subscriber loss when it decided to suspend operations in russia due to the war with ukraine what are your thoughts on netflix s q1 losses will stopping password sharing help their bottom line

the 2022 porsche taycan with optional porsche surface coated brakes pscb 2022 porsche cars north america inc porsche offers five distinctly unique variants of its all electric taycan sport sedan these include the taycan taycan 4s taycan gts taycan turbo and taycan turbo s each model has been engineered and configured to deliver a specific level of performance to satisfy a particular niche of consumers over the past couple of years i ve been fortunate to have driven all of the taycan variants at venues in the united states and europe which puts me in a unique position i can authoritatively select the best model so here are my top reasons for naming the standard taycan the best in the model s current lineup the standard taycan is equally as technically advanced and innovative many automakers offer entry level models that are stripped of the premium engineering or technologies but not porsche the standard taycan model shares the identical platform as its more expensive siblings and the same rear power unit and battery architecture as the taycan 4s including a permanent magnet synchronous electric motor and a 600 amp pulse inverter and mirroring the other taycan models the standard taycan features a two speed transaxle to optimize acceleration both around town and on the highway in addition the standard taycan is fitted with porsche active suspension management pasm as standard equipment with adaptive air suspension on the options list i recommend it and in terms of passenger amenities the standard taycan offers porsche connect apple carplay and much more at no additional cost 2022 porsche taycan 2022 porsche cars north america inc the standard taycan offers the best range porsche fits the taycan with a 79 2 kwh battery that may be charged up to 225 kw still i recommend opting for the larger performance battery plus that offers 93 4 kwh of capacity and a faster charging rate of 270 kw it takes 22 minutes to go from 5 percent to 80 percent state of charge when connected to a high speed dc charger also ignore the pessimistic epa range estimates for the taycan with the 93 4 kwh battery as independent expert tests show the vehicle can deliver 280 miles on a full charge and owners are reporting 300 miles of range this is the mileage champ amongst the taycan models the standard taycan is the most aerodynamic slightly narrower tires and a few unique attributes e g the manual charging port door is more aerodynamic than the motorized one make the standard taycan the most aerodynamically efficient production porsche ever offered the drag coefficient is just 0 24 with the stock suspension the optional air suspension drops it to an even sleeker 0 22 cd the excellent aerodynamics lower cabin noise and contribute to its impressive range 2022 porsche taycan passenger cabin 2022 porsche cars north america inc the standard taycan is no slouch porsche reveals that the standard taycan which is rated at up to 402 hp and 254 lb ft of torque is the most powerful base model that the automaker has ever produced that figure jumps up to 469 hp and 263 lb ft of torque when equipped with the optional performance battery plus the 0 60 mph takes a mere 5 1 seconds regardless of battery size while the performance battery plus option delivers more output it also adds more mass and that negates the increase in power and the acceleration is very linear right up to the vehicle s top speed of 143 mph a combustion vehicle with equivalent performance will fall behind in a race above 80 mph the standard taycan has excellent driving dynamics unlike the other taycan models the standard taycan features a single motor on the rear axle meaning it is rear wheel drive eliminating the front power unit removes about 200 pounds of mass from the nose so the standard taycan is a whopping 535 pounds lighter than the taycan turbo s if you want to get technical the performance battery plus adds 170 pounds of mass to the taycan but that weight is added very low on the chassis and between the axles so its effect on handling is minimal all wheel drive vehicles force their front tires to compromise a balance between acceleration turning and braking duties but rear wheel drive vehicles free up the front tires to only focus on direction changes and braking from the driver s seat this feels more responsive and tactile traditional rear wheel drive driving dynamics which allow oversteer to be effortless induced with the accelerator pedal are also more natural for a driving enthusiast and further contributing to its handling prowess is that the taycan has the lowest center of gravity of any road legal porsche the 2022 porsche taycan on angeles crest highway above los angeles 2022 porsche cars north america inc the standard taycan has the most attractive pricing and strongest resale value taycan pricing ranges from about 83 000 standard taycan to 185 000 taycan turbo s a well equipped standard taycan with my recommendations of performance battery plus adaptive air suspension with porsche active suspension management pasm rear axle steer and porsche surface coated brakes pscb and a few conveniences should come in around 110 000 very reasonable considering that turbo s buyers frequently spend double that amount standard porsche models also often have stronger resale value in terms of percentage of original sales prices as the flagship models help to keep their values afloat making the standard porsche taycan a wise purchase for those concerned about depreciation

the biggest default looming in emerging economies is in russia where putin s decision to invade ukraine has brought sanctions economic isolation and a pledge to pay debts only in roubles which would likely be ruled a breach of commitments triggering losses for investors still russia s role as the sanctions hit aggressor make it a unique case which means sri lanka for now is at the vanguard of the potentially broader crisis we can see this train wreck coming towards us former imf executive john lipsky the country s currency is down nearly 40 per cent this year last week it suspended foreign debt payments deciding to use what s left of its reserves to cover food and energy imports rather than pay investors for people like jagath gunasena the crisis has already arrived it s meant sending his wife and son to stand for hours to refill the cooking gas cylinder they need to run their colombo food stall only to see them turned away when supplies run out at least we have leftovers from our food stall to eat gunasena said i don t know how the others will find ways to cook or get by that kind of uncertainty has driven protesters to call for president gotabaya rajapaksa to resign even as his government tries to negotiate help with the imf and asian powers like china and india sri lanka may be the first but it s not alone some 13 emerging countries have bonds trading at least 1 000 basis points above us treasuries up from six a year ago credit default swaps on developing country debt spiked in the first weeks of the ukraine war showing a growing fear of default and while they ve since retreated they re still some 90 basis points above last year s average loading bloomberg economics which keeps scorecards of the building risks for em countries puts turkey and egypt top of the list of major emerging markets exposed to economic and financial spillovers from the ukraine war and it ranks tunisia ethiopia pakistan ghana and el salvador with large debt stocks and borrowing costs that have risen by more than 700 basis points since 2019 among countries in immediate danger of being unable to repay debts start to surface the direct impact of a default in five countries such as these on the global economy would be small but crises in the developing world have a history of spreading well beyond their starting points in a cascade of emerging market credit events the negative impact of the whole could be larger than the sum of the parts wrote ziad daoud bloomberg economics chief em economist the world bank calculates 60 per cent of low income countries are in debt distress already or at high risk of it so far the trouble is brewing in the sort of off the radar screen places investors don t pay much attention to said the bank s chief economist carmen reinhart that doesn t mean it will stay that way reinhart cited the example of ltcm which was bailed out in 1998 due to losses in russia and other emerging markets that wasn t necessarily on anyone s radar screen she said those things start to surface exposures are opaque governments all over the emerging world stepped up their borrowing to cushion the pandemic s impact the cost of servicing those debts is rising on a steep incline according to the imf a record amount of that debt is now held on balance sheets of local banks in emerging economies according to the imf raising the risk of a feedback loop in which banks are forced to pull back on lending as economies slow and the value of the government bonds they own falls which in turn may lead to the sort of economic doom loop that drove russia to default in 1998 and argentina to a similar fate a few years later a disaster the increase in borrowing costs is likely to get steeper still as the fed s efforts to combat inflation at home lead to higher interest rates on us treasuries the benchmark for many developing economies central banks across much of the emerging world are raising their own policy rates too as prices surge jim o neill the former goldman sachs economist who coined the term brics in the early 2000s to describe the then fast growing emerging markets of brazil russia india and china said the current environment is the most uncertain he s seen since he began his career in finance in the early 1980s if we get the inflation risk persisting and central banks have to tighten policy for certain emerging markets it will be a disaster he said one sign of trouble ahead is the lengthening line of countries in rescue talks with the imf along with sri lanka it includes countries with similar balance of payments problems like egypt and tunisia where food prices helped drive regime change just a decade ago and pakistan where high inflation and geopolitical tensions combined to topple premier imran khan this month and where the government is cutting electricity to households and industry because it can t afford to buy coal or natural gas from abroad to fuel its power plants loading in tunisia the cradle of the 2011 arab spring uprisings a cash strapped government has raised fuel prices at least 4 times over the past 13 months tourism has dried up and shortages are spreading to the point where market vendors joke that marijuana is easier to buy than flour raed a 26 year old baker said he can t get enough flour on the black market at prices far above the official subsidised one to keep his shop open the situation is very bad he said so he s decided that once the holy month of ramadan is over he ll join the legions of migrants trying their luck elsewhere in nearby egypt the world s largest wheat importer the disappearance from the market of supplies from russia and ukraine has hit hard last month the central bank let the currency weaken more than 15 per cent in a matter of hours and hiked its benchmark rate for the first time in five years amid an outflow of hard currency president abdel fattah el sisi has urged people to make do with less lavish meals when they break their ramadan fast the government is asking us to ration our consumption but we ve already been doing this said ezzat mohamed who lives in the rural qalyubiya province where stores have begun offering food on credit to be sure many developing nations sell more commodities than they buy and benefit from rising prices they re typically a boon in regions like latin america for example where brazil s real is the world s best performing major currency this year and chile s exports in march were up more than 20 per cent from a year earlier skeletons in the closet robin brooks chief economist at the institute for international finance predicts the fallout from the ukraine war will largely be limited to food and energy importers busts often follow booms and there haven t been many of the latter in an emerging world that s had a rough ride from covid 19 brooks points out by contrast the crises of the 1990s erupted in economies where capital had been pouring in and its abrupt departure revealed flaws in corporate balance sheets even with risks rising because of an increasingly aggressive fed i m not as worried as others about skeletons in the closet he said but if that pandemic backdrop leaves emerging countries less vulnerable to capital outflows the opposite is true when it comes to social tensions that s one reason why it s hard not to see something broader in the political and economic turmoil starting to hit the poorest corners of the global economy oxfam is warning that more than a quarter of a billion people could be pushed into extreme poverty this year latin america s commodity exporters aren t immune from political unrest peru with one of the world s highest covid death rates has been rocked by weeks of violent protests or even a weakening of their external position peru s current account balance swung from a surplus of 0 8 per cent of gdp at the end of 2020 to a deficit of 2 8 per cent a year later in neighbouring colombia and chile deficits widened to around 6 per cent and 7 per cent of gdp respectively in the final quarter of last year foreign investors also own a majority of the sovereign debt in those countries which has ballooned by 10 15 percentage points of gdp over the past two years gavekal research pointed out in a recent note emerging market asset prices including those of commodity exporters may be a lot more vulnerable to swings in the external environment than is currently assumed by investors its economists wrote in brazil less than six months ahead of presidential elections opinion polls show that 75 per cent of the public blames president jair bolsonaro s government for a surging cost of living loading although the country s central bank is months into an aggressive tightening campaign brazil s inflation rate was still 11 3 per cent in march the problem is that as in many parts of the world prices feed off each other and higher fuel costs make food more expensive too said thais zara an economist at lca consultores in sao paulo bolsonaro is using a commodities windfall to expand cash aid to the poor ahead of the election and has pumped us32 billion of credit into the economy but in rio de janeiro s markets the anxiety about what lies ahead remains real maria conceicao loaded up on fish for her family ahead of last weekend s easter celebrations we ll celebrate with fish now but will have less later she said because for conceicao like millions of others in the developing world the grim reality is each month gets worse

prominent chinese neurologist rao yi president of capital medical university in beijing on wednesday criticized the government s decision to ship millions of doses of a traditional chinese herbal cure to shanghai even as the city s captive population struggles to find food and medicine during a grueling coronavirus lockdown rao who lived and studied in the united states for many years but was blacklisted from obtaining a u s visa in the closing days of the obama administration for reasons he says are unclear trenchantly noted the traditional lianhua qingwen cure has no proven effectiveness against chinese coronavirus dispatching of medicines should follow rigorous tests and examinations no fake and shoddy products should be given to the public rao said in a social media post if the efficacy of lianhua qingwen has never been strictly proven the mandatory dispatch would hurt the interests of people in shortage of food and drug necessities he said it should not have happened that a medication with no effect to prevent covid 19 was sent to healthy people it s even more inappropriate to squeeze the logistics capacity for lifeline products a group of medical experts similarly argued in a sunday post on chinese medical website dxy this unusually stern criticism from top chinese doctors threatens to derail a very profitable gravy train lianhua qingwen is an herbal concoction commonly consumed in capsule form that includes honeysuckle licorice root apricot seeds and forsythia it is marketed by a company called shijiazhuang yiling pharmaceutical owned by billionaire wu yiling for hazy reasons having to do with china s push to export its traditional medicines to the rest of the world and probably more than a little good old fashioned corruption lianhua qingwen was granted regulatory approval as a coronavirus medication and endorsed by some influential figures including influential government medical expert zhong nanshan and hong kong chief executive carrie lam zhong incidentally appears to have tumbled off his lofty communist party perch by questioning the regime s dynamic zero covid lockdowns he wrote an english language article about reopening the country to normalize socio economic development and synchronize chinese policy with the rest of the world the article was translated into chinese on monday and deleted by communist censors within a matter of hours there is absolutely no clinical evidence that the herbal remedy is effective at preventing or treating chinese coronavirus infections as worldwide health authorities including the u s food and drug administration pointed out shijiazhuang yiling s share price skyrocketed after the chinese government began pushing lianhua qingwen as a coronavirus medication especially in hong kong which had an exceptionally severe outbreak of the omicron variant demand for the herbal remedy increased to the point that hong kong officials worried people would get sick from buying cheap knockoffs of the concoction that were even worse than useless the pushback against lianhua qingwen received a boost from a popular figure on chinese social media named wang sicong son of real estate tycoon wang jianlin last week the younger wang shared a video questioning the usefulness of the herbal remedy with his 40 million followers on weibo the tightly controlled chinese version of twitter he followed this up with a post calling for a securities fraud investigation of yiling pharmaceutical wang deleted the latter post within an hour having apparently realized it might upset powerful communist party patrons of the pharmaceutical company but it was too late as of tuesday the billionaire s son had been banned from weibo for violation of related laws and regulations wang s now deleted and suppressed criticism was nevertheless potent enough to knock 10 percent off the value of yiling pharmaceutical stock when the shenzhen market opened on monday the ban might also have been prompted by wang s public refusal to submit to coronavirus testing a stance that won him applause as a grassroots hero from chinese citizens subjected to endless rounds of mandatory tests in locked down cities like shanghai on wednesday the skeptical health sciences authority hsa of singapore announced it has begun the first serious clinical trial to determine if lianhua qingwen is effective as a therapeutic for the wuhan coronavirus the study which will ultimately include 300 participants of various ages is intended to determine if the herbal remedy helps reduce several clinical symptoms from mild chinese coronavirus infections hsa previously warned singaporeans there was no evidence that traditional chinese medicine tcm products could be used to prevent or treat chinese coronavirus despite claims to the contrary on social media various agencies of the chinese state have promoted tcm for coronavirus treatment since the early days of the pandemic pushing everything from acupuncture to soup as treatments for chinese coronavirus and its complications beijing even made a show of distributing tcm kits to chinese students living abroad with lianhua qingwen included in the kits questioning the effectiveness of tcm as rao and his colleagues did this week was frowned upon to say the least the tcm industry generates at least 27 billion in annual profits the coronavirus pandemic fueled 70 percent growth in the market over the past five years dictator xi jinping is an outspoken advocate of tcm praising it as a treasure of chinese civilization and ordering chinese doctors to include it alongside western medical treatments the chinese government has long desired approval for tcm as coronavirus therapy from the world health organization w h o in january the chinese national administration of traditional chinese medicine said it presented a report on the effectiveness of tcm to w h o director tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who purportedly accepted it with delight w h o began pushing traditional chinese medicine in april without any hard scientific evidence to back up its recommendations
