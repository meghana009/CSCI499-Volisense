people going over design prints stock photo st george news st george a push to create future commercial design guidelines for a part of washington fields moved forward wednesday with the washington city council s approving to meet with design consultants next month the process to create and adopt a design standard for commercial development has been in the works for the majority of the washington fields area since 2019 the project was delayed due to the pandemic and has since been reduced in scope to the properties surrounding the intersection of 3650 south and washington fields road we ve talked at length about design guidelines for the washington fields area washington city manager jeremy redd said during wednesday s council meeting a reason for the guidelines is to provide a uniform yet aesthetically pleasing design standard that both area stakeholders and city officials can agree moving forward for a time some council members didn t want to approve new commercial development in the fields area until the sought after design standards had finally been presented and approved wednesday s vote which was unanimous among the council clears the way for preliminary work to begin starting in november consultants from the barnes gibson partners architecture firm will meet with the city council members of the city staff and community stakeholders to discuss what the commercial architecture of the targeted area should look like following their visits the consultants will return to their offices and create a plan that can by used in communicating the city s design vision to future commercial developers i m a real big proponent of keeping our heritage alive washington city mayor ken neilson told st george news during a call friday whatever that may mean to anybody else to me it it means we keep our fields looking like the fields where there s commercial property it may be a western look it may be a contemporary look but it needs to reflect on the a little bit on our heritage and on our progressive nature in washington city city council member kurt ivie shared a similar opinion during wednesday s meeting as well as the desire to have more citizen involvement so the public would buy in to the new design guidelines when they rolled out ivie also said he wanted to hear from council members doug ward and kress staheli who were absent at the meeting before moving too far with anything council member craig coats disagreed i think we re already behind in my opinion coats said we need to get moving and then get the council involved with that as well the preliminary steps toward design standards for the 3650 south washington fields road area are estimated to cost the city 25 600 once adopted the design standards will primarily impact the designated area though is expected to have some impact beyond that redd said moving ahead other areas of future commercial development may have their own design guidelines depending on the nature of the area neilson said for example the guidelines for a downtown commercial development will likely have be different from those used for commercial development next to the st george regional airport he said no time table was given on when the new architecture guidelines are expected to be produced in other council business wednesday the mayor declared october to be domestic violence awareness month the council also approved a citywide upgrade related to water metering the city will be moving to what is called ami or advanced metering infrastructure which according to a city document has proven to be a very effective means of conserving water due to the fact that meters are read more frequently which allows for notice to be given of potential leaks and provides the customer with readily available records of their water use under the currently metering system city staff collect data on a monthly basis water use data is also not readily available for water users to check on their own copyright st george news saintgeorgeutah com llc 2021 all rights reserved

backus minn after a quite extraordinary year life in the small town of backus is back to mostly ordinary on a recent weekday the town s main street was quiet a few cars were parked in front of the post office and around the corner by the meat market in the kitchen of the corner store and restaurant on highway 371 cooks loaded plates with fried eggs and hash browns for a handful of diners it s a much different scene from earlier this year during the peak of construction on the line 3 oil pipeline when hundreds of pipeline workers were living and working in the area corner store owner dave sheley said they would start showing up at his convenience store at 5 a m to stock up on food for the workday advertisement we d have people just lined up back all the way to the cooler sometimes he recalled sheley had to open earlier and add staff to help with the morning rush he installed a second coffee pot and a heated display case for sandwiches keeping up with the rush was a challenge sheley said but after two pandemic related shutdowns of his restaurant he said the pipeline workers were a godsend that showed up at just the right time it was tough on us sometimes he said but in general it was like oh thank you because we would have been really hurting there for a while without it now that line 3 is operating and most of the pipeline workers have moved on sheley said he has scaled back staffing and food orders and expectations for the future you look at our sales this year we re not going to expect that this coming year he said anyone who thinks that they re going to i think is probably a little bit misguided no more traffic jams for the past year this small town in cass county with about 250 residents was a central hub for the line 3 project a staging area on the outskirts of town hummed daily with trucks workers and equipment all the activity sometimes caused traffic jams on backus quiet streets it also gave a boost to local businesses as all those workers stayed in motels ate in restaurants and stocked up on supplies at local hardware stores advertisement at the peak of construction there were more than 4 000 workers involved with the line 3 project about 700 workers remain said enbridge spokesperson juli kellner the pipeline started operating on oct 1 that short term burst of activity is normal for a pipeline project said louis johnston an economics professor at the college of st benedict and st john s university during construction local communities see a wide variety of benefits johnston said including work crews spending their money in town and buying supplies they need once it s built it s basically just carrying crude oil through an area he said unless there s some maintenance that needs to be done the local area isn t going to notice its effects enbridge has stressed that communities along the line 3 corridor will benefit from millions of dollars in increased property tax revenue the canadian based company also has invested in community initiatives and nonprofits a total of 1 4 million last year plus another 3 million in grants to environment and habitat restoration efforts in the region kellner said while the large influx of line 3 workers may be over the timing of it just after the covid related shutdown may have saved some struggling businesses said mike paulus executive director of the nonprofit cass county economic development corp we may never know how many businesses were on the precipice of closing their doors after a historically difficult time and were saved paulus said advertisement like part of your family leaving it wasn t just restaurants that saw a surge in business line 3 workers frequently came into b l automotive in downtown backus for oil changes and repairs on their personal and work vehicles said co owner leanne pollock after construction on the pipeline wrapped up a couple of weeks ago most of those workers left town leaving the regular flow of local customers they kept us busy they were great people pollock said it was sad to see them all go at the backus locker a butcher and meat processing shop co owner janis schmid was spreading beef jerky on a tray to be loaded into the smoker schmid said their retail shop saw an increase in customers from line 3 as did other local businesses it was a nice way to come through after the pandemic schmid said because there people around and they were purchasing local stuff within their areas where they were working so it helped everybody schmid said she and her husband david already work six days a week so it was difficult to extend their hours to accommodate the pipeline workers schedules she said they did hire two women a spouse and a girlfriend of pipeline workers who were looking for work they left when the project finished schmid said it s like part of your family leaving she said advertisement the temporary nature of the surge didn t surprise most backus residents said blair ecker pastor of pine mountain gospel church it s located in the town s former elementary school along with a christian school and a thrift shop it was completely expected he said it was going to be a boom while they were here and then they were leaving with stories of oil boom towns in north dakota on his mind ecker said he was a little worried about so many pipeline workers flooding into quiet backus but for the most part ecker said the surge of workers was a positive experience they were friendly and didn t cause problems he said one project manager attended ecker s church regularly with his wife up until last week we would always tease them that they were going to end up becoming backus residents ecker said laughing they didn t financial gains and housing challenges ecker said some residents in town got temporary jobs on the line 3 project either working on the pipeline itself or in supporting roles such as security or as covid 19 testers and his church did benefit indirectly from line 3 a few parishioners who owned property along the pipeline corridor profited by leasing it to enbridge they donated more money to the church which was able to pay off its building debt but ecker said aside from some local business owners most people here weren t really affected financially by line 3 advertisement individually i didn t see an influx in personal income with the pipeline being here and i think i m the majority of backus residents he said i was happy for those that did line 3 did bring some challenges ecker said the influx of a large number of workers looking for a place to live put a strain on rental housing in backus where poverty and housing instability are already problems it also was controversial and the target of protests by environmental activists native american tribes and others who opposed the project a few of those protests took place in backus prompting an increase in law enforcement activity and curious interest from residents ecker said it was a traffic jam every time there was a protest every time somebody chained themselves to something because everybody wanted to see he said in a log cabin office on a downtown backus corner real estate agent mark tietjen had an up close view of the activity created by the line 3 project all hours of the day it was this constant flow of traffic said tietjen office manager at rusty s up north realty the flood of workers needed places to stay and tietjen said he took hundreds of calls from people looking for places to rent advertisement i m surprised they all found rentals he said it s such a small town but somehow they managed some local residents rented out their lake cabins or extra rooms to pipeline workers not just in backus but other nearby communities such as hackensack pine river and walker tietjen only took one call from a worker who wished to buy a home but he hopes that some of the workers may have liked the woods and lakes region so much that they ll return to buy a home or cabin someday there s another trend happening that could have a longer economic impact on the region since covid 19 more people are moving up north to homes or cabins and working remotely tietjen said unlike pipeline workers moving on to the next job those newcomers appear to be here to stay

backus minn after a quite extraordinary year life in the small town of backus is back to mostly ordinary on a recent weekday the town s main street was quiet a few cars were parked in front of the post office and around the corner by the meat market in the kitchen of the corner store and restaurant on highway 371 cooks loaded plates with fried eggs and hash browns for a handful of diners it s a much different scene from earlier this year during the peak of construction on the line 3 oil pipeline when hundreds of pipeline workers were living and working in the area corner store owner dave sheley said they would start showing up at his convenience store at 5 a m to stock up on food for the workday advertisement we d have people just lined up back all the way to the cooler sometimes he recalled sheley had to open earlier and add staff to help with the morning rush he installed a second coffee pot and a heated display case for sandwiches keeping up with the rush was a challenge sheley said but after two pandemic related shutdowns of his restaurant he said the pipeline workers were a godsend that showed up at just the right time it was tough on us sometimes he said but in general it was like oh thank you because we would have been really hurting there for a while without it now that line 3 is operating and most of the pipeline workers have moved on sheley said he has scaled back staffing and food orders and expectations for the future you look at our sales this year we re not going to expect that this coming year he said anyone who thinks that they re going to i think is probably a little bit misguided no more traffic jams for the past year this small town in cass county with about 250 residents was a central hub for the line 3 project a staging area on the outskirts of town hummed daily with trucks workers and equipment all the activity sometimes caused traffic jams on backus quiet streets it also gave a boost to local businesses as all those workers stayed in motels ate in restaurants and stocked up on supplies at local hardware stores advertisement at the peak of construction there were more than 4 000 workers involved with the line 3 project about 700 workers remain said enbridge spokesperson juli kellner the pipeline started operating on oct 1 that short term burst of activity is normal for a pipeline project said louis johnston an economics professor at the college of st benedict and st john s university during construction local communities see a wide variety of benefits johnston said including work crews spending their money in town and buying supplies they need once it s built it s basically just carrying crude oil through an area he said unless there s some maintenance that needs to be done the local area isn t going to notice its effects enbridge has stressed that communities along the line 3 corridor will benefit from millions of dollars in increased property tax revenue the canadian based company also has invested in community initiatives and nonprofits a total of 1 4 million last year plus another 3 million in grants to environment and habitat restoration efforts in the region kellner said while the large influx of line 3 workers may be over the timing of it just after the covid related shutdown may have saved some struggling businesses said mike paulus executive director of the nonprofit cass county economic development corp we may never know how many businesses were on the precipice of closing their doors after a historically difficult time and were saved paulus said advertisement like part of your family leaving it wasn t just restaurants that saw a surge in business line 3 workers frequently came into b l automotive in downtown backus for oil changes and repairs on their personal and work vehicles said co owner leanne pollock after construction on the pipeline wrapped up a couple of weeks ago most of those workers left town leaving the regular flow of local customers they kept us busy they were great people pollock said it was sad to see them all go at the backus locker a butcher and meat processing shop co owner janis schmid was spreading beef jerky on a tray to be loaded into the smoker schmid said their retail shop saw an increase in customers from line 3 as did other local businesses it was a nice way to come through after the pandemic schmid said because there people around and they were purchasing local stuff within their areas where they were working so it helped everybody schmid said she and her husband david already work six days a week so it was difficult to extend their hours to accommodate the pipeline workers schedules she said they did hire two women a spouse and a girlfriend of pipeline workers who were looking for work they left when the project finished schmid said it s like part of your family leaving she said advertisement the temporary nature of the surge didn t surprise most backus residents said blair ecker pastor of pine mountain gospel church it s located in the town s former elementary school along with a christian school and a thrift shop it was completely expected he said it was going to be a boom while they were here and then they were leaving with stories of oil boom towns in north dakota on his mind ecker said he was a little worried about so many pipeline workers flooding into quiet backus but for the most part ecker said the surge of workers was a positive experience they were friendly and didn t cause problems he said one project manager attended ecker s church regularly with his wife up until last week we would always tease them that they were going to end up becoming backus residents ecker said laughing they didn t financial gains and housing challenges ecker said some residents in town got temporary jobs on the line 3 project either working on the pipeline itself or in supporting roles such as security or as covid 19 testers and his church did benefit indirectly from line 3 a few parishioners who owned property along the pipeline corridor profited by leasing it to enbridge they donated more money to the church which was able to pay off its building debt but ecker said aside from some local business owners most people here weren t really affected financially by line 3 advertisement individually i didn t see an influx in personal income with the pipeline being here and i think i m the majority of backus residents he said i was happy for those that did line 3 did bring some challenges ecker said the influx of a large number of workers looking for a place to live put a strain on rental housing in backus where poverty and housing instability are already problems it also was controversial and the target of protests by environmental activists native american tribes and others who opposed the project a few of those protests took place in backus prompting an increase in law enforcement activity and curious interest from residents ecker said it was a traffic jam every time there was a protest every time somebody chained themselves to something because everybody wanted to see he said in a log cabin office on a downtown backus corner real estate agent mark tietjen had an up close view of the activity created by the line 3 project all hours of the day it was this constant flow of traffic said tietjen office manager at rusty s up north realty the flood of workers needed places to stay and tietjen said he took hundreds of calls from people looking for places to rent advertisement i m surprised they all found rentals he said it s such a small town but somehow they managed some local residents rented out their lake cabins or extra rooms to pipeline workers not just in backus but other nearby communities such as hackensack pine river and walker tietjen only took one call from a worker who wished to buy a home but he hopes that some of the workers may have liked the woods and lakes region so much that they ll return to buy a home or cabin someday there s another trend happening that could have a longer economic impact on the region since covid 19 more people are moving up north to homes or cabins and working remotely tietjen said unlike pipeline workers moving on to the next job those newcomers appear to be here to stay

iran is moving ahead with a us 500 million contract for the production development and enhanced oil recovery from its strategically vital south pars oil layer signed between the national iranian oil company nioc the iranian offshore engineering and construction company and an as yet officially undisclosed foreign company in this contract for the first time horizontal drilling with new foreign technologies and water injection will be used as one of the methods of production enhancement said nioc chief executive officer mohsen khojasteh mehr the two key points to understand about the oil layer is that it is likely to have a lot more oil in it than has been publicized by the and even more importantly it has always been seen by the ministry as being a doorway for foreign firms to participate more deeply in the ongoing development of the gas field one of the sources said the south pars non associated natural gas field s 3 700 square kilometers km sector of the 9 700 square km basin shared with qatar in the form of the 6 000 square km north field holds an estimated 14 2 trillion cubic meters tcm of gas reserves in place plus 18 billion barrels of gas condensate it already accounts for around 40 percent of iran s total estimated 33 8 tcm of gas reserves and about 60 percent of its gas production with this set to rise it is so important to iran s future prosperity and places in the world that it is regarded by the islamic republic as a core strategic project with the latest accurate information relating to it seen as a matter of national security nonetheless as part of the detailed analysis of it and of all iran s core oil and gas assets contained in my new book on the global oil markets with the addition of the export and sanctions avoiding guriyeh jask pipeline the net present value of the south pars gas field has jumped from an estimated us 116 billion two years ago to just under us 150 billion now according to sources close to the petroleum ministry according to the only previous public statements from iran on the south pars oil layer spol project the former deputy head of the national iranian oil company nioc gholamreza manouchehri has said that the project is a complex process requiring integrated development and that we are looking for a competent contractor who can make a commitment to production we are looking for cumulative production earlier last month mohammad meshkinfam the managing director of the pars oil and gas company which is in charge of developing the south pars site said that the company was in talks with a number of iranian companies on the development of the oil layer of the field he added that these negotiations were confidential this said just prior to discussing the possibility of pushing the development of the spol the iranian minister of transport and urban development rostam ghasemi was at the head of a delegation that flew to moscow overnight on 26 april to meet his russian counterparts in order to sign several wide ranging agreements connected to transport and transit infrastructure according to local iranian reports the agreements included the activation of the international north south transport corridor instc and the development of maritime air and rail cooperation between iran and russia part of this includes the operation of the rail corridor from chabahar port in iran to russia and the electrification of the incheborun garmsar railway chabahar port has been designated by china and russia as one of the key port and later air facilities that can be assigned dual use for civilian and military purposes both under the 25 year china iran deal originally agreed in 2019 as analyzed in depth in my new book on the global oil markets and under the rolling 10 year cooperation agreements between russia and iran the railroad from garmsar on the tehran mashhad mainline to inchehborun on the border with turkmenistan is part of a transit route connecting kazakhstan and turkmenistan to amirabad port in iran s mazandaran province meanwhile as finland pushed for nato membership in the aftermath of russia s invasion of ukraine it is apposite to note that the north south railway corridor starts from helsinki in finland and passes through russia azerbaijan iran and mumbai related the war in ukraine has stalled global efforts to cut emissions previously the main international oil companies with interests in the spol were denmark s maersk group and french oil supermajor total ironically given the subsequent turn of events regarding iran s supergiant non associated south pars gas field many in the oil industry believed that one of the reasons for total s us 7 45 billion purchase of danish a p moller maersk s oil and gas unit was to boost the french company s chances of being allowed to run the flagship phase 11 of the south pars field by being allowed first to develop the spol according to one of the iran sources exclusively spoken to by oilprice com maersk was just days away from being awarded the spol contract alongside royal dutch shell before iran s nioc heard that total was going to buy the norwegian firm so held off awarding the contract according to the nioc s khojasteh mehr the development of the second phase of the spol has been negotiated within the framework of the new upstream contract model of the iran the iran petroleum contract ipc as also analyzed in depth in my new book on the global oil markets as such he added the project entails upgrading and modifying the existing processing vessel and platform overhauling existing wells drilling new wells including production and water injection wells and appraisal construction of oil discharge and loading system and strengthening the water injection system iran started pumping oil from the oil layer in march 2017 with an initial production of just 5 000 bpd that has risen now to 25 000 bpd and this has been focused on the proven oil areas of the spol including sarvak kazhdomi and the upper darian and lower darian formations however previous internal petroleum ministry estimates have been that the spol may hold around seven billion barrels of oil this original estimate has officially been revised down to just under one billion barrels but this is regarded by the iranian sources spoken to by oilprice com as being an attempt to minimize any potential wrangling with neighboring qatar over boundaries and the future development of the site in this context much of the spol s reserves are projected to be located about 100 kilometers from the iranian coast in the north eastern extension of qatar s al shaheen field in the persian gulf given that the site is located at around 67 meters of water depth the lifting costs excluding capital expenditure will be higher than the usual figure in iran however the usual figure a us 2 3 per barrel lifting cost range is the lowest in the world along with iraq and saudi arabia so a few extra dollars per barrel would still place the site amongst potentially the most profitable in the world depending on the per barrel remuneration rate given to participating firms by the petroleum ministry

microsoft announced on october 14 that it has decided to shut down the localized chinese version of linkedin in china the business and employment oriented social media platform launched its chinese version in 2014 based on the requirements of the chinese government about social media platforms however the company s strategy is no longer able could to work in china its sunset decision being motivated by a significantly more challenging operating environment and greater compliance requirements in china as mohaf shroff senior vice president of engineering at linkedin wrote on linkedin s official blog linkedin s chinese version has more than 50 million domestic users it has been the only major social platform allowed to operate in china by a u s company the latest decision implies that linkedin will soon join google twitter facebook among others in the china list of blocked sites and its users in mainland china would have to circumvent china s internet censorship to access linkedin upon the shutting down of the social networking site the chinese branch of linkedin will launch a chinese job search application injobs to serve job seekers in china but the new service will not allow users to create and share content caught between censorship and users needs since the launch of its localized version linkedin has been caught in a crossfire between chinese government censorship requirements and its users criticism over its censorship practices last march the new york times quoted sources saying that china s internet regulator the state internet information office had rebuked linkedin over lax censorship two months after the cyberspace administration of china listed more than 100 apps accusing them of improper collection of data mentioning microsoft s linkedin and bing on the list on the other hand since 2014 human rights activists academics and journalists have slammed company for censoring content that is sensitive inside china in order to satisfy the chinese government s requirement linkedin users from mainland china have been banned from posting sensitive content like photos reports and commentaries about the 1989 tiananmen massacre as for overseas users posts that contain sensitive information would be blocked in the chinese linkedin network in recent years linkedin has extended its censorship to overseas users profiles since 2019 a number of overseas journalists academics and activists have found their profiles blocked in china last month a number of u s journalists including bethany allen ebrahimian melissa chan and greg bruno found their profiles blocked in the linkedin chinese platform when bethany allen ebrahimian reached out to linkedin the platform administrator advised her to update the summary section of her profile the investigative reporter mocked the company for its free self censorship consulting service i d like to highlight one especially disturbing part of the linkedin customer service email we will work with you to minimize the impact and can review your profile s accessibility within china if you update the summary section of your profile b allen ebrahimian bethanyallenebr september 28 2021 after the incident republican u s senator rick scott wrote to linkedin and the ceo of its parent company microsoft describing the censorship as a gross appeasement and an act of submission to communist china and raised a set of difficult questions demanding the company to explain its censorship policy in china inside china linkedin china s official weibo said that media reports about the shutting down of its service were incorrect its china president lu jian interpreted the move to terminate its social networking services as an adjustment of business strategy in a statement but very few chinese netizens buy the apolitical version of this story on weibo quite a few have expressed their frustrations about such news one linkedin user said 一想到领英要关闭 我就烦躁 关注了好多学校和外企 我的唯一消息途径 关闭社交功能 我要它干什么 i am so frustrated about the shutting down of linkedin i have followed so many schools and foreign companies and it was the only source of related information what s the point of a platform without social media functions a more critical remark said link and chinese original quote removed for security concern damn it now they not only block anything sensitive but also access to job opportunities from foreign companies and overseas so chinese workers can only be exploited by chinese businesses everyone is locked in involution development through intense internal competition let s walk toward common wealth 共同富裕 the country is closing its door on twitter quite a few mainland chinese users have used circumvention tools to leave comments on related news and claim that linkedin left the chinese market because of business failure rather than for political reasons here are some examples amazon was beaten down by taobao and jingdong linkedin is less popular than mai mai market wsj saves making up excuses for linkedin china s new data security law till now microsoft has not explained what challenges the company is facing in china paul mozur a journalist from new york times believed that the newly enacted data security law in china may have contributed to linkedin s departure a few other points on linkedin s departure from china data security law likely a factor as linkedin would have to store much more data on users in china also in linkedin s china announcement they make no mention of regulatory issues so a censored exit for their censoring paul mozur 孟建國 paulmozur october 14 2021 some chinese bloggers on weibo also share the same theory a current affair commentator fei yan ping tan 飛彥評談 pointed to the fact that linkedin had mostly foreign users within china as mentioned in an explainer in the south china morning post tech companies will face legal action from their own country if they hand over foreign users data to the chinese authorities upon request the chinese data security law has extended its jurisdiction overseas as it seeks to prevent and sanction data activities conducted outside of china that may harm the national security or public interests of the prc or the legitimate rights of chinese citizens or entities foreign internet companies have to asset their data activities including data collection storage usage processing transmission provision and disclosure by a third party to make sure their protocols won t damage critical information infrastructure in china and lead to severe consequences microsoft s linkedin and bing would likely be subject to a third party assessment as both apps were listed by the cyberspace administration for improperly collection of data back in may another push factor is the upcoming algorium law as suggested by china policy researcher kendra schaefer second the cac s guiding opinions on information services algorithms released in sept which make it clear that info distribution algorithms should uphold socialist core values 8 13 kendra schaefer 凯娜 kendraschaefer october 15 2021 the proposed law makes it mandatory for internet companies to adjust their algorithms to spread positive energy which means these companies would be turned into part of the chinese propaganda machinery against such a challenging environment mainland chinese twitter user mike56705438 used humor to comment that for linkedin to take root in china it has to give up its ownership altogether to the chinese communist party 成立党支部 转让51 的股份给我党是领英的唯一出路 这和当年刚解放时 保留外资企业 但在政策上用钝刀子杀猪一模一样 毛泽东思想学的真好 set up a party branch and transfer 51 percent of its stock to the party is the only way out the current situation is like during the time of china liberation they wanted the foreign enterprises to stay but in terms of policy they slaughtered them one after the other such a good follower of mao zedong s idea the chinese communist party has started demanding domestic internet firms to set up party branches in 2017 it has become clear that the chinese government wants to have stronger control over the internet sector in july it launched a crackdown on didi china s biggest car hailing app accusing it of infringing users data security after it was listed in the u s one month after reportedly it started working on a law to ban internet companies from listing in overseas stock markets citing data security risks for more than two decades foreign big techs had attempted to enter the china market once they believed that working with local partners and setting up a local version of their products would grant them access to the chinese market hence for example google launched its simplified chinese version in 2000 and set up a google china subsidiary in 2005 but shut down its simplified chinese search engine in 2010 microsoft seems to have more patience and linkedin is the last u s owned social media to quit the chinese market the termination of linked chinese version as many have pointed out marks the end of an experiment for foreign big techs to engage with authoritative china

higher to 83 4 million acres up 300 000 acres similarly harvested area was bumped up to 82 6 million acres from 82 3 million acres also usda reports a yield boost from 50 2 bushels per acre to 51 bushels per acre soybean demand was adjusted with 1 million bushels in increased crushing and a 5 million bushel increase in exports the largest adjustment occurred in soybean residual which was lowered by 7 million bushels dropping 175 from 4 million bushels to 3 million bushels from september to october which helps account for the changes to soybean stocks the increase in stocks pushed the stocks to use ratio from 3 9 last month to 5 7 and pushed prices down the average farm price for soybeans for the 2020 21 marketing year was lowered from 10 90 per bushel to 10 80 bushel for the new 2021 22 marketing year soybean production expectations are increased slightly with a yield bump from 50 6 bushels per acre in september to 51 5 bushels per acre in october which is slightly up from analysts expectations that yield would be closer to 51 1 bushels per acre the yield increase pushes production expectations for this year s soybean crop to 4 45 billion bushels up 5 5 compared to 2020 if that size crop comes to fruition it will be the u s largest soybean crop on record given those expectations usda this month lowered the estimate for soybean imports to 15 million bushels from 25 million bushels in september when the 2021 22 marketing year estimates were first published the tighter margins implied that the u s would need to import more soybeans and in may usda estimated imports of 35 million bushels the soybean supply increases combined with the 81 million bushel increase in carry over stocks put total soybean supply at 4 7 billion bushels a 3 2 increase compared to september which is just behind the 4 8 billion bushel record the u s held in 2018 despite record soybean production the only expected increase in 2021 22 soybean demand is in soybean crushing up 10 million bushels from september to 2 19 billion bushels exports for the newest soybean crop are still not estimated to be anywhere near 2020 s peak of 2 265 billion bushels usda kept 2021 22 exports in october at 2 09 billion bushels about 7 7 behind 2020 with little change made to 2021 22 soybean use and an increase in soybean supply margins are much looser soybean stocks for the 2021 22 marketing year increased 73 this month going from 185 million bushels to 320 million bushels the stocks to use ratio moved upward from 4 2 to 7 3 this month while prices dipped from 12 90 per bushel last month to 12 35 per bushel in october updated corn supply and demand expectations for the 2020 21 marketing year corn ending stocks were revised up from 1 187 billion bushels to 1 24 billion bushels an increase of 6 and up from analysts expectations of 1 15 billion bushels this estimate is still about 36 lower than 2020 and close to 2013 levels when the corn price for the average marketing year was around 4 46 per bushel however the increase in corn stocks was not due to an increase in corn production usda revised estimates for u s corn production for 2020 lowering it by 71 million bushels to just above 14 billion bushels but still up about 4 compared to 2019 this was influenced by a change to the planted area which was lowered by 100 000 acres to 90 7 million and a revision to harvested acres now pegged at 82 3 million acres down 200 000 acres compared to estimates usda provided earlier in the year usda is also attributing the slightly lower yield to a down tick in production with 2020 21 yields decreasing from 172 bushels per acre to 171 4 million bushels usda did make changes to 2020 21 domestic corn use feed and residual use had the largest demand revision lowering by 128 million bushels to just under 5 6 billion bushels a decrease of 2 2 from estimates in september ethanol use was lowered slightly as was food seed and industrial use domestic corn use overall decreased a total of 129 million bushels in october when compared to september wasde estimates the slight increase in corn exports this month was not nearly enough to offset any domestic changes the 2020 21 corn stocks to use ratio increased from 7 9 to 8 3 still significantly behind the 13 7 stocks to use ratio in 2019 usda increased the average farm corn price from 4 45 per bushel in september to 4 53 per bushel this month there was a minor increase in yield for new corn crop for the 2021 22 marketing year rising from 176 3 bushels per acre to 176 5 bushels per acre from the opposite of analysts expectations for corn yields to be revised downward to 176bushels per acre the best yield on record is 176 6 bushels per acre which occurred in 2017 the increase to yield and added carry over stocks from 2020 pushes corn supply upward to 16 2 billion bushels just about 72 million bushels up from last month usda made minor changes to 2021 22 corn demand for corn feed and residual usda lowered the estimate by 50 million bushels from 5 7 billion bushels to 5 65 billion bushels but increased food seed and industrial use by 5 million bushels corn exports were adjusted upward by 25 million bushels now reaching 2 5 billion bushels which would be the second largest corn export amount behind 2020 corn exports of 2 75 billion bushels ending stocks for the 2021 22 corn marketing year were increased by 92 million bushels to reach 1 5 billion bushels up 21 compared to 2020 ending stock estimates the stocks to use ratio increased from 9 5 last month to 10 1 in october while the average corn price remained neutral at 5 45 per bushel updated wheat supply and demand expectations for the 2020 21 marketing year usda increased wheat planted area by 200 000 acres moving from 44 3 million acres to 44 5 million acres which puts the estimate about 2 behind the planted area in 2019 usda also increased the wheat harvested area by 100 000 acres moving it from 36 7 million acres to 36 8 million acres the increase in the productive area pushed wheat production upward slightly to 1 8 billion bushels and increased overall supply by 3 million bushels to just under 3 billion bushels of wheat for 2020 21 wheat use usda increased seed use by 5 moving from 61 million bushels to 63 million bushels but decreased food and residual use by 2 moving from 97 million bushels to 95 million bushels these minor adjustments increased total wheat use by 1 million bushels the resulting ending stocks for 2020 21 wheat are pegged at 845 million bushels which is 18 behind levels in 2019 when wheat ending stocks were above 1 billion bushels the stocks to use ratio for the 2020 21 wheat crop continues to sit at 40 with the average farm price at 5 05 per bushel for the 2021 22 marketing year wheat stock carry over is at its lowest point since 2014 but production is expected to be slightly lower given dryer than normal weather conditions usda adjusted harvested area lower by 2 moving from 38 1 million acres to 37 2 million acres despite an estimated 46 7 million acres of planted wheat the highest amount since 2018 usda also lowered wheat yields slightly moving from 44 5 bushels per acre to 44 3 bushels per acre the overall result lowers wheat production by 51 million bushels moving from 1 7 billion bushels to 1 64 billion bushels usda also further reduced global wheat imports into the u s to 125 million bushels after a reduction last month from 145 million bushels in august to 135 million bushels the overall impact to supply in 2021 22 is a reduction of 50 million bushels down 2 compared to september moving from 2 67 billion bushels to 2 61 billion bushels the lowest u s wheat supply since 2006 on the demand side for 2021 22 wheat use usda decreased feed and residual use by 25 million bushels going from 160 million bushels in september to 135 million bushels in october a decrease of 16 this use category is small compared to other domestic wheat uses and only lowers domestic use by 2 on the balance sheet moving from 1 18 billion bushels to 1 16 billion bushels the changes to supply and demand lower ending stocks to 580 million bushels this month down 6 compared to last month when wheat ending stocks were 615 million bushels this would be the smallest amount of wheat ending stocks the u s has held since 2013 sending stocks of 590 million bushels before that it would be 2007 when ending stocks were 306 million bushels the stocks to use ratio for 2021 22 wheat currently sits at 28 which is the lowest level since 2013 when the stocks to use ratio was 24 usda has this month s wheat price at 6 70 per bushel up from 6 60 per bushel last month summary usda s wasde 2021 22 marketing year domestic balance sheets for corn and soybeans reflected the big surprises in the september grain stocks quarterly report major adjustments were made to reflect those survey results particularly for soybeans as 2020 21 ending stocks rose sharply and demand factors were adjusted however the impact to the new marketing year when record soybean production is expected means much higher than originally reported soybean supplies with little demand change thus increasing stocks in both marketing years and slowing price increases for corn the increase to old corn stocks will carry over into the new marketing year with increased corn yields if demand for the new crop year remains stagnant and harvest is not interrupted by weather prices could drop u s wheat is pegged to have its lowest supply since 2006 and ending stocks are being pushed to their lowest level in almost a decade just as an overall reduction in global wheat stocks ripples through which could help drive wheat prices even higher with estimates this month implying more grain than expected except in wheat there is little worry over too low corn and soybean stocks the next wasde published on nov 9 will likely reflect more robust yield estimates as harvest progresses shelby myers is an economist with the american farm bureau federation

electric school bus in beverly massachusetts successfully delivered power back to the electricity grid for more than 50 hours over the course of the summer this is the first time an electric school bus has been leveraged as an energy resource by the regional utility national grid in new england and among the first instances in the united states that an electric school bus has supported the electric grid in this way in conjunction with highland electric fleets and national grid a thomas built buses saf t liner c2 jouley electric school bus equipped with a proterra powered battery system discharged nearly three megawatt hours of electricity stored in the bus to the regional electric grid over the course of 30 events this summer highland who provides the bus chargers and all electricity to beverly public schools under a mileage based subscription worked with national grid to ensure that the site was prepared for energy discharge and coordinated participation in their connected solutions daily dispatch program under this program national grid utilized the energy stored in the electric school bus battery on 30 different occasions over the summer to lower demand on the grid during times of peak demand thomas built s saf t liner c2 jouley with proterra s bidirectional charging system managed the charging and discharging of the electric school bus back into the grid by sending electricity back to the grid when demand for electricity was at its highest and most expensive the school bus helped reduce local emissions and decreased the need to fire up costly fossil fuel peaker plants national grid compensates participants in this program for their energy services incentivizing the use of distributed energy resources to strengthen the local grid participation in national grid s program marks an important step in closing the up front cost gap between traditional diesel school buses and electric school buses as revenue from vehicle to grid v2g programs offer a unique means to improve the economics of electric school bus ownership the average school bus transports students for approximately six hours a day 200 days annually and are otherwise parked or idled when not in operation this is particularly true during summer months when demand for electricity is often at its highest and clean energy stored in idled electric school buses can provide an energy resource to the grid we are proud to have added several customers and vendors to our programs this year that are using vehicle to grid technology this underlines the strength of the technology neutral approach of the connected solutions daily dispatch program through this single program we have enrolled batteries fuel cells thermal storage v2g and many other technologies without needing to confuse customers and vendors with separate programs and incentives for each technology said john isberg vice president of customer sales and solutions at national grid in beverly highland provided a turnkey fixed price subscription that eliminated up front cost risk and complexity of managing the electric school bus and allowed beverley to benefit from the v2g services provided by the bus through a lower subscription price this type of public private partnerships allows school districts to capture the value of a v2g program and fully unleash the potential of electric school buses beverly is proud to lead in electrifying our school bus fleet and to be at the forefront nationally to successfully discharge battery stored electricity back to the grid we look forward to taking full advantage of the economic environmental and operational benefits that v2g technology offers we truly appreciate our valuable partners highland electric fleets national grid and proterra whose collaboration has made this project a huge success said beverly mayor mike cahill the saf t liner c2 jouley couples 226 kwh of total energy capacity from proterra s industry leading battery technology the highest standard battery capacity in the industry with a proterra electric drivetrain to offer unparalleled energy efficiency and up to 135 miles of drive range to meet the needs of school bus

vehicle battery autoneum has expanded its expertise in aluminum sheet forming to include battery electromagnetic shields ems the stamped aluminum components prevent electromagnetic interference emi inside electric vehicles and thanks to their design and simple manufacturing process provide a robust and cost effective shielding solution for composite battery lids the performance of vehicles today depends on a growing number of electronic systems and devices while the increasingly complex technical equipment enhances both driving comfort and vehicle safety it is also susceptible to electromagnetic disturbance to prevent electromagnetic radiation from affecting the functionality of the car s electronic circuits and battery or causing damage to its safety critical control systems or its occupants health electronic components must be protected accordingly the need for effective electromagnetic shielding is especially prevalent in electric vehicles where e motor and battery present additional sources of emi in order to minimize the associated risks autoneum has developed ems made from embossed aluminum sheets autoneum s latest product specifically targeted at electric vehicles draws on the company s decades of experience in the design development and production of aluminum heatshields however instead of providing protection against the heat arising from the powertrain and exhaust system ems are placed on top of the battery lid to shield the vehicle battery and other electronic devices from emi thanks to the excellent conductive properties of aluminum as well as the particular design of the components autoneum s ems improve the function of the battery housing as a highly effective protective shield against emi with a shielding effectiveness of more than 70 db they not only offer greater electromagnetic protection than alternative methods such as the use of additional fillers or the spraying of metal coatings on the battery lid they are also considerably easier to manufacture as a high quality robust and cost effective complement for composite battery lids aluminum ems prevent emi inside the vehicle and thus provide a valuable extension of autoneum s textile based product portfolio for electric cars which already includes components such as the ultra silent based front trunks and under battery shields as well as e motor encapsulations made of hybrid acoustics pet autoneum s aluminum ems are currently available in europe north america and asia volta chargers at floor decor

survival pfs at the first interim analysis globally orient 31 is the first prospective double blind multi center phase 3 study that has demonstrated significant pfs improvement of anti pd 1 and anti vegf antibody combination therapy i e sintilimab plus byvasda combined with chemotherapy in patients with epidermal growth factor receptor egfr mutated nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer nsqnsclc that has progressed after treatment with an egfr tyrosine kinase inhibitor tki in the first interim analysis reviewed by the independent data monitoring committee idmc in the intent to treat itt population based on assessment by the blinded independent radiographic review committee birrc sintilimab in combination with byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection and chemotherapy demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in pfs compared with chemotherapy sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy also showed a trend of pfs benefit compared to chemotherapy alone data is not yet mature additionally the prespecified pfs futility analysis that compares sintilimab in combination with byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection and chemotherapy to sintilimab in combination with chemotherapy did not cross futility stopping boundary a numerical benefit of adding byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection to sintilimab and chemotherapy combination can be observed the safety profile of this study was consistent with that observed in previously reported studies of sintilimab and byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection with no additional safety signals the detailed results of orient 31 will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting the principal investigator of the orient 31 prof shun lu from the oncology department of shanghai chest hospital stated for patients with egfr mutated advanced nsqnsclc who have progressed following egfr tki treatment platinum based chemotherapy is the current standard of care but with limited benefit new treatments are clearly imperative orient 31 is the first prospective double blind phase 3 study worldwide to demonstrate significant pfs benefit with an anti pd 1 antibody combination therapy in this patient population it has shown the clinical value of adding sintilimab plus byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection to platinum chemotherapy this quadruple regimen has the potential to bring forth a new and more effective treatment option to patients with egfr mutated nsqnsclc following treatment with an egfr tki dr hui zhou senior vice president of innovent stated lung cancer has the highest mortality rate among all tumor types both in china and worldwide in china egfr mutated nsclc accounts for 40 to 50 of nonsquamous nsclc and the treatment options for these patients after treatment with first second and third generation egfr tkis are very limited representing a large unmet medical need through the joint efforts of investigators orient 31 achieved these encouraging research results we are grateful for all the contributions made by the investigators and patients in this study together we accomplished this important milestone about non squamous non small cell lung cancer nsclc lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide and the second most commonly diagnosed tumor type non small cell lung cancer nsclc accounts for about 80 to 85 of all lung cancer in which about 70 of nsclc patients present with locally advanced or metastatic disease that is not suitable for surgical resection at diagnosis in china nsqnsclc accounts for 70 of nsclc in which about 40 to 50 of nsqnsclc patients have an egfr mutation the standard first line treatment for patients with advanced egfr mutated nsclc is a third generation egfr tki or first or second generation egfr tki for patients who have progressed following egfr tki treatment platinum based chemotherapy is still the standard therapy with limited benefit representing a large unmet medical need about the orient 31 study orient 31 is a randomized double blind multicenter phase 3 clinical study evaluating sintilimab with or without byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection combined with chemotherapy pemetrexed and cisplatin in patients with egfr mutated locally advanced or metastatic non squamous nsclc who have progressed following egfr tki treatment clinicaltrials gov nct003802240 the primary endpoint is pfs as assessed by birrc based on recist v1 1 the secondary endpoints include overall survival os pfs as assessed by investigators objective response rate orr and safety eligible patients included patients with disease progression following first or second generation egfr tki and confirmed as t790m negative or t790m positive but further progressed on third generation egfr tki treatment or patients with disease progression following third generation egfr tki as first line treatment patients were randomized in a 1 1 1 ratio to receive sintilimab plus byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin sintilimab plus placebo 2 combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin or placebo 1 plus placebo 2 combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin after 4 cycles of combination treatment patients will receive maintenance treatment of sintilimab plus byvasda and pemetrexed sintilimab plus placebo 2 and pemetrexed placebo 1 plus placebo 2 and pemetrexed until radiographic disease progression unacceptable toxicity or any other conditions that required treatment discontinuation target accrual is 480 patients about sintilimab sintilimab marketed as tyvyt sintilimab injection in china is an innovative pd 1 inhibitor with global quality standards jointly developed by innovent and eli lilly and company sintilimab is an immunoglobulin g4 monoclonal antibody which binds to pd 1 molecules on the surface of t cells blocks the pd 1 pd ligand 1 pd l1 pathway and reactivates t cells to kill cancer cells innovent is currently conducting more than 20 clinical studies of sintilimab worldwide to evaluate its safety and efficacy in a wide variety of cancer indications including more than 10 registrational or pivotal clinical trials in china sintilimab has been approved for four indications including the treatment of relapsed or refractory classic hodgkin s lymphoma after two lines or later of systemic chemotherapy in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first line treatment of nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer in combination with gemcitabine and platinum chemotherapy for the first line treatment of squamous non small cell lung cancer in combination with byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection for the first line treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma additionally innovent currently has one regulatory submission under review in china for sintilimab for the first line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma additionally four clinical studies of sintilimab have met their primary endpoints phase 3 study in combination with oxaliplatin and capecitabine for the first line treatment of unresectable locally advanced recurrent or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma phase 2 study as second line treatment of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma phase 3 study as second line treatment for squamous nsclc with disease progression following platinum based chemotherapy phase 3 study in combination with byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection and chemotherapy pemetrexed and cisplatin for egfr mutated nonsquamous nsclc following egfr tki treatment in may 2021 the u s fda accepted for review the biologics license application bla for sintilimab in combination with pemetrexed and platinum chemotherapy for the first line treatment of nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer sintilimab was included in china s national reimbursement drug list nrdl in 2019 as the first pd 1 inhibitor and the only pd 1 included in the list in that year about byvasda bevacizumab biosimilar injection byvasda also known as ibi305 is a bevacizumab biosimilar and a recombinant humanized anti vegf monoclonal antibody drug vascular endothelial growth factor vegf is an important factor in angiogenesis that is highly expressed by the endothelial cells in most human tumors an anti vegf antibody binds vegf a selectively with high affinity and blocks its binding to vegf 2 receptors on the surface of vascular endothelial cells thereby inhibiting signaling pathways such as pi3k akt pkb and ras raf mek erk byvasda produces anti tumor effects by inhibiting the growth proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells blocking angiogenesis reducing vascular permeability blocking blood supply to tumor tissues inhibiting the proliferation and metastasis of tumor cells and inducing apoptosis in tumor cells since its launch bevacizumab has been approved for the treatment of patients with multiple malignant tumors globally including non small cell lung cancer metastatic colorectal cancer glioblastoma renal cell carcinoma cervical cancer and epithelial ovarian fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in these

backus minn after a quite extraordinary year life in the small town of backus is back to mostly ordinary on a recent weekday the town s main street was quiet a few cars were parked in front of the post office and around the corner by the meat market in the kitchen of the corner store and restaurant on highway 371 cooks loaded plates with fried eggs and hash browns for a handful of diners it s a much different scene from earlier this year during the peak of construction on the line 3 oil pipeline when hundreds of pipeline workers were living and working in the area corner store owner dave sheley said they would start showing up at his convenience store at 5 a m to stock up on food for the workday advertisement we d have people just lined up back all the way to the cooler sometimes he recalled sheley had to open earlier and add staff to help with the morning rush he installed a second coffee pot and a heated display case for sandwiches keeping up with the rush was a challenge sheley said but after two pandemic related shutdowns of his restaurant he said the pipeline workers were a godsend that showed up at just the right time it was tough on us sometimes he said but in general it was like oh thank you because we would have been really hurting there for a while without it now that line 3 is operating and most of the pipeline workers have moved on sheley said he has scaled back staffing and food orders and expectations for the future you look at our sales this year we re not going to expect that this coming year he said anyone who thinks that they re going to i think is probably a little bit misguided no more traffic jams for the past year this small town in cass county with about 250 residents was a central hub for the line 3 project a staging area on the outskirts of town hummed daily with trucks workers and equipment all the activity sometimes caused traffic jams on backus quiet streets it also gave a boost to local businesses as all those workers stayed in motels ate in restaurants and stocked up on supplies at local hardware stores advertisement at the peak of construction there were more than 4 000 workers involved with the line 3 project about 700 workers remain said enbridge spokesperson juli kellner the pipeline started operating on oct 1 that short term burst of activity is normal for a pipeline project said louis johnston an economics professor at the college of st benedict and st john s university during construction local communities see a wide variety of benefits johnston said including work crews spending their money in town and buying supplies they need once it s built it s basically just carrying crude oil through an area he said unless there s some maintenance that needs to be done the local area isn t going to notice its effects enbridge has stressed that communities along the line 3 corridor will benefit from millions of dollars in increased property tax revenue the canadian based company also has invested in community initiatives and nonprofits a total of 1 4 million last year plus another 3 million in grants to environment and habitat restoration efforts in the region kellner said while the large influx of line 3 workers may be over the timing of it just after the covid related shutdown may have saved some struggling businesses said mike paulus executive director of the nonprofit cass county economic development corp we may never know how many businesses were on the precipice of closing their doors after a historically difficult time and were saved paulus said advertisement like part of your family leaving it wasn t just restaurants that saw a surge in business line 3 workers frequently came into b l automotive in downtown backus for oil changes and repairs on their personal and work vehicles said co owner leanne pollock after construction on the pipeline wrapped up a couple of weeks ago most of those workers left town leaving the regular flow of local customers they kept us busy they were great people pollock said it was sad to see them all go at the backus locker a butcher and meat processing shop co owner janis schmid was spreading beef jerky on a tray to be loaded into the smoker schmid said their retail shop saw an increase in customers from line 3 as did other local businesses it was a nice way to come through after the pandemic schmid said because there people around and they were purchasing local stuff within their areas where they were working so it helped everybody schmid said she and her husband david already work six days a week so it was difficult to extend their hours to accommodate the pipeline workers schedules she said they did hire two women a spouse and a girlfriend of pipeline workers who were looking for work they left when the project finished schmid said it s like part of your family leaving she said advertisement the temporary nature of the surge didn t surprise most backus residents said blair ecker pastor of pine mountain gospel church it s located in the town s former elementary school along with a christian school and a thrift shop it was completely expected he said it was going to be a boom while they were here and then they were leaving with stories of oil boom towns in north dakota on his mind ecker said he was a little worried about so many pipeline workers flooding into quiet backus but for the most part ecker said the surge of workers was a positive experience they were friendly and didn t cause problems he said one project manager attended ecker s church regularly with his wife up until last week we would always tease them that they were going to end up becoming backus residents ecker said laughing they didn t financial gains and housing challenges ecker said some residents in town got temporary jobs on the line 3 project either working on the pipeline itself or in supporting roles such as security or as covid 19 testers and his church did benefit indirectly from line 3 a few parishioners who owned property along the pipeline corridor profited by leasing it to enbridge they donated more money to the church which was able to pay off its building debt but ecker said aside from some local business owners most people here weren t really affected financially by line 3 advertisement individually i didn t see an influx in personal income with the pipeline being here and i think i m the majority of backus residents he said i was happy for those that did line 3 did bring some challenges ecker said the influx of a large number of workers looking for a place to live put a strain on rental housing in backus where poverty and housing instability are already problems it also was controversial and the target of protests by environmental activists native american tribes and others who opposed the project a few of those protests took place in backus prompting an increase in law enforcement activity and curious interest from residents ecker said it was a traffic jam every time there was a protest every time somebody chained themselves to something because everybody wanted to see he said in a log cabin office on a downtown backus corner real estate agent mark tietjen had an up close view of the activity created by the line 3 project all hours of the day it was this constant flow of traffic said tietjen office manager at rusty s up north realty the flood of workers needed places to stay and tietjen said he took hundreds of calls from people looking for places to rent advertisement i m surprised they all found rentals he said it s such a small town but somehow they managed some local residents rented out their lake cabins or extra rooms to pipeline workers not just in backus but other nearby communities such as hackensack pine river and walker tietjen only took one call from a worker who wished to buy a home but he hopes that some of the workers may have liked the woods and lakes region so much that they ll return to buy a home or cabin someday there s another trend happening that could have a longer economic impact on the region since covid 19 more people are moving up north to homes or cabins and working remotely tietjen said unlike pipeline workers moving on to the next job those newcomers appear to be here to stay

economist and allianz chief economic advisor mohamed el erian went on fox news sunday to discuss what investors can expect from the market given the circumstances of inflation workforce shortages and port bottlenecks host chris wallace asked how the demand of the holiday season would affect inflation and supply so as sad as i am to say this it is what i expect things will get worse before they get better the economist said sunday afternoon we re going to have more shortages of goods we re going to have higher prices inflation will remain in the four to five percent level and it s just going to take time to sort these things out chris these things cannot be sorted out overnight there were many years in the making and then covid pressed fast forward and got everything accelerated and that s where we are now wallace pressed el erian what about the markets i worry a little bit that this wonderful world we ve been living in of low volatility everything going up may come to a stop with higher volatility but a lot depends on behavioral changes he said if i were an investor i would recognize that i m riding a huge liquidity wave thanks to the fed but i would remember that waves tend to break at some point so i would be very attentive el erian also responded to the claim that inflation america is experiencing is a high class problem the controversy bubbled after white house chief of staff ron klain appeared to endorse a view that downplayed inflation and shortages hemmer presses pro biden economist on calling inflation a high class problem what were you thinking el erian said some parts were high class problems because the demand for workers was causing pay incentives and wages to go up other parts such as those felt at the gas pump were not high class problems that s not a high class problem but there are elements that are high class one the massive demand for labor so wages are starting to go up and that s starting to go up meaningfully second the reason why there s so much inflation is partly due to a lot of demand that s a lot of purchasing power in the economy that s a good thing but part of this inflation is good inflation part is bad inflation we should expect more strikes going forward because workers now have greater bargaining power why is that happening part of it is the excess demand from people looking to hire quickly because demand has come back but part of that is change behaviors we feel that now we can negotiate higher wages without losing our jobs we feel that we can go from one job to another and get sign up bonuses and some people don t want to come back into the labor force they have changed their views about work life balance el erian also disagreed with the view pushed by the biden administration that inflation was temporary treasury official claims inflation part of economy in transition only way out is 100 global vaccination i do not agree it is transitory chris there is part of it that s transitory that s covid related but there are things going on that are fundamentally much deeper than that they involve change in behavior so we should look forward for another year at least of high and persistent inflation el erian also provided a four point plan the government should do to address the problem first el erian said the fed should ease off the monetary stimulus they continue to pump into the economy in response to covid that made sense at the height of the emergency it doesn t make sense now so they should ease off the pedal to the metal monetary stimulus he said the second he said involved infrastructure and human investments in order to get productivity back up third we ve got to look very seriously at excessive financial risk because what s going to happen if we re not careful is inflation as it persists will disrupt the financial markets that will then undermine the economy and finally we ve got to get more people into the labor force these things are feasible from an engineering perspective what they require is the political will to implement them

it looks like the defence industry lobby group the australian strategic policy institute is running low on funds nothing else can account for the surfacing of its executive director peter jennings on the opinion pages of the australian conjuring up a fictional version of a chinese bid to grab taiwan one finds it passing strange that jennings would seek to write this kind of fantasy stuff after us president joe biden made it a point to stress that he and chinese president xi jinping had both affirmed their commitment to the existing taiwan policy during talks in september additionally the news that an online summit is planned between the two leaders was also ventilated the us probably did that to try and cool things down given reports that chinese aircraft have been making flights close to taiwan in increased numbers so while the americans are trying to cool down things jennings prefers to pump up the volume and indulge in fanciful scenarios aspi s annual report for 2020 21 appears to be ready but has not yet been placed on its website the only part of the report which has been published on the web isfor 2020 21 when one looks at the list of sponsors for aspi it is clear why things do not look very bright for jennings a fair few have fallen off since i last wrote about the institute among them the shipbuilder austal and mbda missile systems among aspi s sponsors are us defence contractor lockheed martin us defence supplier northrop grumman swedish defence company saab the australian arm of american defence contractor raytheon french defence giant thales and naval group the international design and build partner for australia s future submarine program given australia s jettisoning of the contract with france to build submarines and the adoption of a new deal with the us and the uk to acquire nuclear submarines instead which may not eventuate until the 2040s jennings may also lose the naval group as a sponsor within the next year or so aspi s cyber policy centre is backed by auda the american cloud behemoth amazon web services facebook the australian signals directorate addaxis the cyber security co operative research centre google jacobs microsoft palo alto networks the department of prime minister and cabinet property council of australia splunk thales macquarie government and upguard in this latter group too jennings has seen a few sponsors call it a day among them the australian government department services australia with money pouring in from all these sources it s a mystery how aspi calls itself independent and non partisan its deception is helped no end by newspapers like the australian and the abc not identifying clearly who jennings backers are jennings has every right to propagate his own views inflammatory as they are but one should be given a clear picture of who is funding the show the one who pays the piper calls the tune and australians need to be told clearly who that paymaster is and he never does that aspi has an agreement to receive 4 million a year in grants from the australian government from 2018 19 to 2022 23 an additional 5 million has been granted for an us office jennings tactics are well worn ones hype up the fear factor so that countries in the region will stock up on arms the arms industry will be laughing all the way to the bank and drop a few more crumbs aspi s way the us and the uk used to do it in the middle east during the 1980s and 1990s despite the fact that arms supplied to countries in that region would be needlessly used for bloodshed and not to defend against an attack in december last year jennings was beating the war drums at the same time that many business leaders and some politicians were calling for dialling down the rhetoric between australia and china because of the fact that beijing is an important export market in his latest op ed jennings says the taiwanese assess perhaps a three year time frame before an attack while the us military command at indopacom in honolulu considers a military assault in six years is possible but of course peter jennings noble warrior that he is sees it differently and would like to shirtfront xi jinping right away screenshots from aspi funding breakdown
rockville ind wtwo wawv this year s covered bridge festival was one of the busiest in recent memory parke county commissioner jim meece said that a big crowd was expected as the festival was cancelled last year due to covid 19 concerns however this year was unlike any other i don t think anybody anticipated this kind of uptick meece said we ve had traffic backed up more than a mile in all directions so it s been an incredible year the big attendance caused big sales for vendors meece has attended every covered bridge festival since its beginning and his family sells sassafrass candy at the event he said that he s had record sales for his candy we sold out of our product yesterday morning and we ve never sold out until late in the day on sunday meece said nathan ingram sells handmade wooden crafts at the festival and he said his stock ended up being lower than originally planned i m getting low on stock on a lot of things so it s been a great year ingram said the covered bridge festival is one of the biggest festivals in indiana this massive festival requires early preparation that meece said already began for next year parke county incorporated is passing out letters to all the vendors asking if they want to come back next year meece said
i t is important for policymakers in pakistan to understand that how the rate of growth in productivity within an economy which is measured by its total factor productivity tfp is also closely linked to the growth rate of its gdp per capita various empirical studies have found tfp variables to be statistically significant in contributing towards economic growth and higher national output levels in the context of developing countries an economic development strategy must therefore be focused on improving the skills of the workforce reducing the cost of doing business and making available the resources that businesses need to compete and thrive in today s global economy in their paper published in 2016 namra awais and rashid amjad currently serving as members on the prime minister s ecc stated that in pakistan over the last 35 years 1980 2015 the contribution of physical capital and education remains modest and there has been a declining trend in tfp growth with the lack of sustained growth and low and declining levels of investment appear to be the most important causes of the low contribution of tfp to productivity growth given the countries abysmal performance with respect to its tfp growth the underlying root cause behind pakistan s sluggish economic growth must be understood the standard weighting of tfp is 70 percent for labour and 30 percent for capital therefore sustained long term economic growth comes from increases in labour productivity the first determinant of labour productivity is human capital which is the accumulated knowledge from education and experience skills and expertise that the average worker in an economy possesses developing countries like pakistan need to seek ways of increasing their citizens stock of human capital through expanding the educational attainment of their population output can grow by making people themselves more productive this may be achieved through the acquisition of skills also referred to as human capital accumulation which enables a person to do more using even the same amount of capital the government must devise programmes aimed at increasing investment in physical capital relative to total output to promote greater gdp per capita such policies increase the value added per worker and seek ways of increasing their citizens stock of human capital through expanding the educational attainment of their population the second factor that determines labour productivity is technological change technological change is a combination of invention advances in knowledge and innovation which is putting that advance to use in a new product or service technological progress measured as changes tfp does contribute positively to per capita gdp growth however technology is the systematic application of scientific or other sources of knowledge to practical tasks a policy implication for governments in developing countries is to therefore undertake measures that combine capital labour and skills more efficiently while applying new technology to knowledge a recent study by the bcg henderson institute boston consulting group found there to be a weak link between investment in technology and productivity growth but a strong link with labour market tightness the authors of the study conclude that technology is the spark but tight labour markets are the enabler of productivity growth a number of other studies provide strong evidence to back their claim romer 1990 develops a model in which growth is driven by technological change that arises from intentional investment decisions made by profit maximising firms his main conclusions are that the stock of human capital determines the rate of growth and that having a large population is not sufficient to generate growth part of this balancing act is first acknowledging that human and labour capital development labour markets push productivity growth and thereby can expand an economy s capacity as peter drucker once remarked the ultimate resource in economic development is people it is people not capital or raw materials that develop an economy this matters because productivity or output per input pays for higher wages which helps distribute income fairly in an economy without infringing upon the profitability of business owners human capital development and labour productivity is therefore the right foundation towards long run economic prosperity for any developing country in order to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth moving forward policymakers must first ask themselves the following question what is the calculus of innovation the answer is that the calculus of innovation is really quite simple knowledge drives innovation innovation drives productivity and productivity drives economic growth the writer is an economist and strategic planning expert
a roaring trade in bullish crude oil options says the 2021 energy rally is far from over traders once again are betting that the u s oil benchmark will surge above 100 a barrel from a recent 82 as early as december u s crude known as west texas intermediate or wti is up 10 this month and 70 this year but it hasn t hit 100 since the oil crash of 2014 wagers across the atlantic are even more aggressive some traders are betting brent crude the global benchmark will hit a record high of 200 a barrel by december 2022 according to data from provider quikstrike options give investors the right to buy or sell at a stated price by a certain date traders typically use options to make directional bets or to hedge their portfolios oil prices rise on tight supply set for weekly gain of more than 2 the bullish trading amounts to a gamble that supply chain disruptions and regional shortages will keep pushing energy markets higher despite a slowing global economic expansion and concerns that higher oil and natural gas prices will crimp consumer spending the wagers also show that investors drawn by the small upfront investments and potentially quick payoffs of options trades are piling into energy markets echoing trades in the stock market this year i haven t seen crazy strikes like this in a long time said mark benigno co director of energy trading at stonex group inc referring to the price in the underlying asset at which the options become exercisable the momentum and trend is higher wall street is watching whether the energy price surge will dent third quarter corporate earnings delta air lines inc on wednesday warned investors that it expects higher fuel prices to undercut profit in the fourth quarter in coming days earnings from airlines including united airlines holdings inc and american airlines group inc will shed more light on the issue the supply squeeze already has had profound effects u s crude recently hit its highest level in almost seven years natural gas prices have more than doubled this year and are trading above 5 per million british thermal units some warn of a prolonged bout of inflation others that high energy prices will hit consumers who are already expecting to pay more for heat this winter 100 oil talk pushes department of energy into panic mode wall street is watching whether the energy price surge will dent third quarter corporate earnings delta air lines inc on wednesday warned investors that it expects higher fuel prices to undercut profit in the fourth quarter in coming days earnings from airlines including united airlines holdings inc and american airlines group inc will shed more light on the issue the supply squeeze already has had profound effects u s crude recently hit its highest level in almost seven years natural gas prices have more than doubled this year and are trading above 5 per million british thermal units some warn of a prolonged bout of inflation others that high energy prices will hit consumers who are already expecting to pay more for heat this winter call options tied to wti jumping to 95 or 180 a barrel have also been popular over the past week quikstrike data show mr benigno said that speculative traders have made aggressive bullish bets on oil over the past year as the commodity s rally accelerated many of them appeared to close out their existing options positions and pegged their bets to even higher prices in a wager that oil would keep soaring get fox business on the go by clicking here at the same time the volume of speculative activity could make for large single day pullbacks in the oil market if economic data or other information comes to light that conflicts with the bullish narrative jpmorgan chase co analysts said this month that they expect brent crude oil to trade at 84 a barrel by the end of the year bullish sentiment and positioning alongside the prospect of a colder winter have driven prices up however ebbing demand could weigh on prices oil fundamentals could ultimately disappoint the hype they wrote in a note on oct 1 we also think downside risks are underappreciated

the world s largest banks posted record third quarter earnings this past week putting 2021 on track to be the most lucrative year in history for the financial world bloomberg estimates that altogether the leading banks have taken in 170 billion over the last four quarters starting with the fourth quarter of 2020 this is the most profitable four consecutive quarters for banks in history in this december 13 2016 photo the logo for goldman sachs appears above a trading post on the floor of the new york stock exchange ap photo richard drew file leading the banks is jpmorgan chase which during this time made an estimated 131 million per day goldman sachs made a net third quarter profit of 5 4 billion this surpassed estimates that it would take in 3 7 billion and was up from 3 4 billion last year the investment bank has now recorded a profit of 17 7 billion for the first nine months of year itself higher than any 12 month period in its history the news sent goldman shares 3 8 percent higher having already gained 80 percent this year profits are up at all the major american banks bank of america increased its profits by 64 percent citigroup by 48 percent morgan stanley by 38 percent and jpmorgan chase by 24 percent in europe banks also performed well while not as spectacularly as their us counterparts ubs and barclays both posted their highest quarterly profit in over a decade their profits over the past 12 months were 7 6 and 7 4 billion respectfully deutsche bank posted its highest profits in eight years the stock index for us banks has gone up 59 percent this past year while for european banks it has risen by 56 percent an analyst for oppenheimer speaking to the financial times described the quarter as quite literally off the charts the record earnings come as a historic strike wave begins in the us and global food and energy prices surge meanwhile the pandemic continues to rage with weekly global deaths of almost 50 000 people according to our world in data the surge in bank profits is fundamentally bound up with the unprecedented pumping of money into the stock markets by all the major central banks in particular the us federal reserve is electronically printing 120 billion of new money every month and buying us backed treasuries and corporate bonds from major banks flooding these institutions with cash this massive loan of money with no strings attached allows the banks to gorge themselves on risky financial practices by trickling down to other sections of capital stimulating investments the money encourages acquisitions corporate mergers and ipos initial public offering when a company goes public with its stock much of the record profits that are being made by these banks comes from precisely this type of speculative activity specifically banks charge large fees for handling mergers acquisitions and ipos they charge fees for advising companies finding sellers and buyers executing the financial actions involved and raising capital during the process mergers and acquisitions frequently mean job cuts eliminating so called redundancies in companies in the most recent quarter global merger activity rose to a record 1 52 trillion last quarter jpmorgan chase tripled its fees to 1 23 billion bank of america increased its fees by 65 percent to 654 million morgan stanley tripled its fees to 1 27 billion and goldman sachs increased its fees by 31 percent to 1 6 billion in a comment to the financial times financier chris kotowski said ith the fed printing 120 billion of new money each and every month every ceo in the world has lots of monopoly money to play with so m a and investment spending and capital raising will likely remain strong indeed this monopoly money is what is keeping capitalist financial markets afloat markets built on top of a mountain of debt and speculation liable to pop while the federal reserve has announced it may begin to draw back the asset purchasing program in november it has repeatedly delayed this move for fear of sparking a sell off on wall street as the banks make record profits the bottom half of the us have collectively negative wealth the entire bottom 90 percent of americans according to economists emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman own only 26 percent of the country s wealth this leaves the top 10 percent with 74 percent of the wealth a number that does not even include offshore accounts that fly under the radar few banks expect their profit feast to last morgan stanley ceo james gorman drew attention in comments last week to the effects of the fed tapering its cash injections he stated it s good to be watchful there s certainly nothing that suggests there are any issues but markets are bouncing a little bit and over the next 18 months we ll see more of that as the fed starts to move jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon said he thought that while the cash injections or quantitative easing as it is known may be wound down interest rates would likely remain at record lows for another year this means inflation might go higher than people think a further surge in the cost of goods including food and energy could itself lead to significant economic social and political explosions the international monetary fund has urged central banks to be very very vigilant about workers demanding higher wages in response to inflation an imf report warned that an increase in core prices due to inflation and higher wages could lead to a spiral of doubt in the economy that would endanger growth a catch 22 faces the financial oligarchy either let the debt bubble balloon further driven by easy money policies or burst it through tightening risking a financial collapse neither option poses a solution the former risks widespread inflation and devaluation of cash only making the next financial crisis larger the latter bursts the bubble that has already grown larger than 2008 s pile of debt in either case the outcome will be the intensification of class struggle both in the united states and globally as these interconnected international economic processes reach their logical conclusion

september 30 2021 13 57 los angeles sept 30 2021 prnewswire southern california gas co socalgas today announced that it is blending hydrogen to fuel a household system and appliances at its engineering analysis center and centralized training facility as part of the testing technicians are measuring the performance of common household appliances like stoves wall heaters and forced air furnaces when they are fueled with a blend of hydrogen and natural gas this is the next step moving out of the lab and toward future blending into the natural gas grid with an emphasis on safety and training socalgas is among the first utilities in the nation to test the effects of a hydrogen blend on natural gas infrastructure and equipment in a controlled field environment this effort utilizes the same engineering and technology that will be used to blend into the natural gas grid in the future the use of hydrogen either blended with natural gas or delivered via a dedicated pipeline is one important component of socalgas strategy to achieve net zero emissions in its operations and the energy it delivers by 2045 preliminary results of testing that began earlier this summer show the household natural gas appliances are compatible with up to a 20 hydrogen blend these initial findings are consistent with previous international research and lab testing this effort provides key operational and safety experience including testing for pipeline leaks that will enable socalgas to implement larger scale hydrogen blending demonstrations socalgas continues to test the impacts of blending hydrogen with natural gas on pipelines and appliances furthermore separate national renewable energy laboratory nrel analysis and several international industry studies have indicated the potential to blend hydrogen into existing distribution pipelines serving end use customers in a net zero emissions california clean fuels like hydrogen will play an essential role in supporting a reliable electric grid in eliminating emissions from hard to electrify sectors of the economy like transportation and industry and in making the transition to a clean energy economy affordable said neil navin vice president of clean energy innovations for socalgas the european hydrogen backbone initiative is a great example on how cooperation can accelerate these goals there some 23 nations are working to repurpose 70 percent of their existing natural gas infrastructure to carry clean hydrogen to a cluster of demand centers across the european union investing in tests that aim to demonstrate the potential of hydrogen is key to identifying solutions that can help us address our current climate crisis said assemblymember bill quirk socalgas commitment to decarbonization innovations help advance the energy transition several analyses including the los angeles renewable energy study la100 by the los angeles department of water and power ladwp and nrel highlight the need in 2045 for renewably produced and storable fuels to maintain reliability in the power sector in addition many experts agree that clean fuels like hydrogen will be essential for decarbonizing hard to electrify sectors of the economy like industry and heavy duty trucking socalgas is actively engaged in more than 10 pilot projects related to hydrogen including a partnership with netherlands based hyet hydrogen on technology that could transform hydrogen distribution and enable the rapid expansion of hydrogen fueling stations for fuel cell electric vehicles fcevs the technology would allow hydrogen to be easily and affordably transported via the natural gas pipeline system then extracted and compressed at fueling stations that provide hydrogen fcevs in addition later this year socalgas will break ground on its award winning h2 hydrogen home the first project of its kind in the u s the h2 hydrogen home aims to show how carbon free gas made from renewable electricity can be used in pure form or as a blend to fuel clean energy systems of the future when the home is built in the city of downey it will be the first fully integrated demonstration project with solar panels a battery and electrolyzer to convert solar energy to hydrogen and a fuel cell to supply electricity for the home in june 2021 socalgas and its h2 hydrogen home were named one of fast company s world changing ideas

imf chief economist gita gopinath speaks during an interview with afp at the international monetary fund headquarters in washington dc on tuesday afp photo imf chief economist gita gopinath speaks during an interview with afp at the international monetary fund headquarters in washington dc on tuesday afp photo menafn jordan times washington rising energy prices are weighing on households but the recent spike is unlikely to fuel a 1970s style oil crisis and should retreat early next year international monetary fund imf chief economist gita gopinath said on tuesday energy prices collapsed last year amid the shutdowns imposed to contain the covid 19 pandemic but 2021 has brought a sharp rebound in demand as the global economy recovered gopinath said in an interview in the energy market a long cold winter followed by a particularly hot summer led to greater demand and depleted stocks especially gas reserves in europe this recovery is really quite unique she said speaking on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank supplies of many other goods have not been able to rebound as quickly as demand hampered in part by the spread of the delta variant of covid 19 which has made workers reluctant to return to their jobs and snarled supply chains those labour shortages are feeding into price pressures in countries like germany the united states and japan she said we are in a difficult situation where we ve seen prices go up very sharply and the key question is whether that will persist she said worst case scenario while energy prices will be elevated for the next couple of months we expect that to come back down by the end of the first quarter next year and into the second quarter she said once we get past the winter months we will be in a better place oil prices have soared in recent weeks jumping to multiyear highs on monday with the benchmark wti crude jumping above 80 a barrel for the first time since october 2014 and up 30 per cent since august which sent major stock markets tumbling the increase in energy prices has ramped up fears that overall inflation could tick even higher and hinder the global economic recovery gopinath cautioned that the weather will play a factor since a very severe winter could lead to broader power outages that will have a much bigger effect on the world the worst outcome would be an extremely severe winter in the northern hemisphere driving up demand for energy combined with a failure of producers including the opec to respond with increased output which could feed into headline inflation she said in february 2021 severe weather marked by polar temperatures and snowstorms caused a surge in electricity consumption in the southern united states texas with a population of nearly 29 million was unable to meet the explosion in demand and blackouts affected hundreds of thousands of homes however gopinath does not expect a crisis like the one seen in the 1970s because the world relies much less on energy relative to the size of the economy it would take a much bigger ratcheting up in gas prices for instance to have a kind of a stagflationary event she said referring to the economic crisis in the 1970s when inflation spiraled due to high oil prices as growth stalled the imf s latest forecasts call for inflation to return to pre pandemic levels by the middle of 2022 but warn of high uncertainty and upside risks in the united states

washington want proof that the biden administration is really the second incarnation of the carter administration we have runaway inflation americans trapped overseas a member of the first family who tried to do business with libya and a president begging the organization of the petroleum exporting countries and allies opec plus to increase oil production it s like the 1970s all over again gas prices have risen 1 a gallon since joe biden s election while crude oil prices have doubled since november to 83 per barrel and some analysts predict they could rise by another 10 before the end of the year natural gas prices have shot up more than 150 in the same period which means winter heating bills for the half of american homes that use natural gas are projected to be 30 higher than last year 49 higher in the midwest this is the result of deliberate policy choices biden has made clear his intention to tax and regulate the fossil fuel industry out of existence during the 2020 campaign he declared i guarantee you we re going to end fossil fuel well those threats have consequences today the number of rigs producing oil across the united states is 528 roughly half its 2019 peak under president donald trump when you tell oil producers you plan to put them out of business they are not going to bolster production or drill more wells when your 3 5 trillion build back better plan would impose punitive taxes on oil and gas the producers are going to get the picture that building back better doesn t include them and when you make clear you plan to destroy an industry banks and investment firms stop investing in it the new york times reports that the flow of capital from wall street has slowed to a trickle after a decade in which investors poured over 1 4 trillion into north american oil and gas producers through stock and bond issues and loans as woke capitalists pare their exposure to fossil fuels to meet the commitments they have made to fight climate change blackrock the world s largest asset manager has announced that it intends to have net zero emissions across our entire assets under management by 2050 the result less fossil fuel production and higher prices with lower income americans who can afford it the least penalized the most at the pump biden s energy policy is not only hostile it is incoherent the president canceled the keystone xl pipeline between the united states and canada but then greenlighted the nord stream 2 pipeline between russia and germany he declares his intention to reduce fossil fuel production at home in the name of climate change but then asks opec plus to produce more oil abroad increased production will result in the same carbon emissions no matter where the oil is drilled why not produce it here in america under trump the united states became an energy superpower he withdrew from the paris climate accord approved the keystone xl pipeline opened the arctic national wildlife refuge to exploration rolled back obama era regulations such as the clean power plan that held back domestic exploration and production and enabled the united state to supplant russia and saudi arabia as the world s largest oil producer that not only created millions of jobs it made america energy independent for the first time in years and it transformed the national security landscape strengthening the united states vis a vis russia china and iran now biden seems determined to cede our status as an energy superpower in just a few short months he has brought us back to where we were in the carter years pleading with a foreign oil cartel to increase production rather than increasing production ourselves during the 1970s when america was locked in a twilight struggle with soviet communism what did the left demand nuclear disarmament well today america has become the world s preeminent energy superpower and what is the left demanding energy disarmament at the very moment the united states has achieved strategic dominance in a critical area for our economic and national security the biden administration and its progressive allies want to unilaterally disarm and with energy prices skyrocketing americans are now paying the price for the democrats war on fossil fuels all we need is for bell bottoms and disco to come back and our transformation into the carter era will be complete
it looks like the defence industry lobby group the australian strategic policy institute is running low on funds nothing else can account for the surfacing of its executive director peter jennings on the opinion pages of the australian conjuring up a fictional version of a chinese bid to grab taiwan one finds it passing strange that jennings would seek to write this kind of fantasy stuff after us president joe biden made it a point to stress that he and chinese president xi jinping had both affirmed their commitment to the existing taiwan policy during talks in september additionally the news that an online summit is planned between the two leaders was also ventilated the us probably did that to try and cool things down given reports that chinese aircraft have been making flights close to taiwan in increased numbers so while the americans are trying to cool down things jennings prefers to pump up the volume and indulge in fanciful scenarios aspi s annual report for 2020 21 appears to be ready but has not yet been placed on its website the only part of the report which has been published on the web isfor 2020 21 when one looks at the list of sponsors for aspi it is clear why things do not look very bright for jennings a fair few have fallen off since i last wrote about the institute among them the shipbuilder austal and mbda missile systems among aspi s sponsors are us defence contractor lockheed martin us defence supplier northrop grumman swedish defence company saab the australian arm of american defence contractor raytheon french defence giant thales and naval group the international design and build partner for australia s future submarine program given australia s jettisoning of the contract with france to build submarines and the adoption of a new deal with the us and the uk to acquire nuclear submarines instead which may not eventuate until the 2040s jennings may also lose the naval group as a sponsor within the next year or so aspi s cyber policy centre is backed by auda the american cloud behemoth amazon web services facebook the australian signals directorate addaxis the cyber security co operative research centre google jacobs microsoft palo alto networks the department of prime minister and cabinet property council of australia splunk thales macquarie government and upguard in this latter group too jennings has seen a few sponsors call it a day among them the australian government department services australia with money pouring in from all these sources it s a mystery how aspi calls itself independent and non partisan its deception is helped no end by newspapers like the australian and the abc not identifying clearly who jennings backers are jennings has every right to propagate his own views inflammatory as they are but one should be given a clear picture of who is funding the show the one who pays the piper calls the tune and australians need to be told clearly who that paymaster is and he never does that aspi has an agreement to receive 4 million a year in grants from the australian government from 2018 19 to 2022 23 an additional 5 million has been granted for an us office jennings tactics are well worn ones hype up the fear factor so that countries in the region will stock up on arms the arms industry will be laughing all the way to the bank and drop a few more crumbs aspi s way the us and the uk used to do it in the middle east during the 1980s and 1990s despite the fact that arms supplied to countries in that region would be needlessly used for bloodshed and not to defend against an attack in december last year jennings was beating the war drums at the same time that many business leaders and some politicians were calling for dialling down the rhetoric between australia and china because of the fact that beijing is an important export market in his latest op ed jennings says the taiwanese assess perhaps a three year time frame before an attack while the us military command at indopacom in honolulu considers a military assault in six years is possible but of course peter jennings noble warrior that he is sees it differently and would like to shirtfront xi jinping right away screenshots from aspi funding breakdown
after hitting a covid 19 induced low in march 2021 the nifty 50 has doubled driven both by foreign flows fpi inflows into the indian stock market amounted to 14 billion over fy20 21 and domestic inflows amounting to 25 billion over fy20 21 the sustained vigour of this bull run has attracted millions of new investors into the indian stock market as per sebi 14 2 million new investors have entered the stock market over the past 12 months in fact prior to covid s onset in march 2020 there were around 11 million active investors in india over the past 18 months this number has more than doubled to around 25 million active investors this bull run is not a flash in the pan over the past decade the nifty50 total return index or tri has compounded at 11 per annum and created 1 trillion of wealth the stock market has therefore become a potent source of sustainable wealth creation in india it stands to reason therefore that if the wealth created by the stock market spreads across the country it gives free market reforms a degree of mass legitimacy that it has hitherto lacked in india furthermore in a country where the reserve bank of india says a mere 5 of household wealth is in the form of financial assets the stock market can potentially drive financialisation of wealth however there is good reason to believe that this is not happening in other words the beneficiaries of the rise in the indian stock market are a privileged minority of indian investors data from amfi the mutual fund trade body shows that 84 of mutual fund investors by the value of assets come from the 30 largest cities in india so why is this happening given the ease with which demat accounts can be opened and the extensive network of mutual fund distributors why are the masses not investing in the stock market where the overall household financial savings rate is typically around 20 of income
on the fourth day of iowa s largest strike in decades george clark of podcast by george and i planned to interview some john deere workers on the picket line in ankeny we learned that united auto workers which represents some 10 000 deere employees on strike is discouraging rank and file members from speaking to the media however jd neal was authorized to talk with us outside the uaw hall in des moines neal has worked at the deere plant in ankeny for seventeen years and is among the leaders of the uaw local 450 george posted the video of our interview with neal on youtube on concerns that led to the strike neal said he couldn t discuss specifics of the uaw contract labor reporter jonah furman explained the key points of the company s offer on pay and retirement benefits which angered many workers speaking broadly about the mood within the union we felt that what john deere put out in front of us wasn t fair and we re fighting to receive what s fair and not just for us but for the labor movement in general this isn t just about us it s about the americans out there middle class working americans we re fighting for us right now but we re also fighting for everybody else on the overwhelming vote to reject the contract it s hard to get 90 percent of any large group of people to agree on anything so i wanted to hear neal s take on why 90 percent of uaw members voted to reject deere s proposed contract in an election with more than 90 percent turnout i think this time it was overwhelming because as the local here around iowa illinois missouri we re showing what strength in numbers is about so to see a 90 percent no i believe that s a strong statement saying that the working class is tired of corporate greed and the corporations padding their pockets and not paying what s owed george asked how the inequities facing deere workers factored into the decision to go on strike the union members were deemed essential workers during the covid 19 pandemic meanwhile company s stock price tripled and the ceo s pay increased by 160 percent from 2019 to 2020 neal explained it pissed us off 100 percent you called me essential we came to work every single day and we continued to make you millions not millions billions of dollars you say you want to give us 5 to 6 percent up front it s a slap in the face how much extra work were uaw members taking on during the pandemic it would depend some people would work five day weeks some people would work up to seven days and did we take on extra damn right we did people were out sick we couldn t come to work if we sneezed they d send us home so somebody had to pick up the slack and that was the people that were able to be there and we did that so yeah it was something to say the least on preparing for a potentially long haul the last strike at john deere which started in 1986 lasted a little more than five months neal said the union has no idea how long it s going to last but we re prepared and ready to stand strong as long as it takes the uaw has a strike fund that will pay each worker on strike 275 a week the union will also cover members health care for the duration of the strike since deere has announced it s cutting workers on strike off from company provided health insurance later this month update the company reversed itself on october 22 saying it will continue to provide health care to uaw represented employees the union is organizing pickets around the clock with some workers scheduled for shifts and others showing up whenever they are able during the day and night we voted no for a reason we didn t vote for a vacation do they plan to continue with round the clock pickets as the weather gets colder they do obviously keeping safety of our members firsthand neal mentioned that some people have donated propane tanks so the uaw can set up propane heaters on the lines open burn barrels are not allowed within ankeny city limits on salaried employees working on the factory floor deere has told some of its non union employees to work shifts on the floor to help keep things going asked for his thoughts on the company assigning office employees to do jobs they re not trained for neal replied good luck that s all i can say good luck that s good luck already on october 15 at least one deere facility had to make a 911 call and a non union worker crashed a tractor inside a factory the labor reporter furman learned from his sources furman has spoken with salaried deere employees who are frustrated about having to do these jobs and who feel sympathy for the union members because the company has already cut pensions for its white collar workforce some have said they won t cross the picket line on the community support neal said it was very heartwarming to see overwhelming support in the des moines area and all over iowa people have spontaneously brought donations after hearing about the strike some have sent food water clothes or toiletries from outside the state the food pantry in the union hall on nw 6th has grown and neal said members are encouraged to come down to pick up whatever they need we ll always have a hot meal the local posted on facebook october 16 that they are in need of take out meal containers disposable containers with lids and disposable foil containers for cooking on news coverage of the strike i wondered whether neal thought anything had been missing from news reporting on the strike he hasn t followed it very closely but from what he s seen the media coverage has been pretty fair as for what he wants the public to understand i would hope that people know that we re not the greedy ones we want a fair wage we want to be able to retire someday with a pension to be able to continue to pay our bills we want to be able to send our kids to school help our kids pay for school with the work that we do between welding machinists assemblers forklift drivers all around it s hard work that takes a toll on the body and if we don t have anything when we retire what good are we going to be to our families and to the community that we re going to give back to on two tiered contracts deere has used two tiered contracts since 1997 giving older employees a better deal than newer hires that divide and conquer strategy has been successful for many corporations in getting labor unions to accept new contracts that reduce benefits or lower wage growth why didn t deere workers go along with the latest contract proposal because people are starting to understand that that benefits the company that does not benefit the workers neal was working for deere when the 2015 contract was negotiated many workers were unhappy with that deal which barely passed by fewer than 200 votes neal speculated that many people who had voted yes six years ago paid attention this time final thoughts was there anything we didn t ask that neal thought was important for people to know just continue the support know that the people out there walking the line we re not the bad guys we re just hard working middle class people that want a fair wage and a benefit package to you know just live our lives we don t want to live in mansions or buy a lamborghini or anything like that how much solidarity is there within the uaw neal said that in the seventeen years he s been active in the union this is the strongest solidarity i ve seen yet outside of the company locals the uaw nationally and internationally has promised to support the deere workers efforts i feel pretty confident that we re pretty strong right now top image screenshot from podcast by george video of laura belin interviewing j d neal of the uaw local 450 on october 17
fiona hill worked on trump s national security council and later provided compelling testimony in his first impeachment trial i asked her if she feared for democracy s future should trump win again we re already there she told me i m worried about it now millions of people are showing they don t want any criticism of trump democracy is becoming a dirty word something that s anti trump advertisement ask the white house what it s doing to defend voting rights and the stock reply is plenty one aide sent me a spreadsheet illustrating biden and vice president kamala harris s attention to the issue the breakdown showed nearly three dozen speeches meetings and events for harris and six for biden attorney general merrick garland has set up a criminal task force to crack down on intimidation of election employees a growing problem in georgia a state that biden narrowly won an election worker was emptying trash from a warehouse one day when hecklers surrounded him and told he would be going to jail gabriel sterling an official in the georgia secretary of state s office told me even biden s allies worry that the progress is too slow is the president doing enough to spotlight the perilous state of american democracy i asked senator sherrod brown an ohio democrat no of course not he said democrats are understandably antsy senate majority leader chuck schumer is planning for members to vote on the bill as early as wednesday a delay would be costly republican controlled legislatures are already coming out with redistricting maps that would lock in their majority status for the next decade i wish senator manchin the best in his effort to round up some republican votes but we cannot have infinite patience democratic senator chris van hollen of maryland told me the clock is ticking here we ve got to get these protections in place right away practically that looks unrealistic unless manchin and simena relent and agree either to nuke the filibuster or carve out a specific exception for voting rights biden could pressure the duo to do just that but with his party holding a one vote majority in the senate he would risk antagonizing two people he can t afford to lose when i asked a white house official if biden supports lifting the filibuster to pass voting rights protections i got a tepid reply i don t think we can rule out anything said the official who was not authorized to speak on the record
by mark thornton via mises the federal reserve has been increasing the money supply at an explosive rate the federal budget deficits and the trade deficit are record levels governments both foreign and domestic have locked down people restricting production and consumption how should this be viewed by an economist there is clearly chaos in the economy and hardly a day goes by when i don t find unusual if not unprecedented situations in day to day economic life however many people and economists are either oblivious to the problems or in denial things are normal for them politicians are mostly in this camp for economists and investment promotors inflation is transitory they don t know how the economy works and they expect near perfection from the economy and entrepreneurs this view is wrong the chaos is all too real for most others homemakers who spend household income are seeing their purchasing power shrink their choices disappearing and more of their time consumed stretching the family budgets christmas shopping will be worse than normal chaos deniers are further entrenched in their experience by the mainstream media msm the problems are either not reported by the msm or are masked by aggregate statistics like price inflation i e the consumer price index low unemployment wage increases and extremely high stock markets and real estate especially housing prices these stats make people feel good or at least less nervous below the government economists radar there is real economic suffering small businesses are hurting and going out of business based on help wanted signs i drive by every day it is extremely difficult to hire employees or purchase inputs one local bbq restaurant recently had a sign that said out of chicken pork and beef big business is likewise finding roadblocks throughout their supply chains primarily because of lockdowns and covid restrictions this government roadblock to economic life is epitomized by the five hundred thousand shipping containers stuck off the port of long beach california meanwhile domestic inventories are dwindling for everything from houses to mayonnaise austrian economics provides an understanding of the causes of this chaos and the way to solve it the fed s actions have been a tidal wave force against the economy printing money has given some signs of prosperity but its main known effect tangible effects are higher prices malinvestment and more wealth redistributed from the middle class to the very wealthy the solution is straightforward the central bank needs to stop its policy of propping up the markets for government bonds and home mortgages and the perverse effects it is creating on the general loan market in the form of ultralow interest rates promises of the fed tapering where they do fewer asset purchases is really too little too late completely ending assets purchases by the fed would stop their mischief limit the damage and would make stocks bonds and homes more affordable for americans lockdowns and restrictions are a great harm to the us and world economies why are so many cargo ships sitting waiting for unloading why are others going unfilled in the first place why aren t truckers driving product to market why isn t product being placed on shelves there are millions of details here but in many cases workers are not available or are unwilling to comply with covid restrictions and requirements production is stuck in a quagmire of government intervention a big piece of the problem are the restrictions and subsidies in the us labor markets special unemployment benefits and stimulus checks from the government mean that not working pays more than working plus more leisure time for those that accept being on the public dole in one recent week i engaged with three small businesses they could not have continued to operate if they had not been able to hire a few new workers who were unwilling to be on the dole or more likely had not realized how easy it is to collect unemployment locally mcdonalds is offering 50 percent higher than minimum wage for fourteen year old kids and they are still having trouble attracting workers we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us the bottlenecks empty shelves business closures reduced hours and worker wanted signs are not the direct result of price controls nor are they the fault of the market economy rather prices in some areas of the economy need to rise so high and so fast to harmonize supply and demand that entrepreneurs can hardly keep pace in this environment dominated by government interventions and heightened uncertainty i truly sympathize with entrepreneurs who are trying to save jobs keep food on our tables plus pay a huge chunk of taxes locally an ice cream stand that has been successfully in business for almost seven decades had to shut down it wasn t the complexity of the business the lack of product or even the higher prices it charged they could not find and maintain a workforce through the maze of restrictions of unemployment subsidies the current owner of this beloved multigeneration family owned business explained we don t really know what s going to happen it just depends on covid and when people want to start working it is unclear what aspect s of covid is their primary concern but the main complaint is that obody wants to work anymore the federal government in a variety of ways is what killed this business it is evident and increasingly clear that unemployment insurance bonuses and government stimulus checks must be stopped for the economy to recover it s not just retail products that are not readily available even at higher prices people who repair and replace things that wear out or break in normal circumstances are also much scarcer repair and replace service dealers are having a hard time finding parts replacement models and workers to make parts and products and to service and replace them in a timely manner i have had several such companies not answer their phone and not be able to offer appointments or show up on time because of a lack of parts and employees all of these companies were reliable and showed up on time for repair appointments before the government caused chaos buying a new car or large flat screen smart tv is a joyous occasion in a family s material life we know that we will get years of enjoyment for a good price how does this compare to going without a refrigerator hot water heater or air conditioner because the product was not available it should be clear that the cause of our new economic problems is massive across the board government intervention here and abroad among the negative consequences are these harms and dislocations we face the solution is to remove those government interventions not only have they caused a great deal of interference in economic transactions but they have destroyed businesses and people s lives many have also even died as a result from the despair and chaos not the disease meanwhile social media and internet giants and pharmaceutical companies among others have received an enormous unearned windfall this is an economic crisis and it is one of the government s making economic statistics and stock markets led by a small number of superwinners from the lockdowns have masked the calamity the sure remedy is to end the interventions especially the fed s inflationary policy and the restrictions and subsidies on production and consumption this would help restore the market economy to a functioning state author contact

tabahi ka nuskha hai it s a recipe for disaster tabdeeli ka tohfa gift from a party that promised change picture abhee baqi hai meray dost more is yet to come my friend mar jaen tau achha hai it s better to die these are just a few responses from the members of a whatsapp group as people vented their helplessness shortly after someone posted in that space the finance ministry s order increasing the oil prices on saturday morning as you scroll down further you find an opposition parliamentarian complaining that she couldn t cook breakfast that morning because there was no gas in the pipes the conversation becomes much more intense or does it among the consumers posting news of the increase in power prices alongside a federal minister s statement predicting the resolution of the almost two week old standoff between the imran khan government and the powerful military establishment over the appointment of new chief of the inter services intelligence with many insisting that the party is already over for the ruling party that may be stretching things a bit too far but the prime minister and his party are surely in for a winter of massive discontent indications are that the pti government s pro cyclical growth strategy has already started unraveling even before taking off the growth party that started six months ago with the induction by the premier of shaukat tarin in place of abdul hafeez sheikh is now being wound up slowly but surely as the country moves back into the international monetary fund programme imf after a recess the gamble of using pakistan s enhanced leverage over washington and other western capitals after the us pullout from afghanistan and the taliban takeover of the war ravaged nation has failed to help islamabad secure the expected concessions from the imf and cash from americans at least until now in order to secure more multilateral dollars as well as the imf endorsement to show off to the international investors for raising fresh debt to keep the economy afloat shaukat tarin has agreed to do what he said would kill growth and unleash inflation raise the base electricity prices by rs1 39 a unit addressing a news conference energy minister hammad azhar said the decision was taken during a meeting with the world bank management justifying the decision he said the increase in power rates had been necessitated by the expensive power projects contracted by the previous government much beyond the country s needs yet we have not increased tariff as much as the international lending institutions insisted he said the government s defence of the power tariff increase seems rich considering its claims and the impact of its economic policies over the last three years the imf wanted a rs3 35 per unit increase in march but the government did not allow it and instead increased only rs1 95per unit the remaining rs1 39 per unit increase was delayed till now the spi sensitive price index inflation reading for the last week shows that the index which monitors price movements of 51 essential items on weekly basis has soared by 12 66 per cent in one year the new energy price increases will further fuel inflation in the country putting more financial stress on the low middle income households that have seen their real wages shrink rapidly under the pti administration quite unsurprisingly the government is again trying to divert the attention of people from their increasing cost of living to its unproductive meaningless actions against the sugar mill owners but these gimmicks seldom pay off people will not have gas to burn and money to buy electricity and put food on the table this winter will they care if imran wins or loses his battle over the appointment of isi chief remarked a pro pti corporate executive on social media with islamabad back into the imf fold in the next several days or weeks we may see the electricity rates go up again and again in upcoming months along with the government raking up loans through euro bonds and sakuks to shore up its foreign exchange reserves and support the home currency that has already depreciated to more than 171 to the dollar and is forecasted by fitch ratings to go down to 180 a dollar in 2023 both the central bank and the finance ministry have already moved to slow down the pace of economic growth engineered in the last one and a half years through their expansive monetary and fiscal stimulus as rapid import growth brings new pressures on current account imbalances the sbp has repeatedly boasted of its historically high debt based foreign exchange reserves in recent months but practically the stocks are good only for three months of imports like at any given time in the past indications are that the pti government s pro cyclical growth strategy has already started unraveling even before taking off the reemergence of imbalances in the country s macroeconomic framework is forcing the policymakers to retract their steps and knock at the imf doors like its predecessor imran khan s pti too has expectedly failed to prove that it can forge and sustain growth with pro cyclical policies and trade deficits without actually tackling the longstanding structural issues facing the economy the ruling party cannot say it wasn t warned well in time and repeatedly published in dawn the business and finance weekly october 18th

imf chief economist gita gopinath speaks during an interview with afp at the international monetary fund headquarters in washington dc on tuesday afp photo imf chief economist gita gopinath speaks during an interview with afp at the international monetary fund headquarters in washington dc on tuesday afp photo menafn jordan times washington rising energy prices are weighing on households but the recent spike is unlikely to fuel a 1970s style oil crisis and should retreat early next year international monetary fund imf chief economist gita gopinath said on tuesday energy prices collapsed last year amid the shutdowns imposed to contain the covid 19 pandemic but 2021 has brought a sharp rebound in demand as the global economy recovered gopinath said in an interview in the energy market a long cold winter followed by a particularly hot summer led to greater demand and depleted stocks especially gas reserves in europe this recovery is really quite unique she said speaking on the sidelines of the annual meetings of the imf and world bank supplies of many other goods have not been able to rebound as quickly as demand hampered in part by the spread of the delta variant of covid 19 which has made workers reluctant to return to their jobs and snarled supply chains those labour shortages are feeding into price pressures in countries like germany the united states and japan she said we are in a difficult situation where we ve seen prices go up very sharply and the key question is whether that will persist she said worst case scenario while energy prices will be elevated for the next couple of months we expect that to come back down by the end of the first quarter next year and into the second quarter she said once we get past the winter months we will be in a better place oil prices have soared in recent weeks jumping to multiyear highs on monday with the benchmark wti crude jumping above 80 a barrel for the first time since october 2014 and up 30 per cent since august which sent major stock markets tumbling the increase in energy prices has ramped up fears that overall inflation could tick even higher and hinder the global economic recovery gopinath cautioned that the weather will play a factor since a very severe winter could lead to broader power outages that will have a much bigger effect on the world the worst outcome would be an extremely severe winter in the northern hemisphere driving up demand for energy combined with a failure of producers including the opec to respond with increased output which could feed into headline inflation she said in february 2021 severe weather marked by polar temperatures and snowstorms caused a surge in electricity consumption in the southern united states texas with a population of nearly 29 million was unable to meet the explosion in demand and blackouts affected hundreds of thousands of homes however gopinath does not expect a crisis like the one seen in the 1970s because the world relies much less on energy relative to the size of the economy it would take a much bigger ratcheting up in gas prices for instance to have a kind of a stagflationary event she said referring to the economic crisis in the 1970s when inflation spiraled due to high oil prices as growth stalled the imf s latest forecasts call for inflation to return to pre pandemic levels by the middle of 2022 but warn of high uncertainty and upside risks in the united states

photo credit pexels last week india s finance minister nirmala sitharaman spoke eloquently about how india will witness close to double digit economic growth this financial year one hopes this will happen but such predictions must be taken with a lot of salt reassessments required a high gdp growth rate on an exceptionally low base thanks to the steep shrinking of the indian economy may actually mean nothing moreover if the world bank s latest figures are to be taken at face value one finds that it has again cut india s gdp growth forecast for 2021 22 from 10 1 to 8 3 as kaushik basu former chief economic advisor india pit it since growth was 7 3 in 2020 21 this means over two years india s growth will be 0 49 let us know what type of content would you like to see from us this year hubspot hubspot there is something even more important mere gdp growth may not mean anything what matter is the per capita income that indians enjoy and that is where india appears to have slipped badly see table this is because if your population is large your gdp can be large even with a small per capita number a big gdp gives politicians more money to play around with but if people in that country cannot be wealthy then governance is a big issue just look at the per capita income of sri lanka which just a decade ago was war torn people talked about this country being a basket case because it had sold itself out to the chinese but it is when you look at the per capita number you realise that people in that country are significantly better off and enjoy more purchasing power ditto with bangladesh when the country emerged from a painful separation from pakistan it was hugely dependent on doles from india and elsewhere but its policymakers have managed their affairs better than what india appears to have done in fact it is sad to see india lean toward the us shrugging off the humiliation of the pl480 schemes it subjected india to during the 1970s this was the scheme under which india imported us wheat india has forgotten that the us has never really transferred defence technology to india it gave its buyers knocked down kits which they could screw together even the swiss headquartered nestle sneered at dr verghese kurien sought technology for pasteurization he eventually designed on n his own much of the technology india got for pharma steel defence or even agriculture came largely from two countries russia and israel usa vs usa in fact as things stand now despite panic screams that media has been making about china s precarious economy it is the us which is under immense pressure its purchasing power is diminishing rapidly it may be the biggest military power in the world today but unless it can make its dollar stronger such strengths will become increasingly difficult to sustain ironically the us seems to have become its own enemy had it not tried to block russia from selling its oil and gas to europe the latter would not have been compelled to seek out a trade deal with china today much of china s oil and gas comes through pipelines from russia at extremely attractive terms so while the world may groan under the burden of higher fuel prices china is better off thanks to the us similarly had the us not tried to embargo iran from selling its oil the latter would not have sought out a market in china today the sphere of influence of china with both russia and iran has only made china less dependent on oil from the middle east china s realignments moreover by building the china pakistan economic corridor china has reduced the transit time for oil tanker deliveries from the middle east to its eastern ports from over 12 days to just 2 days that has also made it sidestep the substantial number of naval bases the us has built along the eastern coast of china along with its allies almost overnight almost a quarter of transactions in the world led by oil and gas from russia and iran are now in the chinese rmb not the us that has added to the weakness of the us currency instead the rest of the world must contend with higher fuel prices and the major beneficiaries are both the middle east oil producing countries and the us this is because the oil and gas production in the us itself is not small moreover it has equity stakes in the largest oil exploration centres and refining capacities in the middle east in addition it retains equity stakes in oil exploration centres in south american countries as well so if energy prices go up the biggest beneficiary remains the usa that is something few people talk about finally look at the status of emerging china it remains focused on economic growth and common prosperity notwithstanding shrill doomsday cries about the impending crisis that evergrande and possibly the smaller fantasia will cause to financial markets but then nostradamus like warnings about china are not new and most of them emerge from the us or the uk both countries excel in the art of disinformation people who have travelled through china marvel at its infrastructure its social stability despite a poor ratio of girls to boys you will not hear catcalls on china s streets and its focus on growth it is worth reading a recent tweet about that infrastructure let us know what type of content would you like to see from us this year hubspot hubspot india has the population but not the education medicare and the focus on growth its most productive populations in the south and the west have witnessed declining growth rates even below the replacement rate in sheer contrast its poorer less educated less employable and more fundamentalist populations in north india continue to grow at a rapid rate the fact is that when populations remain less educated with little medicare and poor and are often unemployable the tendency to have more children is well documented one of the reasons why china s population like those in europe and japan is declining is because they are economically better off better educated and more employable than many indians are the one child policy is just part of the whole story if the indian government focusses on providing better education and medicare to the people of uttar pradesh bihar and madhya pradesh and makes them more employable and prosperous you will see birthrates decline there as well and per capita incomes increase india has to begin looking to improving education and employability in these regions quickly mere announcement of more schemes is not enough you need good education medicare and good governance as well eventually talking about gdp growth rates is not enough it could be misleading india must aspire to grow per capita income the way sri lanka has done just staying ahead of pakistan is no benchmark the

will comment on the results in a live webcast beginning at 3 p m cet today please refer to this link the pivotal phase 3 cov compare trial recruited a total of 4 012 participants aged 18 years and older across 26 trial sites in the united kingdom the trial met its co primary endpoints vla2001 demonstrated superiority against azd1222 chadox1 s in terms of geometric mean titer for neutralization antibodies gmt ratio 1 39 p 0 0001 vla2001 gmt 803 5 95 ci 748 48 862 59 azd1222 chadox1 s gmt 576 6 95 ci 543 6 611 7 as well as non inferiority in terms of seroconversion rates scr above 95 in both treatment groups at two weeks after the second vaccination i e day 43 in adults aged 30 years and older t cell responses analyzed in a sub set of participants showed that vla2001 induced broad antigen specific ifn gamma producing t cells reactive against the s 74 3 n 45 9 and m 20 3 protein vla2001 was generally well tolerated the tolerability profile of vla2001 was significantly more favorable compared to the active comparator vaccine participants 30 years and older reported significantly fewer solicited adverse events up to seven days after vaccination both with regards to injection site reactions 73 2 vla2001 vs 91 1 azd1222 chadox1 s p 0 0001 and systemic reactions 70 2 vla2001 vs 91 1 azd1222 chadox1 s p 0 0001 no unsolicited treatment related serious adverse events sae have been reported less than 1 reported an adverse event of special interest in both treatment groups participants in the younger age group vaccinated with vla2001 showed an overall safety profile comparable to the older age group the occurrence of covid 19 cases exploratory endpoint was similar between treatment groups the complete absence of any severe covid 19 cases may suggest that both vaccines used in the study prevented severe covid 19 caused by the circulating variant s predominantly delta adam finn professor of paediatrics university of bristol trial chief investigator said the low levels of reactogenicity and high functional antibody responses alongside broad t cell responses seen with this adjuvanted inactivated whole virus vaccine are both impressive and extremely encouraging this is a much more traditional approach to vaccine manufacture than the vaccines so far deployed in the uk europe and north america and these results suggest this vaccine candidate is on track to play an important role in overcoming the pandemic thomas lingelbach chief executive officer of valneva said these results confirm the advantages often associated with inactivated whole virus vaccines we are committed to bringing our differentiated vaccine candidate to licensure as quickly as possible and continue to believe that we will be able to make an important contribution to the global fight against the covid 19 pandemic we are keen to propose an alternative vaccine solution for people who have not yet been vaccinated juan carlos jaramillo m d chief medical officer of valneva commented i would like to thank the trial investigators a well as all trial participants and collaborators especially the national institute for health research and the clinical teams within the nhs research centres as well as public health england this outcome shows the value of the collaboration that we started in september 2020 and we could not have achieved this milestone without them we ll continue to work very closely with the mhra to complete our rolling submission for approval valneva commenced rolling submission for initial approval with the uk s medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra and is preparing to commence rolling submission for conditional approval with the european medicines agency a final assay validation required by the mhra to verify the integrity of the

mars architectes apartment building in paris may be made from timber but building ecologically requires closer attention than simply material choices wood construction is gathering momentum in france re2020 a new regulation designed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 in the construction sector which will gradually come into effect from january 2022 is expected to reinforce that trend a new carbon life cycle assessment of buildings will promote bio sourced materials such as timber all new public buildings are to be built using at least 50 per cent natural materials and paris olympics 2024 has promised that 30 per cent of all buildings and 80 per cent of buildings of up to eight storeys will be made of wood most of the wood used in the construction industry is engineered roundwood timbers sawn from local forests are the exception and not the norm a wide range of mass timber products exist plywood mdf osb glulam clt etc formed by combining wood in fibres and chips with adhesives often treated with additional inputs such as flame retardant the main purpose of engineered wood technologies is to stabilise wood limiting its expansion and retraction while increasing its versatility and structural rigidity for instance by tapping into its anisotropic qualities different properties depending on its orientation lumbers cut along their grain do not have the same physical characteristics as lumbers cut across the grain for example mars architectes new apartment building in paris uses glulam beams to reduce any movement in the building s structure while the roof and floors are made of clt the timber building designed by the paris based studio cannot be seen from the street it is nestled in the inner courtyard of a bland 1964 building on avenue de saint mandé in the residential streets of the 12th arrondissement through the entrance hall made of faux marble glass doors open on to a newly designed garden that has enhanced what used to be a sad looking soulless courtyard and the warm wood facade of a surprising construction among the white and beige facades the building s modest four storey height and the sliding douglas fir panels that are used as shutters conjure up a clear japanese identity lodged in what remains a typical parisian typology this reading is confirmed by sylvain rety one of mars architectes three principals who points out the reference to japanese traditions in the white paint they have used to adorn some of the beams the balconies that run all around the facade evoke the rustic inns that still sometimes survive in central and eastern europe with their outdoor corridors that look down on a central courtyard these balconies are filled with a joyful mess of plants drying racks colourful tables and chairs for morning coffees and evening apéros inside the flats feature a variety of woods and therefore of grains and tones too from a light parquet to the darker douglas fir panels and shutters rety explains that acoustics in a wooden building represent a technical challenge one of the reasons why the ground floor is made of several layers of materials including panels of clt and a 50mm screed of concrete all the apartments three studios six one bedroom flats four two bedroom maisonettes are dual aspect a much sought after feature in paris yet for all their charming features there is nothing quirky or lavish in the flats design they are efficient and compact the most basic rule of sustainable forestry is that a tree cut for use as lumber has to be replaced the contrast is stark with the communal areas at the back of the building dominated by a glossy white hpl high pressure laminate cladding metal poles and guardrails are also lacquered in white and a full height stainless steel net secures the corridors to access the flats devoid of any personal touches it feels cold and clinical the wood bonanza in construction begs questions of ecological and social sustainability the process of engineering wood bears a significant environmental cost a comparison of the embodied carbon footprint of some engineered wood to other building technologies might come as a surprise callum hill and janka dibdiakova of bath university found in their research in 2016 that fibreboard displays some of the worst performance indicators and can be placed in the same category as cement and steel meanwhile among those materials with smaller carbon footprints we find brick concrete and solid wood this ranking changes completely when taking into account the real magic of wood carbon sequestration forests naturally capture the carbon dioxide co 2 in the atmosphere hence the stereotypical image of forests as the lungs of the earth that sequestered carbon remains in harvested wood products buildings and even furniture made of wood constitute reservoirs that will hold co 2 indefinitely wood together with other bio sourced materials such as bamboo is the only construction material to naturally possess this ability and for such large volumes but this is only true if two main conditions are met at the end of its life the wood product should be reused instead of being burned or discarded and left to decompose releasing its sequestered co 2 secondly the forest from which the tree has been harvested to build the house or furniture must be managed in a sustainable way appropriately enough the headquarters of the french national forestry office onf are located on the same avenue de saint mandé as mars architectes housing project the onf is in charge of managing the publicly owned forests of france about a quarter of its forests the most basic rule of sustainable forestry is that a tree cut for use as lumber has to be replaced and there is a significant time factor onf marketing manager benoît fraud explains that broad leaved trees that constitute 67 per cent of french forests might take 120 160 or even 180 years to reach maturity while the conifers that account for 21 per cent might need only 50 to 60 years the onf reaction time is counted in centuries fraud explains there is no point trying to guess what the wood industry will need in one or two centuries from now instead the industry has to adapt to what the land offers france has the fourth largest forest area in europe with 138 varieties of trees this exceptional diversity should be a strength but in fact the country lacks a well organised wood sector for instance it lacks a dense network of versatile small scale sawmills able to handle the variety of trees growing on its land the industry is organised in such a way that most of its production is sold abroad transformed and imported back in recent months this structural deficit has been worsened by a high demand for timber and other wood products worldwide the combination of a post pandemic construction surge increased demand in china and the us and the growing popularity of wood in construction everywhere has seen its price skyrocket at the chicago stock exchange lumber went from 400 per 1 000 board feet in january 2020 to a whopping 1 686 in may 2021 most wood is sold in online auctions to the highest bidder and these days that bidder is usually from china or the us leaving french construction facing a shortage of timber with budgets and delivery time increasing massively as a result of these structural and conjectural challenges timber often has to be imported from abroad the building by mars is a good illustration of this while some of their wood such as the elements of the facade were sourced in france the glulam beams and the clt were imported from other european countries haulage is increasing both the cost of wood and its carbon footprint tainting its sustainable credentials and increasing the wood premium sylvain rety estimates it is roughly 30 per cent more expensive to build with wood than concrete the biggest losers in re2020 like the concrete and steel industries have publicly doubted the capacity of the wood sector to deliver on the new demands french lumberjacques say they are up for the challenge rety explains he is proud of the sustainable record of their building the studio s first and so is their client a real estate group with a portfolio valued at 19 7 billion composed mostly of offices in the paris region as well as a growing focus on residential properties gecina is keen to show off the project and its rented apartments as the flagship of their commitment to a greener future despite the increased price tag of building in wood in a city where rents are capped by law the reason why mars which is completing a very promising all concrete social housing building for the city a few streets away and their client went for a wooden building is not ideological for neither has a specific ecological agenda the site this inner courtyard has no road access and is surrounded by 12 storey buildings making installation of a crane extremely difficult to access the heart of this parisian islet they dug a hole in the yard to reach the underground parking and transported prefabricated wood elements from the avenue de saint mandé down through the parking door and up to the courtyard the building assemblage took only six weeks it was almost like a piece of furniture explains rety if it hadn t been for wood this residential building might not have existed the cleverness of this design is in the way mars overcame the challenges of the site by relying on the possibilities wood offers as a versatile construction material in a dense urban context gecina achieves an elegant densification furnished with a collection of ecological accolades and certifications that are so dear to the real estate industry nf habitat hqe excellent effinergie biosourcé level 3 biodivercity they are creating much needed new homes in a city where housing is scarce they were rented out in an instant and improving the setting for the whole block which they own needless to say the 2 4 million operation is highly profitable for the owner
dubai when it comes to consumer demand tech brands will not have too many complaints to make of 2020 the work and study from home made sure these brands could call in sufficient demand for the better part of last year this year however has been a bit of a wake up to reality situation for global tech demand has subsided and that was expected because it would have been difficult to repeat the bumper run of 2020 but the concerns over chip shortages is hitting all manufacturers and brands hard whether it is selling a smartphone a laptop or a gaming device paul collins the mea general manager at the taiwanese pc maker acer gives an insight into where the industry and the brand stands right now 2020 was an exceptional year when it comes to consumers buying tech do you think it will be difficult to maintain those sort of levels paul collins while it s undeniable that the pandemic revitalized the computer device market with work learn and entertain from home becoming a new normal this was also accompanied by major supply chain shortages and terrible logistics congestion all major suppliers reacted and fed their major markets this meant that countries such as america and the european continent enjoyed the majority of supply in 2020 we are still in the midst of shortages albeit reduced which means that 2021 has still been a very good year for the industry as normalcy returns in 2022 much catching up needs to happen in areas such as mea south america and the asia pacific which will mean that it should still offer robust opportunities the need for new hardware is still very much there reckons paul collins of acer consumers are refreshing older devices with more premium products gaming devices and home centres with monitors accessories and furniture image credit ahmed ramzan gulf news but wasn t all of the consumer buying consolidated into 2020 pc not at all for the first time since the arrival of the smartphone and ipad the pc has become a relevant device again consumers and businesses realise what technologies such as zoom and specialized products can mean to their ability to access work opportunities education and entertainment consumers are refreshing older devices with more premium products gaming devices and home centres with monitors accessories and furniture this is an evolving market and should carry on for the foreseeable future brand acer has always been about having a major presence in the consumer space rather than b2b but within the consumer space acer s share seems to have slipped in the last two years is it because you didn t have that broader range available in these markets acer has looked to verticalise many of our consumer offerings bringing specialization into our range to meet customer needs we very proudly own the predator brand which is a go to product in the massively growing gaming area these products can command prices over dh20 000 and we have more than healthy shares in that segment we have other brands such and enduro urban a ruggedized tablet and laptop range for clients who follow active outdoor lifestyles and concept d a product aimed at designers and creators and our chromebooks market share positions have been very difficult to maintain for any vendor since the beginning of 2020 due to supply chain constraints and this can be seen in wide fluctuations in the reports on a month to month basis for this reason acer has been focused on its verticalisation strategy aiming to supply and dominate particular market segments your made for humanity lineup is this acer s attempt at a major brand reconnect pc acer has been committed to being a responsible corporate company for many years it has been in our dna since our launch of the first chromebook requiring far less technology and power to run than any other product at the time we have followed this with many initiatives led from a corporate level such as meeting carbon emission reductions of 60 per cent in 2020 and being included in a list of the top 100 most sustainably managed companies by the wall street journal we felt that now was the right time to encapsulate these many csr actions into a comprehensive strategy so that we could hold ourselves and also be held accountable to these goals it is true though that this does represent a refocus as we have long recognized that we are not only a technology supplier but also a company that has an impact on all we come into contact with earthion which is a acer s initiative that stems from project humanity is the culmination of our efforts earthion represents acer s initiative to tackle environmental challenges and also a platform that unites the strengths of our employees and supply chain partners expanding the circle of impact of our sustainability efforts do you reckon the brand itself needs a major refresh now that the likes of a revitalized vaio are again getting active pc we have many sub brands that dominate in their space as the acer holding brand it is important to maintain what we stand for while evolving continually we have been supplying technology for over 45 years and during that time we have seen the social demographic add generation x y and z to the babyboomers these groups all require different things from products and indeed the companies that supply them in that we continually evaluate and evolve our brand statement with even products such as device as a service being rolled out now to meet the new trend of non ownership being championed by gen y and z acer is a lifestyle brand with products like the predatorshot energy drink e scooters and ozone sanitisers amongst many offerings from the acer stable
stock image photo by carl ballou istock getty images plus st george news st george a suspect currently on pretrial release on two open assault cases was arrested thursday evening and booked into jail on a felony robbery charge following an altercation in which the suspect reportedly attacked an individual in st george and demanded his money the arrest stems from an incident reported shortly after 8 p m when officers were dispatched to east 700 south in st george on a report of an assault in progress and arrived to find a suspect later identified as 41 year old william lucas who was being detained by two bystanders according to charging documents filed with the court the suspect was handcuffed as officers worked to control the scene that also involved another individual who was injured and being treated by paramedics at the time of the incident lucas told officers he was riding in a vehicle with his sister when he said she pointed to a man on the street and said he had stolen 300 from her when the vehicle stopped lucas said he got out and tried to get the money back the officer noted in the report when asked how he went about doing that the answer was that it didn t matter and when officers asked for the sister s last name lucas said he didn t know he then went on to explain she was not a biological sister but said the two were close when officers asked for the woman s phone number so they could contact her since she was no longer at the scene lucas said she didn t have a phone the suspect became agitated at that point and he demanded to go to jail telling officers he knew how this would end the report also states that while officers were speaking to lucas they could smell a strong odor of alcohol and noted his eyes were glassy and his speech was slurred the suspect was given a breathalyzer test that revealed a blood alcohol content of 167 more than three times the legal limit in utah once the suspect started raising his voice lucas was placed in the back of the patrol vehicle while officer spoke to the man being treated by emergency medical personnel according to the report the man told officers he was walking across the street when a red passenger car pulled up and a man he didn t recognize got out and demanded the man hand over any property he had to which the man replied by saying he didn t even have a dollar the man said the suspect then attacked him threw him to the ground and continued striking him in the face and demanding money the altercation continued in the middle of the street until two bystanders witnessing the scuffle intervened and held the suspect down until the first officer arrived the report also states the man had blood on his face and appeared to have sustained an injury to his jaw the suspect was arrested and transported to purgatory correctional facility he was booked into jail on second degree felony robbery since lucas reportedly used force in an attempt to deprive the victim of his property he was also booked on misdemeanor intoxication lucas was formally charged with the offenses the following day the most recent case is one of four open cases filed against the suspect in which a physical altercation was involved including a case filed in iron county on june 17 the details of which were not included in court records the suspect was on a pretrial release on that case when the incident on thursday took place as well as on an assault case filed in march that is still moving through the courts the charges were filed in connection with an incident reported march 22 in iron county when officers were dispatched to a call reporting that a man had been struck in the face by the suspect officers arrived and spoke to the reporting party who said lucas had been staying in his van with him when the two got into an argument at which point the suspect struck the van owner in the face he said and then broke out one of the van s windows with a baseball bat according to court records the owner of the van also sustained injuries to his head lucas fled prior to officers arriving and was found on state route 14 shortly thereafter he was arrested at that time and booked into jail on misdemeanor assault criminal mischief and intoxication he is scheduled to appear for a pretrial conference in april of next year lucas also has a felony assault case filed in june of last year after officers found him lying in the grass and bleeding from what appeared to be a fractured nose at a park in cedar city on the evening of june 16 2020 the suspect became combative as paramedics were attempting to tend to his wounds and when officers intervened he spit on one of the officers and attempted to kick him in the head seconds later the suspect kicked the officer s chest breaking the body cam mounting on his vest as the suspect did so once fully restrained the suspect was transported to the hospital and then to jail where he was booked on assault disorderly conduct propelling bodily fluids and other misdemeanor charges lucas was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail after pleading guilty to the charges and after a series of warrants and probation violations the case remains

skip to comments posted on by seekandfind having made a mess of afghanistan the biden administration now turns its trademark incompetence to something closer to home namely the supply chains that put toys under our christmas trees and food on our tables biden is using the pandemic as an excuse but the truth is that government diktats handouts and cronyism have catastrophically gummed up our supply chains and it s getting worse in response to rising criticism about his absent administration amid bare shelves biden trending online the president bestirred himself on oct 13 to trumpet a band aid while his transportation secretary smirks about late shoppers and predicts shortages may last years and years contrast this fatalism with former president donald trump s hyperactivity when supply chains were creaking early in the covid 19 pandemic sitting down with the people doing the actual work asking them what s in the way what they need and what s gumming things up and then jawboning and executive ordering bureaucrats to get off their rears instead the biden administration mumbles and smirks while in the shadows handing over supply chains to unions and environmental activists supply chains are in trouble worldwide due to chinese disruptions and the u s stands out by far particularly the port of los angeles which together with the adjacent port of long beach handles 40 of containers bringing both finished goods to american homes and critical parts and materials to american factories without those containers entire industries grind to a halt and shelves clear across america there are now 50 to 70 ships anchored off los angeles with delays of up to three weeks los angeles overflow now clogs ports across the country roughly 16 of all trans pacific ships are currently stuck at anchor while government owned and unionized port of los angeles strolls along at 60 to 70 of capacity closed evenings and sundays the sister port of long beach did implement so called 24 7 operations several months ago a magic wand biden dangled for the port of los angeles on oct 13 but in reality 24 7 at long beach means only one of six terminals and only monday to thursday apparently 24 7 in government speak isn t what it means to the rest of us not surprisingly since it s not the union s job to make things easy it s fought automation for years to protect its 200 000 salaries while imposing arcane rules on truckers that make it a nightmare to do pickups the chokehold is sending factories and retailers nationwide into panic mode not only for the risk the company christmas season but for the critical supplies and materials needed to run their own factories home depot and target resorted to chartering their own ships only to run into the meat grinder of inland supply chains analysts are predicting the chaos could last into 2023 because imported resins and materials are necessary in food production and delivery even grocery store shelves are now clearing across the country nearly 20 of beverage and bakery products are out of stock nationwide while costco and sam s club stores are reimposing purchase limits on some goods across the states shortages are being reported in bread meat juices and now diapers even dairy critical for kids is dwindling to core products amid driver shortages parked ships are easy to see but ports are just the beginning once goods get off the ship there aren t enough truckers or enough chassis to carry the containers or enough warehouse space or enough rail capacity railhead waits are now averaging 10 to 20 days while warehouses in los angeles are already 98 8 full it s now so expensive to import that containers ship back empty leaving u s products to sit on trains too full to take new loads which back up the ports and block them from unloading incoming ships it s layer after layer with supply chains failing at every stage like dominos the go to excuse for the administration and the media is that import volumes soared amid covid 19 so it s all just too much the truth is the port of los angeles own numbers say containers handled are actually down 1 from a year ago and rose just 11 in the two years through august that s half the jump from 2009 to 2011 when supply chains were not collapsing as comedian jon stewart remarked about the 2008 financial crisis this isn t a perfect storm it s a regular storm and we have a s boat so what is driving the chaos government along with union chokeholds environmental and labor mandates on truckers mandates on supply chain workers across the board crony trade restrictions and excessive unemployment benefits nationwide but especially in california remember too that this is all before biden s vaccine mandates kick in california truckers in particular have been socked by the state s notorious ab 5 law restricting gig workers and independent contractors combined with truck emission mandates introduced just last year that can mean tens of thousands of dollars out of pocket many truckers have already decamped to greener pastures in friendlier states finally crony trade restrictions like the century old jones act can actually make it cheaper to import from china than to ship goods domestically knocking internal shipping as an option if biden is serious about solving supply chains he needs to get ports truckers railroads and warehouses back to work that means loosening union chokeholds on critical infrastructure using the taft hartley act if needed it means clearing out labor and environmental mandates that ban or disincentivize flexible workers and contractors and it means draining the swamp of crony and environmental regulations that gum up supply chains with 100 year old detritus on top of whatever activists are banning this week above all biden needs to stop making it worse that means he must resist spreading california s job killing labor and environmental mandates across the country from environmental protection agency truck emission rules to congressional democrats jamming nationwide anti contractor legislation into their 3 5 trillion tax and spend bill finally it means withdrawing biden s reckless vaccine mandate which is already pulling thousands of additional critical workers off the job before it has even kicked in biden has a lot to do and he ll need to stand up to unions and radical activists if he stands a chance of actually delivering

the walkout by more than 10 000 john deere workers in illinois iowa and other states begins a new week today amid increasing statements of concern in corporate and political circles that the unions will be unable to contain the growing strike wave by workers demanding a reversal of decades of union backed concessions deere workers struck on october 14 after a near unanimous vote to reject a contract brought back by the uaw which included a de facto cut in real wages the elimination of pensions for new hires and the continuation of health care and other concessions accepted by the uaw in earlier contracts in a recently published article on the investor information web site seeking alpha financial analyst harrison schwartz notes that the company s stock price has doubled since 2019 and its profit margins have hit a record level of 13 percent the sharp rise in the prices of corn soy and other agricultural commodities has fueled a spike in demand for new farm machinery but all of this is threatened by the strike schwartz warns after acknowledging that deere has the resources to increase employee pay and benefits he expresses the hope albeit without much confidence that the uaw will be able to end the strike quickly and push through a deal with minimal impact on the company s bottom line it is entirely possible if not likely that john deere s employees will accept a deal before too long however considering 90 voted against the previous offer workers are emboldened to gain significant demands harrison warns that the growing militancy of workers expressed in the biggest strike wave in generations threatens the regime of low wages and high productivity that wall street has enjoyed for decades pointing to the labor shortages and to the millions of workers quitting low paying jobs he says the current economic environment has placed the ball back in laborer s court put simply the blue collar workers around the united states have the capacity to demand higher wages a fact which will likely cause sharp margin reversals for many firms this is a stark difference from the environment that has reigned since the 1960s which empirically speaking caused revenues to flow away from workers toward capital i e investors investors should note this change to avoid exposing themselves to blue collar dependent firms particularly manufacturing which the shift will likely hit the hardest deere management is determined to prevent such a reversal in fortunes sitting on deere s corporate board are high profile figures associated with some of the biggest corporate and financial institutions in the world including agribusiness giant cargill cascade assessment management which oversees the investment of billionaires bill and melinda gates general electric asset management dupont and verizon the uaw is no less determined to prevent a victory by deere workers fearing it would trigger an uncontrollable rebellion by autoworkers and other workers who have suffered from the decades of concessions the uaw imposed in exchange for the millions in company bribes its top officials pocketed that is why the uaw is doing everything it can to isolate the strike and undermine the powerful position of deere workers the uaw has kept 3 500 workers at dana a key supplier to the auto industry and to deere on the job more than six weeks after they rejected a pro company contract brought back by the uaw and the united steelworkers by over 90 percent the union is now floating information about an impending deal which will be no different from the first which contained below inflation rate wage increases and gave the company a free hand to continue unbearable amounts of forced overtime last week the uaw released a statement saying uaw john deere members struck at midnight october 14 after the company failed to present an agreement that met our members demands and needs without acknowledging that uaw president ray curry and vice president chuck browning tried to ram through the rotten deal with lies about the six year contract containing significant gains for workers now according to local uaw officials talks with the company are supposed to resume on monday once again the uaw is keeping workers completely in the dark about the content of the meetings this is because they are not negotiations between two antagonistic parties but a strategy session to discuss how to beat down the resistance of workers before trying to push through another pro company contract one deere worker from east moline illinois told the wsws i haven t heard a thing rumor is that they haven t been back to the table since we went on strike most of our updates are coming from tv and social media another worker said only thing i know is they are supposed to go back to the table on monday the workers who spoke with the wsws said the union had not even gone through the motions of surveying workers on what contract improvements they wanted a ploy in earlier strikes to pretend that the uaw was bargaining hard even as it completely ignored workers demands earlier this year nearly 3 000 volvo trucks workers in virginia rebelled against the uaw and rejected three union backed concessionary contracts the first two by over 90 percent the union did everything to isolate their five week strike and put workers on starvation rations of 275 a week in strike benefits even though the strike fund paid for by workers dues is valued at 790 million then the uaw forced a revote on the same contract workers rejected and claimed it passed by 17 votes the courageous struggle against the company and the uaw by the volvo workers which is continuing to this day was only a prelude for the battle at deere the virginia workers were only able to sustain their months long struggle by forming the volvo workers rank and file committee which operated completely independently of and in opposition to the uaw and consistently countered the efforts by curry co to sabotage the strike and starve them into submission the rank and file committee established direct lines of communication with autoworkers in detroit and with volvo workers in belgium and other countries the recently formed john deere workers rank and file committee is leading the fight to unify all deere workers demand full income from the strike fund and call for joint strike action with dana workers and common struggle with autoworkers and deere workers throughout the company s international operations deere employs nearly 70 000 workers worldwide at 102 operations including agricultural construction and forestry manufacturing plants distribution centers and research and development facilities in france germany china india and brazil in a transparent effort to give itself a cover the uaw international posted a video on its web site saturday of officials from the metal workers union at a deere factory in catalão brazil sending greetings to striking workers in the us but these are not the workers of brazil who are the natural allies of striking workers in the us but union bureaucrats who are hated by brazilian workers just as much as american workers hate the uaw gm workers in the brazilian city of são caetano do sul in são paulo s abc industrial region are currently waging a strike in defiance of the metal workers union which has done everything to sabotage their struggle against gm s cuts in workers income and benefits to fight a transnational giant like deere workers need real international unity and a coordination of their struggles across national boundaries workers have taken a decisive step by forming the john deere workers rank and file committee now this committee must be expanded to bring in workers from every deere plant and warehouse to break the isolation of the struggle by the uaw and fight for demands that meet the needs of the workers not what the uaw and management say is acceptable a direct appeal should be made to dana workers to conduct joint strike action and to autoworkers caterpillar volvo and other workers in the us and deere workers around the world to join in a common struggle

hospitals around the world typically to perform abdominal urological and gynaecological procedures a surgeon can sit in front of its 3d screen and operate the robot by manipulating two joysticks cambridge is a good place to do technology says luke hares the chief technology officer at cmr surgical the company behind versius cmr has grown rapidly since its foundation in 2016 and now employs 750 people as it ramps up exports with dozens of its 1m 1 5m 750 000 1 1m robots lined up and awaiting shipment at the firm s headquarters it has just announced it will open another factory in nearby

when he said we are going to make this country not just a science superpower we re going to make the united kingdom the most exciting place on the planet hares says he built a wooden single arm model of versius in a weekend but it took 18 months to develop a four arm prototype finding financial backers was even trickier he stresses the importance of luck in the chain of events referring to a chance meeting with cmr s first backer the norwegian investor per methi at a patent lawyer s office methi remains a main shareholder and a board member of the company it was either going to be massive or it was going to fail there s a level of serendipity that is important hares says what sets versius apart from other surgical robots according to cmr s chief executive per vegard nerseth is that it can deploy up to four arms that move independently of each other rather than coming out of one boom each one holds an instrument as it might a pen and moves like a human wrist unlike heavier robots

funding than the rest of europe 14 6bn 12 3bn in the first six months of 2021 as much as the 2020 total according to figures from pitchbook the latest crop of successful uk life science firms includes the dna and rna sequencing company oxford nanopore whose market value jumped to almost 5bn on its london stock market debut in late september a day later exscientia which uses artificial intelligence to develop drugs spurned london and floated on nasdaq in new york at 2 9bn ending the day worth 3 5bn analysts say there is more willingness from investors in the us to support fledgling biotech companies on an often bumpy road with clinical trial setbacks along the way investors are very hesitant when it comes to clinical stage risk says cuddon another problem is that british r d spending which totalled 38 5bn in 2019 is among the lowest in oecd countries as a percentage of gdp the uk business secretary kwasi kwarteng recently set out a plan to help the uk keep pace in the global innovation race this includes raising annual public investment in r d to 22bn from nearly 15bn in 2021 22 the government aims to increase public and private r d investment to 2 4 of gdp by 2027 from 1 7 in 2019 the nanopore float could be a turning point as it effectively sends a signal that you can list in the uk and get support says adam barker a life sciences analyst at shore capital the uk can

inflation nerves are alive and well with robust us lifting us yields on friday and underpinning the over the weekend bank of england governor bailey warned the bank would have to act to curb inflationary pressures mr bailey sees plenty of transitory inflation but his all seeing monetary policy eye is also spotting underlying medium term pressures as well lastly new zealand released this morning rocketed to 4 90 yoy for q3 well above the rbnz 1 3 target the new zealand data was made all the worse by the fact that its largest population centre auckland has been under covid 19 restrictions for a good part of that time markets are locking and loading a hike before year end from the band of england while talk has shifted to a potential 0 50 hike from the reserve bank of new zealand in november both and the have outperformed in the last week on rate hike expectations the only thing capping the kiwi at the moment is that the spiralling covid 19 cases in auckland may prompt the government to announce a level 4 circuit breaker lockdown later today meanwhile singapore s non oil yoy in september rising by 12 30 the mas pre emptively tightened policy slightly at its 6 monthly policy review last week assuming singapore holds its nerve and continues to reopen the nodex should maintain its upward trajectory and hit high speed if the singapore malaysia border loosens to allow greater labour movement asian markets will be predominantly focused on china data today china releases yoy 5 2 exp printed lower at 4 9 yoy september 7 9 exp printed lower at 7 3 yoy sep 3 3 exp printed higher at 4 4 yoy sep 4 5 exp printed lower at 3 1 and of those gdp retail sales and industrial production will carry the most weight there is downside risk in all three thanks to holidays weather the energy crunch the government crackdowns along with rising material costs and supply chain disruption the national bureau of statistics press conference after will be worth following for signals on the path forward for china s economy for the rest of the year and into 2022 china markets are likely to find some solace initially from weekend comments from the pboc dampening down nerves that evergrande hk and its fellow property developers pose a systematic risk to the financial system but the data dump will provide a binary outcome for regional markets today weak data equals equities down strong data equals equities higher a weak data print though will lift expectations of an imminent pboc rrr rate cut which should be supportive of domestic markets once the post release noise dies down a divergence in monetary policy between asia still soft and much of the rest of the developed world tentative tightening will provide challenges for the region as q4 progresses the fed taper is the elephant in the room and if the pboc remains accommodative and allows the to modestly weaken currencies around the region will once again face selling pressure the indirect tightening of monetary policy that causes could cause angst amongst the region s central banks and likely sees intervention measures stepped up some of that pressure may be relieved by the slew of reopening announcements by asean countries last week particularly in the tourism space asean is probably the only part of the world pining for a cold northern hemisphere winter to flush those winter sun tourists out of hiding cryptos have had a busy few days after rumours flew on friday that the us sec might approve two futures etfs this week why you would want to buy a bitcoin futures etf instead of bitcoin itself escapes me but if you are an investor that is mandated to only have exposure to regulated markets then this could be your chance to get involved despite getting long at near record highs the increased drone of the crypto is becoming mainstream buzz in my ears is more irritating than tinnitus still as long as vast swathes of the investment community are looking to get rich quick by believing it has any real value i will respect the tradeable versus investible price action bitcoin jumped 7 50 on friday to 61 650 00 held those gains over the weekend and has risen again by 1 50 to 62 500 00 this morning i believe jack dorsey might have said something anyway the all time high of around 65 000 00 is in sight and a daily close above that level tilts the technical picture to further gains targeting 80 000 00 going forward and you all thought i was a crypto cynic putting down my copy of the now very well read emperor s new clothes with a will they never learn shake of the head we circle back to this week s data calendar asia isn t very exciting after today s china data dump indonesia will leave rates unchanged tomorrow while japan s trade balance may have some marginal interest its stock markets are hitched to wall street and the impending 594757635385th extra budget since 1995 and the is trading purely on the us japan rate differential wednesday sees china announce its latest one and five year loan prime rate decisions unless today s data is an absolute shocker they will remain unchanged at 3 85 and 4 65 in europe and the us the pickings are relatively slim as well us later today and the fed on wednesday will be of marginal interest while thursday s could weigh on equities if it gives back last week s positive gains uk on wednesday will increase the rate hike noise to deafening levels and lift sterling if the yoy prints over 3 50 friday brings markit manufacturing services and composite pmi releases from the european heavyweights and the us the uk releases and pmis arguably they could have the largest impact on the week data wise if only because they may give greater credence to the inflationary pressures or if the data is soft temporarily alleviate tightening concerns us quarterly earnings swing from the large banks last week to a broader mix of technology fmcg and manufacturing companies goldman sachs nyse reported on friday to left us markets with the masters of the universe filling their coffers for another quarter the picture across the real economy may look rather more mixed especially if you are exposed to rising interest rates material costs or supply chain disruptions their 2022 outlooks will be of more importance than their actual results and this week could see heightened two way volatility in stocks asian equities off to a mixed start new york turned in a strong performance on friday after us unexpectedly rose by 0 70 for september well above the 0 20 expected us yields firmed across the curve but were ignored by equity markets as the rose 0 75 the gained 0 50 and the jumped by 1 10 us futures are quiet in asia thus far easing slightly on long covering from friday s close asia was on hold ahead of the china data dump this morning with early markets showing a mixed performance the 0 25 fall by the this morning sees the easing by 0 40 while the is 0 30 lower mainland markets finished almost unchanged last week the pboc comments on the risks in china s property market being contained may give some comfort initially but the data releases good or bad will dominate proceedings has fallen 0 70 in early trade after soft guidance from alibaba nyse hinting that the mainland may have a soft open is unchanged but has risen by 0 55 as reopening plans gain traction and commodities especially energy remain firm riding the same wave is 0 15 higher as the government projects a lower than expected deficit has risen by just 0 10 with climbing 0 40 australian markets have also edged higher after a strong finish in new york the and have risen by 0 25 with new zealand deciding on whether to revert to level 4 restrictions in auckland today the has fallen by 0 10 the china data dump will dictate most of the region s direction today although indications seem to suggest we are seeing another rotation day from north asia to asean markets seemingly a short term defensive play for local investors at the moment european markets have shown little inclination to take their direction from asia of late thus no matter how asia s session turns out today europe is likely to open firmer based on the positive finish from new york and a lack of market moving headlines over the weekend the us dollar treads water the us dollar continued to tread water versus the major currencies on friday the maintaining a 94 00 close for the third day in a row remains unchanged at 1 1590 while sterling strength was offset by yen weakness in the index early selling pressure on the us dollar was alleviated as us yields firmed across the curve after the strong retail sales data on friday while eur usd trades sideways at 1 1590 the sterling continues to rally versus both the greenback and the euro rose by 0 56 to 1 3750 on friday before easing to 1 3740 in asia despite hawkish rhetoric over the weekend by the boe governor sterling s strength is based on ever rising hiking expectations and a rally through 1 3775 opens a retest of 1 3900 only a fall through 1 3700 changes the bullish outlook rose 0 56 to 114 20 on friday after resistance at 113 80 gave way with us yields firming across the curve the only way was up for usd jpy in the absence of any haven buying of yen from domestic investors usd jpy remains at the mercy of the us japan rate differential and a test of 115 00 is likely this week elsewhere the improvement in investor sentiment on friday after the retail sales data saw the us dollar mostly retreat remained firm at 0 7410 but rose 0 55 to 0 7070 on rbnz hiking expectations today s new zealand inflation print boosted the kiwi to a high of 0 7105 as that noise increased however all those gains have now gone as spiralling covid 19 cases in auckland have led to speculation that the auckland region new zealand s largest population centre could re enter level 4 lockdown this afternoon a government announcement is expected at 1600 nzt with a lot of speculative longs out there nzd usd could fall quickly to 0 7000 if a tightening of restrictions is announced regional asian currencies also enjoyed a positive back end of last week thanks to a weakening us dollar and some judicious intervention by a few regional central banks the and have outperformed thanks to high energy and commodity prices as well firmer investor risk sentiment this week looks rather less clear though as despite us equities rallying on friday us yields also firmed across the curve if that status quo remains or yields move higher the pressure will once again come on asean currencies as well as the yen and the in the bigger picture we are starting to see a pattern emerging in the developed market space of currency outperformance from those on a nearer term hiking path the key remains the fed taper and the list of fed speakers this week will probably give more clarity in this respect ever rising energy prices are also supportive of the us dollar i am still expecting prolonged us dollar strength in q4 although this week may see more sideways action as speculation long us dollar open interest is culled coal lifts oil in asia hong kong have leapt 9 0 higher this morning meaning that the china energy crunch has made its way back to the front of investors minds that has lifted oil prices in asia as well with surging 0 80 higher and leaping by 1 0 on friday oil prices continued to grind higher with no sign of any inclination to open the pumps by opec or announcements by the us government on spr releases brent crude finished 0 90 higher at 484 90 and wti finished 1 25 higher at 82 50 a barrel in asia brent crude has risen to 85 65 and wti has risen to 83 40 a barrel as coal futures rocket into space with no signs of the china energy crunch alleviating soon and with the rest of northern asia and europe competing for scarce energy supplies particularly the price environment for oil remains constructive even a us or china spr release is only likely to provide temporary relief a rapidly reopening aviation sector with a slew of reopening announcements from asean last week will be another price pressure point brent crude should now target the october 2019 high at 86 80 and onto 90 00 barrel with support at 84 25 and 82 00 a barrel wti has now meaningful resistance until the 89 00 regions although i expect some sellers to appear above 86 00 a barrel initially only a fall through 82 00 a barrel changes the bullish outlook if brent crude moves to 90 00 a barrel i expect the pressure on opec to step up quite a few notches from the us white house the huge weight of speculative long positioning in oil futures means a sudden 5 8 a barrel drop could still occur on a headline shock however with the underlying fundamentals for oil so strong any large dip will reverse just as quickly nervous specs cut long gold positions although the us dollar finished roughly neutral on friday higher yields across the us curve were enough to spook speculative longs in that saw the predicted rush for the exit door and gold fell rapidly by 1 60 to close at 1767 50 an ounce in early asia gold has recouped some losses rising 0 25 to 1771 50 an ounce the price action on friday speaks volumes about the gold market now us dollar weakness earlier last week soured gold buying and drew in fast money speculative longs the equally rapid unwinding of most of those gains on friday reinforces that much of gold s rally was built on speculative hot air and that those longs have little to no appetite to wear any pain on those long positions in the bigger picture the lack of staying power from gold longs suggests that it will struggle to maintain any upward momentum even if gold reaches 1800 00 an ounce up via the stairs down via the sixth floor window firmer us yields should they endure this week will be a headwind for gold rallies especially if it leads to us dollar strength gold has nearby support at 1765 00 followed by 1745 00 an ounce with failure reopening a test of 1720 00 gold failed for the third day in a row at the 100 and 200 day moving averages dmas today at 1795 40 and 1796 60 an ounce formidable resistance in the bigger picture only a rise through 1835 00 an ounce would trigger a multi month inverse head and shoulders technical pattern and swing gold s outlook back to positive the risks remain firmly to the downside original post

while the iphone 13 range seemingly launched without a hitch in september a recent bloomberg report claimed that apple was expecting to ship 10 million fewer units of its newest phone line in the coming months but what exactly does that mean there are two perspectives to consider apple s of course given that 10 million fewer iphones potentially means a loss of sales as fewer handsets arrive on physical shop shelves and online store stock but also consumers who may conceivably have a harder time buying a new iphone 13 during black friday cyber monday and through the holiday season lest you immediately worry that iphone 13 models will be as hard to find as a ps5 or gpu take heart this doesn t seem to be a production shortfall on the level of the global chip shortage but the lack of information regarding the allegedly 10 million fewer iphones which bloomberg credits to component shortages from parts suppliers broadcom and texas instruments means even the experts can t say exactly what the impact will be that s especially true since we don t know how many iphone 13 units apple had planned to make it s never a good idea to read too much into individual supplier reports and it s equally impossible to verify what apple s production targets were that have now supposedly changed avi greengart founder of tech research and analysis firm techsponential told techradar over email that said this report is entirely plausible apple builds iphones in enormous volumes and there are multiple cascading faults impacting everyone s supply chain these days even apple is not completely immune broadly speaking the culprit for the shortfall is almost certainly related to the impact of the covid pandemic which continues to affect industries a year and a half after it began specifically we could be talking about any of a myriad of stops on the way from thinking up an iphone to getting it in consumer hands and greengart s cascading faults could affect anything from resource chains to production and assembly lines to shipping overseas to finally loading phones on trucks to line store shelves physically and digitally but there s a reason you might not see a difference in iphone 13 availability this holiday season even if there are shortfalls and it s entirely because apple is the juggernaut that it is image credit apple iphone 13 shortfalls why you may not notice if apple is seeing a 10 million iphone shortfall of its planned production consumers in some regions may not see any impact at all that s because the company prioritizes its largest markets like the us and allows other areas to feel the brunt according to nabila popal research director at analyst firm idc get daily insight inspiration and deals in your inbox get the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news reviews opinion analysis and more from the techradar team contact me with news and offers from other future brands receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors even if there were to be the us as a market gets priority because it s the largest market globally accounting for almost a third of all apple shipments popal told techradar over the phone instead markets in africa or the middle east or parts of europe may see fewer iphone 13 models in stock than expected if a shortage were to happen that s a big if as popal was uncertain that a shortage would even happen when the bloomberg report came out the smartphone industry suppliers that idc chats with disagreed on the reality of the shortage even if it did though there are ways those companies can make up for supply constraints to ensure minimal impact to sales we haven t heard anything significant to confirm that popal said but even if it were true it is not necessary this means that there will be a shortage because a lot of the companies that were working with apple said that they re just going to reprioritize themselves or use inventory that they already had to continue with their production orders and still hit their targets for q4 and more importantly the initial target was very aggressive so even if there is a reduction from original plan it may not impact things too much the uncertainty over the impact is also due to apple itself which makes such large scale orders for parts and production that it ends up commanding higher priority over other companies popal said this might explain why shortfalls in the industry may not hit apple as hard because the company ends up rather insulated from supply shocks though smaller companies might end up feeling the impact far more and if there is a shortage would apple even feel it during last year s holiday sales period q1 2021 apple sold a record 65 billion in iphones which idc estimated to account for some 90 1 million iphones in that period according to cnbc trimming 10 million units from that number or about 11 suggests it could have dropped sales by 7 2 billion that s nothing to sneeze at but wouldn t cripple apple s revenue for the quarter and given apple has been selling even higher percentages year over year throughout 2021 that 10 million shortfall would likely account for an smaller number of total sales and there s a question of whether consumers would balk at lower iphone supply and look elsewhere apple is one of two companies with samsung that commands a brand loyalty among handsets popal said customers may be upset that they can t get their iphone 13 of choice and just buy it later offsetting sales regardless that might make for a more disappointing quarter for apple according to anshel sag principal analyst at moor insights and strategy this is an unfortunate reality of our current chip shortage and will likely mean that apple won t be able to beat its last iphone sales record set in q4 of last year sag told techradar over email however i also believe that they will be able to make up for some of that in q1 and q2 especially since there isn t necessarily a huge change like there was last year with the addition of 5g in the iphone 12 ultimately this will set expectations for investors when apple doesn t ship record numbers of iphones this quarter image credit apple will this change which iphone 13 models i can buy should consumers looking to pick up an iphone 13 during the black friday deals season or during the holidays hurry to get what models they can before they re out of stock i think it will probably have the same kind of difficult availability that people are used to when it comes to an iphone model being in high demand sag said if plan ahead for the holidays they should be able to get one and some models may have better availability than others but just walking into the store and getting a phone might be more difficult during the holidays and as mentioned before the shortfall may not affect all areas equally with some markets seeing full stock of the various iphone 13 models and others seeing certain gaps in the range perhaps that means fewer of the phone s more specialized siblings including the smaller iphone 13 mini flagship iphone 13 pro or larger iphone 13 pro max or consumers may find the right phone but not the right storage configuration the iphone 13 is available in 128gb or 256gb of storage while the iphone 13 pro is available up to 1tb generally speaking i would expect it to be harder to find specific configurations in stock than most years and shipping times may be longer greengart said

day grace period the company has kept silent on coupon payments for four other bonds that were due in the past few weeks these developments come as china s central bank said friday that the risks posed by evergrande are controllable and that most real estate businesses in the country are stable however the people s bank of china also said property firms that have issued bonds overseas referred to as offshore bonds should actively fulfil their debt repayment obligations on sunday the central bank s governor yi gang made additional comments he said authorities will try to prevent evergrande s problems from spreading to other real estate firms according to reuters he also said china s economy was doing well but faced challenges such as default risks from mismanagement at certain firms the news agency reported real estate and related industries account for about a quarter of china s gdp according to moody s estimates china s property developers have grown rapidly following years of

one of the bigger developers in china s guangdong province which focuses on the country s greater bay area the ratings agency pointed to its high debt and said the firm s move to reduce debt will slow over the next year it also flagged aoyuan s considerable bond maturities due in 2022 which will put further pressure on the property firm the company s reduced visibility on revenue growth and continued margin pressure will hinder deleveraging efforts weakening cash generation will also pressure aoyuan s liquidity as it faces sizable maturities in 2022 despite our expectation that the

ability to generate cash to slow greenland s bond prices have deteriorated sharply again following wider investor concerns over the sector fitch wrote a prolonged weakness in bond prices may hit the confidence of the company s borrowers suppliers and purchasers china properties struggling capital economics new home sales have dived in recent weeks and are now 25 below 2019 levels said research firm capital economics in a note on friday the evergrande debacle has probably given homebuyers concerns about whether developers will honour presale commitments capital economics senior china economist julian evans pritchard said meanwhile developers land purchases have slumped as they batten down the hatches to ride out slowing sales and the constraints on their financing the economist added that points to a further pullback in new housing projects in the coming months one thing we can be sure of is that the property sector is struggling he wrote looking ahead he expects more policy easing of the property sector as authorities look to boost housing demand this may include cutting minimum down payment requirements for first time home buyers and rate cuts to push down mortgage costs evans pritchard wrote we do not expect policymakers to relax constraints on developer financing or allow a sharp pick up in overall credit growth he said the leadership we think remains

pov it s time to reimagine school accountability beyond standardized tests commonwealth s mcas tests fail to support diverse students and to cultivate the diversity of knowledge and skills they need to thrive in a complex ever changing world students chant against the massachusetts comprehensive assessment system exam on boston common about 200 students and teachers gathered in a protest against the exam which is given annually to students in grades 4 8 and 10 ap photo charles krupa voices opinion pov it s time to reimagine school accountability beyond standardized tests commonwealth s mcas tests fail to support diverse students and to cultivate the diversity of knowledge and skills they need to thrive in a complex ever changing world the 2021 massachusetts comprehensive assessment system mcas scores released last month revealed what one would expect after a year of disrupted learning amid a global pandemic an overall drop in the percentage of students meeting or exceeding the english language arts math and science exams from when the tests were last administered in 2019 they also showed pronounced achievement gaps for students identified as black hispanic latino economically disadvantaged or english learners students whose communities were hit hardest in massachusetts by the pandemic yet these mcas results are limited in measuring learning loss they do not account for the loss of family friends and financial security the emotional scars or the ongoing anxiety that youth have experienced nor do they account for the resilient ways in which students have stepped up when they have been asked to adapt to social distancing and wearing masks learning virtually in less than ideal environments and caring for younger siblings at home however the mcas have always measured school success in narrow terms as the education community takes stock of how to tackle the immense challenges students and schools continue to face we have a golden opportunity to redefine what success looks like for students and how to hold schools accountable in ways that actually support equitable educational opportunities and outcomes the mcas were born out of the standards based reform movement that swept over the united states in the 1990s the tests became massachusetts way of complying with no child left behind nclb the 2001 federal policy that required all states to measure adequate yearly progress of student reading and math achievement in grades 3 to 8 and grade 10 proponents argued that all students should receive an excellent education defining excellence as equal access to high standards they also argued that equity could be achieved through standardized tests that reported disaggregated results by student race poverty level english proficiency and special education status more than 20 years later these standardized tests have not achieved the policy goals of equity or excellence first standardized tests are themselves a biased yardstick that perpetuates structural racism and inequality the early 20 th century psychologists who developed them supported the eugenics movement and intended these tests to sort and rank individuals by race ethnicity gender and class early standardized tests were normed on samples of native born middle class european american children while today a bias and sensitivity committee vets the mcas for concerning questions harmful questions still slip through as recently as 2019 a test question asked students to write a journal entry from the perspective of a racist character from colson whitehead s novel the underground railroad the fact that the mcas achievement gap between black and white latino and white english learners and non english learners and economically disadvantaged and non economically disadvantaged students has persisted since long before the pandemic suggests that 1 tests focused on a single white centric standard of achievement are not appropriate measures for an education system that serves diverse students and 2 results of standardized tests like the mcas reflect the extent to which educational policies practices and structures have systematically failed black brown non native english speaking and low income students rather than individual student performance the mcas have also failed to deliver on providing an excellent education students today are living and breathing societal challenges pandemic climate change extremism polarization digital misinformation to name a few that require creative multifaceted collaborative solutions but rather than provide students the interdisciplinary knowledge and skills needed to address these challenges high stakes testing pushes schools to focus on isolated subject areas for example numerous studies have documented a severe reduction in social studies instruction since the passage of nclb this is part of a broader trend of innovative curricular reforms addressing deeper learning and social emotional development whereby researchers have found that standardized tests are consistently perceived by teachers and school leaders as a barrier to successful implementation put simply the standards based reforms designed to address inequitable access to an excellent education both perpetuate inequities and reduce opportunities for students to experience a rigorous relevant well rounded curriculum the policy goal of ensuring schools provide equitable opportunities and outcomes for all students is a valid one but the mcas as a policy solution has failed to support the commonwealth s diverse students and failed to cultivate the diversity of knowledge and skills students will need to thrive and survive in our complex ever changing world as we return to a new reality of schooling in the long shadow of covid 19 now is a vital time to ask what truly matters for students to learn and how to best hold schools accountable for validating and valuing the lived experiences cultures and dreams of each of

considered the world s best cinnamon ceylon cinnamon has been grown and produced in sri lanka for generations but experienced peelers are now rare it is 9am in the carlton estate in thihagoda a small town about 160km 100 miles south of sri lanka s capital colombo and the july sun hides behind inky clouds the air is thick and hot two men walk to the main estate building carrying piles of cinnamon branches inside a group of women sit on the cement floor chatting as they peel cinnamon since 2000 workers here have planted harvested and peeled cinnamon sending batches of the fragrant sticks to a factory in kamburupitiya a 15 minute drive away where they are cut packed and loaded onto shipping containers for export cinnamon harvesting usually takes place from june to december when the monsoon skies burst into downpours but here at rathna producers cinnamon exports it is produced throughout the year on the 42 acre 17 hectares estate when we are done harvesting one acre the next acre is ready says chamara lakshith 28 the estate s visiting officer whose job involves coordinating between the estate and the main office in kamburupitiya but sometimes for a few weeks the bark is so hard that you can t peel cinnamon we know it by looking at the trees young leaves turn striking red the family business that began in 1985 is run by ravindu runage whose late father started in the cinnamon trade with 7 000 sri lankan rupees 35 to buy cinnamon from small farmers and sell it to bigger traders now runage says the company is one of the largest cinnamon producers in sri lanka exporting cinnamon and other spices like nutmeg and black pepper to 56 countries apart from growing organic cinnamon the company also sources it from 8 000 individual and small scale farmers and exports more than 30 containers of cinnamon a month we grew up with cinnamon says 36 year old runage at his office in kamburupitiya surrounded by several industry awards his family has won over the years we lived in a two bedroom house we slept in one room in the other room my thaththa stored cinnamon once they were in the business the runage family learned that mexico is one of the biggest cinnamon consumers so thaththa learned english and visited mexico in 1998 to find a buyer says runage but they spoke spanish so thaththa sent his business cards to companies he found in a telephone book five months later we sold our first container of cinnamon to mexico the world s best cinnamon there are two types of cinnamon in the western market ceylon cinnamon named after the title british colonisers gave to sri lanka and cassia ceylon cinnamon is native to sri lanka it has a lush inviting scent and a sweet taste and its quills are soft and light brown in colour cassia comes from other asian countries like china indonesia and vietnam its bark is sturdy with a rough texture it is dark brown in colour and is stronger and hotter in taste cassia is considered lower quality while ceylon often triumphs as the pure true cinnamon the process of producing this cinnamon includes several laborious time consuming steps this is also why ceylon cinnamon is expensive in the market while cassia is cheap runage says at the estate seeds are planted in grow bags after one year saplings are cultivated harvesting begins four years later for harvesting farmers cut down the branches of cinnamon trees at an angle which allows cinnamon bushes to regrow lakshith says young and tender twigs are thrown away once branches are soaked in water and are moist enough peelers remove the outermost layer of the cinnamon bark to produce thin cinnamon quills they spend hours stripping off the inner bark of the cinnamon branch in sheets once produced ceylon cinnamon quills are graded based on their width the thinner the quills the higher they are in value alba is the highest form of cinnamon with a diameter of 6mm h1 is a lower grade of cinnamon with a diameter of 22mm in the export market alba costs twice as much as h1 a generational craft with a hearty smile suduhakuru piyathilake holds a large batch of cinnamon quills piyathilake and his wife have been living in an old dilapidated house next to the estate s main building for 10 years now at 5am every day piyathilake heads off to the plantation after collecting branches from about 15 trees he plods back to the water tank in the main building drops them off for soaking and returns to the plantation he must make several trips back and forth before he begins peeling when it s moist it s easy to peel says the 55 year old that s why we cut them early in the morning and soak them when the clock hits 10am piyathilake comes back with the last batch after five hours he has collected the branches of 200 trees sweat trickles down his forehead a resident kitten swats at his feet but piyathilake ignores it and rushes in for a shower after a two hour break he sharpens his knife by scraping the outer bark of the branch and then he gets to work this is what my father and his father did he says now my sons are cinnamon peelers piyathilake has been peeling cinnamon for the last 43 years he learned the craft from his father in their village in elpitiya 70km north of the runage family estate where his children live with his mother at home cinnamon trees adorn their back yard piyathilake says but it s a small garden so we can t harvest cinnamon every day of the year we don t make much money there so i work here with my wife we only see our children once in every four months piyathilake is so adept at work that he can masterfully strip off extremely thin barks of the cinnamon branch by merely measuring them next to his index finger after peeling the outer bark he makes two cuts on two opposite sides before peeling off the inner bark a half a length cut of your smallest bone is for alba piyathilake says for rough or h1 cinnamon quills piyathilake uses the length of two bones of his index finger however even for experienced generational peelers like piyathilake making extremely thin alba cinnamon is profitless by 10pm when he sets off to sleep piyathilake can have peeled about 5kg of lower grade cinnamon earning about 2 500 rupees 12 50 per kilogramme but i will only make just one kilo of alba for the whole day he says alba is smaller and lightweight so you need to make more quills to make up a kilo that earns me only 4 300 rupees when piyathilake removes the inner bark it curls up within a few minutes under the shade these barks are then stuffed with small cuttings of the bark called quillings to make one 42 inch 1 metre quill quills are placed on ropes under the roof for drying after three days peelers pack them into bales and send them off to the factory for piyathilake and his family cinnamon is their bread and butter but it is also much more than that it s a craft you have to master for years i started peeling cinnamon when i was 12 it took me several years to strip off thin layers of the inner bark without damaging it he says skills shortage for producers like runage however it is not always easy to find skilled labour at the carlton estate piyathilake is one of their last experienced peelers runage feels that finding generational peelers is one of the biggest challenges in the business today peeling cinnamon requires hard labour so the younger generations don t want to do it any more they prefer office jobs it doesn t necessarily mean that these office jobs will pay you more than peeling cinnamon but an office job has a better social image today says runage people consider peeling cinnamon as a low level job so it s difficult for us to find experienced peelers now back at the estate s main building grey haired heenipellage chandra sits on a floor mat her eyes focused on the cinnamon bark she peels for 10 years the 62 year old has walked to the estate daily to peel at least 3kg of cinnamon chandra recalls runage s father visiting her house in the late 1980s he came to meet my father in law and buy cinnamon from him chandra has been peeling cinnamon at home since she was married somewhere in the late 1970s she says trying to recall her wedding day husband s father and his father all of them peeled cinnamon but chandra s children do not peel cinnamon any more both her 20 something sons do office jobs says chandra as her eyes twinkle with a smile she is proud of her sons they have climbed the social ladder when the coronavirus pandemic began most resident cinnamon peelers left for their homes during the months long lockdowns runage had to shuffle his staff around to find labour women from the factory were relocated to the estate to peel cinnamon dayani malkanthi 44 worked at the packing department at the factory but a few months ago when sri lanka went back into lockdown to battle a new wave of covid she came to the estate i m really slow it s a very hard job says malkanthi giving a faint smile while scraping the outer bark of a cinnamon branch i m still learning once done malkanthi is careful to avoid any damage to the inner cinnamon bark while experienced peelers like piyathilake peel about 5kg a day malkanthi can produce only about 2kg she is not happy here and wants to relocate to the factory take us back to the factory she says to the visiting officer lakshith let s see we are trying to find skilled peelers says lakshith walking past malkanthi he cannot make any promises while the company struggles to find skilled labourers coronavirus is another battle they have to tackle of colonial oppression cinnamon was widely consumed as early as 3000 bc the ancient world considered it a luxurious spice for ancient egyptians cinnamon was a status symbol which they also used in perfumes the greeks considered it a medicine sinhalese literature in the 10th century mentions that the island s cinnamon was highly valued in the 13th century sinhalese kings established economic ties with egypt to export it historian nirmal ranjith dewasiri says that from the beginning of the 10th century arab merchants traded sri lanka s cinnamon to europe along with other spices the island became an important hub in the indian ocean trade in ancient sri lanka the king was considered the guardian of the land for cultivating the land people had to perform a service to him historically these tasks were assigned to certain castes cinnamon peeling was reserved for the salagama community who were originally weavers and believed to be the descendants of post 13th century south indian migrants cinnamon grew in the wild in sri lanka therefore for months of the year the head of the household would set off to the jungles to produce a certain amount of cinnamon for the king in return for the land they cultivated when the portuguese colonisers came here they took advantage of this ancient land tenure system says dewasiri a paper pdf by historian mu de silva explains that a decree from goa then portuguese india declared the salagama community to be descendants of captured slaves in order to exploit them previously cinnamon peeling was reserved for the head of the household in a salagama family but under portuguese rule boys as young as 12 had to peel cinnamon and deliver a certain amount of it the colonisers increased this amount according to age and one s physical condition by the end of the 17th century the original weavers now turned peelers had to stay in the woods for more than eight months of the year writes mu de silva then in 1658 the dutch allied with the kandyan kingdom in sri lanka took control of sri lanka s coastal belt after a series of battles with the portuguese and established a cinnamon monopoly by exploiting the salagam community to supply the spice to meet the growing demand of the european market governor rijckloff van goens jr ruling from 1675 to 1680 referred to cinnamon as the bride around whom all of us danced there were only a small number of peelers left in the coastal areas by then dewasiri explains most people lost their lives because of battles against the colonial invasions and various diseases some of them had gone to the central hills of sri lanka to escape their fate says dewasiri so there was more burden on the individual peeler when you marry a low caste person you automatically become part of that lower caste so some salagama people would marry into a lower caste to escape the burden on them says dewasiri but the dutch noticed that so they made a new law even if you marry a low caste person you are still a cinnamon peeler so there was no escape local headmen supervised the cinnamon peelers they were paid by the dutch according to the number of peelers they provided according to mu de silva the dutch forced a person who could stand up and walk with the help of a stick to peel cinnamon those who attempted to flee were tied and tortured like high criminals to be placed in stocks and sent to colombo for trial and seldom they escaped flogging and other punishments in colombo he adds when cinnamon trees dwindled in the jungles because of excessive peeling the dutch took measures to cultivate cinnamon by 1794 there were 609 million cinnamon trees in southwest sri lanka by the end of the dutch rule there were massive commercial plantations of cinnamon along the coast when the british occupied the island in 1815 other cash crops like coffee and tea became more important explains dewasiri referring to dutch era plantations like cinnamon gardens in colombo today there is hardly a cinnamon tree left in the area which is now an upmarket neighbourhood with residential houses boutiques and cafes a tourist experience despite these colonial era changes some generational labourers like piyathilake are still peeling cinnamon during their rule dutch colonisers also harnessed the services of other castes to meet their demands one of those was the hakuru caste who were traditional jaggery makers piyathilake belongs to the hakuru community in elpitiya a region famous for palm jaggery but as far as his memory runs his family never made jaggery cinnamon was the only thing we knew says piyathilake trying to recall the childhood stories he heard from his grandparents i don t know how our ancestors began peeling cinnamon maybe we had so much cinnamon growing in the land as for runage cinnamon is still tied to the lives of thousands of people in the south of sri lanka in his company alone there are about 9 000 registered farmers and peelers more than 40 000 members of their families depend on the cinnamon industry for their income cinnamon also occupies a place in the tourism industry today sarath de silva 70 lives on a small island named ganduwa in koggala lake roughly an hour s drive and a 20 minute boat ride from the runage family estate cinnamon trees grow in the wild here and there are five houses in total before the coronavirus pandemic many local and foreign tourists flocked to ganduwa de silva peeled cinnamon as tourists snapped pictures he then treated them to a cup of cinnamon infused black tea in return most visitors would buy small packets of cinnamon quills cinnamon powder and one ounce about 30ml glass bottles of cinnamon oil each costs 400 rupees 2 for now the pandemic has completely halted de silva s means of earning an income but he is hopeful that tourists will return when the travel restrictions are relaxed de silva is not the only one in the cinnamon tourism business as foreign arrivals started increasing more and more cinnamon growers organised tours for visitors there were luxury tours like the cinnamon experience where visitors can walk through a large estate and receive hands on experience peeling cinnamon tourists could also prepare and taste cinnamon scented sri lankan curries the cassia challenge while the runage family has been successful in building a lucrative cinnamon business their biggest challenge in the international trade has been cassia that masquerades as ceylon cinnamon in the market when you walk to walmart or costco in america everything is labelled cinnamon you can t find what cassia is or what ceylon cinnamon is explains runage that s a big challenge because cassia is cheap and people tend to buy it research shows that cassia also contains high levels of coumarin that may cause liver damage if one consumes it in large quantities it is a reason why ceylon cinnamon is also touted as the healthier option but runage says that most people are not aware of it while european countries use cinnamon in their food there is little demand from the continent for ceylon cinnamon european buyers like to buy products from the country of origin that leads us to our next problem says runage to prove that ceylon cinnamon comes from sri lanka we need to acquire the gi for ceylon cinnamon in 2020 sri lanka applied for the gi tag for ceylon cinnamon during the process madagascar objected the objection has been made by the madagascar authorities on the grounds that ceylon cinnamon is not a variety and they too grow ceylon cinnamon jm seneviratne who is the economics research unit director of sri lanka s department of export agriculture told the local newspaper sunday morning i didn t take them to a lab to test but i saw our cinnamon growing in madagascar a couple of years ago when i went there says runage it is thought that sailors brought cinnamon to madagascar around the 17th century they don t use our traditional methods of peeling so ceylon cinnamon is very much our unique product but unless we have the gi tag we can t go somewhere else and tout it as ours no one will believe us what the future holds runage believes that government intervention and a proper system to regulate the cinnamon industry is essential for the future no matter how much we make businesses like us cannot fight for the gi tag that s up to the governments for now runage exports most of the cinnamon produce to latin american countries like mexico guatemala and peru we can get more buyers from south american countries but they are quite far away so if i travel there i would want to visit a few countries at once explains runage you would wonder why i can t do that let me tell you there s an issue if i want to visit peru as a businessman i have to go to the embassy in new delhi to get a visa once i get it and apply for a visa to guatemala my peru visa has already expired and this is where runage needs government assistance bilateral agreements between countries so businessmen like him can explore more opportunities despite these challenges the company continues to expand exporting cinnamon quills and powder across the globe and also producing and selling cinnamon oil both leaf oil which is used for perfumes and bark oil favoured by culinary experts currently organic cinnamon accounts for only 1 3 percent of the company s whole production but runage is hoping to expand soon back in the estate piyathilake attends to his work peeling organically grown cinnamon and binding new quills for drying there is a way to identify good cinnamon in the local market he says if you see beautiful gold coloured cinnamon never buy them it looks beautiful but it s a lie they are deceiving you it s sprayed with sulfur so they look pretty in the eye despite his long tiring days at work he is proud of being part of a generational craft that has put a roof over his family s heads for centuries you have to make these cinnamon quills look beautiful without any cuts or wounds he says smiling like the same way you would dress a new bride

virulent propaganda and lies constantly issuing from washington and the western media washington s gratuitous demonization of russian president vladimir putin has rallied the russian people behind him putin has the highest approval rating ever achieved by any leader in my lifetime washington s reckless and irresponsible destruction of the trust achieved by reagan and gorbachev has resurrected the possibility of nuclear war from the grave in which reagan and gorbachev buried it again as during the cold war the specter of nuclear armageddon stalks the earth why did washington revive the threat of world annihilation why is this threat to all of humanity supported by the majority of congress by the entirety of the presstitute media and by academics and think tank inhabitants in the u s it was my task to answer this question for the conference read my speech below american exceptionalism dangerous what i propose to you is that the current difficulties in the international order are unrelated to yalta and its consequences but have their origin in the rise of the neoconservative ideology in the post soviet era and its influence on washington s foreign policy the collapse of the soviet union removed the only constraint on washington s power to act unilaterally abroad at that time china s rise was estimated to require a half century suddenly the united states found itself to be the uni power the world s only superpower neoconservatives proclaimed the end of history by the end of history neoconservatives mean that the competition between socio economic political systems is at an end history has chosen american democratic capitalism it is washington s responsibility to exercise the hegemony over the world given to washington by history and to bring the world in line with history s choice of american democratic capitalism in other words marx has been proven wrong the future does not belong to the proletariat but to washington american exceptionalism the neoconservative ideology raises the united states to the unique status of being the exceptional country and the american people acquire exalted status as the indispensable people if a country is the exceptional country it means that all other countries are unexceptional if a people are indispensable it means other peoples are dispensable we have seen this attitude at work in washington s 14 years of wars of aggression in the middle east these wars have left countries destroyed and millions of people dead maimed and displaced yet washington continues to speak of its commitment to protect smaller countries from the aggression of larger countries the explanation for this hypocrisy is that washington does not regard washington s aggression as aggression but as history s purpose we have also seen this attitude at work in washington s disdain for russia s national interests and in washington s propagandistic response to russian diplomacy the neoconservative doctrine of u s world supremacy is most clearly and concisely stated by paul wolfowitz a leading neoconservative who has held many high positions deputy assistant secretary of defense director of policy planning at the u s department of state assistant secretary of state ambassador to indonesia undersecretary of defense for policy deputy secretary of defense and president of the world bank in 1992 wolfowitz stated the neoconservative doctrine of american world supremacy our first objective is to prevent the re emergence of a new rival either on the territory of the former soviet union or elsewhere that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the soviet union this is a dominant consideration underlying the new regional defense strategy and requires that we endeavor to prevent any hostile power from dominating a region whose resources would under consolidated control be sufficient to generate global power for clarification a hostile power is a country with an independent policy russia china iran and formerly saddam hussein qaddafi assad this bold statement struck the traditional american foreign policy establishment as a declaration of american imperialism the document was rewritten in order to soften and disguise the blatant assertion of supremacy without changing the intent these documents are available online and you can examine them at your convenience neocon foreign policy dominance softening the language allowed the neoconservatives to rise to foreign policy dominance the neoconservatives are responsible for the clinton regime s attacks on yugoslavia and serbia neoconservatives especially wolfowitz are responsible for the george w bush regime s invasion of iraq the neoconservatives are responsible for the overthrow and murder of qaddafi in libya the assault on syria the propaganda against iran the drone attacks on pakistan and yemen the color revolutions in former soviet republics the attempted green revolution in iran the coup in ukraine and the demonization of putin a number of thoughtful americans suspect that the neoconservatives are responsible for 9 11 as that event gave the neoconservatives the new pearl harbor that their position papers said was necessary in order to launch their wars for hegemony in the middle east 9 11 led directly and instantly to the invasion of afghanistan where washington has been fighting since 2001 neoconservatives controlled all the important government positions necessary for a false flag attack neoconservative assistant secretary of state victoria nuland who is married to another neoconservative robert kagan implemented and oversaw washington s coup in ukraine and chose the new government the neoconservatives are highly organized and networked well financed supported by the print and tv media and backed by the u s military security complex and the israeli lobby there is no countervailing power to their influence on u s foreign power the neoconservative doctrine goes beyond the zbigniew brzezinski doctrine which dissented from detente and provocatively supported dissidents inside the soviet empire despite its provocative character the brzezinski doctrine remained a doctrine of power politics and containment it is not a doctrine of u s world hegemony while the neoconservatives were preoccupied for a decade with their wars in the middle east creating a u s africa command organizing color revolutions exiting disarmament treaties surrounding russia with military bases and pivoting to asia to surround china with new air and naval bases putin led russia back to economic and military competence and successfully asserted an independent russian foreign policy when russian diplomacy blocked washington s planned invasion of syria and washington s planned bombing of iran the neoconservatives realized that they had failed the first objective of the wolfowitz doctrine and had allowed the reemergence of a new rival on the territory of the former soviet union with the power to block unilateral action by washington attack on russia begins the attack on russia began washington spent 5 billion over a decade creating non governmental organizations ngos in ukraine and cultivating ukrainian politicians the ngos were called into the streets extreme nationalists were used to introduce violence and the elected democratic government was overthrown the intercepted conversation between victoria nuland and the u s ambassador in kiev in which the two washington operatives chose the members of the new ukrainian government is well known if the information that has recently come tome from armenia and kyrgyzstan is correct washington has financed ngos and is cultivating politicians in armenia and the former soviet central asian republics if the information is correct russia can expect more color revolutions or coups in other former territories of the soviet union perhaps china faces a similar threat in uyghurstan the conflict in ukraine is often called a civil war this is incorrect a civil war is when two sides fight for the control of the government the breakaway republics in eastern and southern ukraine are fighting a war of secession washington would have been happy to use its coup in ukraine to evict russia from its black sea naval base as this would have been a strategic military achievement however washington is pleased that the ukraine crisis that washington orchestrated has resulted in the demonization of putin thus permitting economic sanctions that have disrupted russia s economic and political relations with europe the sanctions have kept europe in washington s orbit no interest in peace washington has no interest in resolving the ukrainian situation the situation can be resolved diplomatically only if europe can achieve sufficient sovereignty over its foreign policy to act in europe s interest instead of washington s interest the neoconservative doctrine of u s world hegemony is a threat to the sovereignty of every country the doctrine requires subservience to washington s leadership and to washington s purposes independent governments are targeted for destabilization the obama regime overthrew the reformist government in honduras and currently is at work destabilizing venezuela bolivia ecuador and argentina and most likely also armenia and the former central asian soviet republics it would be a strategic error to dismiss the neoconservative ideology as unrealistic the doctrine is unrealistic but it is also the guiding force of u s foreign policy and can produce a world war in their conflict with washington s hegemony russia and china are disadvantaged the success of american propaganda during the cold war the large differences between living standards in the u s and those in communist lands overt communist political oppression at times brutal and the soviet collapse created in the minds of many people nonexistent virtues for the united states as english is the world language and the western media is cooperative washington is able to control explanations regardless of the facts the ability of washington to be the aggressor and to blame the victim encourages washington s march to more aggression 9 11 and the u s police state just as 9 11 served to launch washington s wars for hegemony in the middle east 9 11 served to create the american police state the constitution and the civil liberties it protects quickly fell to the accumulation of power in the executive branch that a state of war permitted new laws some clearly pre prepared such as the patriot act executive orders presidential directives and department of justice memos created an executive authority unaccountable to the constitution and to domestic and international law suddenly americans could be detained indefinitely without cause presented to a court habeas corpus a constitutional protection which prohibits any such detention has been set aside suddenly people could be tortured into confessions in violation of the right against self incrimination and in violation of domestic and international laws against torture suddenly americans and washington s closest allies could be spied on indiscriminately without the need of warrants demonstrating cause the obama regime added to the bush regime s transgressions the assertion of the right of the executive branch to assassinate u s citizens without due process of law the police state was organized under a massive new department of homeland security almost immediately whistleblower protections freedom of the press and speech and protest rights were attacked and reduced it was not long before homeland security declared that the department s focus has shifted from muslim terrorists to domestic extremists an undefined category anyone can be swept into this category homes of war protesters were raided and grand juries were convened to investigate the protesters americans of arab descent who donated to charities even charities on the state department s approved list that aided palestinian children were arrested and sentenced to prison for providing material support to terrorism all of this and more including police brutality has had a chilling effect on protests against the wars and the loss of civil liberty the rising protests from the american population and from soldiers themselves that eventually forced washington to end the vietnam war have been prevented in the 21st century by the erosion of rights intimidation loss of mobility no fly list job dismissal and other heavy handed actions inconsistent with a government accountable to law and to the people in an important sense the u s has emerged from the war on terror as an executive branch dictatorship unconstrained by the media and barely if at all constrained by congress and the federal courts the lawlessness of the executive branch has spread into governments of washington s vassal states and into the federal reserve the international monetary fund and the european central bank all of which violate their charters and operate outside their legal powers jobs offshoring destroyed the american industrial and manufacturing unions their demise and the current attack on the public employee unions has left the democratic party financially dependent on the same organized private interest groups as the republicans both parties now report to the same interest groups wall street the military security complex the israeli lobby agribusiness and the extractive industries oil mining timber control the government regardless of the party in power these powerful interests all have a stake in american hegemony the message is that the constellation of forces precludes internal political change america s achilles heel hegemony s achilles heel is the u s economy the fairy tale of american economic recovery supports america s image as the safe haven an image that keeps the dollar s value up the stock market up and interest rates down however there is no economic information that supports this fairy tale real median household income has not grown for years and is below the levels of the early 1970s there has been no growth in real retail sales for six years the labor force is shrinking the labor force participation rate has declined since 2007 as has the civilian employment to population ratio the 5 7 reported unemployment rate is achieved by not counting discouraged workers as part of the work force a discouraged worker is a person who can t find a job and gives up looking a second official unemployment rate which counts short term less than one year discouraged workers and is seldom reported stands at 11 2 the u s government stopped including long term discouraged workers discouraged for more than one year in 1994 if the long term discouraged are counted the current unemployment rate in the u s stands at 23 2 the offshoring of american manufacturing and professional service jobs such as software engineering and information technology has devastated the middle class the middle class has not found jobs with incomes comparable to those moved abroad the labor cost savings from offshoring the jobs to asia has boosted corporate profits the performance bonuses of executives and capital gains of shareholders thus all income and wealth gains are concentrated in a few hands at the top of the income distribution the number of billionaires grows as destitution reaches from the lower economic class into the middle class american university graduates unable to find jobs return to their childhood rooms in their parents homes and work as waitresses and bartenders in part time jobs that will not support them none of the problems that created the 2008 recession and that were created by the 2008 recession have been addressed instead policymakers have used an expansion of debt and money to paper over the problems money and debt have grown much more than u s gdp which raises questions about the value of the u s dollar and the credit worthiness of the u s government this raises the question why was the credit rating of russia a country with an extremely low ratio of debt to gdp downgraded and not that of the u s the answer is that the downgrading of russian credit worthiness was a political act directed against russia on behalf of u s hegemony how long can this house of cards stand how long can fairy tales and political acts keep the u s house of cards standing a rigged stock market a rigged interest rate a rigged dollar exchange value a rigged and suppressed gold price the current western financial system rests on world support for the u s dollar and nothing more the problem with neoliberal economics which pervades all countries even russia and china is that neoliberal economics is a tool of american economic imperialism as is globalism as long as countries targeted by washington for destabilization support and cling to the american doctrines that enable the destabilization the targets are defenseless if russia china and the brics bank were willing to finance greece italy and spain perhaps those countries could be separated from the eu and nato the unraveling of washington s empire would begin dr paul craig roberts was assistant secretary of the u s treasury under president ronald reagan and was associate editor and columnist at the wall street journal he has been a professor of economics in six universities and is the author of numerous books and scholarly contributions he has testified before congress on 30 occasions

the new government of afghanistan run by the muslim fanatics of the taliban has called on international donors to rescue the country from a dire situation a report on this latest call for undeserved support is here un world should send pledged aid to afghans to avert economic refugee crisis algemeiner october 9 2021 the world should urgently provide promised aid to afghanistan the un refugee agency said on saturday warning that a lack of resources is hampering efforts to avert an economic crisis that could push fresh flows of refugees to its neighbors and beyond but why is there a lack of resources given that the americans plowed more than a trillion dollars into the afghan economy over two decades what happed to all that money here s what happened colossal theft by the afghan leaders our steadfast friends and allies and by all their relatives too those grasping leaders made sure to divert hundreds of millions of dollars and possibly billions in aid money to their own and relatives bank accounts abroad and already they ve been spending that money taken from the aid that had been provided to the afghan government by american taxpayers without any embarrassment or worry a new report shows how one well connected afghan is enjoying our aid money he s daoud wardak the son of afghanistan s former defense minister his latest purchase is reported on here son of afghanistan s former defense minister buys 20 9 million beverly hills mansion by james mcclain dirt october 7 2021 he already owns a 5 2 million miami beach condo at the prestigious st regis bal harbour resort but

rectangular pool sits just a few feet from the house not much is publicly known about the various business interests or wealth origins of wardak an ethnic pashtun refugee who was born in afghanistan in 1977 but public corporation records show he s the president of a miami based firm called ad capital group various reports have also noted that his older brother hamed wardak a georgetown university grad and onetime valedictorian is a successful businessman who runs military transportation company ncl holdings based in virginia but operating primarily in afghanistan ncl has secured lucrative u s government contracts in exchange for protecting american supply routes in afghanistan those contracts were reportedly worth north of a whopping 360 million the wardak paterfamilias is abdul rahim wardak who served as the minister of defense in that position he no doubt had a great many ways to amass a fortune either by kickbacks from defense contractors to ensure that their weaponry would be chosen for purchase or by inflating the costs of weapons procured and pocketing the difference his son daoud wardak has been buying american real estate to add to his portfolio he already owns a 5 2 million miami beach condominium at the st regis bal harbour resort but he apparently also wanted a west coast outpost to that end he s bought a 20 9 million mansion in beverly hills if he has spent 27 million on real estate alone how much more do you think he has in stocks bonds and cash surely tens of millions perhaps a total of 100 million a tidy sum which was not the fruit of hard work or business acumen but the result of being the crooked son of a crooked father who cheated american taxpayers by raising the costs of weaponry for the afghan military and then there is daoud s brother hamed wardak who has managed to make a fortune from his military transportation company that operates or did until the taliban took over the country in afghanistan now how do you think hamed wardak s company managed to get u s government contracts to protect supply routes worth more than 360 million if not through the machinations and clout and inside knowledge of rival bidders possessed b his father the defense minister of afghanistan the humanitarian crisis in afghanistan remains really dire babar baloch spokesperson for the un high commmissioner for refugees said in an interview in islamabad the focus has to be inside afghanistan to avoid and avert another refugee crisis since the taliban took over afghanistan on aug 15 the country already struggling with drought and severe poverty from decades of war has seen its economy all but collapse most of the nation s international assistance has been cut off though there are exceptions for humanitarian aid billions of dollars in central bank assets held abroad have also been frozen which has put pressure on the banking system those billions in assets of the afghani central bank that are in accounts abroad should stay frozen for if they were to be unfrozen the taliban would promptly take them over and nothing should be done that would support the fanatical muslims of the taliban our worry is afghan suffering will increase the impact will be inside but also it could be beyond afghanistan in terms of displacement not only to countries like pakistan and iran that have been generous hosts of refugees for decades but beyond the total needed for humanitarian operations in afghanistan in the next few months is 600 million baloch said and only 35 of that had been provided by international donors despite promises at a recent conference in geneva where donors pledged more than 1 billion in aid if the americans can figure out a way to distribute aid directly to impoverished afghans bypassing the taliban altogether then some limited humanitarian aid could be given but that s it and before making any commitment to provide such aid washington should try to claw back as much of the billions that were seized by corrupt afghans such as abdul rahim daoud and hamed wardak there ought to be legislation allowing the american government to seize the assets in this country of the wardaks and others like them based on the argument that there is no possible explanation for their great wealth other than corruption and that the money they stole came from the american government which has a right to get as much of it back as possible washington can for example make an attempt at freezing the wardaks bank accounts and seizing the wardaks real estate and try to persuade other western countries to do likewise and that extends to many other afghans beside the wardak family literally to thousands of afghans who treated the american government as their own atm machine the self exiled former president of afghanistan ashraf ghani who skipped his country what a patriot as soon as the taliban approached kabul carried with him on the plane 169 million in cash where could he have gotten such sums given that his official salary was only in the five figures it s american aid money and we must do everything we can to get it back and how did one of ghani s predecessors the mediagenic hamid karzai who comically claims a net worth of 20 000 manage to amass 20 million on the same modest salary as ghani if we simply compile a list the 200 leading members of the afghan government from 2001 to 2021 and then beside each name put both their government salaries and their current estimated net worth the results will be both eye opening and maddening what will biden what will congress do to claw back what is after all american taxpayers money anything or as i greatly fear nothing
