enough is enough leeser says what will the bond money fund not all debt is bad mayor s reasons for veto we cannot continue issuing debt and obligating future generations to that debt as we just saw with the unexpected covid 19 public health crisis we do not know what is in store for us in our future no one could have foreseen the expenditures we d be faced with in addressing this crisis as such we must tread carefully in issuing any additional debt i believe in being fiscally responsible and debt cautious in debt management el paso already ranks at the top of the six largest cities in texas with certificates of obligation debt outstanding tns the el paso texas city council voted tuesday to override a veto by the mayor that would ve stopped the city from issuing 96 million in nonvoter approved debt the vote was 6 2 with city reps claudia lizette rodriguez district 6 and joe molinar district 4 opposing overriding the veto city reps peter svarzbein district 1 alexsandra annello district 2 cassandra hernandez district 3 isabel salcido district 5 henry rivera district 7 and cissy lizarraga district 8 voted in favor of overturning the veto the city s charter states that six city council representatives are needed to override a mayoral veto molinar said the city needs to be more frugal with its spending i have to say this is not our money it s taxpayer money molinar said we have a fiduciary responsibility to do well with it rodriguez the other dissenting vote said the city council should be looking for alternative ways to fund projects rather than relying on debt that isn t approved by voters this form of debt is known as certificates of obligation or cos those certificates of obligation that we ve collected over the years we re nearing a billion dollars rodriguez said those optics are terrible as of august 2020 el paso ranked no 1 in the amount of co debt outstanding among texas six largest cities according to the texas bond review board annello who voted in favor of overriding the veto said there are a number of ongoing projects that are in low income communities that she wants to support but she doesn t want to fund the mexican american cultural center and so here i am having to put my values and my community on the line and make a very hard decision annello said mayor oscar leeser said he is in favor of the projects but wants to find another way to fund them just like a credit card just because you have it you don t need to continue to charge on it leeser said sooner or later that credit card is gonna blow up on you and this is no different in april the city council approved issuing 93 million in cos during tuesday meeting svarzbein asked leeser what changed since then i m speaking today because i can tell you that enough is enough and i think we can find money to be able to do these projects and continue to work together as a body leeser said svarzbein responded to leeser by saying he wish he heard those words from leeser s mouth three months ago at the beginning of this budget season not three days after we approved the budget leeser said the city s slow growth reflected in the 2020 u s census also influenced his decision to veto the new round of certificates of obligation census data wasn t released until aug 13 city council approved the 2021 2022 budget on aug 24 svarzbein said he felt blindsided by leeser s veto i can t support this i wish that we were having these conversations i wish i could hear anything of actual substance about which projects that the mayor would like to propose to defund or cut svarzbein said leeser s veto applied to only a portion of a 180 million bond package city council authorized on aug 24 the portion leeser opposed was 96 million in certificates of obligation the co money is earmarked for construction projects such as a new roundabout near the downtown international bridge street lighting and animal quarantine areas for el paso animal services the total 180 million bond package will pay for extra costs tied to projects voters approved in the 2012 quality of life bond package and the 2019 public safety bond city engineer sam rodriguez told the city council that the pandemic delayed many of those projects and now the city needs more money to cover higher construction costs the costs for other projects like the eastside regional park and the mexican american cultural center macc went up after the original bond issuances because of added amenities and design changes the macc and the eastside regional park are set to get 20 8 million in this latest bond issuance city figures show 46 7 million of the bond money will go to street improvements chief financial officer robert cortinas said so some of these projects have already begun with the design or the initial stages of these projects and so the funding that we requested is to in essence complete a lot of projects that have already been started cortinas said taking advantage of the low interest rate brings the project cost down martin luby a professor at the university of texas at austin who specializes in public finance said that debt is a tool cities use to pay for their developmental needs particularly long term infrastructure like buildings and roads the fact that there s more debt that s not necessarily a bad thing luby said one of the great things about debt is that you re spreading the cost over many years meaning that you re spreading the cost amongst various beneficiaries the current taxpayer they re getting a benefit of that new road being built but so is the person 30 years from now so it makes sense out of equity purposes for them both to be paying for it fitch ratings gives the city of el paso a favorable aa credit rating which is the agency s second highest rating an april 2021 report by the agency about el paso municipal bonds said fitch views the city s budget management as strong marked by a trend of stable and strengthened financial position in recent years anne ross a municipal finance specialist who helps institutional investors buy bonds said now is a good time for governments to borrow because demand for bonds is high that demand is pushing down interest rates making borrowing cheap the inflow of cash into the muni bond space is phenomenal ross said if you re an issuer and you are coming to the market now you are making out like a bandit because there s so much demand for your paper in a news release friday leeser gave four reasons for vetoing the certificates of obligation stating i honestly believe that being the largest city in the state of texas with certificates of obligation and adding additional obligation to the taxpayers that they re gonna have to pay back sooner or later is going to be tough for our city and our taxpayers leeser said what it does do is it redefines the type of debt that can still be serviced with the interest and that sort of side of the tax rate el paso city attorney karla nieman said

by kristina cooke and mica rosenberg reuters in mid august ahmad got an urgent call from his nephew zia telling him to come immediately to kabul airport to try to get on an evacuation flight members of the taliban had been to ahmad s house in the capital looking for zia who had worked with the u s military in afghanistan they also wanted ahmad who was not at home at the time to report to the police station zia told him ahmad 43 worried he would be arrested or executed because of his nephew s involvement with the u s military which flew out its last remaining troops this week in a chaotic withdrawal formally ending a 20 year war ahmad went to the airport with his wife and six children but got separated from them in the crowds at the entrance gates he said he showed officials a photo of his nephew s green card on his phone and told them he was a member of his family that was enough to get him alone on a plane to the u s allied gulf arab state of qatar he said following the scramble to evacuate vulnerable afghans thousands of people some with no documentation or pending u s visa applications others in families with mixed immigration statuses are now waiting in transit hubs in third countries the hubs include u s military bases in qatar germany and italy where afghans must overcome bureaucratic immigration hurdles to eventually enter the united states i am so disturbed about leaving them ahmad said by phone speaking through an interpreter about his wife five daughters and 2 year old son who are now in hiding ahmad spoke on condition he be identified only by his first name to protect his family army general mark milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said on wednesday there were about 43 000 evacuees in nine countries in europe and the middle east and some 20 000 afghans at eight military bases in the united states at the u s military base in qatar people line up for hours for food fearful that there won t be enough to go around said ahmad he has only the clothes he arrived in which quickly became sweat drenched in the 100 degree fahrenheit 38 degree celsius heat his nephew zia is a u s permanent resident so was able to fly to seattle washington with his wife and five children three of whom had pending visa applications but no visas after two weeks in qatar ahmad and another nephew who have only afghan identity documents remain u s officials took their fingerprints on tuesday but have given them no updates on when they might board a flight to the united states they don t have pending special immigrant visa siv applications ahmad said some evacuees without visas have been allowed into the united states temporarily on urgent humanitarian grounds rather than under the traditional refugee program surging resources sivs are available to certain afghans who aided u s forces as interpreters and translators as well as in other roles and who fear reprisals by the taliban a white house official said the u s government is surging resources to bases abroad to screen those hoping to enter the united states much is still unclear to refugee groups immigration lawyers and individual afghans about how long some people may have to wait overseas as checks on their applications move forward the immigration bureaucracy is cumbersome and there is a lot of complexity to it said steve miska a former white house official who is helping coordinate evacuation efforts by non profit and veterans groups advocates have long criticized the slow moving multi step siv application process which has left many petitions languishing without resolution for years refugee groups said the delays are unjustified because siv applicants have extensive documentation of their work with u s entities and pose no national security threat for afghans like ahmad who have no pending visa applications the groups said the u s government could draw on its experience vetting refugees and asylum seekers who often cross borders without documents to allow their passage to the united states many of these afghans had their fingerprints and photos collected over the years either by u s government officials or afghan authorities who shared information with the united states the u s can figure out who people are but this takes time and resources and whether the u s government is going to bother to help people or force the people themselves to meet an impossible burden said margaret stock a military and immigration expert no visibility in addition to the afghans at u s military installations abroad there are thousands of afghans who were evacuated in a flurry of improvised private organized by non profit groups companies and veterans associations that s an entire category of refugees i am not sure our government has visibility on miska said those are the ones i am really nervous about since they might struggle to lodge petitions to enter the united states around 3 500 afghans were brought to the united arab emirates on charter flights by a u s nonprofit according to a diplomat familiar with the situation these afghans are not being processed to go to the united states the diplomat said as washington is prioritizing the roughly 4 000 people in the uae evacuated on u s government flights the diplomat said it is expected to take months to process all these evacuees the groups that leveraged personal connections and raised private donations to charter flights out of afghanistan may lack the expertise to help people navigate the complex u s immigration system said miska the former white house official many afghans now find themselves in unfamiliar countries with no clear idea of where they will be able to permanently settle albania accepted a couple hundred staff members and afghans affiliated with the open society foundation a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire george soros said laura silber a vice president for the group she said the organization was trying to help their staff as they consider whether to apply for visas or resettlement in the united states or elsewhere albanian officials have welcomed the evacuees many of whom only had national identity cards and no passports and put them up in a local beach resort some who made it on to evacuation flights are haunted by the idea they could have brought along more relatives i feel so guilty said zia

this past year has underlined a multitude of global issues including those related to diversity and social justice as well as climate change and the environment and while many brands are working to do their part ones of a global nature with a larger footprint workforce and set of resources are primed to take the lead for global small business platform xero building a fast growing but sustainable business means consciously managing our environmental impact helping to build thriving communities and cultivating an engaged workforce climate change and the environment has been especially front of mind for many of our people and customers around the globe that s why xero introduced our environmental sustainability program called net zero xero and since 2019 has been committed to carbon neutrality offsetting 100 of our global organisation s scope 1 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions across owned and operated businesses in australia and internationally including new zealand the united states canada south africa the united kingdom and asia in fy21 xero was certified carbon neutral by the australian government s climate active program which is one of the world s most established and respected carbon neutrality programs we achieved carbon neutrality by purchasing certified carbon offsets from projects in indonesia india and new zealand these projects are designed to restore indigenous forests and protect endangered species soak up carbon dioxide directly from the air and generate clean energy with the aim of reducing future emissions xero also recently expanded our sponsorship of the fishermans bay conservation project near akaroa in new zealand which is also owned and operated by a xero small business customer that means that in addition to the fishermans bay project s carbon benefits we re also directly supporting biodiversity related activities such as yellow eyed penguin sanctuary habitat management possum and predator pest control work noxious weed control work and provision and maintenance of safe tracks for public and educational groups more information about xero s fy20 carbon disclosure emission reduction plans and the projects we selected to offset our emissions can be viewed on the climate active website while xero sees the offsetting of our emissions as important we also recognise the importance of actively working to minimise our footprint an important step xero intends to take in fy22 is to formalise our emissions reduction plans and set science based targets here are some of the reduction initiatives already underway reducing electricity consumption via efficiency measures within xero offices such as sensor and timer lighting extensive use of led lighting in all offices working with air conditioning engineers and landlords to improve the efficiency of heating and cooling systems cutting waste production and increasing recycling rates including e waste collection and compost bins in some offices making procurement decisions that consider the carbon intensity of our suppliers and our climate impact evolving our flexible work policy to allow our people to choose how many days a week they work from home and how many in the office with their manager s approval xero expects this will reduce carbon emissions associated with a reduction in people commuting to work and travelling for work encouraging our people to use alternative modes of transport to get to work such as cycling by offering end of trip facilities including showers bike cages and lockers purchasing forest stewardship council certified paper stock for jobs that require printing proactively working with amazon web services aws our cloud services provider to determine how it can operate its infrastructure more efficiently

in mid august ahmad got an urgent call from his nephew zia telling him to come immediately to kabul airport to try to get on an evacuation flight members of the taliban had been to ahmad s house in the capital looking for zia who had worked with the u s military in afghanistan they also wanted ahmad who was not at home at the time to report to the police station zia told him advertisement ahmad 43 worried he would be arrested or executed because of his nephew s involvement with the u s military which flew out its last remaining troops this week in a chaotic withdrawal formally ending a 20 year war ahmad went to the airport with his wife and six children but got separated from them in the crowds at the entrance gates he said he showed officials a photo of his nephew s green card on his phone and told them he was a member of his family that was enough to get him alone on a plane to the u s allied gulf arab state of qatar he said following the scramble to evacuate vulnerable afghans thousands of people some with no documentation or pending u s visa applications others in families with mixed immigration statuses are now waiting in transit hubs in third countries the hubs include u s military bases in qatar germany and italy where afghans must overcome bureaucratic immigration hurdles to eventually enter the united states i am so disturbed about leaving them ahmad said by phone speaking through an interpreter about his wife five daughters and 2 year old son who are now in hiding ahmad spoke on condition he be identified only by his first name to protect his family army general mark milley chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said on wednesday there were about 43 000 evacuees in nine countries in europe and the middle east and some 20 000 afghans at eight military bases in the united states at the u s military base in qatar people line up for hours for food fearful that there won t be enough to go around said ahmad he has only the clothes he arrived in which quickly became sweat drenched in the 100 degree fahrenheit 38 degree celsius heat advertisement his nephew zia is a u s permanent resident so was able to fly to seattle washington with his wife and five children three of whom had pending visa applications but no visas after two weeks in qatar ahmad and another nephew who have only afghan identity documents remain u s officials took their fingerprints on tuesday but have given them no updates on when they might board a flight to the united states they don t have pending special immigrant visa applications ahmad said some evacuees without visas have been allowed into the united states temporarily on urgent humanitarian grounds rather than under the traditional refugee program surging resources sivs are available to certain afghans who aided u s forces as interpreters and translators as well as in other roles and who fear reprisals by the taliban a white house official said the u s government is surging resources to bases abroad to screen those hoping to enter the united states much is still unclear to refugee groups immigration lawyers and individual afghans about how long some people may have to wait overseas as checks on their applications move forward the immigration bureaucracy is cumbersome and there is a lot of complexity to it said steve miska a former white house official who is helping coordinate evacuation efforts by non profit and veterans groups advocates have long criticized the slow moving multi step siv application process which has left many petitions languishing without resolution for years refugee groups said the delays are unjustified because siv applicants have extensive documentation of their work with u s entities and pose no national security threat for afghans like ahmad who have no pending visa applications the groups said the u s government could draw on its experience vetting refugees and asylum seekers who often cross borders without documents to allow their passage to the united states many of these afghans had their fingerprints and photos collected over the years either by u s government officials or afghan authorities who shared information with the united states the u s can figure out who people are but this takes time and resources and whether the u s government is going to bother to help people or force the people themselves to meet an impossible burden said margaret stock a military and immigration expert no visibility in addition to the afghans at u s military installations abroad there are thousands of afghans who were evacuated in a flurry of improvised private efforts organized by non profit groups companies and veterans associations that s an entire category of refugees i am not sure our government has visibility on miska said those are the ones i am really nervous about since they might struggle to lodge petitions to enter the united states around 3 500 afghans were brought to the united arab emirates on charter flights by a u s nonprofit according to a diplomat familiar with the situation these afghans are not being processed to go to the united states the diplomat said as washington is prioritizing the roughly 4 000 people in the uae evacuated on u s government flights the diplomat said it is expected to take months to process all these evacuees the groups that leveraged personal connections and raised private donations to charter flights out of afghanistan may lack the expertise to help people navigate the complex u s immigration system said miska the former white house official many afghans now find themselves in unfamiliar countries with no clear idea of where they will be able to permanently settle albania accepted a couple hundred staff members and afghans affiliated with the open society foundation a philanthropic organization founded by billionaire george soros said laura silber a vice president for the group she said the organization was trying to help their staff as they consider whether to apply for visas or resettlement in the united states or elsewhere albanian officials have welcomed the evacuees many of whom only had national identity cards and no passports and put them up in a local beach resort some who made it on to evacuation flights are haunted by the idea they could have brought along more relatives your subscription could not be saved please try again your

for many years evolutionary scientists have taught that early humans evolved longer strides than other primates it turns out this was a highly inaccurate assumption a new study on chimpanzees shows the human stride is relatively much shorter than all of our primate cousins and it also reveals insights about why we walk as we do eradicating false assumptions one step at a time the challenged paradigm is that the long human stride developed for efficiency this is taught in almost every introductory class and textbook says nathan thompson from the new york institute of technology usa in his new paper published in the journal of experimental biology the researcher suggests that after about 7 million years of selective pressure for economical bipedalism there has been a lot of time to experiment with the costs and benefits compared with the strides of our closest primate relatives even the tallest humans take relatively short steps wrote thompson he added that when standardized by size in comparison with other primates humans don t really have long strides at all having cleared this traditional myth surrounding the assumed grandiosity of the human stride thompson says it might have been worthwhile for early humans to have walked with slightly shorter strides for whatever energy we lose said the scientist we might make up elsewhere the human stride is relatively not as long as a chimpanzee although our legs are of course longer shotprime studio adobe stock turning organic strides into big data the traditional misconception about humans having large steps became clear to thompson when he began investigating the rotational movements in chimpanzee pelvises watching them walk he began wondering whether the distinctive swivelling action observed in chimp s hips might be related to why they have longer relative strides than humans the professor s experiment first required teaching chimpanzees to walk upright on two feet while being filmed with high resolution 3 d cameras researchers danielle rubinstein william parrella o donnell and matt brett reconstructed human stride patterns and hip motions that were also recorded in 3 d then the humans steps were scaled down to overlay on the chimpanzees this showed that while the human legs were proportionally 112 longer their strides were 26 7 shorter than those of chimpanzees it was also observed that chimpanzees swiveled their hips between 28 and 61 degrees while human hips only rotated their hips by a mere 8 degrees the results of this comparative analysis on walking speed and time revealed chimp strides are 25 longer than humans this means chimp strides are 5 4 times greater than what are in comparison mini side to side wiggles performed by humans when they walk what does all this mean for science and for my strut thompson concluded that chimpanzees probably developed pelvic rotations to squeeze every bit of stride length out or their relatively short legs and attempting to answer why humans don t have the same swiveling motion in their hips as chimps thompson suggested the extreme rotations of the hips was all about achieving balance he wrote that chimps swing their arms and legs to serve as a kind of counterbalancing system a sort of weight displacement mechanism the scientist wrote that by forcing their muscles to work harder even while the human stride was less efficient this was a price that simply might not be worth paying for an increased stride length so there we have it folks decades of wrong assumptions about the size of the human step have now been put right no longer will our grandchildren be taught that humans have a large stride but they will now learn that the relatively short human stride evolved not for size but for efficiency however if a child were to ask thompson sir surely environmental factors greatly affected the human stride the researcher would no doubt say what he wrote in his paper that many other factors also impacted the development of our strides and the ways in which we all walk today top image chimpanzees walking on two legs has a pelvic swivel far larger than humans increasing their stride source chimpanzee sanctuary northwest by ashley cowie

reasons for the price increases are global in nature including the covid 19 pandemic challenging weather across the northern hemisphere and supply chain issues but the causes can also be seen much

very pleased to report a solid start to fiscal 2022 with overall sales and operating income in line with expectations and sales reaching their highest first quarter level since fiscal 2003 our results reflect strong top line growth driven by higher demand for both our mattress and residential upholstery fabric products in each of our businesses we executed our product driven strategy with a continued emphasis on design creativity and innovation we also benefited from our expanded market reach and the continued resilience of our flexible global platform despite supply chain disruption and pressures on profitability we are passionately dedicated to servicing the needs of our customers and both of our divisions have excelled in using our robust platform and long term supplier relationships to make sure that we meet our customer commitments we believe this is an advantage for culp as customer service is more important than ever in the face of supply chain disruption while we are optimistic about the ongoing strength of our sales trends we do continue to navigate headwinds relating to rising freight and raw material cost labor shortages our customer supply chain constraints for non fabric components and other pandemic related challenges our previously implemented price increases for both of our businesses did help to offset certain inflationary pressures and foreign currency fluctuations to some extent during the first quarter but with freight raw material and labor costs continuing to rise we are now taking further pricing action via surcharges in both businesses during the second quarter to assist in covering these rapidly increasing costs despite these challenges we continue to invest in our business and expand our capacity with our diversified manufacturing and sourcing capabilities along with our innovative products and digital design strategies we expect to have additional opportunities to capture market share with new and existing customers we are also excited about the september opening of our new innovation campus in downtown high point north carolina which will bring together our most innovative and creative minds and foster collaboration among our businesses we believe this will be a transformative space for culp and allow us to share best ideas across our divisions and better showcase our full expensive product lines to our customers importantly we have the financial strength to support our business in the current environment and we believe we are well positioned for continued growth as market conditions evolve we also remain grateful for the extraordinary efforts and resilience of our associates all around the world we are extremely proud of their hard work their adaptability and their dedication in the face of ongoing challenges i ll now turn the call over to ken who will review the financial results for the quarter kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks iv as mentioned earlier on the call we have posted slide presentations through our investor relations website that cover key performance measures we have also posted our capital allocation strategy here are the financial highlights for the first quarter net sales were 83 million up 29 compared to the prior year period iv will go into more detail on divisional operations in a moment the company reported income from operations of 3 3 million up 76 compared with income from operations of 1 9 million for the prior year period net income for the first quarter was 2 3 million or 0 18 per diluted share compared with a net loss of 2 7 million or 0 22 per diluted share for the prior year period which included a 3 7 million non cash net income tax charge excluding this income tax charge non gaap adjusted net income for the first quarter of last year was 1 million or 0 08 per diluted share the current quarter reflected an impressive sales performance from both divisions but our overall operating performance was affected by several headwinds namely higher freight and raw material cost labor shortages and unfavorable foreign exchange rate fluctuations among other factors i will comment on divisional performance in a moment trailing 12 months adjusted ebitda was 20 million or 6 3 of net sales compared with 12 million or 4 8 of net sales for the same period last year reflecting a year over year improvement of 66 consolidated return on capital for the trailing 12 month period was 15 5 the effective income tax rate for the first quarter this fiscal year was 28 7 compared with 283 7 for the same period a year ago our effective income tax rate during the first quarter this fiscal year was affected by the mix of taxable income that is mostly earned by our foreign operations located in china and canada which have higher income tax rates than the u s income tax expense during the first quarter of last fiscal year was significantly higher than the current quarter because of the 3 7 million net income tax charge i mentioned earlier looking ahead to the rest of this fiscal year we currently estimate that our consolidated effective income tax rate for the second quarter will be approximately 30 based on the facts we know today additionally we are currently projecting cash income tax payments of approximately 4 2 million for fiscal 2022 importantly our estimated cash income tax payments for this fiscal year are management s current projections only and can be affected over the year by actual earnings from our foreign subsidiaries located in china canada and haiti versus annual projections as well as changes in the foreign exchange rates associated with our china operations in relation to the u s dollar now let s take a look at our business segments for the mattress fabric segment sales for the first quarter were 43 1 million up 19 compared with last year s first quarter which was impacted by the covid 19 pandemic operating income for the quarter was 3 6 million compared with operating income of 1 8 million a year ago with an operating income margin for the quarter of 8 4 compared with 5 1 a year ago an increase of 330 basis points our improved operating performance for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of last year primarily reflects a solid increase in sales somewhat offset by increased raw material prices freight costs unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations in canada and china and inefficiency due to labor shortages in the u s and canada as compared to the fourth quarter of last year s 5 3 operating income margin our improved operating performance was primarily driven by a favorable product mix and the price increase implemented during the first quarter to help cover expected inflationary pressures but our results were further affected by operating inefficiencies due to labor shortages and additional increases in freight and raw material costs particularly during the second half of the quarter we are implementing a surcharge during the second quarter to help offset these pressures while also continuously working to control costs notably the surcharge will not take effect until midway through the quarter resulting in a temporary cost price lag that will affect our operating performance during the period return on capital for the trailing 12 month period for mattress fabrics was 19 6 for upholstery fabric segment sales for the first quarter were 40 million up 41 over the prior year which was impacted by the covid 19 pandemic operating income for the quarter was 2 3 million compared with 2 1 million a year ago with an operating income margin of 5 7 compared with 7 5 a year ago a decrease of 180 basis points despite our top line growth operating performance for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter of last year and also compared to the fourth quarter of last year s 7 2 operating income margin was negatively affected by the dramatic increase in freight costs and by lower sales in our read window products business as well as start up cost in our new haiti facility our operating performance as compared to the first quarter of last year was also pressured by foreign currency fluctuations in china notably our previously implemented price increase has helped offset foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to some extent as intended but we are implementing an additional freight surcharge during the second quarter to help cover the continued rise in freight costs we also began to see a growing project backlog in our read window products business during the first quarter but given the typically longer term timeframe for project installations which can often range from six months to nine months there is a temporary lag between the impact of the pandemic related disruption and improved results for this business return on capital for the trailing 12 month period for the upholstery fabrics segment was an impressive 74 3 here are the balance sheet highlights we reported 44 million in total cash and investments and no outstanding borrowings as of the end of the quarter compared with 47 4 million in total cash and investments and no outstanding debt at the end of the prior year period we generated cash flow from operations of 1 6 million and negative free cash flow of 782 000 for the first three months of the year compared with cash flow from operations of 10 6 million and free cash flow of 10 million for the same period last year as we continue to invest in our business our cash flow from operations and free cash flow during the first quarter were affected by increased inventory purchases due to higher sales capital expenditures including expenditures for machinery equipment and it investments as well as expenditures related to our new innovation campus incentive bonus compensation and payments for the new building lease associated with our haiti upholstery cut and sew operation during the first quarter we invested 2 5 million in the business through capital expenditures and payments associated with our new building lease in haiti we paid 1 4 million in regulatory dividends and spent 723 000 on share repurchases while we are very pleased with our solid balance sheet going into the second quarter it is important to note that we will continue to utilize our cash for strategic investments in working capital planned capital expenditures and investments in haiti with a significant portion that s been taken place during the second quarter the company repurchased approximately 49 000 shares of common stock during the first quarter of the year and repurchased approximately 48 000 additional shares through august 31 leaving approximately 3 6 million available under our current share repurchase program with that i ll turn the call back over to iv robert g culp iv chief executive officer thank you ken i will begin with the mattress fabrics business we were encouraged by the strong level of sales for this business during the first quarter our top line performance up 19 compared to last year and up 11 compared to the pre pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2020 was driven by the continued strength of our product offerings and was supplemented by the price increase implemented during the first quarter that help offset certain inflationary pressures additionally demand trends for the sewn mattress covers remained strong and our on shore near shore and off shore supply chain strategy as well as our fabric to cover model continued to provide a preferred platform that gives customers the agility and value they need for their business as we look ahead we expect that current inflationary conditions labor shortages and other near term headwinds will continue to impact the mattress fabrics business during fiscal 2022 we are confident in our ability to navigate these challenges as mentioned earlier we are adding a surcharge during the second quarter to help offset inflationary more inflationary pressures while also working diligently to control costs if demand trends remain strong we believe this business is well positioned for the long term we have a supply chain to continue meeting our customer commitments and we expect to continue increasing our operating income margin toward the end of the fiscal year as we benefit from innovative products creative designs digital marketing strategies pricing actions and eventual mitigation of costs now i ll turn to the upholstery fabric segment we were also pleased by the continued strong growth and sales for this business as well during the first quarter up 41 compared with the prior year period and up 26 compared with the pre pandemic first quarter of fiscal 2020 the growth in upholstery fabrics was driven by a significant increase in our residential business compared to last year and was also supplemented by a price increase that was effective during the quarter we continue to benefit from growth in our market reach the flexibility of our asian platform and the success of our product innovation strategy including the ongoing popularity of our livesmart portfolio of products we are especially encouraged by our popular livesmart evolve products which offer both performance and sustainability we believe that consumer desire for products with a sustainability focus will only gain more traction as we move beyond the covid 19 pandemic however our hospitality business particularly read window products remained under significant pressure in the first quarter from the ongoing covid 19 disruption that continues to affect the travel and leisure industry looking ahead we remain encouraged by the strong backlog in our residential upholstery business reflecting continued favorable demand and attraction to our innovative products we are also pleased to begin seeing some rebound in demand for hospitality fabrics and we have built our largest project backlog since the beginning of fiscal 2019 in read window products although as ken mentioned the timeframe for project installations in this business can range from six to nine months so there s an expected lag between the backlog and the corresponding results we do expect that near term headwinds including rising freight and labor costs customer supply chain constraints and ongoing pandemic related disruptions such as quarantine and shutdown requirements currently affecting our sourcing partners in vietnam may temporarily pressure our upholstery business during the year however with our flexible asian platform and the upcoming addition of our new haiti platform as well as our long term supplier relationships and our product driven strategy we are very confident in our ability to navigate these challenges we believe we are well positioned to sustain and enhance our competitive advantage over the long term as we continue to deliver innovative products that meet the needs of our customers i ll now turn back to ken to discuss the general outlook for the second quarter and fiscal 22 full year and we will then take some questions kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer although subject to uncertainties we are encouraged by the execution of our product driven strategy and the resilience of our global platform as well as our expanding market reach the financial outlook we are providing for the second quarter of this fiscal year is a sequential comparison to the first quarter rather than a comparison to the prior year period due to the current inflationary pressures and volatility that were not present during the prior period we expect our sales and consolidated operating income for the second quarter of this fiscal year to be comparable to the first quarter of this fiscal year with an expected consistent performance for our mattress fabrics business and an expected improvement in operating margins for our upholstery fabrics business for the full fiscal year we expect net sales to continue to increase moderately with a projected increase between 8 to 12 and consolidated operating income to increase significantly with a projected increase between 20 to 25 in each case as compared to last fiscal year the projected year over year improvement in our consolidated operating income mostly relates to our expected improvement in operating performance by our mattress fabrics segment notably our expectations for the second quarter and the full fiscal 2022 year are based on the information that is available at the time of this webcast presentation and reflect certain assumptions by management regarding our business and trends additionally based on current expectations capital expenditures for this fiscal year are expected to be in the 10 million to 10 5 million range our capital investments will focus on our ongoing strategy of maintenance capex centered in our mattress fabrics business as well as spending in our upholstery fabrics business with investments in read windows and our new haiti start up at the corporate level capex spending will include investments in it infrastructure and security as well as our new innovation campus in high point north carolina depreciation and amortization is expected to be approximately 7 5 million to 8 million for fiscal 2022 with that we ll now take your questions questions and answers operator our first question today comes from anthony lebiedzinski with sidoti company anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company llc analyst yes good morning and thank you for taking the questions so certainly impressive results even with all the cost headwinds that are out there so i guess first i just wanted to ask about the pricing actions that you took in the quarter how much was pricing a benefit how much of a benefit was pricing in the first quarter just so we could get a handle on the unit volume growth versus pricing kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah anthony this is ken on a consolidated basis and keep in mind that the price increases kind of came in at different times during the quarter so it was about 2 5 impact for the quarter versus the total increase in sales anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company llc analyst got it okay all right that s very helpful okay and then can you talk about the strong backlog that s referenced in the residential upholstery business how should we think about that and as far as the expectation for that backlog to turn into revenue boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division yes anthony this is boyd and we continue to see strong demand in the residential side of our business and the backlogs today remain in relatively relative to even pre pandemic remain in good levels very good levels we have seen the backlogs our backlogs come down from the peak as our output has been able to align with the demand but we still have very strong backlogs in that business the industry still is reporting extended backlogs and in many cases our manufacturers are reporting still having record backlogs so backlog in residential continues to be strong and certainly supports that going forward into this fiscal year and as mentioned earlier in our hospitality business we are seeing increasing orders coming in in the hospitality area as travel has started to return in the read window products business those backlogs are up now to levels that we haven t seen in a couple of years so there is a lag time between those orders coming in and when that ll be realized in sales as those projects get installed but that certainly is we re optimistic about what we re seeing in the backlogs for really all segments of our business robert g culp iv chief executive officer anthony this is iv i want to just to tack on a bit to what boyd was saying a little bit of a nuance it s important for everyone to understand about the residential upholstery backlogs we still have as boyd mentioned very healthy backlogs but what you should know is because of our strong supply chain and the network and the flexibility of our platform we re absorbing that backlog and actually shipping product to customers so having a crazy extended backlog which we hear about a lot in the industry is not positive we want a strong backlog that we re actually shipping and pulling through demand and we re seeing that start to happen so while we love the backlog we have we want it to be manageable and our supply chain has allowed us to get into a very manageable place that s encouraging for us in a service standpoint because we are passionate about servicing customers meeting commitments and that s what we re doing in both businesses especially proud of what boyd and his team have done on the residential upholstery side anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company llc analyst all right well thanks a lot iv and boyd for that detailed explanation so as far as labor shortages obviously it s an issue that s prevalent throughout many different businesses can you talk about the steps you re taking to try and minimize the impact of that robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah anthony that s a really good question i would say for the mattress fabrics business which is primarily a north american supply chain for us at least by a percentage that s where we see the most labor challenges but we re doing a lot of things internally to engage our employees more effectively to recruit employees more effectively and just try to build our business that does come with some wage pressure although i will tell you if we can get a more stable workforce we can offset so many other costs of training and things of that nature so i don t worry about wage costs we just we need to do to get a stable labor force and then on top of that having our flexible platform and remember in mattress fabrics we operate across six countries either through our own facilities or through supply chain partners so we just have to be prepared to move items to where we can get them and that s part of a strategy forever and that s part of that s an enhanced strategy of the business we will use it more in times like this to just flex our muscle and again be sure we re meeting our customer commitments through our very robust supply chain anthony lebiedzinski sidoti company llc analyst okay well thank you very much that s all i have today and best of luck kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thank you robert g culp iv chief executive officer thank you anthony operator our next question comes from budd bugatch with water tower research budd bugatch water tower research analyst good morning iv good morning ken good morning boyd congratulations to you and your team robert g culp iv chief executive officer good morning bud budd bugatch water tower research analyst for navigating these challenging times i just want to make sure i understand when you looked at the inflation and the uncertainties is there any way you can rank them for us and give us what are the most pressing problems and maybe put some colors from quantification on that kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah bud i ll start and boyd can certainly jump in i think it s really when you look by division i think that on the upholstery side when you look at i guess a sequential of freight is a huge issue freight has been one that s been pressuring us really starting last year and really gotten worse on the upholstery side we re not dealing with the same labor pressure as the mattress side but freight certainly on the upholstery side has been a big factor i think from mattress fabrics its raw material prices those have been steadily increasing labor obviously is a big issue as we continue to try to hire folks and not only hire and keep them keep them hired but those are the it s various pressures but when you kind of define it by division those are the ones that kind of rise at the top budd bugatch water tower research analyst and the in the raw materials in mattresses primarily foam was what s the raw material that s given you the biggest issue robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah i would say i ll just clarify a bit what ken said for sure the most concerning go forward on the mattress side is labor but raw materials to ken s point that s that would be more of a customer challenge and that would impact our delivery to customer when we say raw materials we mean more yarns laminates different finishing things we need to run our products so there is definitely a rising material cost to us coming in but i would put that secondary behind labor as a go forward concern budd bugatch water tower research analyst okay and when you put your freight surcharge and when i hear of surcharges is that a temporary surcharge or do you think it s going to become a permanent surcharge or you ll wrap that into a price increase that becomes permanent how do you how do we think about that boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division yeah bud this is boyd and i think with the volatility we have seen in the freight pricing and particularly the just extreme acceleration or increase in rates there we thought that the surcharge was the way to go because there s just a lot of uncertainty around what will happen from here so it could become longer term just depending on where those freight rates remain and again there s a high degree of uncertainty as to how that will play out so we re with the surcharge we re poised to react in whatever way it might play out from here and that s really the reason we decided to approach it in that manner robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah i think bud this is iv i ll tackle on boyd comments he s exactly right both businesses have already done a price increase to offset some of the pressure we just felt like without knowing where it s going and seeming to be changing almost every week a surcharge is more appropriate for the second action that we can pass on what was appropriate not too much not too little and to be able to react either way i would want you to know that besides we re not just passing on every increase we get we re also trying to do a lot of work by shifting our supply chains and then trying to do a lot to mitigate our incoming costs so our intention is not to pass everything on we just want to pass on what s appropriate and then be able to react if we have to do more we ll do more if we can pull some of that back we ll pull it back only when it was appropriate so it s there s a lot of nuance to it and just trying to figure out the right mix budd bugatch water tower research analyst okay and i was trying to understand if there s i know containers have been a big issue and particularly i guess in the goods coming from asia and going back are you seeing any change in that condition at all the container prices and the container availability changing at all is it getting better or worse how are you seeing it in the recent weeks kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i would describe it bud as it has continued to be upward pressure in the most recent weeks on pricing availability we haven t for our moves of containers through our north american distribution points we haven t had too much difficulty in availability to this point or creating disruption but certainly the costs have continued to escalate in the most current week budd bugatch water tower research analyst okay just a couple of modeling questions if i could can you you had said i think if i got it right that the tax rate that you re projecting or planning for the second quarter is 30 is that did i hear that correct robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah yeah kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer that s correct budd bugatch water tower research analyst and you normally have a 35 have it for the year what are you thinking it s going to be is it still 35 overall or kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer i think budd bugatch water tower research analyst is it still 35 kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer well yeah we had projected the last quarter to be in the 35 area we came in at 28 7 this time so i think based on what we know today and based on the mix of what we see we re saying approximately 30 should hold for the year second quarter as well as the year budd bugatch water tower research analyst second quarter so for the balance third quarter and fourth quarter as well kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer correct budd bugatch water tower research analyst okay and you said i think capex 10 million to 10 5 million and the second quarter was going to robert g culp iv chief executive officer correct budd bugatch water tower research analyst have you did you put a number to the second quarter or did i missed it robert g culp iv chief executive officer no we did not i will just say that a sizable portion of that s going to be in the second quarter we spent 1 9 million or round it up to 2 million in the first quarter we re guiding 10 million to 10 5 million so i would say that you re probably going to be at least by the end of the second quarter you re probably going to be at least well over half spent for sure boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division two of the significant projects come online in q2 budd bugatch water tower research analyst correct boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division between congdon yards our innovation campus and haiti for cuf so a lot happened in 1q budd bugatch water tower research analyst i understand and congratulations on that and condolences to the people of haiti for what they ve had to go through you i think you put out a release and fortunately you were not impacted in your geography but haiti comes on at the end of the second quarter you think or since still robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah the third facility that we have there for upholstery cut and sew comes online in the second quarter and yeah but i would say thank you for the comments about haiti we are significant distance from that earthquake region but certainly just a terrible thing for the country of haiti and we re doing quite a bit here from the humanitarian side to do a lot of donation to that country it s beautiful country terrific people that want to work and want opportunity so we re thrilled to be there it s a special place for us and an important part of the future for culp budd bugatch water tower research analyst understood and appreciate your efforts on their behalf and last for me just talk about the mattress units side and what the impact has been now that we ve gone through the second round of the anti dumping we re seeing anti mattress units imported every month but what are you seeing is coming for your business because you ve it s a little complicated a little more complicated for culp because now you ve got the cut and sewn so we can t quite figure out what the unit side looks like can you give us a feeling of how that looks just in terms of mattress units or yardage units or some way to frame that in terms of some color robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah it s a good question bud and you re right trying to follow the anti dumping numbers is choppy at best i think it has definitely been impacted some in the last short term period from foam shortages and other things that have maybe forced some importing that wouldn t be normal we see optimism on units and what we see is so much investment being done from new pharma companies new fulfillment companies new setups to deliver mattresses in north america so for us we re very optimistic both on fabric yards and cut and sewn covers i think we see a strong demand and we would expect over the longer term to go back to the sales levels we were in our strong days there s a good recovery that we think will happen over the medium to long term so we re confident budd bugatch water tower research analyst and i m sorry go ahead robert g culp iv chief executive officer so we are confident with the units budd bugatch water tower research analyst and did you see that in the second quarter with the units if you measure it and i m sure you look at it kind of differently than we have to because you get to see some numbers we don t get to see robert g culp iv chief executive officer in the first quarter in our first quarter budd bugatch water tower research analyst yes sir in the quarter that just ended yes sir robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah so we are seeing very definitely strong units especially on cut and sewn covers and then continuing building uniform knits so there s a mix there but yes units both fabric and covers are increasing budd bugatch water tower research analyst and last just reacting to one of the things you said you re seeing new are you seeing new start ups and like i remember the days when we had the digitally native brand explosion with a lot of the marketing companies are you seeing that again are we seeing more of those develop i thought we saw a retracement on some of those robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah i m not seeing a new mattress brands i m just seeing more infrastructure for supplying the current brands i don t i ve not seen an explosion of new in consumer items i m not seeing that i m just seeing more focus on delivering it here budd bugatch water tower research analyst and is there any event that the anti dumping country companies coming to the states robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah we hear rumors of that all the time how for sure that will be it at the end of the day is i guess is still a question but we do hear rumors of that budd bugatch water tower research analyst and that s an opportunity as well as a potential challenge for culp right robert g culp iv chief executive officer it s a i would see as an opportunity because it s important to note this anti dumping is on the mattress it s not relative to components like fabric or covers but what we would do in that case if that was an option for new companies here looking for mattress covers we could still flex our muscles in both haiti and asia to deliver covers here to be assembled to the mattress it actually makes it much easier for us to find the end customer of ours versus two years ago where we re having to try to chase that all around the world so much better to have a supply chain find a supply chain where we know where to deliver the product budd bugatch water tower research analyst great okay that s terrific well good luck on the balance of the second quarter and the balance of the year robert g culp iv chief executive officer thank you bud kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks bud operator our next question comes from marco rodriguez with stonegate capital markets marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst good morning everyone thank you for taking my questions robert g culp iv chief executive officer good morning marco kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer good morning marco marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst hi i was wondering if just to kind of follow up on some of the line of questioning when it comes to the price increases and the surcharges just wondering if you could provide any sort of customer feedback you re receiving just trying to get a sense i know some of this stuff is contractual but kind of wondering if you have some kind of color on customer sentiment if there s like significant pushback or these are things that are happening across multiple industries so it s kind of just been an accepting of these increases boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division marco this is boyd and i can speak from the upholstery fabrics side of the business and certainly this is industrywide pressures that are occurring so the same pressures that we have been under our customers have faced in multiple ways as well so where no one likes price increases there certainly an understanding in the marketplace today that these steps are necessary so in for that reason we re not seeing significant pushback because it s understood as to what s happening throughout the industry today and that these steps are really something that are necessary so not too much pushback robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah i think boyd said that really well marco it s iv i will add some little color there too pick up the mattress side same comments no one is surprised by it certainly none of our customers like it but i do think we ve done a good job passing on what s appropriate at the right time frame not necessarily immediately usually with some lag that now might not be perfect all the time for quarterly results it is the right strategy for the long term view of the business so i think it s been generally accepted well as well as these things could be marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it and then just following up on a question from the prior caller in terms of the unit sales or the unit movements on the mattress fabric side i was wondering maybe if you could perhaps frame it from a growth rate perspective if you have that information here in this last quarter from your more shall we call it traditional mattresses versus the bed in the box robert g culp iv chief executive officer yeah we don t always break it out that way marco because we when we sell covers it s also fueling our fabric supply as well so kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah yeah and marco i will jump in there too this product mix goes a long way when you look at our sales from quarter to quarter and with covers versus yards or fabric it s very difficult to even on both sides you can t really nail down on a per unit so we just look at an in total we know that as iv said earlier knits we had strong growth in knits we had strong growth in covers so from the standpoint of unit growth for sure there we got the benefit of the price increase as well but i think it s difficult to quantify but we would say that we got again we ve seen it again there were significant unit growth and we got the benefit of the price increase as well robert g culp iv chief executive officer and we ve seen from an industry standpoint we re seeing growth traditional retail and e commerce so we see growth across the whole chain i don t see a stronger one or the other it s both which is good for culp we have ability to sell through both channels marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it very helpful and then coming back to one of the comments you made on the prepared remarks in your call about on the upholstery fabric side i believe you called out livesmart evolve fabric that has a sustainability hook if you will is that using the same sort of yarn that i believe it was prior call where you had a cooling type fabric that also had a sustainability angle robert g culp iv chief executive officer yes marco that is exactly right we livesmart evolve was actually was first before the other products called chillsense and what we ve done in both businesses is look for combining performance with sustainability so livesmart evolve combined stain performance stain proof stain treatable fabrics along with sustainability recyclable products and then chillsense combines cooling with that same sustainability so each business has a different view of what performance means but we do think there s so much momentum around a sustainability type product line and we re pushing that hard in both divisions marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it and are you seeing a pickup in demand for the sustainability aspect versus more traditional fabrics if you will boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division yeah marco this is boyd and certainly as iv mentioned our evolve product on the upholstery side yes we it was one of the leaders in our first quarter in terms of growth that we re seeing so sustainability is certainly resonating with the consumer and is also seeming to receive very good and strong response at the retail level so without a doubt our products that include the sustainability component are certainly one of our fastest growing product categories right now marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it and last quick question for me i don t know if i missed this on the call but the share repurchases what were the average prices you purchased that and if maybe you can discuss briefly the drivers behind those recent purchases kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer yeah marco this is ken i think the second part of that we ve always said that we would be out there at opportunistic prices and so as the stock was trailing down we felt it was time for culp to jump in as far as an average i think it s i don t have an average in front of me but it we re we ve been in the 13 to 15 16 range throughout the period more toward the 15 to 13 range so it s been an average of share repurchases so i d say i d kind of catch it like that marco rodriguez stonegate capital markets analyst got it very helpful thank you guys for your time i appreciate it robert g culp iv chief executive officer thank you marco boyd b chumbley president culp upholstery fabric division thank you kenneth r bowling senior vice president chief financial officer and treasurer thanks operator this concludes our question and answer session i d like to turn the call back over to iv culp

united nations food supplies in afghanistan could run out this month a un humanitarian official warned wednesday the situation threatens to add a hunger crisis to the problems facing the country s new taliban rulers they are trying to return the country to a peaceful state after many years of war ramiz alakbarov is the u n s humanitarian chief in afghanistan he said that about one third of the country s population of 38 million does not know if they will have a meal every day the un s world food program has brought in food and given it to tens of thousands of people in recent weeks but winter is coming soon and dry weather is continuing alakbarov said at least 200 million is needed urgently to be able to continue to feed the afghans who are at risk by the end of september the stocks which the world food program has in the country will be out alakbarov told reporters at an online news conference we will not be able to provide those essential food items because we ll be out of stocks earlier un officials said that of the 1 3 billion needed for overall aid efforts only 39 percent had been received the taliban militant group seized control of the country ahead of the withdrawal of american forces this week now the group must govern a nation that depends heavily on international aid and is facing an economic crisis that is growing in addition to the concerns about food supplies government workers have not been paid in months the local currency is also losing value most of afghanistan s foreign currency supplies which are held in other countries are currently frozen khalid payenda is afghanistan s former acting finance minister he spoke about afghanistan s dangerous economic situation on wednesday at georgetown university in washington d c payenda said the afghan currency has not sharply lost value because money exchanges have been closed its value could drop by more than 100 percent he added part of the disorder shows the speed at which the taliban took control of the country i did not expect it to be this quickly payenda said nobody actually did mohammad sharif a shopkeeper in the capital kabul said shops and markets there have supplies but a major concern is rising food prices if the situation continues like this and there is no government to control the prices that will cause so many problems for local people he said many afghans are worried they are waiting to see how the taliban will rule they were very severe when they held power before their fall in 2001 but more recently their leaders have tried to show a more moderate image schools have reopened to boys and girls although taliban officials have said they will study separately women are out on the streets wearing islamic head cloths as they always have rather than the long burqas that cover the whole face which the taliban required in the past ambassador geraldine byrne nason is ireland s ambassador to the un ireland is the current president of the united nations security council byrne nason said wednesday that the most important test for the new taliban government will be how it treats women and girls the problems taliban rulers have in rebuilding the economy could give western nations influence these nations want the taliban to meet its promise to form an inclusive government and guarantee women s rights the taliban said it wants to have good relations with other countries including the united states bilal karimi is an official member of the taliban spokesman s office he said wednesday that a team of turkish and qatari technicians arrived in kabul to help restore operations at the city s airport alakbarov the un humanitarian official said the united nations is asking to use the airport so it can bring food and other supplies to the capital the taliban also must deal with the threat of militants from the islamic state in afghanistan group known as isis k it took responsibility for last week s bombing at the airport the taliban have promised they will not let afghanistan be used as a base for attacks on other countries after the bombing american officials said air strikes targeted isis k u s president joe biden said they would continue u s army general mark milley is chairman of the joint chiefs of staff milley said wednesday it was possible that the u s will have to work in agreement with the taliban on any counterterrorism strikes

it was the multibillion dollar economic lifeline for companies struggling to deal with the cost and uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic but pressure for more transparency around the jobkeeper program is not relenting the federal government continues to resist demands to claw back money paid out to companies who kept jobkeeper payments despite their revenue increasing amid calls for them to be publicly outed the senate on thursday rejected a bid to reveal the biggest 10 000 companies that received the wage subsidy treasurer josh frydenberg has repeatedly defended the wage subsidy program which he says was implemented in the face of an economic abyss the reality is that jobkeeper helped save our economy he told parliament on thursday the great deal of uncertainty in the economy at that time meant that we gave businesses certainty we gave businesses the ability to plan for their future read more renewed calls for companies to repay billions in received jobkeeper despite not seeing downturn the 1 500 a fortnight wage subsidy program was announced last march for businesses hit by covid 19 lockdowns as the economy sat on the precipice of a recession businesses and charities had to demonstrate either an actual or projected drop in income to qualify for the support the scheme paid out some 90 billion in jobkeeper subsidies over the year to the end of march this year the way the program was set up means it s completely legal for profitable businesses to keep their jobkeeper windfall but pressure on these businesses continues to grow the abc on thursday revealed data from the independent parliamentary budget office showing thousands of businesses doubled or tripled their earnings while on the wage subsidy scheme the data seen by sbs news shows nearly 20 000 of these firms tripled their turnover but still pocketed approximately 368 million in subsidies in the first three months of the program an additional 15 000 firms also doubled their earnings compared to the same quarter in 2019 but took in approximately 320 million in jobkeeper if there has been no rorting there is nothing to hide labor the greens and independent senator rex patrick have led a push in the senate trying to force the disclosure of jobkeeper details to increase transparency around the program the effort comes as retailer harvey norman this week declared it had repaid 6 million of an estimated 22 million in jobkeeper funds it received following months of pressure read more harvey norman repays 6 million in jobkeeper profits following months of pressure shadow assistant treasurer andrew leigh has campaigned for profitable firms to repay their jobkeeper windfall and obtained the latest data from the parliamentary budget office he said more than 13 billion in these payments had been given to businesses which recorded increases in revenue during the first six months of the program last year any firm that saw their revenue increase and received jobkeeper should pay it back he told sbs news the vast bulk of that went to unlisted firms and so that s in the shadows shadow assistant treasurer andrew leigh source aap listed entities on the australian stock exchange are already required to include jobkeeper funds in public reports to the corporate regulator but estimates from shareholder lobby group ownership matters show these companies only accounted for around 3 per cent of jobkeeper payments ownership matters director dean paatsch said this meant the vast majority of companies were exempt from this transparency what we need to know is where the jobkeeper went for the 97 per cent of the program that currently remains in the dark he told sbs news that group we know absolutely nothing about their identity the only thing we know is that they are under no obligation to pay if there has been no rorting there is nothing to hide mr paatsch said other countries like new zealand the united kingdom and the united states had established transparency registers for their wage subsidy programs critics have noted that new zealand has received 5 per cent back from companies that repaid the money compared with just 0 25 per cent in australia where there is no such public register looting of taxpayers money senator rex patrick has warned the jobkeeper program has led to the looting of taxpayers money by profitable companies urging that more transparency is needed it s clear that a whole number of companies have received jobkeeper and have then gone on to profit from their business over the period he told sbs news companies that have made more money than they ever anticipated don t have to give back and that is a massive prudential failure his attempt to force firms turning over more than 10 million annually to disclose their payments was defeated in the senate on thursday after lodging an amendment on unrelated government treasury legislation one nation instead won support for its own amendment requiring publicly listed companies to report their jobkeeper receipts and for the corporate regulator to publish a consolidated report on these companies but senator patrick has criticised this measure as meaningless indicating that the businesses were already required to report this information he has also threatened ato commissioner chris jordan with contempt of parliament proceedings for declining an upper house order to disclose big companies jobkeeper receipts one nation senator malcolm roberts on thursday said the party still wanted to work with other minor parties to establish a real audit of the jobkeeper program the government has also come under criticism for chasing debts from ordinary australians who were wrongly put on the scheme sbs news has seen debt letters from the tax office upwards of 10 thousand dollars sent to people 12 months after being told they were eligible for the payment

by hari kishan bengaluru reuters the dollar s direction is in limbo as financial markets await a clearer path from the u s federal reserve according to a reuters poll of fx strategists who were split on where they expected the currency to trade over the next three months on the back foot even before fed chair jerome powell s comments last friday at jackson hole the greenback has lost almost 1 4 since it hit a nine month high about two weeks ago but it is still up around 3 for the year while analysts in the aug 30 sept 2 poll of nearly 60 fx strategists expected the greenback to give up most of those gains over the coming year they were increasingly uncertain about both the short and medium term outlook there s two important forces when we look at the direction of the dollar the first is the global recovery and the momentum we ve seen most recently and the second point is obviously the central banks response to that said kerry craig global market strategist at jp morgan asset management in melbourne because those two forces are competing at the moment we re relatively neutral about the direction of the u s dollar eventual fed tapering of its 120 billion of monthly bond purchases which an over 75 majority of 51 analysts expected the central bank to announce in the final quarter of this year should help u s treasury yields to move higher ultimately we think in a world where real yields will continue to rise over the coming months it s likely to be dollar positive said david adams head of fx strategy in north america at morgan stanley we continue to be dollar bullish particularly versus the low yielding funding currencies that would be the japanese yen and the euro data from the u s commodity futures trading commission released on aug 27 showed speculators had once again increased their net long u s dollar positions but underscoring the prevailing uncertainty there was no consensus among analysts who answered an additional question on how the dollar would trade over the next three months although 23 of 60 strategists said they expected the currency to trade around current levels 25 said broadly higher the remaining 12 chose broadly lower while sticking to their long held view of a weakening dollar over a 12 month horizon analysts were turning skeptical asked how confident they were in that view 62 of strategists 36 of 58 said they were not confident or not at all confident twenty two chose confident with most major currencies expected to strengthen against the dollar in the next 12 months the euro was forecast up a little over 2 for the same period the common currency is down 3 this year most emerging market currencies were also forecast to weaken or at best cling to a range over the next three to six months as u s stimulus withdrawal could push investors to shun the currencies coined the fragile five turkey south africa brazil india and indonesia as they did in 2013 the dollar tends to weaken when we have a lot of risk appetite pulling money into emerging markets and what we ve seen recently is the delta variant really shaking up asian markets and that degree of uncertainty has been amplified by this tapering debate said jane foley head of fx strategy at rabobank in london it is a combination of those two factors that have seen flows being pulled back to the dollar in order for the dollar to weaken again we would have to have a huge amount of flows going into emerging markets and i can t see that happening imminently for other stories from the september reuters foreign exchange poll reporting by hari kishan polling by susobhan sarkar and mumal rathore editing by ross finley and steve orlofsky
the strike by train drivers and conductors employed by german railways deutsche bahn db deserves the solidarity of the entire working class the strike is about whether train crews should pay the price for the covid 19 crisis while management is lining its pockets and stock markets are soaring deutsche bahn is determined to impose a null wage increase for the current year even though inflation is approaching 5 percent this would mean a massive cut in real wages in fact a more fundamental issue is at stake big business is using the corona pandemic for a frontal attack on all the conditions and rights of the working class not only in germany but internationally two decades after a social democratic government led by gerhard schröder imposed its agenda 2010 which included the anti social hartz iv laws low wages pension cuts and massive tax cuts for the rich the current government and big business are stepping up their offensive they see this policy as essential to fuel the stock market boom further increase their already huge fortunes and finance new wars human lives are treated as a mere cost factor in the covid 19 pandemic british prime minister boris johnson who says out loud what others of his kind think made a cost benefit analysis concluding that 50 000 covid 19 deaths a year constitute an acceptable level and that saving a patient should cost no more than 30 000 even slaves were once traded at a higher price according to official statistics 93 000 people have died in germany and 4 5 million worldwide because ruling elites across the globe refused to implement strict lockdowns and other measures that could have quelled the pandemic in a matter of weeks after the german government the european union and the european central bank spent trillions in aid for big business and the banks they rapidly reopened factories offices and schools to ensure the flow of profits for the rich the pandemic is a lucrative business in germany the number of billionaires rose from 107 to 136 in the pandemic year of 2020 their fortunes from 447 billion to 625 billion keeping this orgy of self enrichment going requires constantly intensifying the exploitation of the working class whether in the railways public transport hospitals parcel and delivery services or the car and parties industries millions of workers are angry as shift work and overtime make life more and more unbearable pay levels are falling while the prospect of unemployment and a life in poverty in old age increases workers are looking for a way to fight back that is why the vast majority of the working class welcomes the rail strike despite the inconvenience it causes and that is also why deutsche bahn is behaving so provocatively even though its offer and the demand of the train drivers union gdl are not too far apart deutsche bahn boss richard lutz is playing hardball with the full backing of the german government which owns deutsche bahn they are intent on making an example of the train drivers and conductors and prevent other sections of workers following in their footsteps discontent is surging in many workplaces and companies amid the second round of the rail strike siemens workers in berlin protested against job cuts and nurses went on strike against intolerable working conditions in hospitals in the us workers at volvo trucks and dana an auto parts supplier overwhelmingly rejected unacceptable contracts agreed to by the unions after having previously formed independent action committees similar struggles are taking place in many other countries the train drivers are fighting not only db management and the government but also the unions the head of the german trade union federation dgb reiner hoffmann and the head of the rail and transport union evg klaus dieter hommel have stabbed the train drivers strike in the back the unions have long since stopped representing workers interests they are nothing more than co managers and company cops who reject and suppress the class struggle this is true not only for the evg db s company union but also every other union the train drivers union gdl is no exception the head of the gdl claus weselsky is under enormous pressure train drivers are fed up with the financial restructuring of the railways being carried out at their expense at the same time the gdl s existence is threatened by the reactionary law on collective bargaining unity which only allows one union to represent workers at the workplace nevertheless it would be a dangerous illusion to put one s trust in weselsky the gdl is just as committed to the german system of social partnership i e defending the interests of the company as all other trade unions weselsky himself is even a member of the party of the german chancellor the christian democratic union cdu weselsky has ended all previous contract bargaining rounds with rotten compromises resulting in real wage cuts and bans on rail workers taking further industrial action the gdl s current demand also falls far short of covering inflation above all the gdl rejects the broad mobilisation that is absolutely necessary to make the strike a success the limited duration of the individual strikes called by the gdl makes it easy for deutsche bahn to adjust and react in time the fact that the current strike will last five days from september 2 6 instead of two days like the first two strikes does not change this the entire history of the labour movement shows that only an indefinite strike can bring the opposing side to its knees weselsky however categorically rejects such an option i never talk about indefinite industrial action in the railway system he told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper instead of appealing to the broad mass of workers weselsky relies on the right wing german civil service federation to which the gdl belongs he even invited the reactionary head of the german police union rainer wendt as guest speaker at a gdl strike rally inside the railways the gdl is driving a wedge between drivers and administrative employees whose jobs according to weselsky should be cut to lead the struggle against the offensive of db management and the ruling class new organisations of struggle must be built that are independent of the unions and their officials in workplaces action committees controlled by workers and accountable only to them these committees must provide workers with information democratically decide on demands develop a strategy for struggle and oversee negotiations on working conditions and collective agreements they must network nationwide and build contacts with workers in other countries and sectors the international committee of the fourth international icfi launched a call in april to build the international workers alliance of action committees to develop the framework for new forms of independent democratic and militant rank and file organizations of workers in factories schools and workplaces on an international scale the statement says in this regard the icfi and its affiliated socialist equality parties are advancing this initiative to begin and develop a global counteroffensive of the working class against the homicidal policies of the governments controlled by the capitalist ruling class which are responsible for the worldwide catastrophe there are now numerous independent action committees that like at volvo trucks and dana in the united states have successfully mobilised workers against the sell out by the unions the construction of a network of workers committees is no substitute for building a new party to represent workers interests serious practical steps require a programme and principles germany in particular has a long tradition in this regard workers in germany built the social democratic party in the 19th century before they built trade unions and at a time when the spd fought for a socialist programme under the banner of marxism today train drivers and conductors are confronted with political tasks at every turn all of the political parties represented in the bundestag including today s spd and the left party vehemently oppose their strike the leading election candidate for the left party dietmar bartsch even called upon chancellor angela merkel to intervene and end the strike a third strike would be completely unreasonable he told the dpa news agency the chancellor must prevent the strike and order the rail company to meet the demands for pandemic reasons alone this theatre must end the socialist equality party sgp is contesting the federal election to build a new mass party in the working class to fight for a socialist and international programme no social problem can be solved without expropriating the banks and corporations and placing them under the democratic control of the working class our election programme states we invite striking railway workers and all those who are not ready to accept growing social inequality the murderous official pandemic policy and the return to militarism to contact the sgp and discuss the building of independent action committees support the sgp s election campaign and become a member

by richard bernstein advisors it s time for our annual august report charts for the beach each year we highlight five of our favorite charts we think consensus is currently overlooking load up the cooler get your towel and chair and enjoy the charts as the happenings sang see you in september the fed has cornered the treasury market when the hunt brothers attempted to corner the silver market in the early 1980s they owned approximately 30 35 of the privately held market today the us federal reserve owns between 50 55 of the 10 20 year treasury market the fed has cornered the treasury market this has several implications the treasury market s available float has been reduced so interest rate movements have become the fed has worked against its own goals the combination of tighter post financial crisis regulations on leverage and a flat yield curve has constrained bank lending and prevented liquidity from flowing to the real economy the fed has fostered a broad range of bubbles because their massive liquidity injections have been trapped in the financial as with any cornered market there are limited buyers and prices fall as the cornerer accordingly bond prices seem likely to fall interest rates rise when as fed reduces its cornered positions rising interest rates could be the kryptonite to the bubble in long duration assets long term bonds technology innovation disruption bitcoin etc content continues below advertisement don t be geographically myopic investors tend to become very myopic during a bubble and believe only a small universe of stocks is attractive accordingly innovation and disruption themes have become cornerstones of speculative growth investing in the us during the current bubble however france not exactly the hotbed of innovation and disruption is outperforming nasdaq so far this year no technology industry ranks in the top 10 of msci france index s industries myopia during a bubble can hurt portfolio performance one sign of a bubble increased turnover did you realize the leading bitcoin trading platform has a market capitalization over 50 larger than the market cap of the exchange upon which its stock trades increased turnover is one of the classic signs of a bubble and these elevated crypto trading volumes are reflected in coinbase s outsized market capitalization more normal than you d think patience is not a word used to describe investors these days however investing patience has historically been a virtue case in point the current value cycle seems to be playing out according to historical norms despite all the i told you so regarding the recent underperformance of value according to bofa global research growth outperforms value 33 of the time during value cycles and the current value run seems to indeed be closely mimicking the historical pattern stop the technology hype investors always need to distinguish hype from reality but it s often difficult to do so because the underlying story seems so compelling but facts are facts there is a clear consensus the increased use of technology has improved productivity and will hinder any inflation potential the unfortunate reality is technology hasn t changed the trend in productivity one bit over the past 30 years that s true in the us and true in most major economies globalization and its associated impact of increased competition more likely depressed inflation trends than did technology when supply is greater than demand and competition heats up prices go down econ 101 is never as sexy as a hyped story though don t miss out on

about this project the 52 week project showcases accomplishments challenges and opportunities of individuals and businesses run by people of color women immigrants veterans representatives from the lgbtq community and a few other groups forwarding the mission of diversity equity and inclusion in the greater raleigh durham metro area the project also will delve into important trends and issues relating to dei part of the motivation for starting her own company were challenges that kenya oduor faced as a black woman working in the tech industry oduor who has a ph d in philosophy and human factors psychology spent the early part of her career at ibm nyse ibm before moving into a consulting role and then launching lean geeks in 2012 lean geeks provides research and design expertise to create strategic solutions in the user experience ux space as a black woman i have to show the person that i am every day oduor said for several decades i felt challenges in technical organizations and an industry where i might be the only female the only black person in the room i wanted to be in a position where the people that i engaged with or who sought out my services were comfortable with who i am where i knew they were not forced to partner with me because we were in the same organization but that it was something they proactively sought out and they felt a certain level of trust to engage my company what started as a moonlighting initiative quickly evolved and by 2017 oduor was running lean geeks full time although she also makes time to teach one semester a year at n c state university where she obtained her doctorate degree the business has been profitable three of the last four years basically since she made it her full time focus and 2020 proved to be the best year to date with revenue approaching 800 000 surprisingly 2020 was the year i was able to pick up an assistant but i m not sure what caused more opportunities to come our way last year oduor said in some cases companies that performed unexpectedly well during covid wanted to understand better how to keep that momentum going there were also companies that had sought research funding in 2019 and had to use that funding in 2020 all of those variables came into play we are on our way to being profitable again this year and to exceed our 2020 sales numbers those outside the it world may not fully appreciate what goes into producing a superior user experience but nearly everyone knows the frustration of slow downloads or content that fails to display well on a mobile device lean geeks blends technical expertise and creative talent to develop optimum experiences that speak to the needs and preferences of end users whenever we do projects we try to couple someone who is on the industrial engineering and cognitive experimental psychology side with someone more creative more on the designer side she said what you have then is a really nice complement of someone who thinks of the nuts and bolts the pure mechanics of answering can the user get something done and what is their motivation and goal and a designer who can bring the ux to life together that complement the best outcomes for our clients at least 80 percent of lean geeks work is business to business but oduor notes one of the differentiators in her company is that they also look at how its clients users are going to be impacted when i talk about it solutions they re not just systems implemented in organizations it s technology that people use in various capacities she explains it could be technology you use on your phone to look at social information or devices that are used in medical procedures or mobile and desktop apps to manage health insurance the same system may be used by both consumers and professionals that s where we differentiate ourselves we try to do the work not only for the end user who paid for the product but also the end user who is impacted by the product expand has a ph d in philosophy and human factors psychology mehmet demirci oduor s training in experimental psychology helps her understand the problems and ecosystems of her clients and enables research to identify the data and demographics of end users we start with the problem space and then we may have to do a little digging like psychology research to figure out where to find that data and recruit people she said the greater challenge is recruitment of minorities because people of lower socioeconomic groups are typically harder to recruit for research oduor s solution is to employ creative ways to recruit the right people often that involves non traditional approaches such as utilizing social networks or personal connections she s learned that leveraging relationships to engage recruits promotes better participation as a black woman i ve always had a focus on diversity and inclusion and i have a team that is comprised across genders ethnicities and the lgbtq community she said when i look at the research we do i push recruiting across demographics if you have an advisory board of folks who are homogenous all with the same sort of income or education levels that s not good we work to find people who represent your user base across different demographics and psychographics lean geeks which does staffing and recruitment work for its clients as well as consulting in the ux space employs seven people plus contract workers ninety percent of the staff are women oduor said it s a stat that she s proud of having achieved particularly in an industry that is traditionally male dominated jacob geib rosch president of the triangle chapter of the user experience professionals association which has hosted the annual ux y all conference since 2018 said achieving diversity in the tech world isn t easy it s no secret that diversity and inclusion has been a challenge in the tech industry and many in the user experience field struggle with a lack of diverse voices on a daily basis in their careers he said ux y all was founded with addressing as a core principle he adds we wanted to make sure we provided a platform for perspectives from a diverse set of speakers so we could learn from talented individuals who have an understanding colored by experiences different from most in the field today over the years women have made up half of our speakers and we ve done our best to make sure people of color have been well represented both in keynotes and speaking sessions their voices have provided valuable insights which many of us in tech don t have access to through our jobs oduor said people gravitate to her company because it is minority owned especially after the season we have been in over the last couple of years there are organizations that want to work with us because of our certification as a woman owned hub certified business she said often we are competing against much larger companies which in most cases are not woman owned or minority owned she and her husband who moved here from kenya funded the start of the business and the momentum of incoming business has kept them going without having to secure financing the company has clients nationwide with the majority located outside of north carolina

california doordash workers protested outside of the home of doordash ceo tony xu on thursday prompted by a recent california superior court judge ruling calling 2020 s proposition 22 unconstitutional prop 22 which was passed last november in california would allow app based companies like doordash uber and lyft to continue classifying workers as independent contractors rather than employees a group of about 50 doordash workers who are affiliated with advocacy groups we drive progress and gig workers rising traveled caravan style to the front of xu s house in the pacific heights neighborhood of san francisco they demanded that doordash provide transparency for tips and 120 of minimum wage or around 17 per hour stop unfair deactivations and provide free personal protective equipment as well as adequate pay for car and equipment sanitizing dasher concerns and feedback are always important to us and we will continue to hear their voices and engage our community directly a doordash spokesperson told techcrunch however we know that today s participants do not speak for the 91 of california dashers who want to remain independent contractors or the millions of california voters who overwhelmingly supported proposition 22 the reality is the passage of prop 22 has addressed in law many of the concerns raised today through its historic benefits and protections workers earn 120 of their local minimum wage per active hour in addition to 100 of their tips receive free ppe and enjoy access to healthcare funds doordash drivers say getting paid for the time they re active meaning actively driving to either pick up food and drop it off rather than when they re online and waiting for gigs to come through leads to inadequate pay they also say much of their living wage comes from tips which should be an added bonus but ends up helping make ends meet based on doordash s pay structure doordash says paying drivers only for engaged time allows them to have the flexibility to use multiple apps at one time either while they re actively working or while they re driving around running personal errands prop 22 is also meant to guarantee a reimbursement of 30 cents per engaged mile which drivers say would be great if it were true rondu gantt a gig worker who s been working for doordash for two and a half years and also drives for uber and lyft to get by says his base pay from doordash is often as low as 3 per hour and that around 40 to 60 of his money comes from tips although this model sounds similar to the restaurant industry in the united states which can be quite lucrative for servers and bartenders for a delivery driver it s an unsustainable way to make a living because tipping culture isn t nearly as strong doordash pays so low because they want to make it affordable for the customer but i would say for the driver it becomes unaffordable gantt told techcrunch citing the costs of owning maintaining parking and fueling a vehicle as potentially crippling last week i drove for 30 hours and i made 405 that s 13 50 per hour which is below minimum wage gantt said drivers also have had to deal with pressure to drive in unsafe conditions and we can look to the images of delivery drivers in new york city during hurricane ida as an example of some conditions drivers feel compelled to accept over the past two years doordash drivers have also been deemed essential workers interacting with and providing services for many people during a pandemic at the risk of their health gig workers rising says doordash workers have received little to no safety support with some workers reporting being reimbursed as little as 80 cents per day for cleaning sanitizing equipment and ppe that they use to keep themselves and customers safe a doordash spokesperson said workers have been entitled to free ppe since the start of the pandemic which they can learn more about online and order weekly supplies right now gig work isn t flexible a spokesperson for gig workers rising told techcrunch workers are at the mercy of when there s demand if they were employees the work would change as they d work in the knowledge that they have healthcare and can take a sick day off because prop 22 was ruled unconstitutional the spokesperson said by rights it shouldn t be in operation the gig corporations violate that law everyday by choosing not to comply with it he said doordash holds firm that prop 22 is still the law and they expect the ruling to be appealed and prop 22 to be upheld for gantt s part he doesn t necessarily want to be an employee he just wants to make sure that he s being paid what he deserves which is not minimum wage he said minimum wage would be unacceptable as well the cost of doing this the danger makes minimum wage unacceptable pay and realistically they re only sometimes paying you minimum wage before taxes after taxes you re definitely making less techcrunch was given access to doordash workers dashboards that break down their pay for the week of july 12 to july 19 one dasher was paid a total of 574 21 for 53 deliveries 274 of which came from customer tips his active time was 14 hours and 21 minutes and his dash time or when he was logged onto the app waiting for gigs to come through and doing deliveries was about 30 hours the dasher s guaranteed earnings from doordash for the week was 300 21 a number that s calculated to ensure drivers go home with 120 of minimum wage for active time his base pay ended up at about 257 62 but doordash added an additional 42 59 to adjust to guaranteed earnings if we divide the amount doordash paid by the number of hours of active time the worker was paid about 21 per hour if we divide it by the dash time it looks more like 10 per hour again this is before tax independent contractors are usually advised to put aside around 30 of their paycheck because they have to pay self employment tax which is 15 3 of taxable income federal income tax which varies depending on tax bracket and potentially state income tax after taxes this dasher s total pay for 30 hours of work including his 274 worth of tip would be around 402 which comes out to 13 40 per hour tips were of concern at the protest on thursday as drivers called for transparency gantt says dashers can see a cumulative amount of tip earnings per week as well as how much tip they re receiving from each order but they don t trust the amount they re receiving is actually the amount customers are tipping them doordash told techcrunch drivers definitely do receive 100 of their tips gantt and other drivers aren t just being paranoid last november doordash agreed to pay 2 5 million to settle a lawsuit alleging the company stole drivers tips and allowed customers to think their tip money was actually going to the drivers the suit filed by washington d c attorney general karl racine alleged doordash reduced drivers pay for each job by the amount of any tip doordash denies the allegations and that they pertain to its former pay model that hasn t been in use since september 2019 during the second quarter doordash saw a 113 million profit adjusted for ebitda but was overall unprofitable with a net loss of 102 million one of the rallying cries of the protest was for xu to share the wealth in 2020 the ceo was reportedly the highest paid ceo in the bay area making a total income of 413 67 million which includes salary and stock options doordash says xu has not actually been paid any of the compensation in the report as of today compensation which xu only gets paid if doordash significantly outperforms the market and achieves a 5x return over the next seven years we all work for money and how that money gets distributed when they go through their earnings is telling you who matters and who doesn t matter said gantt it s a clear sign of who s important who has value if they don t pay you they don t value you this article has been updated with more information from doordash

minnesota s ruffed grouse hunters are discounting the bad news of low spring drumming counts as they prepare for a season they hope will be salvaged by 2021 s chick friendly nesting conditions it s crazy how quickly the opener is coming up said ryan smith a hard core grouse hunter from the brainerd area if bird numbers are like last year it should be a good year the fall harvest season is here and not without controversy bear and dove hunting opened wednesday and waterfowl hunters will take their first shots saturday morning to open the early goose season and a new early teal season dubbed experimental by the department of natural resources conflict arose this week when tribal authorities announced that wild rice waters on the white earth and leech lake reservations will be off limits to teal hunters with the leech lake band of chippewa also specifically prohibiting goose hunting on rice beds state officials are investigating the legality of the closures which the tribes said are necessary to protect wild rice harvesters from accidentally getting shot grouse season won t open until sept 18 including hunting of sharp tailed grouse in the northwest zone but smith and others are gearing up and working with their dogs his youngest canine loki an english cocker spaniel named after the norse god of mischief will be new to the autumn woods loki will be paired with smith s veteran gordon setter mia i think i m like a lot of grouse hunters with dogs said smith who hosts a family and friends grouse camp each october i am into it as much or more for the dog work as i am for the birds according to the dnr ruffed grouse are in the declining phase of the species approximately 10 year cycle this year s spring population survey showed a decline from the previous year the survey is conducted on established routes by counting drumming noises made by male ruffed grouse who beat their wings to attract females the statewide average this year was 1 3 drums per stop the most recent peak in 2017 was 2 1 during the low point of the cycles counts are typically about 0 8 but drumming isn t the only indicator of grouse abundance when it comes to fall hunting charlotte roy grouse program leader for the dnr said this year s warm dry nesting conditions favored survival of chicks in addition an excellent grasshopper hatch provided food for the birds this summer even if other food sources were cut by unprecedented drought she said roy is conducting studies of minnesota s spruce grouse noting very good survival of broods this year her study areas in northern minnesota overlap ruffed grouse habitat hunting success in the fall depends on the hatch not necessarily the drumming counts said the dnr s ted dick an avid grouse hunter and forest wildlife habitat consultant i m going out on a limb and saying there should be some pretty good hunting this fall for the second year in a row minnesota hunters won t be asked to cooperate with a study of west nile virus in ruffed grouse previously in 2018 and 2019 dnr provided tissue sampling kits to hunting volunteers who wanted to assist in a three state study of west nile s impacts on the birds roy said early research results indicated that infected ruffed grouse are capable of recovering from the disease she wrote a paper on the subject soon to be published by the journal of wildlife disease roy said the tricky part of the west nile study is that it couldn t account for the number of ruffed grouse that died from the disease before they were harvested but there s enough evidence to show that some birds are persisting after becoming infected she said the best thing we can do is provide good habitat for the birds she said with good habitat they can better withstand infection roy is again asking spruce grouse hunters this season to collect and submit to the dnr three to five feathers from each bird they harvest genetic examination of the feathers will help scientists interpret how the species is using the landscape and whether spruce grouse are separating into distinct genetic groups while losing touch with their former home range also this year grouse hunters themselves are garnering research attention according to license data kept by the dnr the sport is in sharp decline from 2009 through 2019 the estimated number of grouse hunters collapsed by nearly 30 to 61 600 hunters adam landon a human dimensions scientist for the dnr said the agency is partnering with the university of minnesota to query grouse and pheasant hunters who have allowed their small game hunting licenses to lapse our intent is to try and get at why they are abandoning these pursuits landon said what may be blocking them from participating a similar survey of lapsed deer hunters showed that limited access to desired hunting land was a key constraint landon said the participation surveys will go out to grouse and pheasant hunters after jan 1 a summary of the results should be completed by midsummer laurie chamberlain of the brainerd area chapter of the ruffed grouse society said minnesota s grouse and woodcock hunters are blessed with countless acres of public hunting lands he also said hunters shouldn t put too much stock into predictions of bird abundance they talk about the cycles but in my experience if you are willing to bust some brush you re going to find birds chamberlain said you just have to be in the right kind of habitat
