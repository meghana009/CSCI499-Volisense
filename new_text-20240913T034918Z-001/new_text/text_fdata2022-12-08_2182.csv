the cantaloupe keeps growing from a rebrand to multiple acquisitions in just a few years most recently the malvern based digital payments and software company acquired three square market 32m in a 41 million deal announced this week the goal is to accelerate its market presence in europe and become a global market leader for cell service commerce ceo ravi venkatesan told technical ly the company was previously known as usa technologies until in 2017 it acquired the then bay area based cantaloupe in a move to strengthen itself in the unattended retail market the company handles digital transactions for technology like parking meters and vending machines and uses internet of things technology cloud technology and its seed markets software to keep stock of retail sales and other transactions in 2020 the company had a tough financial year and a new board and leadership team was brought in that s when venkatesan entered the picture he said and the company adopted the cantaloupe name in 2021 as technologist and product developer at his core venkatesan first took the role of cto then coo and finally this past october the ceo role i had been studying this business even before i came in and noted some changing consumer preferences a lack of available labor and the cheaper and easier availability of tech innovation he said ultimately it will lead to more and more commerce being self service the company has four key capabilities in its new vision venkatesan said first it s aiming to be the leader in technology that powers digital payments as ecommerce continues to grow and in person retail moves toward those self service payments even a physical storefront s transactions can be connected to the cloud venkatesan said it s second capability is to handle digital payments where a card is either present buying something in store or not ecommerce at a very large scale third the company is leveraging vertical specific software in different settings customizing for spaces like hospitals and in person retail settings its fourth aim is where the 32m acquisition comes in 32m is a provider of software and self service point of sale kiosks that allow for contactless checkout the two companies had already partnered for a few years venkatesan said with 32m s kiosks using cantaloupe s seed markets software bringing 32m into cantaloupe and gaining access to cantaloupe s 25 000 customer base from small and medium businesses to large enterprises is an exciting opportunity for us said tony danna president of 32m in a statement we can now better leverage cantaloupe s seed platform with our existing customers both in the us and other geographies and expect to benefit from a combined salesforce to help our products reach more customers the acquisition brings this micro market technology to nearly 3 000 locations in north america the uk sweden and romania and allows for cross selling of 32m s micro market technology to cantaloupe s existing food and beverage customers cantaloupe also acquired micro market payments company yoke last year for similar reasons venkatesan said the 32m acquisition will add about 40 people to cantaloupe s 230 person team which is mainly based in malvern but has a secondary office in atlanta venkatesan said the incoming employees are part of inherently capable engineering and sales teams the acquisition ultimately came down to the way the companies would complement each other not compete venkatesan said plus there s now potential to expand in markets much faster than anticipated this is not putting two businesses together to take costs out venkatesan said it s about revenue synergies technically media
los angeles business wire puma biotechnology inc nasdaq pbyi a biopharmaceutical company presented updated findings from the translational breast cancer research consortium tbcrc trial 022 at the ongoing 2022 san antonio breast cancer symposium in san antonio texas the poster pd7 03 entitled neratinib and ado trastuzumab emtansine t dm1 for her2 breast cancer brain metastases bcbm translational breast cancer research consortium tbcrc trial 022 was presented by rachel a freedman md mph breast oncology center susan f smith center for women s cancers dana farber cancer institute at spotlight poster session 7 on december 7 from 5 00 p m 6 15 p m ct tbcrc 022 is a prospective multicenter phase ii study to evaluate the effect of neratinib plus t dm1 in patients with her2 positive breast cancer brain metastases this presentation outlined updates from three cohorts 4a patients with previously untreated bcbm 4b patients with bcbm progressing after prior local cns directed therapy without prior t dm1 exposure and 4c patients with bcbm progressing after prior local cns directed therapy with previous t dm1 exposure data from previous cohorts from this study were reported at the 2017 asco annual meeting patients with measurable her2 positive bcbm received neratinib 160 mg orally once daily plus t dm1 3 6 mg kg intravenously every 21 days in the three parallel enrolling cohorts diarrhea prophylaxis with colestipol and loperamide was required during cycle 1 all enrolled patients underwent a brain mri plus ct scan of the chest abdomen pelvis every 6 weeks for 18 weeks followed by every 9 weeks thereafter the primary endpoint response assessment in neuro oncology brain metastases rano bm was evaluated in each cohort separately the efficacy results from the trial showed that cns objective response rate by rano bm was 33 3 of patients in cohort 4a 29 4 in cohort 4b and 28 6 in cohort 4c rates of response stable disease greater than or equal to 6 months were 50 in cohort 4a 35 3 in cohort 4b and 33 3 in cohort 4c intracranial activity was observed for the combination of neratinib plus t dm1 in all three cohorts including in patients with prior t dm1 exposure suggesting a reversal of resistance to t dm1 overall the most frequently observed adverse event was diarrhea grade 2 32 and grade 3 23 these data provide additional evidence for the consideration of neratinib based combinations in patients with her2 positive bcbm neratinib given in combination with t dm1 showed promising activity in patients with heavily pre treated her2 positive disease metastatic to the cns including patients with prior t dm1 exposure which may suggest that neratinib is playing a role in reversing resistance to t dm1 said rachel a freedman md mph breast oncology center susan f smith center for women s cancers dana farber cancer institute despite the introduction of several new treatments for patients with her2 positive metastatic breast cancer cns progression events remain a major source of patient morbidity and mortality the data from this study provide additional evidence for consideration of neratinib based combinations in patients with her2 positive breast cancer brain metastases alan h auerbach ceo and president of puma biotechnology added we are pleased with the results from the tbcrc 022 trial on the combination of neratinib and t dm1 as a small molecule that can cross the blood brain barrier neratinib potentially offers patients with her2 positive metastatic breast cancer that has metastasized to the cns a novel her2 targeted treatment option this data adds to the existing body of data that we have from the other previously presented arms from the tbcrc 022 trial that continue to demonstrate that neratinib is active in

followed by november s consumer price index and another likely rate hike from the federal reserve next week the last time those were released they all led to rallies in the stock market because we had better inflation prints he said like many investors slimmon expects a downturn ahead given the inverted yield curve but does not anticipate the big earnings collapse or downturn many people are predicting in the first quarter this is in part due to the fact that many consumers have beefed up savings in recent years given the proximity of the most recent recession the message of this year is

5 10 959 the market s kind of bobbing and weaving and finding its breath after the big rally off the october lows ryan detrick chief market strategist at the carson group told cnbc he expected markets to continue this trend until investors receive more clarity from the fed s december policy meeting and november s cpi report stocks on the move included online used car seller carvana co nyse cvna

us wage and employment data and warnings of a looming recession from the chiefs executives of major wall street banks have resulted in four days of losses on wall street while the dow and the s p 500 traded higher mid morning the indices struggled to hold onto their gains with the recent losses attributed to last friday s earnings rise this coming friday provides yet another inflation indicator in the form of the ppi factory pricing figure said joshua mahony senior market analyst at online trading platform ig nonetheless with china starting to moderate their covid restrictions there is a hope that the economic suffering in the west will be counteracted by an asia led rebound in growth 9 35am chinese data highlights challenges facing global economy us stocks opened in the red on wednesday as investors pondered the potential outcomes of the fed s upcoming rate setting meeting amid disappointing economic data from china which showed both imports and exports declined last month despite signs the country is relaxing its zero covid policy just after the market opened the dow jones industrial average had slipped 37 points or 0 1 at 33 559 points the s p 500 was down 8 points or 0 2 at 3 933 points and the nasdaq composite had shed 33 points or 0 3 at 10 983 points oanda senior market analyst craig erlam said equity markets were struggling again on wednesday with the latest chinese trade data highlighting the challenges facing the global economy going into 2023 it would appear the recovery in stocks bear market rally or otherwise has run out of steam and investors are left wondering whether what follows next is another test of the lows or simply a correction of that impressive two month surge he said he added that the difficulty investors had now was balancing the coming end of the tightening cycle with a potential global recession next year amid heavily discounted valuations there s clearly an urge to take advantage of the latter without any real foresight into how bad the decline is going to be which is what makes it tricky and also why some are referring to the move since october as a bear market rally erlam said 6 30am us markets set for a fifth day of losses wall street is expected to open lower as concern about a us recession adds to worries that the federal reserve will continue on its path of hiking interest rates by 75 basis points when its

morgan also warned about the impact of inflation on consumer spending the s p closed 1 4 lower at 3 941 while the dow slipped 1 to 33 596 and the nasdaq sank 2 to 11 015 energy markets weren t spared the growing economic headwinds with the price of brent crude oil setting below 80 per barrel for the first time since january having seen another lacklustre and negative session for european and us markets yesterday there appears very little interest to drive markets higher in the short term as we look ahead to next week s central bank meetings from the federal reserve as well as the european central bank and bank of england said michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk while us markets finished lower for the fourth day in succession oil prices also fell sharply over concerns that a stickier inflation outlook increases the prospect of a weaker economy heading into 2023 markets are also shrugging off reports that china is taking measures to reopen its economy following strict covid lockdowns added james hughes chief market analyst at scope markets with the fed set to persist with the policy tightening agenda and this fuelling concerns that the us economy could be tipped into recession even the idea of china easing those draconian covid lockdown restrictions doesn t seem to be offering up much support hughes said economic data remains thin on the ground although weekly mortgage application numbers could offer up some interest depending just how sharp any contraction is here earnings news is also rather limited but gamestop one of the so called meme

living in the lancaster area to not only improve their socioeconomic conditions but to also gain a qualification in a new field and to find a rewarding career path this scholarship program was available to students enrolling in a range of undergraduate graduate degrees and vocational certifications such as business administration criminal justice nursing and more as the university built for the 21st century we wanted to welcome and support leaders of the future whatever their socioeconomic status and this offering has been the first step in making that goal a reality our second milestone was to introduce a nasa technology transfer program at uav we partnered with nasa to create a unique learning opportunity for engineering and business students and this program connects universities with nasa developed technology to give students the opportunity to work with federal government research innovations and technology student entrepreneurs built case studies with nasa s patent portfolio while learning about commercialization and licensing opportunities also students who want to take their ideas beyond the classroom can utilize startup nasa a special program designed to help early stage startups commercialize nasa technology this partnership is a natural match for uav with the antelope valley being a local hub for some of the world s aeronautical leaders including nasa boeing lockheed martin northrop grumman and the uasf plant 42 to name a few and looking to the future we plan to continue on this partnership growth strategy to keep building out our new high tech online programs in spacex fintech medtech and greentech and allow our students to have highly specialized degrees our second growth strategy for uav is to build a digital twin of the university online to deliver tertiary education globally in an immersive and engaging way allowing students from all around the world to gain access to accredited u s curriculum and degrees accretion of this online platform will combine in the future metaverse including gamified learning a digital credit system and virtual reality and will include the 21st century curriculum faculty campuses and edtech platform for university students our plan is to extend courses and programs to online learning environments with students and faculty connecting and learning in global classrooms and virtual environments around the world we are building six campuses each with a vibrant community lead mentors and course content to service six types of members and partners on geniusu we also plan to integrate each student s ai based virtual system as 3d virtual systems that accompany each student on their personalized journey moreover student credits earned on the platform will also be integrated into the metaverse so that students can spend them on products and services within geniusu as well as counting towards their certifications considering our mission is to develop an entrepreneur education system that prepares students for the 21st century we believe that webtree and the metaverse will provide students and teachers with an enhanced way to interact and learn in a global classroom the goal is to develop a blended solution of real life online and virtual learning to gamify learning and make it far more engaging upon working students in real time around the world we explained on our previous earnings call that our gross model is through a four step approach which is acquisition integration digitization and distribution so we ve acquired five companies since going ipo in april 2022 education angel e squared education enterprises the university of antelope valley property investment networks and revealed films inc we have now started our process of integrating our five acquisitions focusing on products community and revenue synergies this integration process is expected to take several months as our strategy is to ensure that each company is integrated into genius group while operating separately we re redesigning ore processes to make sure they are consistent and that we re learning best practices from each other implementing the most successful one in each of our portfolio companies so for example we developed a genius formula as a proven customer acquisition strategy and marketing pathway that enable partners to build their global classrooms on geniusu we are therefore currently implementing this genius formula within all of the genius group companies to ensure we have the same marketing pathway and that the customer experience is consistent across the board by ensuring that customer funnel and definition of visitors leads and customers are consistent in each of the companies this will simplify our reporting process allow for consistent customer data and as a result will help us improve our operational metrics however we are centralizing certain company functions such as strategy and business development to ensure we maximize efficiencies and generate both revenue and cost synergies across the board so for example a centralized business development function will understand the needs and growth strategies of each of the portfolio companies and will be better placed to find synergies and partnerships that would benefit multiple portfolio companies than having multiple single business development functions and once those five companies are fully integrated to our genius group family and business culture we will be combining each company s courses and products into curriculum and geniusu edtech platform and tailor them to the needs of our students and expand our offering from current local communities to our global one we believe this will increase the lifetime value of our students and reduce the student and partner acquisition costs for each level of our curriculum by digitizing the courses and products for online delivery we aim to scale each company s product offerings globally the integration of these companies to geniusu will help accelerate their speed size and scale and increase their enrollments and capacity to deliver courses and increase their student retention through personalized education pathways our second organic growth is to focus on partnerships with thought leaders and companies that align to our mission that bring with them new students and course content and may lead to potential acquisitions in the future during our impact investor festival november we partnered with popular educators including brian jung and jaspreet singh both investor educators each with over 1 million subscribers on youtube this led to us having more than 20 000 registered students in the event we re expecting the same traction for our global entrepreneurs summit in december as we partnered with futurist peter diamandis co founder of singularity university and the xprize slim ismail author of exponential organizations and founder of openexo and verne harnish founder of the young entrepreneurs organization ceo and co founder of scaling up we re expecting to also have more than 20 000 participants at this event and similarly our latest acquisition revealed films attracts viewers and students through their library of documentaries featuring well known entrepreneur and investor educators including new york times best selling authors robert kiyosaki james rickards and garrett gunderson we plan on continuing this organic growth strategy by organizing multiple events in 2023 and attracting thought leaders best selling authors youtubers and influencers into our faculty and geniusu platform i ll focus on constantly creating new partnerships and leveraging such events for organic growth is reflecting in our operating statistics as the number of students and partners on our platform have been growing steadily over time at the end of september 2022 we had 3 01 million students on the geniusu platform with approximately 9 000 new students joining each week in 2022 this represents a 17 2 annualized growth rate since december 2021 and similarly our paying students grew to 41 282 in the past nine months a 40 annualized growth rate these two numbers are prior to the integration of our ipo acquisition companies with geniusu on a pro forma basis genius group has a student base now of 4 35 million at the end of september 2022 the number of partners on geniusu grew to 10 751 since december 2021 a 7 annualized growth rate and on a pro forma basis we now have 12 521 partners on geniusu we expect to increase both the number of students and partners to grow over time as we step up our organic growth efforts by mainly increasing marketing spend and improving our customer experience and continue our inorganic growth by making further acquisitions we believe that our free student community represents a significant business opportunity for us to bring them in and through the personalized pay path during this quarter we also released a new version of one of our main products wealth dynamics 5 0 this product is a stepping stone of the journey that our students take when joining the genius group community as soon as they join our edtech platform students have the opportunity to take the wealth dynamics test to discover which of the eight entrepreneurial types they are and once they learn more about what their natural talent is they unlock a whole new way of accessing flow productivity creating attraction building the right team and speeding up their results wealth dynamics is already a world s leading entrepreneur tool for finding your flow and building your wealth used by 1 000s entrepreneurs worldwide enables them to significantly grow their business results and do the work they love to do we upgraded our product with new content new stories and detailed definitions on how to be a 5 0 entrepreneur in the digital aid or based on different entrepreneur profiles this update allows our product to further resonate with students as all the profiles are based on some of the most successful business people and entrepreneurs of the decade such as elon musk cathie wood kevin o leary and many others with this upgrade we are planning to continue growing our student base and being the world s leading entrepreneurial pool entrepreneur tool in terms of achievements in q3 i m proud to say that geniuu the edtech arm of genius group has become named as singapore top 10 emerging giant in the kpmg and hsbc emerging giants in asia pacific 2022 report the businesses listed in the report have been identified as those that will be making a lasting impact on the global business landscape over the next decade the joint study by kpmg and hsbc covers the asia pacific s technology focused startup landscape and identifies businesses that are the emerging giants in the region it has listed the top ten companies in various locations from malaysia japan indonesia india hong kong and singapore and geniusu was listed as one of the top 10 in the singapore region we re delighted to have been recognized as an emerging giant and this is a testament of our continued growth and global impact i d also like to that we have recently retained two law firms to investigate our recent market activity after carefully reviewing the recent trading history of our ordinary shares we believe that we may have been the target of a market manipulation scheme that has been adversely affecting our share price we have retained christian levine law group and warshaw burstein llp two law firms that have successfully prosecuted and collected millions of dollars in damages on behalf of their clients from broker dealer s markmakers hedge funds and asset based lenders who have engaged in market manipulation schemes now i would like to turn it over to erez so that he can give an overview of our financial performance see also top 15 infrastructure companies in the us and 15 most capitalist companies in the world erez simha thank you roger and good morning everyone we continue to demonstrate strong growth across our platform expanding the number of students as well as the number of partners and this is reflected in our financials for the nine months ended september 30 2022 for the nine months ended september 2022 genius group revenues on a standalone basis grew by 16 68 year over year to 14 42 million this internal growth was driven by 24 increase in our digital education revenue and a 46 increase in campus revenue the strong growth in campus revenue was due to an increased demand as a result of gradual lifting of covid 19 restrictions our revenue on a pro forma basis reached 24 67 million in year to date september 22 the group gross margin had increased to 33 96 in year to date september 22 our group margin has increased due to improved results from our campus business which had a higher gross margin to date we have been maintaining a balance between growth and a positive gross margin in which we are not being overly aggressive in our marketing spend and this is reflected in our current gross margin genius group pro forma gross margin is 47 33 by owning the majority of our curriculum and courses because all companies and acquisitions we are focused on maintaining low cost of content and high gross margin the cost of revenue that we do incur is mainly our customer acquisition costs and our faculty costs in the future we will continue to focus on further improving our gross margins to synergies and higher efficiency the group had net operating expenses of 10 85 million and 17 5 million on a pro forma basis approximately 60 of our operating expenses is our start up with the remaining in development marketing rental and general expenses the increase in our operating expenses is the result of the growth in our operations acquisition of companies the expansion of our core recurring and preparation for ipo and listing as with our cost of goods sold we have been managing our overhead to maintain a sustainable growth rate and have additional funds to invest in acquisition the group had a negative adjusted ebitda of 3 89 million in year to date september 22 compared to a negative of 1 59 million year to date september 21 on a pro forma basis our negative adjusted ebitda was 2 99 million year to date september 22 this negative adjusted ebitda is due to an increased investment made in infrastructure and marketing and senior levels of leadership position we will continue to maintain a delicate balance growth between growth and infrastructure and aim to improve our operating leverage as we grow turning now to cash performance and the balance sheet the group current asset increased to 36 23 million the largest current asset type in our group our restricted cash of 11 33 million can and cash equivalents of 8 97 million accounts receivable of 7 87 million our group and business model is the short term cash generating business with customers payment made at the time of enrollment and often in advance which is also reflected below in our deferred revenue the exception to this is our annual membership and education programs the payment is mainly the installments genius group pro forma total current asset in september 22 was 33 96 million the group non current assets grew to 46 97 million mainly due to the acquisition of pin education angels and e square and the investment in university of antelope valley on a pro forma basis genius group non current asset was 57 98 million the non current assets are largely the result of intangible assets and goodwill related to the acquisitions the group current liabilities increased to 16 22 million with the largest item being deffered revenue which grew to 5 94 million and the convertible note which increased to 4 19 million genius group pro forma total account liabilities in september 22 was ph million the group non current liability increased to 14 16 million with the largest items being 7 61 million in right of use liabilities of which 7 2 million which is an adjustment due to the gaap to ifrs adjustment for the university of antelope valley on its operating lease liability the additional increase was due to convertible loan issuance in august 22 of 17 million with a net increase of 3 29 million under non current liabilities the pro forma non current liabilities was 14 3 million the group s shareholders equity grew to 52 83 million in september 22 which reflects management s strategy to grow through acquisitions and organic growth during this period the company issued a convertible note of 17 million and accounted for 8 58 million to equity for the potential conversion of debt to equity the company also issued geniusu limited ordinary shares with a value of 2 556 739 dollars in exchange for cash and also 7 million 3 763 636 as a part of its published listing in new york stock exchange and we see the total fpl net proceeds of 18 06 million during the period ended september 30 2022 the company closed four acquisitions and issued shares for the consideration of 27 05 million genius group pro forma legacy shareholders equity was 60 25 million which includes the issuance of shares for the acquisition of revealed films of 7 million we also saw the senior secured convertible note at the end of august to an institutional investor for a purchase price of 17 million of which 1 67 million was received in september 22 and the balance of 11 33 million is held in those ticket cash accounts the note has a 30 month maturity conversion price of 5 17 per ordinary shares for voluntary conversion of the note and build interest 5 we intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and for acquisition to the extent permitted under the business agreement overall we are very happy with the genius group development year to date we have grown our revenue by 16 68 which is much faster than both the global education market growth of 4 3 and the global edtech market growth of 16 3 which demonstrate the strength of our edtech platform and the growing interest in entrepreneurs education we have also increased our gross margin to 33 96 and 47 33 on a pro forma basis which transpired our efficiency and growing operational efforts with regard to our 2022 guidance we are maintaining our pro forma revenue guidance between 35 million and 38 million and revising our 2022 adjusted ebitda guidance to a loss between 4 million to 5 million due to higher planned investment in our education segment to be able to capture short term opportunities specifically in recent acquisitions we expect ebitda to normalize in early 2023 so with that we thank you for joining the call today and i would like to open it up for questions operator to continue reading the q a session

solar flares and plasma eruptions are common and sometimes big enough to wreak havoc on earth eruptions on the sun can cause power outages radio blackouts and gps confusion stay safe during a solar storm by preparing to lose power printing out maps and staying off planes the sun is constantly writhing with activity with plasma bubbling on its surface and giant sunspots opening and closing sometimes the solar surface erupts and sends a burst of plasma and electrically charged particles shooting toward earth as the solar particles wash over earth our planet s magnetic field lines send them toward the north and south poles where they penetrate into the upper layers of the atmosphere and interact with gas molecules to create the dancing lights of the aurora the aurora borealis northern lights in the sky near rovaniemi in lapland finland alexander kuznetsov reuters bigger solar eruptions can produce beautiful auroras as far south as pennsylvania iowa and oregon but a really

stop the magnetic and electrical activity from messing with our technology a coronal mass ejection as seen from nasa s solar terrestrial relations observatory a spacecraft nasa stereo cor2 the risk from severe space weather is that it disrupts the technologies now vital to human life mike hapgood a space weather consultant at the rutherford appleton laboratory in the uk told insider via email this has become a big issue only in the past sixty years say since 1960 as electricity has replaced coal as a key energy source for homes and offices we re in a new solar cycle with the sun building

solar flare and how do they affect earth a coronal mass ejection nasa a solar flare which is a burst of radiation that accelerates charged particles away from the sun travels at the speed of light so by the time forecasters see it it s already affecting earth s ionosphere according to nasa that can cause radio blackouts coronal mass ejections are a more violent targeted eruption when a cloud of plasma and magnetic fields shoots out into space cmes primarily affect the magnetosphere jostling earth s magnetic field lines in an event called a geomagnetic storm also known as a solar storm that s what can cause power outages forecasters can issue warnings ahead of cmes some cmes reach earth as fast as 15 hours after they re first spotted while others can take days according to the national

stock up on supplies for living without electricity ismail sha studies with a rechargeable lantern for his final examination during a power outage in cape town south africa esa alexander reuters geomagnetic storms can produce extra currents in the power grid which interfere with transformers and can cause outages i d expect that interference to cause parts of the power grid to shut down to prevent wider damage and the operators would need some time to restore normal operation maybe hours maybe a day or two hapgood said that s what happened in quebec in 1989 an inundation of particles from the sun knocked out the region s power for about nine hours i d rate that as a once in a century event in any particular location hapgood said adding that any solar storm power outage would likely be across a region of roughly 1 000 miles it is important for people to have some personal resilience to loss of electricity he added that means stocking up on nonperishable food clean water cash battery powered or hand crank flashlights blankets and warm clothes for the winter and some means of cooking safely without electricity it s also a good idea to have a battery powered or wind up radio to get news and weather updates but there s a chance that won t work during a solar storm either don t plan to rely on radio or gps radio enthusiast robin hsu looks at a radio receiver while

five developers selected to build the first floating wind farms in u s federal waters to support the california energy commission s planning goals of 2 5 gw of offshore wind by 2030 and 25 gw by 2045 as well as a federal target to deploy 15 gw of floating wind by 2035 the bureau of ocean energy management boem has concluded the auction date for five 33 year leases offshore california exhibit 1 summarizes the outcome of the auction and estimates the potential of the lease areas using boems standard power density formula of 3 mw per square kilometer which is traditionally proven to be on the conservative side starting with 43 pre qualified bidders successful companies proposed more that 757 million dollars in acquisition fees to secure the rights to operate floating wind farms for more than 30 years off the coast of california the six new york bight leases netted close to 8 billion in acquisition fees this represents an average of around 2 3 million be square kilometer or 2 3 million per 3 mw of capacity potential the average agreed for the five california leases is around 501 000 or around 80 below the prices bid in the new york bight process the two humboldt leases attracted the highest prices per square kilometer at over 615 000 more than the final offers for the two recent carolina long bay auctions the three morro bay leases average below 440 000 per square kilometer exhibit 2 presents a summary of prices paid to date for all federal offshore wind leases off the atlantic and pacific coasts as with the recent new york bight and carolina long bay lease auctions the california auction terms include incentives to develop local supply chains and community benefit agreements the winner of a lease was chosen against a combination bid price and bid credits for supply chain development and community benefit agreements the bidding credits are aimed at developing a floating wind supply chain that is not yet in place either within the u s or globally who are the winners rwe renewables is german utility currently involved in the maine aqua ventus tetraspar and demosath floating wind demonstration projects the maine aqua ventus and sath technologies are both concrete based ideal for local content and will be demonstrated in the united states in the coming two to four years california north south floating llc special purpose limited liability companies ultimately owned by copenhagen infrastructure partners a global leader in developing offshore wind projects including the vineyard wind 1 project off massachusetts equinor wind us lcc is a subsidiary of the norwegian energy company with its own spar and semi submersible floating wind technology equinor is currently developing the world s largest floating wind project hywind tampen in norway central california offshore wind llc is understood to be an entity established by ocean winds a jv of edpr and engie ocean winds currently operates the windfloat atlantic floating wind pilot project featuring principle power s semi submersible technology invenergy california offshore the u s renewable energy developer who secured a lease in the new york bight auction earlier this year has yet to declare a technology partner so why the difference in pricing a key factor in the auction prices is that floating offshore wind is a relatively immature technology till now less than 150 mw has been installed globally compared with around 60 gw globally the largest floating wind farm under construction today is 88 mw it is also the deepest at 300 meters the california floating wind projects pose several challenges including some specific to california and some general to the industry the challenges that the successful bidders face include no offshore wind supply chain on the west coast and limited global floating wind supply chains the impact of inflation on development and financing costs the challenges of manufacturing and assembling floating wind turbine substructures mooring large numbers of turbines in 500 1 200 meters of water port capabilities to support floating wind project construction and operations and maintenance given the current congestion in west coast ports available port capacity is already at a premium accommodating offshore transmission into the onshore grid network environmental and spatial challenges such as the impact of floating wind projects on populations of bats and marine mammals on the west coast as well as the local fishing industry the growth of floating projects at scale and competition for supply chain resources in the u k to south korea within the same timescale timing based on boem standard project review timelines we anticipate the first project to start generating power by 2030 at the earliest with full commercial operations from 2031 this is a very aggressive timeline due to the immaturity of the global floating wind supply chain coupled with similar floating wind ambitions in the same time frame in europe and asia for more information about the intelatus global partners please visit www intelatus com or contact philip lewis at 44 203 966 2492 philip lewis is director research at

inc ngm bio nasdaq ngm a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing transformative therapeutics for patients today announced the presentation of preliminary data from the phase 1 part 1a monotherapy dose escalation arm of the ongoing phase 1 2 trial of ngm707 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors at the european society for medical oncology immuno oncology esmo i o annual congress which is taking place december 7 9 2022 in geneva switzerland in the poster presentation titled first in human study of ngm707 an ilt2 ilt4 dual antagonist antibody in advanced or metastatic solid tumors preliminary monotherapy dose escalation data 174p ngm707 was generally well tolerated across all dose cohorts and demonstrated promising early signals of anti tumor activity of 24 response evaluable patients in the part 1a arm best overall responses as of november 23 2022 are partial response in one patient stable disease in six patients and non complete response non progressive disease in one patient six patients had reduced target lesion size including a maximum decrease in one patient of 70 a copy of the presentation presented at the esmo i o annual congress is available on ngm bio s website at the phase 1 portion of the ongoing ngm707 trial includes a monotherapy dose escalation arm part 1a and a dose finding arm in combination with pembrolizumab keytruda part 1b the phase 2 portion of the trial will include expansion cohorts of patients treated with ngm707 in combination with keytruda part 2b in several advanced solid tumor types the part 1a arm enrolled patients into escalating ngm707 dose cohorts 6 mg to 1800 mg administered intravenously every three weeks enrolled patients received a median of four prior lines of therapy and all had metastatic disease primary objectives in the phase 1 portion are to assess safety and tolerability of ngm707 and to identify phase 2 doses secondary exploratory objectives include assessment of pk biomarker correlation immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity per recist v1 1 as of a november 23 2022 data cut off 34 patients have been enrolled in the monotherapy dose escalation of 24 response evaluable patients those completing at least one on treatment scan best overall responses are partial response pr in one patient stable disease in six patients and non complete response non progressive disease in one patient six of the 24 response evaluable patients experienced target lesion reduction the patient experiencing the pr had a target lesion decrease of 70 along with a reduction and or elimination of non target lesions these responses were seen across five distinct tumor types preliminary evidence of potential myeloid reprogramming was observed in peripheral non classical monocytes as well as in tumor biopsies with reduction of the m2 macrophage marker cd163 observed post treatment treatment related adverse events traes occurred in 47 of patients with 9 of patients experiencng grade 3 traes one dose limiting toxicity of pneumonitis g5 in a patient with pulmonary metastasis was observed at ngm707 600 mg a maximum tolerated dose was not reached as of november 23 2022 four patients remain on ngm707 monotherapy treatment in the part 1a arm including the patient experiencing the pr enrollment is ongoing in the part 1b arm evaluating ngm707 in combination with keytruda ngm bio anticipates enrolling approximately 220 patients in the phase 1 2 trial of ngm707 ngm707 is designed to reprogram immune suppressive ilt4 and ilt2 expressing myeloid cells and ilt2 expressing lymphoid cells in the tumor microenvironment into immune stimulatory cells that will promote anti tumor activity we re pleased to present these initial data demonstrating a favorable tolerability profile for ngm707 as well as early yet promising signals that this mechanistic approach may translate to clinical benefit said dan kaplan ph d head of translational immuno oncology at ngm bio we re particularly encouraged to see clinical benefit in certain patients in response to monotherapy treatment with ngm707 and we look forward to evaluating ngm707 s potential effect when combined with t cell checkpoint inhibition in part 1b of the study which is now underway about ngm707 ilt2 and ilt4 inhibitory receptors with enriched expression on myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment are myeloid checkpoints that may enable certain tumors to evade immune detection thereby suppressing patients anti tumor responses ngm707 is being developed with the goal of improving patient immune response to tumors by inhibiting both ilt2 and ilt4 by inhibiting both ilt2 and ilt4 ngm707 may be able to overcome the potential redundant role the two receptors play where they are co expressed in myeloid cells and reprogram those cells to enhance t cell activity and proliferation in addition ilt2 blockade may drive further benefit through reducing suppression in

the department of energy under president joe biden is touting a 200 million grant it gave to a lithium battery company that would help the united states grow its domestic sources of green energy even though it primarily operates in china according to a report microvast a texas based company that primarily operates in china according to the washington free beacon received 200 million in grant money provided by the u s government from the so called bipartisan infrastructure law to help shift the county to green energy when the grants were announced in october secretary of energy jennifer granholm touted the investment in american made products this is truly a remarkable time for manufacturing in america as president biden s agenda and historic investments supercharge the private sector to ensure our clean energy future is american made producing advanced batteries and components here at home will accelerate the transition away from fossil fuels to meet the strong demand for electric vehicles creating more good paying jobs across the country additionally in the grant s announcement the department of energy touted that microvast is a majority u s owned company traded on nasdaq that is headquartered in stafford texas with additional locations in tennessee florida and colorado however the free beacon explained that financial records reveal the company primarily works out of china inancial records show the company operates primarily out of china microvast itself says the chinese government exerts substantial influence over the manner in which we must conduct our business activities and may intervene at any time and with no notice the company was also recently added to a securities and exchange commission watchlist of chinese companies that are on track to be delisted from nasdaq for failing to comply with u s auditing requirements the report also noted that the so called bipartisan infrastructure law states that the department of energy should avoid using the grants money to fund any project that use battery material supplied by or originating from a foreign entity of concern including companies subject to the jurisdiction or direction of china moreover the free beacon wrote that microvast describes itself in its 2021 annual sec report as a holding company that conducts its business principally through our subsidiary in china a substantial portion of our operations and manufacturing and most of our current customers are in the microvast added in its sec report according to the free beacon which also explained that it previously received subsidies from the chinese government in addition to noting that most of its customers are associated with state owned companies in the prc furthermore the sec in may added the lithium battery company to a list of companies that do not satisfy u s auditing requirements under the holding foreign companies accountable act as the free beacon noted in may the sec added microvast to a list of chinese companies that aren t in compliance with u s auditing requirements under the holding foreign companies accountable act the law which went into effect last spring is designed to prevent chinese companies listed on the u s stock exchanges from using non approved china based auditors to obscure their finances companies that remain on the list for three consecutive years will be delisted from nasdaq they are also required to disclose whether they have any directors who are members of the chinese communist party or ccp ownership the free beacon explained that according to microvast spokeswoman sarah alexander microvast ceo yang wu is a u s citizen still arthur wong another director at the company is a hong kong citizen based in beijing and is the chairman of the audit committee at daqo new energy corporation where a subsidiary of that company according to the report was previously sanctioned by the biden administration for having connections to slave labor alexander noted that one of microvast s directors is a member of the chinese communist party and that the company primarily operates out of huzhou china where their website says it has a manufacturing facility and r d center regarding the sec s compliance list the spokeswoman said that it could change due to recent developments on the including an agreement between the u s and chinese governments to allow for complete inspections recently u s and chinese regulatory officials are in talks to settle a long running dispute over the auditing compliance of u s listed chinese firms reuters reported however as breitbart news extensively reported last year biden s energy secretary is no stranger to controversy regarding taxpayer funded government grants in the green energy sector during granholm s two terms as michigan s governor pushing for electric vehicles was a major focus of hers which she pursued by selecting particular businesses and industries to back with state taxpayer support michigan capitol confidential notes when she was governor granholm approved billions of dollars in state approved tax credits for her chosen companies still michigan capitol confidential noted that every single one fell far short of the job projections hailed by the granholm administration in press releases and a good number of the companies went bankrupt breitbart news added the most notorious of granholm s state backed grant failures was the michigan based electric battery company a123 systems to which granholm s administration granted 141 million in state credits and subsidies in conjunction with a 249 million federal stimulus grant from the obama administration to develop lithium ion battery technology for plug in hybrid electric vehicles despite this massive government investment a123 systems filed for bankruptcy in october 2012 and then in 2013 the obama biden administration approved the sale of a123 systems to a chinese company thereby allowing china to acquire all of the u s taxpayer funded electric battery research developed by the michigan company given the biden administration s soft stance on china and lack of clear safeguards in the so called bipartisan infrastructure law to prevent china from buying up u s assets and government subsidized companies it is possible any company receiving grant money from the u s could be the next a123 systems jacob bliss is a reporter for breitbart news write

while 2022 is marked with red ink for the majority of stocks it s been a good year for those of the value persuasion relatively speaking indeed as of 12 07 22 the russell 3000 value index had a negative total return of 7 1 year to date vs the 26 3 plunge for its growth counterpart the russell 3000 growth index kovitz proponents of value investing have welcomed the turning tide which began on halloween 2020 as the approach had been maligned in recent years of course historical experience favors the style over the long term as well as in periods like the current one that has prominently featured rising interest rates inflation a subject covered in a recent report my team has penned the prudent speculator special report inflation 101b growth is a component of value in my two most recent posts i ve generally argued that two megacap tech stocks microsoft msft alphabet goog should be considered by investors who lean toward the value side of the investing aisle of course such discourse would surely be lacking without including apple aapl in the conversation after all the consumer electronics giant was the first american business to reach a staggering 1 trillion of market capitalization before going on to cross the 2 trillion threshold in august 2020 to be sure apple is a grower having doubled earnings per share since 2018 a rate of nearly 19 per annum and tripled the figure since 2016 20 growth per year quite the feat for a company of its massive size in recent years aapl shares have been rewarded with a multiple of earnings above that of the overall market but there is plenty of value to be realized from the firm s ever evolving product base that goes hand in hand with its ubiquitous ecosystem of course as mentioned in my features of microsoft and alphabet there is much more to choosing an attractively priced stock with handsome appreciation potential than a few valuation metrics indeed we at the prudent speculator have long argued that growth is a component of the assessment of the investment merits of any company in fact our three to five year target prices always consider forward looking expectations for sales and earnings not to mention brand strength competitive position product breadth and depth and management prowess for additional contemplation of the subject check out our special report don t forget about value dominating the headlines although aapl is mostly known for its consumer products that just work its ecosystem serves as a sort of walled garden around its entire product line which enhances the interoperability of devices and broadens the appeal of its additional services like music and television apple now boasts over 900 million subscribers across these services of course there was a recent kerfuffle about apple s command of its app store related to the company s 30 revenue cut and the potential to kick twitter out of the store but ceo tim cook and twitter owner elon musk seem to have found common ground and settled their disagreement also there have been several unnamed sources in the news citing supply constraints as reason for the company to cut iphone production however while these checks can sometimes be the equivalent of a canary in the coal mine apple has many suppliers which can see orders whacked for reasons outside of demand e g low quality and delays of course we ve also seen apple production cutback rumors turn out to be false we might add in this case that the chinese government is feeling rising pressure to abandon its zero covid policy which has put beijing in a lose lose scenario for the rest of the world it should mean that constraints will ease even as companies have been looking to diversify production to regions outside of china no doubt the product upgrade cycle for iphone will reach an equilibrium at which point there will be stabilization of demand from existing iphone users nevertheless growth in subscription services should reduce volatility associated with product refresh cycles in addition the services segment produces a gross margin nearly double those of the products iphone apple watch etc which are impressive in their own right usually between 30 40 apple s balance sheet is also very strong with a large cash hoard that is significant enough on its own to rank among the top 15 largest s p 500 companies by market value the debt burden has also grown over the years but perhaps unsurprisingly apple s credit terms are presently better than those of the federal government and the balance is merely a touch higher than a typical year of net income this liquidity offers flexibility to return capital to shareholders or make key investments i e intel s intc smartphone modem chip acquisition the oracle of omaha true the forward p e ratio of 23 and dividend yield below 1 makes it tough to call apple a traditional value stock but we can t forget that the world s most famous value investor owns a major stake in the company indeed warren buffett s berkshire hathaway brk b held 126 5 billion worth of aapl shares at the end of september so we think apple is both a growth and a value stock a view we have maintained more or less since our original recommendation in the prudent speculator more than 22 years ago follow me on twitter check out my my website
trusts come in many variations rendering them often difficult for non attorneys to follow and comprehend indeed this variation can often be seen in the nomenclature used for trust arrangements which includes terms such as grantor and non grantor simple and complex revocable and irrevocable and discretionary or non discretionary in many instances trusts may also have provisions designed to protect the trust principal from third party creditors such as spendthrift clauses making trusts even more difficult for a layman to understand of course the many variations of trusts also give rise to income tax reporting complexity although the irs has readily recognized that there is nothing unlawful in establishing a trust it has also actively communicated that it will police trust arrangements to ensure that trusts and trust beneficiaries are complying with the federal income tax and reporting laws accordingly taxpayers establishing trusts and particularly those where the drafter intends to charge a large fee should have the trust agreement carefully scrutinized by a tax professional to make sure that the trust complies with these tax laws what is a trust trusts are nothing more than an agreement between the settlor or grantor and the trustee in which the settlor transfers property to the trustee to hold in trust for the benefit of the trust beneficiaries when a trust is settled the trustee has fiduciary obligations to the trust beneficiaries limited only by the terms of the trust agreement and governing state law generally trusts contain provisions whereby the beneficiaries receive specified distributions from the trust for example a trust provision may provide that the income beneficiaries receive income for life with the corpus or principal of the trust going to the principal beneficiaries because certain items have the hallmarks of both income and return of capital there may often be disagreements amongst the beneficiaries as to the proper treatment of those items for trust purposes and fiduciary accounting income irs notice 97 24 as indicated supra there is nothing prohibiting taxpayers from conducting their personal or business affairs through trust arrangements in fact the irs has readily conceded that taxpayers may utilize trusts for valid purposes such as to protect assets or more easily transfer wealth to third parties there is nothing nefarious about creating a trust rather taxpayers run afoul with the irs when the settlor the trust or the trust beneficiaries fail to properly report trust activities to the irs when they are otherwise required to do so by law after a proliferation of abusive trust arrangements in the 1990s the irs issued notice 97 24 the notice attempting to warn taxpayers that certain trust arrangements were unlawful particularly those that purported to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes in a manner not permitted by federal tax law in the notice the irs cautioned taxpayers of too good to be true arrangements that were being offered and sold by third party promoters since issuance of notice 97 24 the irs has successfully challenged abusive trust arrangements under a litany of different legal theories which are discussed more fully below sham trusts theory for some time the irs has successfully challenged certain trust arrangements as sham trusts for example in linmar property management trust v commissioner t c memo 2008 219 the taxpayer established a trust and contributed four parcels of real estate to the trust the taxpayer named his wife as initial trustee with his daughter as a contingent trustee in various tax years the trust claimed significant income distribution deductions attributable to purported trust distributions to the taxpayer s businesses however the taxpayer was unable to show that such income was distributed to those entities nor that those businesses waived their right to such distributions in addition checks from the taxpayer s business were deposited in the trust s bank accounts which funds were then used to pay for the taxpayer s life insurance vacation timeshare family members educations antiques piano and homeowner s insurance the trust filed tax returns effectively zeroing out the income reported for each year through income distribution deductions on the other hand the taxpayer did not file individual income tax returns at trial the irs contended that the trust should be disregarded as a separate entity for federal tax purposes because it lack economic substance and a sham the united states tax court agreed with the irs recognizing that if the creation of a trust lacks economic effect and alters no cognizable economic relationship the court may ignore the trust as a sham this rule applies regardless of whether the entity has a separate existence recognized under state law and whether in form it is a trust a common law business trust or some other form of jural entity whether a trust lacks economic substance for tax purposes is a factual question to be decided on the basis of the facts before the court because the tax court found in favor of the irs under the sham trust theory the taxpayer was ordered to pay the irs over 700 000 of back taxes penalties and interest grantor trust rules the irs has also found success in challenging abusive trust arrangements under the grantor trust rules see i r c 671 679 under these rules if a trust is treated as a grantor trust the grantor or deemed owner of the trust must report the trust activities on his or her individual income tax return regardless of the trust s separate state law existence see i r c 671 see also treas reg 1 671 4 generally requiring grantor trust activities to flow through to the grantor on the grantor s tax return whether a trust is a grantor or non grantor trust is usually a complex determination based on the provisions of the internal revenue code governing regulations and federal case law respecting the trust arrangement interestingly the irs often contends that the trust arrangement is a legitimate non grantor trust and not a sham opting instead to argue that the trust itself should be required to pay federal income tax or alternatively if the trust has made certain income distributions to trust beneficiaries the trust beneficiaries federal gift estate tax finally the irs also looks at abusive trust arrangements to determine whether those arrangements have properly complied with other parts of the internal revenue code such as federal gift tax and federal estate tax provisions for example in many instances the transfer of assets to an irrevocable trust may result in a completed gift to the trust beneficiary which may in turn result in federal gift tax or gift tax reporting requirements see e g hess v comm r t c memo 2003 25 recognizing federal gift taxes on the trust settlor when closely held stock was transferred to an irrevocable trust with the settlor s daughter as the sole beneficiary criminal prosecution in more serious instances the irs may refer a civil case to the department of justice for criminal prosecution generally the irs tends to refer these types of cases where the taxpayer was aware that the trust arrangement was abusive and the taxpayer is sophisticated such as a medical professional or finance professional for example in u s v ellefsen 655 f 3d 769 8th cir 2011 the taxpayer was an orthopedic surgeon in 1997 the taxpayer attended a presentation that suggested that he could utilize domestic and foreign trusts to shelter assets from federal income taxes after attending the presentation the taxpayer requested that his long time certified public accountant cpa discuss the potential transactions with the promoters the cpa spoke with the promoters and cautioned the taxpayer to avoid the transaction urging him to seek a second opinion from an independent tax attorney i e one not affiliated with the promoter the court noted in its opinion that the taxpayer failed to do so later the taxpayer entered into the trust arrangement when the cpa learned that the taxpayer was utilizing the trust arrangement he forwarded a copy of the notice to the taxpayer and wrote in an email to the taxpayer it seems to me that the promoters are relying on an elaborate chain of complex entities to conceal taxable income they have concocted a series of transactions to cloak earned taxable income from rendering patient services in missouri into non reported foreign source income and then arranging to lend or gift the money back to you i am especially suspicious when i learned that they will provide you with a visa card to access the money they have also represented that you will have a power of attorney that will allow you to transfer funds at will you will be earning the income by performing services and you will be enjoying the benefits of the income therefore it is reasonable that the irs could potentially look through this masquerade and say that it is taxable income to you regardless of the structure i am asking that you consider the worst case scenario in which the irs takes the position that you are committing tax evasion they have the power to assess huge penalties and interest to prosecute you to ruin your career and seize property is the risk worth it later federal agents executed search warrants at the promoter s offices after the search warrant the taxpayer was advised by a third party that she had contacted a tax attorney to discuss the trust arrangement and had been informed by the tax attorney that the arrangement was illegal when the cpa advised the taxpayer that he could no longer prepare the tax returns without certain backup items and an opinion from a tax attorney the taxpayer informed the cpa that he had hired another tax preparer to prepare the tax returns notwithstanding the cpa continued to warn the taxpayer of the potential risks of the abusive trust arrangement even after his termination for example the cpa forwarded an irs amnesty program that permitted taxpayers an option to regain compliance if they had already entered into improper offshore transactions and arrangements in march 2005 the cpa received a grand jury subpoena from an irs agent for records pertaining to the taxpayer and his businesses thereafter the taxpayer amended certain tax returns and remitted 534 676 to the irs in april 2007 the taxpayer was indicted and pleaded not guilty to among other tax charges a conspiracy count alleging that from 1997 through 2003 the taxpayer conspired to divert more than 1 5 million in funds from his business for his own benefit without paying taxes on the diverted funds after an 11 day trial the jury found the taxpayer guilty of conspiracy to evade tax on appeal the taxpayer challenged the sufficiency of the evidence that he was willful he contended that he was not a tax professional and could not have been aware of the abusive nature of the trust arrangement the court of appeals concluded otherwise noting that the district court carefully recounted the evidence that showed acted willfully used a series of domestic and offshore entities to move money from the medical practice to several bank accounts from which received the benefit of the money without paying taxes on it received multiple warnings from that the was illegal yet did nothing until after files were subpoenaed from the record is replete with evidence to support the jury s finding that acted willfully conclusion as discussed supra the stakes can often be high when a taxpayer elects to establish a trust particularly if the taxpayer does not necessarily understand the tax ramifications of executing the operative trust agreement at a minimum taxpayers should consult with tax professionals to determine whether the trust arrangement will work as advertised by a third party drafter an oft quoted saying goes that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure that saying certainly applies here where the taxpayer risks significant legal fees back taxes penalties interest and potential criminal prosecution for failure to properly vet a trust prior to execution

from the phase 1 part 1a monotherapy dose escalation arm of the ongoing phase 1 2 trial of ngm707 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors at the european society for medical oncology immuno oncology esmo i o annual congress which is taking place december 7 9 2022 in geneva switzerland in the poster presentation titled first in human study of ngm707 an ilt2 ilt4 dual antagonist antibody in advanced or metastatic solid tumors preliminary monotherapy dose escalation data 174p ngm707 was generally well tolerated across all dose cohorts and demonstrated promising early signals of anti tumor activity of 24 response evaluable patients in the part 1a arm best overall responses as of november 23 2022 are partial response in one patient stable disease in six patients and non complete response non progressive disease in one patient six patients had reduced target lesion size including a maximum decrease in one patient of 70 a copy of the presentation presented at the esmo i o annual congress is available on ngm bio s website at the phase 1 portion of the ongoing ngm707 trial includes a monotherapy dose escalation arm part 1a and a dose finding arm in combination with pembrolizumab keytruda part 1b the phase 2 portion of the trial will include expansion cohorts of patients treated with ngm707 in combination with keytruda part 2b in several advanced solid tumor types the part 1a arm enrolled patients into escalating ngm707 dose cohorts 6 mg to 1800 mg administered intravenously every three weeks enrolled patients received a median of four prior lines of therapy and all had metastatic disease primary objectives in the phase 1 portion are to assess safety and tolerability of ngm707 and to identify phase 2 doses secondary exploratory objectives include assessment of pk biomarker correlation immunogenicity and preliminary antitumor activity per recist v1 1 as of a november 23 2022 data cut off 34 patients have been enrolled in the monotherapy dose escalation of 24 response evaluable patients those completing at least one on treatment scan best overall responses are partial response pr in one patient stable disease in six patients and non complete response non progressive disease in one patient six of the 24 response evaluable patients experienced target lesion reduction the patient experiencing the pr had a target lesion decrease of 70 along with a reduction and or elimination of non target lesions these responses were seen across five distinct tumor types preliminary evidence of potential myeloid reprogramming was observed in peripheral non classical monocytes as well as in tumor biopsies with reduction of the m2 macrophage marker cd163 observed post treatment treatment related adverse events traes occurred in 47 of patients with 9 of patients experiencing grade 3 traes one dose limiting toxicity of pneumonitis g5 in a patient with pulmonary metastasis was observed at ngm707 600 mg a maximum tolerated dose was

ngm707 in combination with keytruda ngm bio anticipates enrolling approximately 220 patients in the phase 1 2 trial of ngm707 ngm707 is designed to reprogram immune suppressive ilt4 and ilt2 expressing myeloid cells and ilt2 expressing lymphoid cells in the tumor microenvironment into immune stimulatory cells that will promote anti tumor activity we re pleased to present these initial data demonstrating a favorable tolerability profile for ngm707 as well as early yet promising signals that this mechanistic approach may translate to clinical benefit said dan kaplan ph d head of translational immuno oncology at ngm bio we re particularly encouraged to see clinical benefit in certain patients in response to monotherapy treatment with ngm707 and we look forward to evaluating ngm707 s potential effect when combined with t cell checkpoint inhibition in part 1b of the study which is now underway about ngm707 ilt2 and ilt4 inhibitory receptors with enriched expression on myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment are myeloid checkpoints that may enable certain tumors to evade immune detection thereby suppressing patients anti tumor responses ngm707 is being developed with the goal of improving patient immune response to tumors by inhibiting both ilt2 and ilt4 by inhibiting both ilt2 and ilt4 ngm707 may be able to overcome the potential redundant role the two receptors play where they are co expressed in myeloid cells and reprogram those cells to enhance t cell activity and proliferation in addition ilt2 blockade may drive further benefit through reducing suppression in certain lymphoid cells capable of directly attacking tumor cells about ngm bio s oncology portfolio ngm bio s currently disclosed oncology product candidates are all derived from the

those who survive severe and traumatic injuries are already forced to deal with physical and emotional turmoil but according to a new study conducted by the university of michigan the lasting impact on survivors financial health could also be damning this finding and more were discovered after researchers analyzed healthcare use data and credit reports from two groups of u s adults comprising a total of nearly five thousand and four hundred people both groups consisted of adults between the ages of eighteen and sixty five who were insured by the same kind of commercial provider but experienced major injuries in different years the first post injury group endured hospitalizations during 2019 and early 2020 meanwhile the second comparison group included people who suffered similar injuries but were hospitalized in 2021 meaning that their credit data was analyzed pre injury the average amount of time spent in the hospital among both groups was five days and this included at least one overnight stay in the intensive care unit for over thirty three percent of participants it was discovered that people who suffered from major injuries within the eighteen months prior to the study s financial snapshot were twenty three percent more likely to have medical debt go to collections these adults also had seventy percent more medical debt in collections as compared to people who suffered injuries following the financial inquiry additionally even though a low percentage of adults were forced to file for bankruptcy it was still twice as prevalent among people who were hospitalized for a severe injury over the last year and a half sign up for chip chick s newsletter and get stories like this delivered to your inbox

news that whole foods is finally bringing its grocery chain to montana could be taken a couple of ways first it s another example of montana consumers becoming increasingly accustomed to having the same options as larger more populated states like california but second one has to wonder if it s yet another retail nail in the coffin of the montana grocery store landscape with the old timey general store on one horizon and local supermarkets on the other and bozeman becomes the turning point some backstory i can recall as a little kid staying with my grandparents when they lived in manhattan and grandma would dispatch me to l f market downtown usually to get a loaf of bread or something similar it was a perfect adventure for a 6 year old in those days learning to cross the street walking by the scary meat counter taking careful track of the money and returning the straight 4 block shot home now i suspect she was just honing my shopping skills google today the l f still stands in the historic brick building downtown they even have a website with cool recipes for things like slow cooker cranberry glazed ham and i swear this is true a pigs in a blanket wreath try asking for that in the new whole foods get our free mobile app get our free mobile app a larger example of local is the famous lee and dad s store in belgrade my mom a belgrade girl recalls how everyone knew dad and the excitement when his son lee joined forces moving to a larger location lee and dad s was our go to store for everything with amazing customer service when we d run out of supplies in the middle of my uncle s gallatin valley steam show and threshing bee all it took was a call and a run to town in fact customer service was so good they learned to actually stock extra hot dogs for the event lee and dad s sold and became town and country in 2015 but is still the choice for longtime locals those are just two examples of how we ve bought our montana groceries for generations even the more organic options are already covered with great operations like missoula s good food store so is there room under the big sky for whole foods sure and one could argue more choices are better for consumers certainly the company s just walk out technology being tried at a handful of stores represents unusual innovation as does efforts to use remote ordering through parent company amazon and if you don t like whole foods there s always alaska and south dakota yet one has to wonder if whole foods arrival doesn t mark more than just store choice but the eventual loss of the kind of local choice that s made montana unique time will tell if that s the whole story in the meantime i think i ll put a dollar deep in my pocket and walk to the l f just to remember my grandma and the best of simple shopping

washington d c hearing aids can now be sold without prescriptions from a doctor in the u s making it easier and cheaper for many americans to improve their hearing in october over the counter hearing aids became available in the us with some costing thousands of dollars lower than prescription hearing aids according to the food and drug administration fda some 30 million americans are suffering from hearing loss but only about 20 percent of those who could use a hearing aid seek help the fda approved over the counter hearing aids for adults with mild to moderate hearing losses which could include those people who have trouble hearing phone calls or have to greatly increase their tv volumes as well as those who have trouble understanding group conversations in noisy locations such as restaurants and bars however it is still hard for people to gauge their own hearing losses so there is still an option to see a specialist just for a test which is often covered by insurance before buying hearing aids several major retailers offer over the counter hearing aids online and in stores such as walgreens drugstores which sells lexie lumen hearing aids nationwide for 799 walmart also offers hearing aids ranging from about 200 to 1 000 per pair and its health centers offer hearing test services catherine palmer a hearing expert at the university of pittsburgh said shoppers should expect a lot of devices to enter and leave the market it will be quite a while before this settles down she added as quoted by reuters most over the counter hearing aids cost between 500 and 1 500 for a pair though some can cost as much as 3 000 and may have to be replaced every five years

opinion after two decades of uninterrupted borrowing the national debt as a share of the economy is higher than at any time since world war ii a record that will be surpassed in just nine years debt is already 97 the size of the economy and will climb to a record 107 by 2031 and 185 by 2052 this assumes no new borrowing occurs and policies set to expire will sunset as scheduled more borrowing and policy extensions could ultimately push the national debt up to more than twice the size of the economy within three decades such a high national debt poses numerous risks and threats that policymakers must start to take seriously first and foremost the recent surge in borrowing has contributed to rapid near term inflation which is up 7 7 from one year ago over time our debt will result in higher interest rates slower economic and income growth and a heightened risk of a fiscal crisis we are seeing some of this now this year alone the national debt has grown by well over 1 trillion and the interest rate on 10 year bonds has increased from 1 5 at the end of 2021 to 3 7 today meanwhile the economy contracted by 1 6 and 0 6 respectively in the first and second quarters of 2022 a high national debt requires growing interest payments to service it which strains the federal budget the federal government already spends roughly 440 billion on interest payments for the national debt which is more than what it spends on veterans programs 2½ times its spending on federal civilian and military retirement and over 11 times its spending on science space and technology within a decade interest costs will more than triple and within three decades interest payments will be the single largest federal government program each dollar spent on interest is a dollar unavailable to spend on reducing taxes or other priorities debt also creates geopolitical challenges and risks and makes responding to emergencies more challenging governments and individuals in foreign countries hold about one third of our national debt which leaves us with less control over financial markets and fewer tools to leverage our holdings against other countries having some of our national debt held abroad means that a share of our national income and growth goes to those living in other countries instead of american households on the domestic front high debt will make it harder for us to respond to emergencies studies have found that countries that enter crises with high debt face both political and financial constraints to borrowing as a result those countries tend to do less to combat the crisis and end up recovering more slowly lastly high debt spurs further intergenerational imbalances the federal budget already skews heavily toward adults and seniors with the federal government spending roughly 6 per older adult for every 1 per child rising national debt will burden young and future generations with higher interest payments slower income growth and more financial responsibility to shoulder any tax or spending adjustments so what are some steps congress could take to tackle our debt first congress needs to fulfill its basic duty of passing a budget believe it or not the 5 9 trillion enterprise that is the united states currently operates without one in fact congress has not passed a real budget since 2015 comprehensive budget process reform is badly needed to end this chronic pattern of fiscal irresponsibility second we need to stop digging at a minimum congress should avoid making our debt situation worse that means not passing unnecessary spending bills that contribute to our debt crisis and strain programs vital to our seniors veterans and families congress should stick to pay as you go practices that promote fiscal responsibility when considering new legislation third we need to begin a process to address the growth of our mandatory programs currently mandatory programs make up nearly two thirds of the federal budget most of this spending operates on autopilot meaning its levels do not need to be negotiated and set annually through the appropriations process like the discretionary side of the budget does congress should pursue commonsense reforms that restore solvency to our major entitlement programs like social security and medicare a way to start would be by a bipartisan commission tasked with reaching a consensus on necessary spending and revenue adjustments to these programs which would thereafter receive fast track consideration in congress last we need to restore planned discretionary spending caps between fiscal years 2012 and 2021 discretionary spending levels were set based on the budget control act of 2011 and subsequently modified through several bipartisan budget acts fiscal 2022 marked the first year the caps were not in place which allowed congress to go on a spending free for all and pass a 1 5 trillion omnibus appropriations bill congress needs to take steps to reverse course and put our national debt on a stable long term reduction trajectory failure to do so will be catastrophic for our economy businesses families and communities republican congressman randy feenstra represents iowa s 4th congressional district maya macguineas is president of the committee for a responsible federal budget a washington based nonprofit focused on issues of fiscal responsibility

better inflation prints he said like many investors slimmon expects a downturn ahead given the inverted yield curve but does not anticipate the big earnings collapse or downturn many people are

february investors will have a lot to digest these next few days as they get a clearer picture of where we stand in the fight against inflation before the fed decision said mike loewengart at morgan stanley global investment office the market is largely expecting the slowdown in rate hikes to begin next week but whether the pivot will be enough to steer the economy into a soft landing remains the question strategists from morgan stanley to jpmorgan chase co have warned investors against piling back into risk on hopes the fed is getting close to pivoting to easier policy presumably if the fed is pivoting this time around it s not for a good reason it s a deteriorating fundamental picture joyce chang chair of global research at jpmorgan told bloomberg television i mean is that really a reason to be buying risk i think it s premature to say that there is a fed pivot investor optimism that inflation has peaked is misguided as a potential spike in energy costs in 2023 could keep prices elevated and interest rates high according to goldman sachs peter oppenheimer the bear market that mauled growth stocks this year now threatens the value stocks in the industrial financial and energy stocks where investors sought refuge this year according to morgan stanley s chief investment officer mike wilson the problem with the value stocks now is they re probably just as vulnerable to the

regularly surveys the lows are in and i think we are starting a new bull market paulsen said the fed is not the only policy driver in the room there are others and a lot of those have already started to ease besides the 100 day moving average the s p 500 is trading near a key support at 3 900 a level that has provided the pivot point for reversals on multiple occasions this year as the equity market rebounded the cboe volatility index fell to around 22 yet derivatives strategists at jpmorgan chase co say the vix has further room to advance they expect the fear gauge to average at 25 next year and see the gauge trading above that level in the first half of the year amid elevated monetary policy concern before subsiding below the line in the latter part of 2023 when the central bank is expected to pivot its stance heightened trader concern over an economic recession has recently pushed up the cboe equities put call ratio the relative trading volume of loss protecting contracts

over the next week kicks off a rally into the end of the year and potentially 2023 according to andrew slimmon morgan stanley investment management s senior portfolio manager the key period of data releases begins friday with the producer price index followed by november s consumer price index and another likely rate hike from the federal reserve next week the last time those were released they all led to rallies in the stock market because we had better inflation prints he said like many investors slimmon expects a downturn ahead given the inverted yield curve but does not anticipate the big earnings collapse or downturn many people are predicting in the first quarter this is in part due to the fact that many consumers have beefed up savings in recent years given the proximity of the

the world is going to need another 50 000 tonnes of tin per year by 2030 to meet a looming surge in demand according to the international tin association ita tin is an often overlooked critical mineral commonly associated with the humble tin can even though packaging today accounts for only 12 of global usage almost half the tin consumed every year is now used as a solder in circuit boards the faster the world moves towards the internet of things the more tin will be needed to glue the expanding metaverse together tin will also benefit from the green energy transition thanks to its use in solar panels and batteries both lead acid and lithium ion the additional production required to feed the coming demand boom is a big ask of a sector that currently produces around 380 000 tonnes per year of primary refined metal a recent history of extreme price volatility and growing resource nationalism in indonesia the world s largest tin exporter add to the challenge rollercoaster ride slows for now the ita estimates the tin production sector needs around 1 4 billion of investment to deliver 50 000 tonnes per year more tin by the end of the decade it s a relatively modest amount equivalent to around one medium sized copper mine but investors have in the past been wary of a market prone to extreme swings in price this year has been a particularly wild ride london metal exchange lme three month tin cmsn3 imploding from a record high of 51 000 per tonne in march to a two year low of 17 350 in november before bouncing to a current 24 430 tin s spin from boom to bust is in part down to covid 19 key producers in asia and south america were hit hard by lockdowns and quarantines output at the world s top 10 operators sliding by 13 over 2020 and 2021 demand simultaneously exploded as locked down populations splurged on consumer electronics to pass the time both drivers have gone into reverse this year producers lifting output just as demand for consumer goods abates tin users expect demand to contract by around 0 6 in 2022 after stellar growth of 7 6 last year according to the ita s annual survey the shift in fundamentals however has been sharply accentuated by speculative flows on both london and shanghai markets investment fund positioning on the lme swivelled from record long in march to record short in october equivalent to some 20 000 tonnes of net selling which is a lot in what is one of the exchange s less liquid contracts too much rather than too little liquidity is the problem in shanghai where volumes and market open interest surged as the price collapsed suggesting a mass bear attack the subsequent recovery rally has generated a lot of churn on the shanghai futures exchange shfe tin contract with volumes hitting a record monthly high of 3 98 million lots in november but market open interest also remains elevated at 98 474 contracts implying the bears are largely holding their ground tin moved onto the investment radar in china last year with a step change in activity on the shfe contract heightened speculative activity in what remains a small physical market comes with the potential for more price turbulence indonesian uncertainty indonesia s talk of banning exports of tin ingot injects significant fundamental uncertainty into the speculative mix the country exported 75 000 tonnes of refined tin last year with shipments running 8 higher through the first 10 months of this year it is the world s biggest supplier outside china the government wants to replicate its success in the nickel sector where a ban on exports of unprocessed ore generated a build out of value add processing capacity the key difference with tin however is that the indonesian authorities spent much of the last decade tightening export rules such that what leaves the country is already in high purity refined form a move further downstream requires more advanced technology to produce solder or tin chemicals state producer pt timah needs around two years to develop its existing tin chemical facility and longer to secure markets alwin albar chairman of the association of indonesian tin exporters told a parliamentary hearing no date for any ban or restrictions has yet been set as the government studies potential time lines but the threat of disruption is already impacting market dynamics with chinese buyers trying to get ahead of any change in export rules china imported 22 600 tonnes of refined tin in the first 10 months of the year with indonesian metal accounting for 19 000 tonnes that s more than china imported from indonesia over 2020 and 2021 combined higher imports have helped shanghai stocks rebuild to 4 708 tonnes from a meagre 1 260 at the start of 2022 but it s noticeable that lme inventory has started sliding again as indonesian metal gets diverted to china after peaking at 5 160 tonnes in september headline lme tin stocks have fallen to 3 075 tonnes with 535 tonnes awaiting physical load

translational immuno oncology at ngm bio we re particularly encouraged to see clinical benefit in certain patients in response to monotherapy treatment with ngm707 and we look forward to evaluating ngm707 s potential effect when combined with t cell checkpoint inhibition in part 1b of the study which is now underway about ngm707 ilt2 and ilt4 inhibitory receptors with enriched expression on myeloid cells in the tumor microenvironment are myeloid checkpoints that may enable certain tumors to evade immune detection thereby suppressing patients anti tumor responses ngm707 is being developed with the goal of improving patient immune response to tumors by inhibiting both ilt2 and ilt4 by inhibiting both ilt2 and ilt4 ngm707 may be able to overcome the potential redundant role the two receptors play where they are co expressed in myeloid cells and reprogram those cells to enhance t cell activity and proliferation in addition ilt2 blockade may drive further benefit through reducing suppression in certain lymphoid cells capable of directly attacking tumor cells about ngm bio s oncology portfolio ngm bio s currently disclosed oncology product candidates are all derived from the

news that whole foods is finally bringing its grocery chain to montana could be taken a couple of ways first it s another example of montana consumers becoming increasingly accustomed to having the same options as larger more populated states like california but second one has to wonder if it s yet another retail nail in the coffin of the montana grocery store landscape with the old timey general store on one horizon and local supermarkets on the other and bozeman becomes the turning point some backstory i can recall as a little kid staying with my grandparents when they lived in manhattan and grandma would dispatch me to l f market downtown usually to get a loaf of bread or something similar it was a perfect adventure for a 6 year old in those days learning to cross the street walking by the scary meat counter taking careful track of the money and returning the straight 4 block shot home now i suspect she was just honing my shopping skills google today the l f still stands in the historic brick building downtown they even have a website with cool recipes for things like slow cooker cranberry glazed ham and i swear this is true a pigs in a blanket wreath try asking for that in the new whole foods get our free mobile app get our free mobile app a larger example of local is the famous lee and dad s store in belgrade my mom a belgrade girl recalls how everyone knew dad and the excitement when his son lee joined forces moving to a larger location lee and dad s was our go to store for everything with amazing customer service when we d run out of supplies in the middle of my uncle s gallatin valley steam show and threshing bee all it took was a call and a run to town in fact customer service was so good they learned to actually stock extra hot dogs for the event lee and dad s sold and became town and country in 2015 but is still the choice for longtime locals those are just two examples of how we ve bought our montana groceries for generations even the more organic options are already covered with great operations like missoula s good food store so is there room under the big sky for whole foods sure and one could argue more choices are better for consumers certainly the company s just walk out technology being tried at a handful of stores represents unusual innovation as does efforts to use remote ordering through parent company amazon and if you don t like whole foods there s always alaska and south dakota yet one has to wonder if whole foods arrival doesn t mark more than just store choice but the eventual loss of the kind of local choice that s made montana unique time will tell if that s the whole story in the meantime i think i ll put a dollar deep in my pocket and walk to the l f just to remember my grandma and the best of simple shopping

percentage of revenues we prepare and release quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial information used to evaluate our performance in this and other earnings releases and investor conference calls as a complement to results provided in accordance with gaap we believe that current shareholders and potential investors in our company use non gaap financial measures such as adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues in making investment decisions about our company and measuring our operational results the term â œadjusted ebitdaâ refers to a financial measure that we define as earnings before certain charges that management considers to be non operating expenses and which consist of interest taxes depreciation amortization stock based compensation for which we include related fees and taxes and other charges for which we include restructuring charges and acquisition related expenses adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues divides adjusted ebitda for a period by the revenues for the corresponding period and expresses the quotient as a percentage management considers these non operating expenses to be outside the scope of descartesâ ongoing operations and the related expenses are not used by management to measure operations accordingly these expenses are excluded from adjusted ebitda which we reference to both measure our operations and as a basis of comparison of our operations from period to period management believes that investors and financial analysts measure our business on the same basis and we are providing the adjusted ebitda financial metric to assist in this evaluation and to provide a higher level of transparency into how we measure our own business however adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues are non gaap financial measures and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with gaap or other non gaap measures that may be used by other companies such as ebitda the use of adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda as a percentage of revenues does have limitations in particular we have completed six acquisitions since the beginning of fiscal 2022 and may complete additional acquisitions in the future that will result in acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges as these acquisition related expenses and restructuring charges may continue as we pursue our consolidation strategy some investors may consider these charges and expenses as a recurring part of operations

the stock market is not pricing in the possibility of the federal reserve raising interest rates to a very harmful level and could be in store for a sharp correction in 2023 according to billionaire investor ray dalio the bridgewater associates founder said wednesday that inflation could settle somewhere around 4 or 5 well above the fed s preferred target of 2 should that happen he warned that the u s central bank will have to raise interest rates to a range approaching 6 the federal reserve will put the short term rate up towards that level which is very harmful very damaging to the economy dalio said during an interview with business today he added but what the federal reserve is trying to do is balance those having an interest rate that s high enough for the creditor but not so high for the debtor and so what you re going to see is a slowing of the pace of the rise but still approaching over 5 probably in the vicinity of 5 5 this will still have an effect on all markets particularly stocks s p 500 could plunge 20 in coming months as recession hits bofa warns the s p 500 has already plunged more than 4 this week as concerns over sky high inflation rising interest rates and a darkening economic outlook continue to weigh on the market the dow jones industrial average meanwhile is down almost 1 000 points while the tech heavy nasdaq composite has tumbled about 5 ticker security last change change i dji dow jones averages 37798 97 63 86 0 17 i comp nasdaq composite index 15865 251278 19 77 0 12 sp500 s p 500 5051 41 10 41 0 21 dalio previously warned that higher interest rates could trigger a 20 decline in equity prices based on the present value discount effect in addition there would be another 10 negative impact from declining incomes he said in september the fed has embarked on the most aggressive tightening campaign since the 1980s as it tries to wrestle under control inflation that s still running near a 40 year high the current benchmark federal funds range of 3 75 to 4 is well into restrictive territory and the fed has shown no signs of pausing as inflation remains abnormally high fed s powell signals smaller interest rate hikes could begin in december although policymakers indicated a preference for a smaller 50 basis point rate hike at their meeting next week they have also signaled an appetite for a higher peak interest rate that could further restrict economic activity fed chairman jerome powell said rates are likely to reach a somewhat higher level than policymakers initially forecast in september when they projected a median rate of 4 6 in 2023 click here to read more on fox business the time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the december meeting powell said during a speech in washington last month given our progress in tightening policy the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level

back in january 109 container ships waited off the california coast to unload cargo in los angeles and long beach the nation s two largest ports consumers stuck at home amid the pandemic had unleashed an avalanche of orders for goods that overwhelmed factories and ports importers were paying 20 000 to send a single container from china to the united states sometimes more than the goods inside were worth businesses had to backorder everything from bedroom furniture to kitchen fryers if they could get them at all these days no freighters are lingering off the southern california coast containers from china go for just 2 000 restaurants can order fryers and have them delivered in a couple of weeks the supply backlogs of the past two years and the delays shortages and outrageous prices that came with them have improved dramatically since summer the web of factories railroads ports warehouses and freight yards that link goods to customers have nearly regained their pre pandemic levels we are in a very different place than we were said phil levy chief economist at the supply chain consultancy flexport if you ask how long does it take to move stuff there has been notable improvement if you measure it by how long would it take to get a cargo from asia to a destination port dramatically better the easing of supply bottlenecks has begun to provide some relief from the inflation that this year reached a four decade peak pummeling consumers and businesses the progress has been modest and so far short lived yet it s still provided a glimmer of good news in the holiday shopping season gift items are much likelier to be in stock perhaps at lower prices the government s latest inflation report showed that prices of toys jewelry and girls apparel all fell in october overall the shelves are full said zvi schreiber ceo of freightos group a digital platform that books international shipping we re not seeing significant shortages of items supply chains are really not the problem anymore agreed timothy fiore who leads the institute for supply management s manufacturing survey and is chief procurement officer at the transportation firm ryder system we ve had four or five months of supplies looking better prices have dropped too the main factor behind the improvement has been diminished demand for manufactured goods spending on goods has fallen for three straight quarters according to the commerce department higher borrowing rates engineered by the federal reserve to try to tame inflation have reduced americans willingness to buy more physical things inflation itself has sapped their spending power and having splurged on everything from lawn furniture and sporting goods to appliances and electronic gear during the covid shutdowns consumers have increasingly shown a desire to venture out and spend on experiences rather than goods demand has shifted toward services restaurant dinners and plane tickets hotel rooms and entertainment as orders for manufactured goods have slowed so have the price pressures surrounding them at the sprawling southern california ports the shipping backup has eased in part because companies have sent cargo to gulf coast and atlantic ports to avoid delays port houston says its cargo volume is up 18 from this time last year an index that measures demand for freight shipments had hit a high of 115 earlier this year now it s below the five year average of 53 we re returning to the mean and the trend lines that existed pre covid said chris adderton senior vice president for the council of supply chain management professionals in addition to the reduced demand that has lightened the strain on supply chains ports have become more efficient additional ships have increased the transportation options and in some industries new producers stepped in once established manufacturers became too overwhelmed to deliver the enhanced competition reduced shortages and helped moderate prices in the market for kitchen equipment for instance new manufacturers were able to break into the business unheard of manufacturers said kirby mallon president of philadelphia based elmer schultz services which maintains kitchen equipment for restaurants and cafeterias when inflation first began surging last year economists had mostly blamed the snarled supply chains fed chair jerome powell echoing the views of many analysts predicted that soaring prices would prove transitory and would ease once it became easier and cheaper to ship products things didn t prove so simple especially after russia invaded ukraine in february disrupting trade in energy and grains and sending oil gas and food prices soaring around the world other problems remain too a chronic shortage of computer chips for example will likely hamper auto production into 2024 kristin dziczek an auto policy adviser at the federal reserve bank of chicago wrote in a recent paper though the shortage has eased slightly factories remain slowed by a lack of chips the average price of a new vehicle is still near a record high nearly 46 000 and isn t expected to fall much if at all anytime soon used vehicle prices by contrast have dropped since late summer analysts expect them to fall further though not to pre pandemic lows automakers are still struggling to acquire enough chips largely because the number of semiconductors required per vehicle has multiplied that is a consequence of more sophisticated auto equipment from automated safety systems and internet connections to infotainment dziczek wrote what s more computer chips used for vehicle production are harder to manufacture than chips for consumer electronics because they must be built to withstand heat cold and vibration the coronavirus lockdowns in china along with the scattered public protests against them may still disrupt global production and shipping the consultancy resilinc has identified 13 800 chinese sites from factories to warehouses to testing facilities that are at risk from protests rising covid cases and lockdowns potential problem spots exist in such key cities as beijing chengdu nanjing and shanghai parts from these regions make their way into just about every product our lives rely on day to day said bindiya vakil ceo of resilinc on wednesday in a move that offered potential relief from its draconian zero covid policies china rolled back restrictions on isolating people with the virus the move will boost hopes that beijing is scrapping its zero covid strategy which could give a lift to manufacturing and global trade julian di giovanni an economist at the federal reserve bank of new york has estimated that supply problems accounted for about 40 of u s inflation from 2019 through 2021 in the absence of any new energy or other shock he said in august it is therefore possible that the ongoing easing of supply chain bottlenecks will cause a substantial drop in inflation in the near term inflation has eased from the dizzy heights it reached earlier this year as measured by the labor department consumer prices rose 7 7 in october from 12 months earlier though painfully high that was the lowest year over year inflation since january and well below the recent peak of 9 1 in june a separate government inflation gauge that is favored by the federal reserve rose 6 in october from a year earlier that was the mildest increase since november 2021 the fed wants to see annual inflation at 2 there s still a long way to go and flexport s levy cautions that inflation has spread from goods which the fed can partly control through its influence over loan rates to services which are more resistant to borrowing rates there s also the risk that americans expect future high inflation and will behave in ways that can make their worries self fulfilling they could spend more now to avoid what they expect will be higher prices later and demand bigger wage gains to compensate for a higher cost of living all of that tends to fuel inflation pressures once you get this stuff built in once it sticks around for a while and everybody starts thinking about inflation as a 5 to 6 kind of thing getting that back to 2 is tough levy said for now though businesses find themselves facing a new problem a consequence of reduced demand for goods rather than lacking enough products in stock to give customers what they want they now often have too many the inventory has arrived warehouses are full and we re scrambling to move the merchandise said thomas goldsby logistics chairman in the supply chain management department at the university of tennessee some retailers like target ordered too much too fast and had to cut prices to draw consumers who were tightening their budgets in response to inflation target s third quarter profit fell 52 ceo brian cornell told analysts that consumers were shopping very carefully on a budget i think they are looking at discretionary categories and saying all right if i m going to buy i m looking for a great deal we re not in a position where suppliers have a ton of power and the buyers just have to accept whatever they get said fiore of ism that s definitely been shifting since september is this a good time for buyers absolutely is it a good time for companies overall not so clear ____ krisher reported from detroit wiseman from washington

store sales comparisons ulta expects an increase in a range between 12 6 and 13 2 that s up from previous guidance calling for growth between 9 5 and 10 5 growth due to newness in the earnings conference call ceo dave kimbell said higher prices contributed to the strong results but he attributed most of the gain to growth from our core assortment and newness historically sales of new products have averaged 20 to 30 of our sales and the overall mix of newness this year has been in line with our historical experience he added that the categories of skincare fragrance and bath hair care and makeup all delivered double digit comp growth against the year earlier quarter skincare was the fastest growing category with science backed and dermatologist recommended products among strong sellers the business is continuing to evolve to include younger and more diverse brand founders the wellness category is also growing part of an initiative to appeal to gen z consumers in addition to its in store sales the company s other revenue sources include salons inside its stores and online sales despite investors cheer about the company s report and its optimism about the current quarter potential investors should be cautious about some details for example revenue growth has been in the strong double digits in the past seven quarters however growth rates have slowed from 65 in the quarter that ended in april 2021 to 17 in the two most recent quarters earnings growth too has slowed here year over year net income was increasing at triple digit rates in mid 2021 those levels are now down to the double digits with growth coming in at 2 but steadily decelerated from 519 in the quarter ended in july 2021 to 26 and 35 in the two most recent quarters in the

the holiday season is in full flow and our teams are executing well kimbell said while predicting holiday shopping patterns this year is challenging i am optimistic about the opportunity for ulta beauty this holiday season he added even as consumers continue to navigate economic headwinds we believe the beauty category will remain resilient and we are confident that our differentiated model and growth strategy combined with our outstanding associates will continue to position ulta beauty as the preferred beauty destination ulta rallied to a high of 477 92 on friday and is down slightly since then as the broader market pulled back on monday and tuesday the stock found support at its 10 day moving average tuesday before ending the season at 465 58 down 6 94 or 1 47 with a market capitalization of 23 85 billion ulta easily qualifies as a large cap and is a component of the s p 500 the stock has outperformed its index by a wide margin in 2022 with a year to date return of 14 59 vs the index s 16 24 decline ulta s support at its 10 day average bodes well and may mean the stock is a viable watchlist candidate however as with any potential purchase always understand how it may

industry conditions in colombia and ecuador and the ability of gran tierra to execute its business and operational plans in the manner currently planned among the important factors that could cause

arise due to guerilla activity or local blockades strikes or protests technical difficulties and operational difficulties may arise which impact the production transport or sale of our products other disruptions to local operations global health events including the ongoing covid 19 pandemic global and regional changes in the demand supply prices differentials or other market conditions affecting

other producing countries and the resulting company or third party actions in response to such changes changes in commodity prices including volatility or a decline in these prices relative to historical or future expected levels the risk that current global economic and credit conditions may impact oil prices and oil consumption more than gran tierra currently predicts which could cause gran tierra to further modify its strategy and capital spending program prices and markets for oil and natural gas are unpredictable and volatile the accuracy of productive capacity of any particular field geographic political and weather conditions can impact the production transport or sale of our products the ability of gran tierra to execute its business plan and realize expected benefits from

assumptions made by gran tierra based on management s experience and other factors believed to be appropriate gran tierra believes these assumptions to be reasonable at this time but the forward looking statements are subject to risk and uncertainties many of which are beyond gran tierra s control which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the

a spokesperson for florida gov ron desantis s office is standing by his statement that disney will pay its debts my statement stands executive press secretary to desantis bryan griffin told the epoch times by email yes it is our position that disney will pay its debts the reiteration was in response to an inquiry by the epoch times regarding his previous statement that the governor was right to champion removing the extraordinary benefit given to one company through the reedy creek improvement district as as previously reported by the epoch times in april desantis floated the possibility that state lawmakers might repeal the 1967 reedy creek improvement act in response to disney s opposition to his parental rights in education law dubbed by liberal opponents as the don t say gay bill the statement comes after reports suggest that florida lawmakers are reviewing ways to restore some of the privileges stripped from walt disney co with the signing of new legislation to repeal a long standing measure that provided disney with special perks not enjoyed by any other business in the sunshine state the 1967 reedy creek improvement district rcid drafted by the florida legislature in cooperation with walt disney world and signed into law by republican gov claude kirk effectively created two municipal style governments bay creek and reedy creek to regulate the lake buena vista land where the walt disney world resort operates through the rcid disney is allowed to operate its own fire protection security services utilities and planning its board of supervisors is selected by landowners surrounding the 38 5 square mile property effectively allowing disney to operate as its own government if the rcid is repealed disney s property would suddenly be under the complete authority of orange and osceola counties after facing pressure from lgbtq communities and staff for his silence on the issue former disney ceo bob chapek issued a march 11 statement to his employees apologizing for not being a stronger ally to them saying the governor s parental rights in education proposal would represent yet another challenge to basic human rights chapek also vowed that disney would immediately halt all political donations in florida on march 30 state rep spencer roach a republican revealed through social media that lawmakers had already met twice to discuss that if disney wants to embrace woke ideology it seems fitting that they should be regulated by orange county in a subsequent demonstration of solidarity disney corporation issued a march 28 statement vowing that its new goal was for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts promising to support organizations working to make such a thing happen in a march 29 post on social media desantis quickly reminded disney that florida is governed by the interests of the people of the state of florida it is not based on the demands of california corporate executives in a subsequent april report by the epoch times polling at the time showed that the overwhelming majority of florida s primary voters including a significant majority of democrats strongly supported the legislation the hashtag boycottdisney was trending on social media and one of the largest mothers advocacy organizations in the united states moms for liberty warned disney of the pushback it would face if it did not stop lobbying against parental rights protected by florida s laws disney cast members in support of parental rights were speaking out saying they were ashamed to work for the company and guests wore homemade t shirts saying walt not woke in protest of the announcement in march by disney parks diversity and inclusion manager vivian ware that disney had removed all of the gendered greetings like ladies and gentlemen boys and girls dan geffers poses for a photo with daughters lila left aged 13 and bryn age 11 on the right in front of cinderella s castle at disney s magic kingdom in orlando florida wearing a handmade t shirt to express his feelings on the direction the company has decided to go in courtesy of dan geffers ceo bob chapek needs to be removed roach asserted on social media on april 3 a man obsessed with sexualizing 4 year olds should not run a company that built its brand on preserving the innocence magic of childhood i think disney leadership is well aware they have stepped in quicksand and made a drastic unforced error roach told the epoch times in april i think they are aware of how badly they ve messed up here and the only way they can get to détente on this is bob chapek is going to have to go i think his days are numbered and he s going to be out as ceo in very short order whoever comes in is going to have to publicly acknowledge to some extent that disney is not going to be held hostage by a small number of employees who think they can dictate disney s political stance and if some employees don t like that they are going to have to leave the bill senate 4c was introduced in both the florida house and senate on april 19 the senate passed the bill on april 20 followed by the florida house on april 21 desantis signed the measure into law during an april 22 news conference at a school in hialeah gardens in a nov 11 staff memo chapek prepared disney staff for severe consequences after the entertainment giant admitted that it lost a 1 5 billion loss in the last quarter i m fully aware this will be a difficult process for many of you and your teams we are going to have to make tough and uncomfortable decisions those decisions would include a hiring freeze and some staff reductions in a nov 20 press release the walt disney company board of directors announced that robert a iger would be returning to lead disney as chief executive officer effective immediately the announcement was made after disney stock dove 38 percent for the year the decision triggers a clause in chapek s contract called terminate without cause valued at 44 million in connection with his termination mr chapek will receive the separation benefits payable in accordance with the terms of his previously disclosed employment agreement disney stated in a regulatory filing the payout is said to be in cash stock options and equity in the company the sponsor of the law eliminating disney s florida perks state rep randy fine said he s encouraged by chapek s removal the sponsor of the law eliminating disney s florida perks state rep randy fine said he s encouraged by chapek s removal disney executive chairman bob iger attends the exclusive 100 minute sneak peek of peter jackson s the beatles get back at el capitan theatre in hollywood calif on nov 18 2021 charley gallay getty images for disney i think mr iger has already said it probably was a misstep on the company s part and how they handled it fine said in an interview i don t think we d be in this situation if bob iger had been ceo it is the return of iger that has inspired florida legislators to consider reducing the restrictions imposed by the legislation enacted in retaliation for chapek s opposition to florida s laws without going as far as ending them all
photography by getty images demna addresses the balenciaga scandal in an interview with vogue balenciaga was accused of sexualizing children in two controversial ad campaigns and the backlash has been swift here s everything to know this article was originally published on november 23 2022 and has been updated below fashion outlines the developments that have taken place since the initial backlash latest update on february 9 balenciaga creative director demna spoke about the controversy in an exclusive interview with vogue in the interview he says that while he approved the set dressing prior to the spring 2023 campaign which was meant to reference the wall street location where that season s runway show was held he wasn t on site for the shoot itself i saw the example of how the offices could look approved what type of furniture they would use and what kind of poses the models would do since i am never on shoots images were presented to me to select the photos i liked most out of the selection made by the photographer said demna in regards to the gift shop campaign which demna says was unrelated to the spring 2023 campaign the designer said the plush teddy bear bags punk and diy culture absolutely not bdsm and they were worn by adults in the october 2022 show regardless of how the toys ended up in the shots the creative director seemingly acknowledge his error in judgment chalking it up to negligence saying i didn t realize how inappropriate it would be to put these objects and still have the kid in the middle it unfortunately was the wrong idea and a bad decision from me we should not have featured kids in images that included objects that were not related and inappropriate to them no one myself included raised a question of it being inappropriate there were control processes in place people involved internal and external but we just did not spot what was problematic this was an error of judgment i regret this a lot he continued with an apology we learned from this now and there are going to be closer and more attentive checks and validation steps applied before any image goes out for this i want to say i am sorry i sincerely apologize for what happened and to anyone who has been hurt by it demna also said that while he knows much of his work has been seen as deliberately provocative it wasn t his intention in balenciaga these campaigns i realize that my work has been seen as provocative but this specific situation would never be part of my you know provocative nature that was the most difficult thing for me personally how could i not see because it is so clear to me now that it was the wrong thing to do in fact the designer got defensive when asked by vogue if the problematic props were intentional intentional from who from us what i can definitely say is that it was not intentional by me or balenciaga if it was intentional by someone else i don t know adding that the document props in the spring 2023 shoot were a shock to him i don t know how they ended up there they were not supposed to be there i was completely stunned ultimately demna seemingly recognizes at least some level of responsibility in the scandal and seeks to make it clear that the campaigns were not intentionally problematic with the goal of being provocative despite what many people may have suspected the issue with the campaigns was absolutely not in any way part of my provocative design language never ever would i have an idea to mess around with such an awful and horrible thing as child abuse december 2 creative director demna addressed the controversial campaigns with a written statement posted to his instagram account i want to personally apologize for the wrong artistic choice of concept for the gifting campaign with the kids and i take my responsibility he wrote it was inappropriate to have kids promote objects that had nothing to do with them he added that though he strives to create thought provoking work it was never his intention to do that with such an awful subject as child abuse the designer said he needs to learn from this and noted balenciaga s commitment to taking steps not only to avoid similar mistakes in the future but also to take accountability in protecting child welfare in every way we can december 2 balenciaga took to instagram to announce that the brand will be dropping its 25 million lawsuit vogue notes the decision to no longer pursue litigation comes after widespread industry support towards north six and des jardins the statement reiterated balenciaga s apology writing in part we want to learn help and contribute to protect children november 28 balenciaga released another statement on instagram taking full responsibility for the holiday campaign and sharing details about the lawsuit for the spring 2023 campaign all the items included in this shooting were provided by third parties that confirmed in writing that these props were fake office documents the statement read they turned out to be real legal papers it continued the inclusion of these unapproved documents was the result of reckless negligence for which balenciaga has filed a complaint the brand finished by listing an internal action plan including laying the groundwork with organizations who specialize in child protection and child abuse and exploitation november 27 kim kardashian shared her thoughts on balenciaga s controversial campaign on instagram stories writing in part i have been quiet for the past few days not because i haven t been disgusted and outraged by the recent balenciaga campaigns but because i wanted an opportunity to speak to their team to understand for myself how this could have happened the skims founder and mother of four went on to say that she was shaken by the campaign s disturbing images and continued the safety of children must be held with the highest regard and any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society period kardashian concluded by saying that while she believed the balenciaga team understood the gravity of the situation her future with the brand was unclear i am currently re evaluating my relationship with the brand basing it off their willingness to accept accountability for something that should have never happened to begin with she wrote november 25 balenciaga initiated a 25 million lawsuit regarding the spring 2023 advertisement which features paperwork from a supreme court decision on child pornography laws the complaint which was filed by balenciaga to the new york state supreme court reportedly details legal action against north six the production company for the shoot and nicholas des jardins the set designer for the shoot according to the new york times the document claims that north six and des jardins actions were inexplicable adding that their omissions were malevolent or at the very least extraordinarily reckless in response a representative for des jardins told the washington post that the set designer is being used as a scapegoat fashion s original article about the balenciaga scandal appears below courting controversy is arguably what balenciaga does best in recent years creative director demna has built a reputation for stealing the world s attention time after time with weird unconventional and often downright startling marketing and so far it s proven to be a pretty successful publicity strategy but as viral backlash from balenciaga s latest campaigns intensifies it appears this time the brand has crossed the line on november 16 the label released a gifting campaign shot by renowned photographer gabriele galimberti which was meant to promote items on par with balenciaga s randomness like studded dog bowls and candle holders shaped like beer cans the accompanying photos however were received as anything but amusing in the images children are seen holding stuffed bears dressed in bondage gear like collars with locks leather harnesses and fishnets if that perceived implication of child sexualization wasn t enough a set of explicit props in another advertisement felt even more disturbing in one photo from their spring 2023 campaign released just five days later a handbag is perched on a pile of paper which reportedly includes documents referencing a u s supreme court case about child pornography the brand balenciaga just did a uh interesting photoshoot for their new products recently which included a very purposely poorly hidden court document about virtual child porn normal stuff pic twitter com zjmn5whz0s shoe shoe0nhead november 21 2022 the troubling visuals have proved to be one of balenciaga s biggest controversies in years with calls to cancel the brand growing on social media and instead of embracing conflict as they regularly would the fashion house has moved to damage control after removing the images from all platforms balenciaga took to instagram stories on november 22 to formally address the backlash we sincerely apologize for any offense our holiday campaign may have caused the statement read our plush bear bags should not have been featured with children in this campaign the fashion house went on to apologize for the unsettling documents in question we take this matter very seriously and are taking legal action against the parties responsible for creating the set and including unapproved items for our spring 23 campaign photoshoot the balenciaga statement continued we strongly condemn abuse of children in any form we stand for children safety and well being if balenciaga took this matter so seriously they never would ve published that campaign or come up with the concept in the first place pic twitter com 2lb3yge0xl tori voguepearls november 22 2022 but despite pulling the campaign and apologizing the world is not exactly ready to forgive and forget in fact the newly released statements have arguably sparked more outrage some criticize the brand for deflecting responsibility while others suggest the entire debacle is yet another outrage marketing scheme do they think we re stupid wrote fashion influencer louis pisano that campaign went people including demna before it went out and here they are trying to scapegoat the parties responsible as fallout grows the prevailing response is more of a question could this really be an accident after all balenciaga thrives off of carefully crafted chaos the brand hosts fashion shows in unconventional environments like simulated snow storms mud pits and the new york stock exchange it has collaborated with entities like the simpsons and fortnite while enlisting unexpected celebs for catwalk cameos it regularly releases absurd designs from destroyed sneakers to trash bag totes in recent years balenciaga s meme worthy style has become so unpredictable that theories suggest the fashion house is in and of itself a social experiment through it all demna has been known to weave deeper meaning and critical commentary into each of his astonishing antics all things considered some feel it s hard to believe a misstep like this is just an oversight tiktok fashion commentator jasmine darya jasminedarya argues the balenciaga holiday campaign is not an ignorant mistake but a result of the brand s quest for clickbait i feel like in the last few couple of years they ve really gone towards this anything to get a headline mentality she said in a recent video when you start relying on headlines and cheap publicity to sell your clothes as a fashion brand that s when you re too far gone she wrote in the caption but even with this problematic promotional look is balenciaga actually cancellable is any brand balenciaga is very much cancelled in my eyes i don t care what explanation they come up with don t mess with children gia virgoessence november 22 2022 the thing is in the world of fashion social media outrage is reliably short lived take dolce gabbana despite having a track record of blatant misogyny racism and homophobia the italian label has remained relatively unscathed with seemingly unconditional support by a list celebrities like the kar jenners and as chance would have it balenciaga too has star power on its side after reliably repping it over the past year kim kardashian has basically become synonymous with the label despite calls for her to condemn this campaign at the time of publishing the beauty and shapewear mogul has stayed notably silent on the scandal which is a statement in and of itself we may never know whether the campaign was an intentional scheme or a tone deaf blunder but does the answer really matter despite how murky the ethics may be it seems shock factor never goes out of style with files from jennifer berry

than or equal to 0 1 g t au true widths unknown some composited intervals may contain individual assays less than 0 1 g t au for continuity calculated average arsenic level contains some individual assays of 10 000 ppm the maximum detection limit used by the assay lab hence actual arsenic levels in this interval may be higher than shown phase 1 of the program delivered anomalous gold intercepts with the highest returned assay value of 1 515 g t au over 0 2 meters this interval also included 43 1 ppm ag 2 530 ppm cu and 472 ppm zn the longest mineralized intercept based on a cut off grade of 0 1 g t gold was 0 167 g t gold over 3 9 meters elevated arsenic values up to the upper limit 10 000 ppm were observed in some intervals typically associated with elevated gold values showed a relationship between gold and arsenopyrite less spatially related anomalous values of copper zinc cobalt and nickel were returned results of the analysis of historic glacial till drilling and sampling sampling of glacial till was used historically and helped to lead to the discovery of the casa berardi mine to the north of casa south reverse circulation drilling was done in the glacial till and typically a few meters into bedrock samples were taken and screened to collect heavy minerals including gold arsenic copper zinc and silver the lithologic units over various till layers were also determined the goal was to identify soil anomalies in the till that could potentially be traced back to mineralized bedrock targets based on till movement over time mercator computerized and remodeled historic till sampling data from paper cross sections using leapfrog geo software data was taken from an assessment report completed by odm for cambior inc in 1989 gm 49285 from this analysis mercator has identified 14 soil anomalies m1 14 for follow up some of these 14 soil anomalies overlap or are near the 20 structural and aeromagnetic targets identified by geokincern in 2021 mercator has made recommendations for prioritization and further follow up on the remaining 15 geokincern exploration targets and the new 14 till anomaly targets qaqc program technominex inc technominex was contracted by mercator for core sampling cutting services logging sampling and assaying procedures were completed by mercator and technominex personnel as per emergent s qa qc protocols and full chain of custody was maintained from the drill site to the core shack and subsequently from the core shack to technominex and als facilities drill core was descriptively logged on site aligned marked for sampling and

news that whole foods is finally bringing its grocery chain to montana could be taken a couple of ways first it s another example of montana consumers becoming increasingly accustomed to having the same options as larger more populated states like california but second one has to wonder if it s yet another retail nail in the coffin of the montana grocery store landscape with the old timey general store on one horizon and local supermarkets on the other and bozeman becomes the turning point some backstory i can recall as a little kid staying with my grandparents when they lived in manhattan and grandma would dispatch me to l f market downtown usually to get a loaf of bread or something similar it was a perfect adventure for a 6 year old in those days learning to cross the street walking by the scary meat counter taking careful track of the money and returning the straight 4 block shot home now i suspect she was just honing my shopping skills google today the l f still stands in the historic brick building downtown they even have a website with cool recipes for things like slow cooker cranberry glazed ham and i swear this is true a pigs in a blanket wreath try asking for that in the new whole foods get our free mobile app get our free mobile app a larger example of local is the famous lee and dad s store in belgrade my mom a belgrade girl recalls how everyone knew dad and the excitement when his son lee joined forces moving to a larger location lee and dad s was our go to store for everything with amazing customer service when we d run out of supplies in the middle of my uncle s gallatin valley steam show and threshing bee all it took was a call and a run to town in fact customer service was so good they learned to actually stock extra hot dogs for the event lee and dad s sold and became town and country in 2015 but is still the choice for longtime locals those are just two examples of how we ve bought our montana groceries for generations even the more organic options are already covered with great operations like missoula s good food store so is there room under the big sky for whole foods sure and one could argue more choices are better for consumers certainly the company s just walk out technology being tried at a handful of stores represents unusual innovation as does efforts to use remote ordering through parent company amazon and if you don t like whole foods there s always alaska and south dakota yet one has to wonder if whole foods arrival doesn t mark more than just store choice but the eventual loss of the kind of local choice that s made montana unique time will tell if that s the whole story in the meantime i think i ll put a dollar deep in my pocket and walk to the l f just to remember my grandma and the best of simple shopping

kalita they also stressed that it was still very much an idea and not a complete design this is the master plan stage so it looks like design but these are suggestive more than actual design said rice who is with lead architecture firm diller scofidio renfro the plan reflects a balancing act acknowledging the work and intent of its original world renowned architect while also recognizing that things are different than they were in 1955 when the dallas theater center approached wright to design the theater wright adapted one of his theater designs for the project when it was finished in 1959 it was one of his final completed buildings he died before it was completed in the following years the dtc staged award winning productions in that theater and over time added more buildings in 1973 the kalita was donated to the city which in turn leased it back to the dallas theater center the two plots of land surrounding the theater were also purchased around that time saving the theater from becoming flanked by two high rise buildings that land was turned into the william b dean park eventually the theater fell into disrepair as responsibility for its upkeep fell to several entities at once including the city s park and recreation department and the dtc the city in 2010 hired the architect ann abernathy to complete a master plan for rehabbing the aging structure the city didn t really have any specific thing they envisioned for the future dtc executive director kevin moriarty said of the 2010 plan the city staff didn t bring it forward to the council and the council never voted on it so it was never adopted and it sat dormant for a long time by 2019 it became clear that something needed to be done there had been no major capital investments into the property since 1989 the city approached its primary tenant the dtc and offered this deal a new lease and in exchange the theater would assemble a team to create a master plan for the theater and dean park the city didn t have resources to fund the master plan so they put into our lease that we should create a master plan using private money moriarty said we raised 2 million to fund the master plan all of which is philanthropic by 2020 the dtc had chosen diller scofidio renfro to lead the project they ve held a series of public meetings to explain the plan and get feedback and will hold a meeting tonight at the kalita humphreys theater campus from 5 30 p m to 7 p m a final master plan is expected to be delivered to the city by the end of the month judging from the portion of the plan presented to the landmark commission which focused primarily on the historical preservation aspect the new master plan is ambitious and also mindful of wright s intent the goal is to open up the site and make it accessible and welcoming for all of dallas so that people truly can encounter the frank lloyd wright building which is literally unique in the world of theater moriarty said and then there s the topography of the site it is very unique in dallas to have public access to the natural features of the site and then to have the activity of the katy trail right there and then the beauty of turtle creek the theater s additions will be removed and architects pored over photos and drawings to ensure that the plan would bring the building back to something resembling what it looked like in 1959 the plan is that the original entrance and drop off will be restored and the thought is that most people coming to the kalita will still use that entry sequence rice said parking will be designed to blend with nature and new paths will link the park and theater campus with the katy trail for the first time a new rehearsal space could pop up nearby that offers treehouse type views of the theater and grounds a black box theater to the south of the building would include a removable wall that turns the space into an outdoor theater i think we re definitely bringing 21st century ideas about how a city can connect with its citizens to a restoration project that has at its heart a classic mid century building said moriarty it ll be one of the most significant historic restoration projects in dallas but it will also be in the context of thinking about what is the future of the city and its relationship to its people so it sits in a really fascinating looking backwards and looking forward place which is especially fun moriarty said that the committee will hand off its 600 page plan to the city at the end of the month in january the architects and moriarty will begin making the rounds to city commissions committees and the city council to make the case for why the city should fund the restoration work the entire master plan will be posted on the dtc s website this week following the meeting which will also be recorded to rsvp go here get the d brief newsletter dallas most important news stories of the week delivered to your inbox each sunday
