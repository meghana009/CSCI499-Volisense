eels in the river thames are in danger of becoming extinct says an expert dr david solomon a retired freshwater ecologist said the most likely cause was climate change not over fishing he was speaking as he launched his latest book which charts the history of fish and fisheries on the famous river dr solomon an experienced angler said most anglers put back the fish they catch so i don t think the thames has an overfishing problem but eels are becoming very scarce there has been a 90 per cent decline which could have been caused by global warming they are now in danger of becoming extinct in the thames eels are an important part of the eco system and things will change without them it s a great loss something we will never get back they had a major role in the thames fisheries there were many eels traps and mills paid their rents in eels to their landlords so they were very important i wish we knew why they are disappearing adults spawn in the sargasso sea in the caribbean and the larvae migrate towards european shores following the gulf stream current and something is going very wrong in the cycle it s not just a problem in the river thames but also in the mediterranean and in european rivers we don t know why and where in the cycle things are going wrong it could be because of changes in the ocean currents or because of parasites there is a lot of research going on to find out more because eels are very valuable his book a history of fish and fisheries of the river thames is his third and describes the development of fish stocks and fisheries of the thames for food and for sport dr solomon 74 who lives in the street ewelme with his wife yvonne worked for the ministry of agriculture fisheries and food and as a fishery consultant he said i have done a lot of work on the thames in the past and had a lot of information on it which i found really interesting and wanted to share and i thought it was worth it i m hoping it will be of interest to historians as well as local people the book is illustrated with old engravings and photographs and contains anecdotes and stories from the anglo saxons to the present day these include the number and price of each species of local freshwater fish used to feed thomas cranmer former archbishop of canterbury in the days leading up to his execution in oxford in 1556 dr solomon also writes about the years of efforts to re introduce salmon to the river there is also the story of a henley man who caught more than 800 thames trout over 3lb during his lifetime dr solomon spent 20 years gathering information for the book and the last eight writing it i kept going back to it but with lockdown i had more time to focus on it he said it was in danger of never being finished as i kept finding more and more information i wanted to include there are so many stories to be added but you need to stop somewhere the book is not really a guide on how to fish there are too many books already telling you how to do that it s about the fish themselves the fisheries and their history dr solomon started fishing when he was eight years old he said i always found water and the river fascinating i caught my first fish a gudgeon with the help of my father when i was eight in six decades he has been fishing in scotland alaska russia tierra del fuego and the caribbean i ve been fishing in many locations around the world but obviously much less in the past year and a half because of the pandemic he said i entered a few fishing competitions in the past but i wasn t very good so i just do it for my own enjoyment his biggest catch was a 181lb halibut that he caught in alaska the halibut is the world s largest flat fish and can weigh up to 515lb each dr solomon said that was definitely my biggest catch but when i was fishing in russia i caught seven salmon in a day which is quite good after retiring i started writing about my experiences and the history of fishing locally i ve always enjoyed it my job involved a lot of report writing but it has definitely become a passion now dr solomon now splits his time between writing and fishing with his six grandchildren he said the older ones who are aged between five and seven are really interested in it as long as it s fun and as long as they catch something young people can be very impatient but they will learn his first book was about the history of the river exe in the south west and was published in 2013 last year he published a book about ewelme brook describing the stream and its place in the hydrogeology landscape history rural economy and ecology of its catchment dr solomon said i gathered a lot of information on the brook which is so important for the village and the main reason ewelme exists it s woven into the history of the village the proceeds from sales of the book were split between ewelme village store the friends of ewelme watercress beds the ewelme society and the bensington society a history of fish and fisheries of the river thames is published by fluvial books and is available from richard way s bookshop in friday street henley
london the rapid advance of taliban towards kabul is not only causing concern about afghanistan s future but also about the impact on other countries in the region and their economies iran and then iraq are situated to the west of afghanistan tajikistan turkm enistan and uzbekistan are to the north but the immediate focus for financial markets and investors is pakistan located to the east pakistan has a large public debt a sizeable equity market and is dependent on a 6 billion imf programme the prospect of years of violence and waves of refugees will add pressure to its fiscal repair plans it is a very troubling situation and unfortunately has set the region back many years said shamaila khan head of emerging market debt at alliancebernstein i think the neighbouring countries will have to deal with an influx of refugees in the coming months years the united nations refugee agency unhcr estimates 400 000 afghans have fled their homes this year only a few hundred of these displaced persons are known to have fled afghanistan but the unhcr estimates there are 2 6 million afghan refugees worldwide with 1 4m in pakistan and 1m in iran pakistan s bond prices have already fallen nearly 8 per cent this year though many financial analysts think this has probably had more to do with delays in it obtaining its latest tranche of imf money than with the security situation read imf carefully watching afghanistan too soon to predict spillover to pakistan nearly 10 000 pakistani civilians were killed in attacks between 2010 and 2015 the south asia terrorism portal figures show those numbers have fallen since then but there are concerns they will now rise again another influx of refugees and the spillover of violent groups motivated to destabilise urban areas and infrastructure particularly on the western side of pakistan could set pakistan s recovery and reform story back said hasnain malik an analyst at research firm tellimer he suggested risk might be reduced if the taliban were included in the afghan government strategically important pakistan s imf programme is its 13th in 30 years and is needed to help the government tackle a public debt of about 90pc of its gdp any taliban attacks inside pakistan could raise security concerns and make it harder for islamabad to meet targets set by the imf at the same time some investors say they could increase pakistan s strategic importance for the west the imf is carefully watching the fast moving situation on the ground in afghanistan a fund spokesperson said on friday adding that it was premature to speculate about what impact the security situation could have on pakistan if the taliban take control of afghanistan pakistan becomes even more strategically important to the us said kevin daly a portfolio manager at abrdn this he said could help keep imf money flowing kay van petersen a global macro strategist at saxo capital markets in singapore said the impact of the crisis in afghanistan could ultimately spread far wider many afghan refugees could seek refuge in europe he said following an earlier influx of migrants mostly fleeing war or persecution in syria other middle eastern countries and afghanistan if the refugees travel via turkey he said they could help turkish president tayyip erdogan make political or financial demands of the european union basically it s a lever for erdogan to pull with the european union pay us to take care of these refugees or we are just going to let them through he said this could weigh on the euro and lift turkey s lira he said emerging market watcher tim ash at bluebay asset management said that the taliban s advances as nato troops withdrew had damaged us credibility and fed into the growing rivalry between washington and china comparisons with vietnam abound ash said recalling the evacuation of the last americans and many south vietnamese via the roof of the us embassy as saigon fell in 1975 with that feeling of a saigon moment and the last us helicopter out published in dawn august 15th 2021

a promotional image for gold bullions the korea exchange by the investor teamthe south korean financial and investment market has been going through probably the biggest and fastest change in its modern history under the covid 19 pandemic which still shows no sign of abating it may not be the case just for asia s fourth largest economy as global markets as a whole have also been greatly touched by the spread of the virus and a series of expansionary fiscal measures as well as the lockdowns that followed what appears to have made the korean market unique in terms of the virus triggered industrial shift is in its speed of the change itself and the magnitude of market participants embracing such unprecedented transformation thanks to the world s most wired country s intensive information technology infrastructure and perhaps the infamous hurry hurry culture here s a look at the biggest winners and losers analyzed by the investor team of the korea herald and a preview of what the prolonged pandemic might bring south korea had been considered a late starter in the development of financial technology firms compared to other players in advanced markets but the pandemic has allowed fintech companies to catch up with their international rivals why various industries are increasingly relying on online payments as consumers shop online more than ever before daily transactions using easy payments rose an average of 449 2 billion won 384 6 million 41 6 percent up from the previous year electronic financial business operators such as kakao pay and naver

more accustomed to using credit cards and that would likely stay the norm even after the pandemic in korea fintech companies such as kakao pay and toss that specialize in digitization saw better than expected growth kakao pay is expected to go public later this month while viva republica the operator of fintech app toss reached a whopping 8 2 trillion won in corporate valuation for its latest funding round in terms of banks who are competing with up and coming fintech companies online only banks shined kakaobank went public earlier this month while k bank had a turnaround in the second quarter this draws a stark contrast to the growing number of closures of physical bank branches across the country granted the decreasing number of bank branches started quite a while ago but the pandemic has sped up that trend one might think extended social distancing and remote work would hinder investment activities such as due diligence and meetings between founders and venture capitalists yet despite these obvious hindrances data shows that the venture capital industry in korea has been unstoppable even as the pandemic rages on in the first half of this year venture capital firms grew 128 3 percent from a year ago to a record high 404 billion won the figure surpassed last year s total of 227 billion won when the first wave of the pandemic struck the local industry in

benchmark kospi soared above 3 300 points while the tech heavy kosdaq traded above the 1 000 point level in the first half of this year more than 20 years after the dot com bubble burst as of friday s

financial supervisory service released wednesday showed virtual assets were regarded as among the favorite investment destinations for day traders at home and abroad as issuers often proclaimed that they were using promising blockchain technologies to build the new future of finance adding fuel to the crypto fever were the relatively loose regulations on cryptocurrencies and retail investors ease of access to their assets moreover there were signs earlier this year that virtual assets were becoming mainstream as us companies such as tesla paypal mastercard and bank of new york mellon announced plans to adopt cryptocurrencies as a viable means of payment but the rosy promises are giving way to virtual assets extreme level of price sensitivity and volatility around the clock leaving day

price of pure gold was quoted at 66 220 won per gram on friday the price fell over 10 percent in the past year and had shed 0 2 percent since january this is attributable to the sizable outflow of gold exchange traded funds for six months through the first quarter of 2021 according to a july report from the world gold council the gold price recovered with the return of gold etf inflow in the second quarter the report also showed but fell short of recouping losses earlier the same year a similar downtrend was seen in etfs tracking gold futures for example seoul based samsung asset

neutrality by 2050 have seen their stock prices tumble over the past few months although direct links between their coal exposure and stock price movement might be unclear for example the state run

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news update the tesla model s plaid completed the race and set a record for electric cars for the course though i think only one other ev raced the course here s a short video update from blake fuller before today no electric car had ever raced in the mt washington hillclimb one of the oldest car races in the usa the first runs were on july 11 and 12 1904 today two electric cars are racing up the highest peak in the us northeast one is a modified electric vehicles and one is a stock electric vehicle as it came out of the factory barring some basic modifications to make the car safe sensible to race as i ve documented in a couple of articles this week the stock electric vehicle is a tesla model s plaid that blake fuller received from tesla a little more than a week ago he has been feverishly getting it ready for the race and texted me a little while ago that the car finally passed tech in other words the car is permitted to race blake spent saturday finally getting some practice in if you haven t followed this sort of thing here s the summary i published a few days ago first of all note that blake holds a few racing records to his name he was the youngest rookie of the year at pikes peak hill climb when he won that award in 18 and he currently holds the record for the best time at pikes peak in a production electric vehicle he s also a deep tech guy and invented the first lithium ion starting battery after founding braille battery which he eventually sold blake s batteries power professional racing cars around the globe and are in every indycar v8 supercar dtm racer and 1 000 s of other vehicles his site notes i ve seen an extremely detailed presentation on what went into the pikes peak hill climb record and i ve ridden in a ford mustang mach e and tesla model 3 on a race track with him the dude knows how to race to put it in simple terms i d trust him to safely race around the track with my computer tv and other valuables inside but there s no way in hell i d put one of my kids in the car with him not because he s careless of course i got quite the opposite impression but because it s a crazy dangerous sport and seeing that to only a minor degree up close personal was enough to scare the piss out of me for more on the race here s what the race website says the subaru mt washington hillclimb presented by yokohama tire is known as the climb to the clouds a thrilling car race from the base of the mt washington auto road to the 6 288 summit the race has a three day format with practice runs on half of the mountain on friday and saturday morning the practice location on either the lower half or the upper half of the mountain depends on the weather on race day sunday august 15 each competitor makes two full runs of the technical steep and winding mountain road once in the morning and once in the afternoon the field of 80 cars leave the starting line one minute apart from each other to tackle the 7 6 mile auto road the auto road is the oldest man made attraction in the united states and is driven by approximately 50k recreational vehicles each year today it typically takes a car and driver about 30 minutes to reach the summit this race is a rare chance to see extreme drivers test their mettle on this extraordinary terrain also known as the climb to the clouds the mt washington hillclimb is the oldest automotive hillclimb in north america first run in july 1904 it took place seven years before the first 500 mile race at indianapolis motor speedway and twelve years prior to the inaugural pikes peak hillclimb in colorado the climb to the clouds was run sporadically from 1904 1961 then not again until 1990 when it was run consistently until 2001 following a ten year hiatus the mt washington hillclimb returned in 2011 in support of the 150th anniversary celebration of the mt washington auto road which first opened on august 8 1861 since the 2011 event the hillclimb has taken place in 2014 and 2017 the current record for the race was set at the last climb to the clouds event in july 2017 by travis pastrana at a blistering 5 minutes and 44 seconds for anyone who has driven the road this is an almost unfathomable feat so yeah blake only had one day of practice instead of two and he s never driven this track before unlike pikes peak which he s been familiar with for years we ll see how he does somewhat humorously but also a testament of the fact that we ve still got a long ways to go with evs the entrant list for this 2021 race says that blake is driving a tesla model 3 performance as noted above he s not he s driving a tesla model s plaid i m not sure how the mistake was made but this is where we stand more details about the mt washington hillclimb can be found in the race brochure or on wikipedia of course for more on blake s prep for the race with the brand new and then almost immediately stripped tesla model s plaid see our previous two articles and videos check out blake s website to learn more and to support his efforts here in new hampshire and in future races he d like to join if funding

by john harwood the trumpist republican party has shown it will toy with democracy now president joe biden is testing its willingness to play with economic fire the test comes in the upcoming showdown over raising the federal debt limit a painful political chore that periodically falls to congress when the treasury exhausts the amount of borrowing that lawmakers had previously authorized performing it is necessary for government to pay its bills and avert a destabilizing financial crisis the white house seeks cooperation from partisan adversaries as well as allies in congress so far republicans have vowed not to provide any it s a credible threat the danger represents a relatively recent development in american history for decades the statutory requirement that congress authorize additional borrowing has provided a venue for harmless skirmishes in which the party out of power flays the party in power for irresponsible borrowing one example march 2006 when it was president george w bush s turn to ask congress for a debt limit increases first term democratic sen barack obama denounced the failure of leadership that made it necessary obama and every other senate democrat opposed bush s request but the republican majority was large enough to approve it without threatening the economy by the time obama reached the oval office however tea party republicans had turned the customary political slap fight into a brass knuckles brawl their initial refusal to raise the debt limit in 2011 triggered a political and economic crisis it made financial markets plummet and forced the first ever downgrade in us government debt costing taxpayers billions in higher borrowing costs the ransom republicans demanded to end it deep federal spending cuts proved so unrealistic that congress repeatedly abandoned them congressional republicans dropped hostage taking once their own party recaptured the white house as much as democrats loathed president donald trump they did not stand in the way of debt limit hikes on his watch including after winning the house in 2018 biden s full court press that s what biden administration officials say must be done again as with every white house they note that a debt limit increase doesn t authorize new spending but merely preserves america s full faith and credit by permitting payment of debts already incurred the economic consequences of failing to do so would be catastrophic which is why that s an unacceptable outcome national economic council director brian deese told cnn in an interview last week in a statement treasury secretary janet yellen warned of irreparable harm to the us economy and the livelihoods of all americans senate minority leader mitch mcconnell insists that democrats shoulder the burden on their own they could do it by including a debt limit hike in the 3 5 trillion human infrastructure bill they seek under special budget rules that will sidestep a republican filibuster at the biden s team behest senate democrats decided not to do that they fear it might fatally weigh down their social spending bill and want to defuse the debt limit as a dangerous partisan weapon the pattern of rising republican aggression suggests that won t be easy when the republican revolution made newt gingrich the speaker in 1995 the house scuttled a procedural maneuver democrats had used to avoid debt limit headaches for the previous 16 years as they sought to thwart obama some congressional republicans went so far as to argue falsely that a federal debt default could be managed by selective prioritization of government s bills in reality the consequences would ripple throughout the american economy of 50 republican senators 46 signed a letter last week promising not to help biden raise the debt limit since this is a problem created by democrat spending in fact tax cuts and spending increases boosted the national debt by roughly 7 trillion or about one third during trump s single term as president it is the republicans who keep reinforcing misinformation for voters observed tony fratto who served as a top aide in the white house and treasury department under president bush a 2021 calling card for republicans in some ways misinformation has become the gop s 2021 calling card after tolerating trump s false claims that he won the 2020 election congressional republicans have stood by while state level gop officials change voting and election administration rules only six republican senators voted to create an independent commission to investigate the january 6 insurrection allowing that proposal to die by filibuster that sounds auspicious for biden s ability to persuade 10 republicans to overcome a debt limit filibuster this fall yet the white house has reason to hope that they re not going to let us default as the president put it last week senate democrats currently plan to attach a debt limit hike to a september spending bill that would keep the government running as his party has grown increasingly radicalized mcconnell has consistently shown an aversion to self inflicted wounds he displayed pragmatism last week in joining 18 republican senators to back biden s popular hard infrastructure bill the combination of gop triggered shutdown and debt crisis could jeopardize his hope of recapturing the senate in 2022 i d like to believe there are 10 republicans who will vote for this said fratto they need to find a fix the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

kabul afghanistan the taliban seized the city of jalalabad early today cutting off afghanistan s increasingly isolated capital kabul to the east as the insurgents blitz across the country continued less than three weeks before the u s hopes to complete its troop withdrawal the militants posted photos online early today showing them in the governor s office in jalalabad the capital of nangarhar province abrarullah murad a lawmaker from the province told the associated press that the insurgents seized jalalabad after elders negotiated the fall of the government there the loss of jalalabad comes on the heels of the taliban s capture of mazar e sharif on saturday the country s fourth largest city which afghan forces and two powerful former warlords had pledged to defend abas ebrahimzada a lawmaker from the balkh province where the city is said the afghan army surrendered first which prompted pro government militias and other forces to lose morale and give up in the face of a taliban onslaught opened earlier saturday ebrahimzada said abdul rashid dostum and ata mohammad noor former warlords who command thousands of fighters had fled the province and their whereabouts were unknown noor said in a facebook post that his defeat in mazar e sharif was orchestrated and blamed the government forces saying they handed their weapons and equipment to the taliban he did not say who was behind the conspiracy nor offer details but said he and dostum are in a safe place now the taliban have made major advances in recent days including capturing herat and kandahar the country s second and third largest cities they now control about 24 of afghanistan s 34 provinces leaving the western backed government with a smattering of provinces in the center and east as well as kabul saturday the taliban captured all of logar province just south of kabul and detained local officials said hoda ahmadi a lawmaker from the province she said the taliban have reached the char asyab district just 7 miles south of the capital later the insurgents took over mihterlam the capital of laghman province northeast of kabul without a fight according to zefon safi a lawmaker from the province peace talks also saturday afghan president ashraf ghani delivered a televised speech his first public appearance since the recent taliban gains he vowed not to give up the achievements of the 20 years since the u s toppled the taliban after the 9 11 attacks we have started consultations inside the government with elders and political leaders representatives of different levels of the community as well as our international allies ghani said soon the results will be shared with you he added without elaborating further the u s continued holding peace talks between the government and the taliban in qatar last week and the international community has warned that a taliban government brought about by force would be shunned but the insurgents appear to have little interest in making concessions as they rack up victories on the battlefield in qatar s capital doha u s envoy zalmay khalilzad met with taliban political leaders who demanded an end to intensifying u s airstrikes aimed at slowing the fast moving push by taliban forces to gain territory occupy provincial capitals and hold key roadways in a statement taking stock of its battlefield victories the taliban on saturday sought to project itself as afghanistan s rightful rulers appealing for calm and claiming no harm would come to those who ve aided the american led military campaign or held jobs in the central government rather those people would be granted amnesty we assure all our neighbors that we will not create any problems for them the statement asserts we also assure all the diplomats embassies consulates and charitable workers whether they are international or national that not only no problems will be created for them but security and a secure environment will be provided to them ghani has proposed waiting at least a week for a government delegation with a plan for a new power sharing agreement to arrive in doha but that timetable was seen as unrealistic in the fast shifting developments according to people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity president joe biden said he has asked secretary of state antony blinken to support ghani and other afghan leaders as they seek to prevent further bloodshed and pursue a political settlement any political settlement at this point is likely to be tantamount to full taliban control even if it includes elements of power sharing with nonmilitant political figures and power brokers the taliban have been adamant that ghani cannot remain in power ghani also expressed concern about the thousands of displaced afghans who have fled to the relative safety of kabul in recent weeks and who could fan a fresh wave of refugees moving into neighboring countries and beyond about 1 200 afghans have been transported to the u s in recent days and the biden administration has committed to temporarily moving another 4 000 applicants and their families to other countries while their immigration paperwork is finalized canadian officials on friday committed to taking in 20 000 refugees focusing on those most in danger including women leaders human rights advocates journalists gay and transgender people persecuted religious groups and families of interpreters already resettled in canada no timeline was given for the resettlements these official rescue efforts account for only a fraction of afghans displaced by the conflict a quarter million people have fled their homes since the end of may the united nations refugee agency said of them most 80 are women and children some 400 000 people have been displaced since the beginning of the year the situation has all the hallmarks of a humanitarian catastrophe tomson phiri a spokesman for the u n world food program said in a statement noting that the conflict has accelerated much faster than we all anticipated no place for women tens of thousands of afghans have fled their homes with many fearing a return to the taliban s oppressive rule the group had previously governed afghanistan under a harsh version of islamic law in which women were forbidden to work or attend school and could not leave their homes without a male relative accompanying them civilians already are reporting the shuttering of girls schools and that poor families are being forced to cook for the fighters they say young men are pressured to join the ranks of the militants salima mazari one of the few female district governors in the country expressed fears about a taliban takeover earlier saturday in an interview from mazar e sharif before it fell there will be no place for women said mazari who governs a district of 36 000 people near the northern city in the provinces controlled by the taliban no women exist there anymore not even in the cities they are all imprisoned in their homes the taliban appointed hard line cleric mujeeb rahman ansari as women s affairs minister in herat according to a prominent women s activist from the city who did not want to be identified because she fears for her safety she described ansari as being strongly against women s rights he rose to prominence about 2015 and became infamous for dozens of billboards he installed in herat that told women to wear islamic hijabs and demonized those who would promote women s rights the taliban also captured paktika province and small kunar province both bordering pakistan as well as faryab province in the north and the central province of daykundi lawmakers from those areas said saturday sayed hussan gerdezi a lawmaker from paktika province said the taliban seized most of its capital gardez but battles with government forces were still underway the taliban said they controlled the city the swift collapse of afghanistan s own forces despite hundreds of billions of dollars in u s aid over the years has raised fears the taliban could return to power or that the country could be shattered by factional fighting as it was after the soviet withdrawal in 1989 it s also prompted many american and afghan veterans of the conflict to question whether two decades of blood and treasure was worth it inside kabul scenes were reminiscent of the taliban s rise in the mid 1990s with families selling everything and doing whatever they could to flee the country afghans have been streaming into kabul s international airport in recent days desperate to fly out even as more american troops have arrived to help partially evacuate the u s embassy 5 000 u s troops in a statement saturday biden said that some 5 000 u s troops will be deployed to oversee the evacuation of u s diplomats afghans who have worked with coalition forces throughout the war and others at special risk from the taliban advance in his statement biden didn t explain the breakdown of the 5 000 troops he said had been deployed but a defense official said in a media statement that the president had approved defense secretary lloyd austin s recommendation that abut 1 000 soldiers from the lead battalion of the 82nd airborne brigade combat team would join a force of about 4 000 soldiers and marines either already on the ground or arriving soon the first marines arrived friday the rest are expected today and their deployment has raised questions about whether the administration will meet its aug 31 withdrawal deadline officials have stressed that the newly arriving troops mission was limited to assisting the airlift of embassy personnel and afghan allies and they expected to complete it by month s end but they might have to stay longer if the embassy is threatened by a taliban takeover of kabul by then taliban representatives have been warned that any actions putting u s personnel at risk will be met with a swift and strong u s military response biden said the goal is to make sure we can have an orderly and safe drawdown of u s personnel and other allied personnel and an orderly and safe evacuation of afghans who helped our troops during our mission and those at special risk from the taliban advance biden said the u s air force has carried out several airstrikes to aid its afghan allies on the ground but they appear to have done little to stem the taliban s advance biden attributed much of the chaos unfolding in afghanistan to former president donald trump s efforts to end the war which biden said created a blueprint that put u s forces in a difficult spot with an emboldened taliban challenging the afghan government when i came to office i inherited a deal cut by my predecessor which he invited the taliban to discuss at camp david on the eve of 9 11 of 2019 that left the taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 biden said saturday i was the fourth president to preside over an american troop presence in afghanistan two republicans two democrats i would not and will not pass this war onto a fifth biden had set an aug 31 deadline for fully withdraw combat forces before the 20th anniversary of the attacks biden s announcement set the latest taliban offensive in motion having the deadline pass with thousands of u s troops in the country could be problematic for biden republicans criticized the withdrawal as a mistake and ill planned though there was little political appetite by either party to send fresh troops to fight the taliban biden who is spending the weekend at camp david again defended his decision to withdraw troops from afghanistan after 20 years one more year or five more years of u s military presence would not have made a difference if the afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country he said and an endless american presence in the middle of another country s civil conflict was not acceptable to me information for this article was contributed by ahmad seir tameem akhgar

something was unsettling beekeeper chris kelly he felt he was being watched he must have been misplacing things more than usual he thought a honey strainer disappeared then some other specialty equipment nothing valuable he said but a couple of weeks ago kelly noticed something strange in a bee yard he d been using to breed queen honeybees frames from one of his hives had been replaced with ones that were unfamiliar he only noticed because koravel was written on the top of one some of his long island survivor stock bees a hearty bunch he hand raised and has been breeding for decades had been stolen and replaced the tale grew stranger within a few days kelly owner of promised land apiaries on new york s long island had heard from two other properties where he has hives more bees had gone missing it s not something wildly obvious but it s been a series of things that are just off kelly said of the sequence of events and the sum total is actually really quite disturbing at this point the saga of kelly s heisted honeybees would rattle the beekeeper and the clients who sought after his specially bred bees it would leave kelly looking over his shoulder hiring a private detective and wondering how anyone outside the tightknit beekeeping community could walk off with a living hive he wondered whether the culprit was one of their own bee rustling or honeybee theft can be a lucrative industry it s more widely reported in commercial settings where beekeepers drive truckloads of hives around to pollinate crops such as almonds and blackberries the thievery has created a worldwide black market so kelly wants to know who is after his bees he doesn t understand the draw to his operation i m a small potato kelly said i m under no illusion that i m a big beekeeper i m a small time beekeeper according to the apiarist community most bee thieves are actually just washed up beekeepers making a last ditch effort to save their businesses bees are fragile to begin with and anyone going to the trouble of stealing a hive would probably want to keep it alive when someone stole 300 of texas beekeeper randy verhoek s colonies in winter 2017 he posted on facebook calling it an inside job in 2012 a california beekeeper was arrested and accused of stealing 80 of a competitor s hives and mixing the pilfered bees in with his own in 1977 23 year old beekeeper david allred was sentenced to serve at least three years in prison for the theft of 10 000 worth of hives from another california beekeeper mother jones reported the outlet deemed allred california s most notorious beenapper after he allegedly continued his spate of heists in 2013 kelly a cornell university trained entomologist who teaches dozens of students every year and takes on beekeeping apprentices has been keeping bees for 50 years his apiary has more than 100 hives and he manages 100 other colonies in the area he said the greatest sadness of this situation is that the thief to be a beekeeper there s one level of hurt because you stole my babies okay he said but there s another level of hurt because you re part of a community that normally is the most beautiful ethical type of individuals you re ever going to meet a facebook post from 1760 homestead farm one of the places where kelly s hives were stolen read this was not the work of an amateur and we don t know what effect this incident will cause on our other hives larry kaiser the farm s owner said he s troubled by the possibility of this crime being more nefarious than a standard theft he s worried that the replacement bees could be infected with a disease or parasite which could lead to the collapse of all 10 hives on his farm he sells honey and relies on the bees to pollinate his watermelons hot peppers lavender and more he said he could lose thousands of dollars if the theft affects future honey production and the monetary ramifications could ripple across his business if the hives collapse kelly saw bee rustling firsthand decades ago he said in 1986 he was working for someone who had him move hives to an orange grove in florida the day after he dropped them off there wasn t a bee left he said but this situation feels completely different the beekeeper said the florida case was a larger operation not theft from a small apiarist he said knowing someone is after his bees in particular has been unnerving kelly breeds what he has termed long island survivor stock bees a special group that he said are more adaptable to long island s volatile weather than standard bees his honeybees aren t commercially available you can only get them from him kaiser said the idea that kelly might be targeted doesn t shock him in my opinion he s the top of his field he s well respected in the community kaiser said so it doesn t surprise me that someone goes after someone who they think is more successful kelly said he filed police reports and put up surveillance cameras at the suggestion of law enforcement reached by phone employees at two departments where kelly filed reports said they hadn t heard of honeybee hive thefts before now kelly also had a private investigator check his phone and truck for tracking devices the monetary loss to his operation was about 500 per hive he said but the loss of the bees themselves is significant to him he just wants the stealing to stop at the end of the day this isn t where i want to be focused he said i want to be focused on really keeping my bees safe and healthy i want to be focused on the joy of beekeeping
kabul afghanistan the taliban seized the city of jalalabad early today cutting off afghanistan s increasingly isolated capital kabul to the east as the insurgents blitz across the country continued less than three weeks before the u s hopes to complete its troop withdrawal the militants posted photos online early today showing them in the governor s office in jalalabad the capital of nangarhar province abrarullah murad a lawmaker from the province told the associated press that the insurgents seized jalalabad after elders negotiated the fall of the government there the loss of jalalabad comes on the heels of the taliban s capture of mazar e sharif on saturday the country s fourth largest city which afghan forces and two powerful former warlords had pledged to defend abas ebrahimzada a lawmaker from the balkh province where the city is said the afghan army surrendered first which prompted pro government militias and other forces to lose morale and give up in the face of a taliban onslaught opened earlier saturday ebrahimzada said abdul rashid dostum and ata mohammad noor former warlords who command thousands of fighters had fled the province and their whereabouts were unknown noor said in a facebook post that his defeat in mazar e sharif was orchestrated and blamed the government forces saying they handed their weapons and equipment to the taliban he did not say who was behind the conspiracy nor offer details but said he and dostum are in a safe place now the taliban have made major advances in recent days including capturing herat and kandahar the country s second and third largest cities they now control about 24 of afghanistan s 34 provinces leaving the western backed government with a smattering of provinces in the center and east as well as kabul saturday the taliban captured all of logar province just south of kabul and detained local officials said hoda ahmadi a lawmaker from the province she said the taliban have reached the char asyab district just 7 miles south of the capital later the insurgents took over mihterlam the capital of laghman province northeast of kabul without a fight according to zefon safi a lawmaker from the province peace talks also saturday afghan president ashraf ghani delivered a televised speech his first public appearance since the recent taliban gains he vowed not to give up the achievements of the 20 years since the u s toppled the taliban after the 9 11 attacks we have started consultations inside the government with elders and political leaders representatives of different levels of the community as well as our international allies ghani said soon the results will be shared with you he added without elaborating further the u s continued holding peace talks between the government and the taliban in qatar last week and the international community has warned that a taliban government brought about by force would be shunned but the insurgents appear to have little interest in making concessions as they rack up victories on the battlefield in qatar s capital doha u s envoy zalmay khalilzad met with taliban political leaders who demanded an end to intensifying u s airstrikes aimed at slowing the fast moving push by taliban forces to gain territory occupy provincial capitals and hold key roadways in a statement taking stock of its battlefield victories the taliban on saturday sought to project itself as afghanistan s rightful rulers appealing for calm and claiming no harm would come to those who ve aided the american led military campaign or held jobs in the central government rather those people would be granted amnesty we assure all our neighbors that we will not create any problems for them the statement asserts we also assure all the diplomats embassies consulates and charitable workers whether they are international or national that not only no problems will be created for them but security and a secure environment will be provided to them ghani has proposed waiting at least a week for a government delegation with a plan for a new power sharing agreement to arrive in doha but that timetable was seen as unrealistic in the fast shifting developments according to people familiar with the situation who spoke on the condition of anonymity president joe biden said he has asked secretary of state antony blinken to support ghani and other afghan leaders as they seek to prevent further bloodshed and pursue a political settlement any political settlement at this point is likely to be tantamount to full taliban control even if it includes elements of power sharing with nonmilitant political figures and power brokers the taliban have been adamant that ghani cannot remain in power ghani also expressed concern about the thousands of displaced afghans who have fled to the relative safety of kabul in recent weeks and who could fan a fresh wave of refugees moving into neighboring countries and beyond about 1 200 afghans have been transported to the u s in recent days and the biden administration has committed to temporarily moving another 4 000 applicants and their families to other countries while their immigration paperwork is finalized canadian officials on friday committed to taking in 20 000 refugees focusing on those most in danger including women leaders human rights advocates journalists gay and transgender people persecuted religious groups and families of interpreters already resettled in canada no timeline was given for the resettlements these official rescue efforts account for only a fraction of afghans displaced by the conflict a quarter million people have fled their homes since the end of may the united nations refugee agency said of them most 80 are women and children some 400 000 people have been displaced since the beginning of the year the situation has all the hallmarks of a humanitarian catastrophe tomson phiri a spokesman for the u n world food program said in a statement noting that the conflict has accelerated much faster than we all anticipated no place for women tens of thousands of afghans have fled their homes with many fearing a return to the taliban s oppressive rule the group had previously governed afghanistan under a harsh version of islamic law in which women were forbidden to work or attend school and could not leave their homes without a male relative accompanying them civilians already are reporting the shuttering of girls schools and that poor families are being forced to cook for the fighters they say young men are pressured to join the ranks of the militants salima mazari one of the few female district governors in the country expressed fears about a taliban takeover earlier saturday in an interview from mazar e sharif before it fell there will be no place for women said mazari who governs a district of 36 000 people near the northern city in the provinces controlled by the taliban no women exist there anymore not even in the cities they are all imprisoned in their homes the taliban appointed hard line cleric mujeeb rahman ansari as women s affairs minister in herat according to a prominent women s activist from the city who did not want to be identified because she fears for her safety she described ansari as being strongly against women s rights he rose to prominence about 2015 and became infamous for dozens of billboards he installed in herat that told women to wear islamic hijabs and demonized those who would promote women s rights the taliban also captured paktika province and small kunar province both bordering pakistan as well as faryab province in the north and the central province of daykundi lawmakers from those areas said saturday sayed hussan gerdezi a lawmaker from paktika province said the taliban seized most of its capital gardez but battles with government forces were still underway the taliban said they controlled the city the swift collapse of afghanistan s own forces despite hundreds of billions of dollars in u s aid over the years has raised fears the taliban could return to power or that the country could be shattered by factional fighting as it was after the soviet withdrawal in 1989 it s also prompted many american and afghan veterans of the conflict to question whether two decades of blood and treasure was worth it inside kabul scenes were reminiscent of the taliban s rise in the mid 1990s with families selling everything and doing whatever they could to flee the country afghans have been streaming into kabul s international airport in recent days desperate to fly out even as more american troops have arrived to help partially evacuate the u s embassy 5 000 u s troops in a statement saturday biden said that some 5 000 u s troops will be deployed to oversee the evacuation of u s diplomats afghans who have worked with coalition forces throughout the war and others at special risk from the taliban advance in his statement biden didn t explain the breakdown of the 5 000 troops he said had been deployed but a defense official said in a media statement that the president had approved defense secretary lloyd austin s recommendation that abut 1 000 soldiers from the lead battalion of the 82nd airborne brigade combat team would join a force of about 4 000 soldiers and marines either already on the ground or arriving soon the first marines arrived friday the rest are expected today and their deployment has raised questions about whether the administration will meet its aug 31 withdrawal deadline officials have stressed that the newly arriving troops mission was limited to assisting the airlift of embassy personnel and afghan allies and they expected to complete it by month s end but they might have to stay longer if the embassy is threatened by a taliban takeover of kabul by then taliban representatives have been warned that any actions putting u s personnel at risk will be met with a swift and strong u s military response biden said the goal is to make sure we can have an orderly and safe drawdown of u s personnel and other allied personnel and an orderly and safe evacuation of afghans who helped our troops during our mission and those at special risk from the taliban advance biden said the u s air force has carried out several airstrikes to aid its afghan allies on the ground but they appear to have done little to stem the taliban s advance biden attributed much of the chaos unfolding in afghanistan to former president donald trump s efforts to end the war which biden said created a blueprint that put u s forces in a difficult spot with an emboldened taliban challenging the afghan government when i came to office i inherited a deal cut by my predecessor which he invited the taliban to discuss at camp david on the eve of 9 11 of 2019 that left the taliban in the strongest position militarily since 2001 biden said saturday i was the fourth president to preside over an american troop presence in afghanistan two republicans two democrats i would not and will not pass this war onto a fifth biden had set an aug 31 deadline for fully withdraw combat forces before the 20th anniversary of the attacks biden s announcement set the latest taliban offensive in motion having the deadline pass with thousands of u s troops in the country could be problematic for biden republicans criticized the withdrawal as a mistake and ill planned though there was little political appetite by either party to send fresh troops to fight the taliban biden who is spending the weekend at camp david again defended his decision

first rate directors of a list casts supported by seasoned reliable crews do not typically encounter the types of production problems that new directors of less accomplished casts and crews sometimes experience as a result the latter s films are often of low quality partly because of the production company s inexperience partly because of the restraints of their films low budgets and partly because of unanticipated problems they encounter while filming whatever the causes the consequences of filming bad horror movies plagued by even worse production problems can provide unintended entertainment albeit probably not for those who were directly involved in the filmmaking a few such films even become cult classics let s go backstage to see how directors actors and film crews have dealt with the production problems that plagued their low budget films 10 beast from haunted cave trailer beast from haunted cave 1959 watch this video on youtube the title of beast from haunted cave

aluminum strips plywood and chicken wire wrapped in muslin the lightweight structure warren reports increased robinson s own apparent height to seven feet and was equipped with spindly legs and tentacles inside the suit robinson moved in a jerky floppy manner suggesting that the monster was no threat to any of the more agile human characters it attempted to pursue 9 what waits below an accident put the brakes on don sharp s 1984 movie what waits below in which a team of military personnel and cave experts respond to the abrupt disappearance of a radio transmission from a deep cave system in central america in an issue of imagi movies actress lisa blount who played scientist leslie peterson recounted the incident which occurred while her character who had been captured was tied up inside the cavern at the time the scene was being shot she said all the extras were out in front of her when she saw them just start silently falling over as it turned out she explained the actors were fainting as this wave of carbon monoxide came at them they needed to get out of the cavern as quickly as possible blount recalled but their only means of transportation were the slow golf carts they had on hand the youngest among them were dispatched before the others she said as the carbon monoxide s presence in the close confines of the cavern was exacerbated by a backed up generator s shooting fumes back into the cave the accident shut down production for a few days blount said but she escaped harm and nobody else suffered long term injuries 8 the house on sorority row the house on

costume party attended by fraternity and sorority members that is in full swing aboard a train the fear of one of the crew caused a production problem according to david grove the author of jamie lee curtis the making of a scream queen terror train a stuntman who was portraying a dead character afloat in the icy waters of a ravine was frightened by the water s frigid temperature and kept trying to swim instead of playing dead art director gary comtois traded places with the stuntman and the filming of the scene was successfully completed the narrow confines and the poor lighting aboard the train in which most of the film s action was shot also presented a production problem in an interview with the terror trap spottiswoode explained how john alcott his cinematographer overcame this technical difficulty first alcott hired electricians to rewire the whole train the electrical wires were attached to long wooden boards spottiswoode explained to which dimmers could be fixed to facilitate the change of the wattage of the lights boxes and boxes of bulbs ranging from 20 to 100 watts were purchased spottiswoode recalled which enabled the crew to easily change the lights and either dim or illuminate the set very very fast the changes in the intensity of the light accentuated the terror aboard the train as the murderer picked off one partygoer after another the lighting effects were improved by other technique as well the director said to prevent reflected light bouncing off walls the walls were painted dark and alcott would position himself behind the camera and using a penlight pick people s eyes out of the darkness increasing the eerie quality of the dimly lit or at times completely dark interior of the train 6 attack of the crab monsters all the crab monster scenes from attack of the crab monsters roger corman 1957 watch this video on youtube a movie that is largely shot underwater is apt to involve a few production problems especially when the picture is filmed on a shoestring budget roger corman s 1957 film attack of the crab monsters certainly did the movie is based on a simple somewhat silly premise scientists who are searching for an expedition that never returned from an island on which they were conducting research also become cut off from the rest of the world to make matters worse the isolated scientists find themselves among intelligent crabs intent on the scientists gruesome destruction one of the movie s production problems resulted from mixed signals as the movie s screenwriter charles b griffith who also directed the filming of the undersea scenes explained in an interview with aaron w graham during a filming session at marineland griffith would be down at the bottom of the tank trying to get actors to do something while floyd crosby was hammering on the glass window trying to get them to do something else another problem concerning the film might have been the script itself corman and griffith disagree to some extent on this matter the director wanted a fast paced action packed movie each scene of which either ended in a cliffhanger or foreshadowed something horrific to come as griffith put it corman wanted suspense or action in every scene period although griffith complied he wasn t sure that this was the best way to go about plotting the picture i put suspense or action in every scene and when i went to go see it the audience fell asleep he reported on the other hand for corman the non stop action horror and suspense approach resulted in the most successful of all the early low budget horror movies because it focused more on spectacle and special effects than on character development and subplots his insistence on non stop action and suspense he said worked because the audience always had the feeling when watching the movie that something anything was about to happen critics reviews as represented by the rotten tomatoes website are mixed but are presently more positive than negative with five of the seven critics who have ventured an opinion on the film awarding it a ripe red tomato for its fresh status and two giving it a green splat to represent the movie s rotten status so far it seems that the critics are more in agreement with corman than they are with griffith on the merits of the picture 5 the beast of yucca flats the beast of yucca flats full free classic horror movie watch this video on youtube a poster promoting coleman francis s the beast of yucca flats 1961 suggests the paper thin plot commies made him an atomic mutant the him to which the poster s tagline refers is soviet scientist joseph jaworsky a defector who is transformed into a monster when fleeing kgb agents he enters a u s atomic weapons test area while a nuclear test is being conducted the movie is widely considered to be not so much horrific as just plain horrible according to producer anthony cardoza a 29 year old welder the cast consisted of anyone whom he and his associates could cobble together including an actor s friend an ex wife the wife of another of the movie s several producers and four of the producers themselves the only actual actor in the film was the star former wrestler tor johnson the special effects may have been effective but they were also cheap wrinkled up toilet tissue cardoza said was pasted onto tor presumably along with makeup to create the appearance of scars from the atomic blast which was supplied by stock footage cardoza said that interior sets were kept to a minimum as well there were two a bedroom and an apartment cardoza played the husband of actress marcia knight when the actor who was supposed to portray her spouse never showed up the inclusion of gratuitous nudity suggests how little consideration was given to the movie s plot to say nothing of its artistic integrity the only reason that the apartment appears in the film is to showcase the nude actress who paces about inside it during the movie s pre credits sequence before the beast kills her when asked the reason that this footage was included cardoza who was very forthcoming during his interview with tom weaver admitted coley liked nudity 4

the greatest avian based romantic thriller since the birds nguyen used income from his day job to finance the movie which he also wrote and produced and according to interviewer brad miska also tackles topical issues of global warming avian flu world peace organic living sexual promiscuity and lavatory access the 93 minute movie offers something for everyone apparently it s plot miska says is a horror action special effects driven love story about a young couple trapped in a small northern california town under siege by homicidal birds to promote birdemic miska recounts nguyen spent eight days driving up and down the festival s nearby streets in a van covered with fake birds frozen blood and birdemic posters while loudspeakers blared the sounds of eagle attacks and human screams the tactic caught the attention of festival organizers filmgoers and local police fortunately for the silicon valley mid level software salesman turned screenwriter director and producer the tactic also intrigued severin films executives who impressed by what they saw when they watched the movie contracted for worldwide rights to the film for twenty years critics haven t been as enthralled by birdemic bloody disgusting s david harley said the film easily makes it onto my top 10 best worst films of all time list classifying it as a beautiful disaster so mind numbingly inept and awful in

invaders from mars invaders from mars director william cameron menzies s 1953 creature feature employed several cheap props including a car headlight for a space gun and the set decorator s own glass table from home one of the most bizarre props in the movie though are the ordinary everyday white condoms used to create what passes for cave wall bubbles as john j j johnson points out in cheap tricks and class acts special effects makeup and stunts from the films of the fantastic fifties the filmmakers of that decade were nothing if not resourceful when it came to cutting costs 1 the visit the visit official trailer hd watch this video on youtube despite some winners n night shyamalan has directed so many losers that it is difficult to say which one is the worst contenders for this position however must include lady in water 2006 the happening 2008 the last airbender 2010 after earth 2013 and glass 2019 indeed his flops have caused him to lose so much status as a director who makes bankable films that to finance the visit 2015 he had to borrow 5 million on his 125 acre country estate west of philadelphia points out rolling stone writer brian hiatt his losing streak has

criticized for the plot twists typical of his films endings many of which critics contend are contrived as his movies box office receipts took a nosedive the director refrained from including such surprises until the visit for which hiatt reveals shyamalan brought back his signature this wasn t the movie you thought it was twist possibly as a result of this reversal no one would touch the movie when he flew to l a a rough cut every hollywood studio passed on it shyamalan feared he would lose the 5 million he had borrowed against his house and that his latest filmmaking fiasco might be his last however hiatt discloses the director filmed a new cut of the film showed it to universal and horror maven jason blum signed on as a producer the film ended up making 98 million perhaps shyamalan

by john harwood the trumpist republican party has shown it will toy with democracy now president joe biden is testing its willingness to play with economic fire the test comes in the upcoming showdown over raising the federal debt limit a painful political chore that periodically falls to congress when the treasury exhausts the amount of borrowing that lawmakers had previously authorized performing it is necessary for government to pay its bills and avert a destabilizing financial crisis the white house seeks cooperation from partisan adversaries as well as allies in congress so far republicans have vowed not to provide any it s a credible threat the danger represents a relatively recent development in american history for decades the statutory requirement that congress authorize additional borrowing has provided a venue for harmless skirmishes in which the party out of power flays the party in power for irresponsible borrowing one example march 2006 when it was president george w bush s turn to ask congress for a debt limit increases first term democratic sen barack obama denounced the failure of leadership that made it necessary obama and every other senate democrat opposed bush s request but the republican majority was large enough to approve it without threatening the economy by the time obama reached the oval office however tea party republicans had turned the customary political slap fight into a brass knuckles brawl their initial refusal to raise the debt limit in 2011 triggered a political and economic crisis it made financial markets plummet and forced the first ever downgrade in us government debt costing taxpayers billions in higher borrowing costs the ransom republicans demanded to end it deep federal spending cuts proved so unrealistic that congress repeatedly abandoned them congressional republicans dropped hostage taking once their own party recaptured the white house as much as democrats loathed president donald trump they did not stand in the way of debt limit hikes on his watch including after winning the house in 2018 biden s full court press that s what biden administration officials say must be done again as with every white house they note that a debt limit increase doesn t authorize new spending but merely preserves america s full faith and credit by permitting payment of debts already incurred the economic consequences of failing to do so would be catastrophic which is why that s an unacceptable outcome national economic council director brian deese told cnn in an interview last week in a statement treasury secretary janet yellen warned of irreparable harm to the us economy and the livelihoods of all americans senate minority leader mitch mcconnell insists that democrats shoulder the burden on their own they could do it by including a debt limit hike in the 3 5 trillion human infrastructure bill they seek under special budget rules that will sidestep a republican filibuster at the biden s team behest senate democrats decided not to do that they fear it might fatally weigh down their social spending bill and want to defuse the debt limit as a dangerous partisan weapon the pattern of rising republican aggression suggests that won t be easy when the republican revolution made newt gingrich the speaker in 1995 the house scuttled a procedural maneuver democrats had used to avoid debt limit headaches for the previous 16 years as they sought to thwart obama some congressional republicans went so far as to argue falsely that a federal debt default could be managed by selective prioritization of government s bills in reality the consequences would ripple throughout the american economy of 50 republican senators 46 signed a letter last week promising not to help biden raise the debt limit since this is a problem created by democrat spending in fact tax cuts and spending increases boosted the national debt by roughly 7 trillion or about one third during trump s single term as president it is the republicans who keep reinforcing misinformation for voters observed tony fratto who served as a top aide in the white house and treasury department under president bush a 2021 calling card for republicans in some ways misinformation has become the gop s 2021 calling card after tolerating trump s false claims that he won the 2020 election congressional republicans have stood by while state level gop officials change voting and election administration rules only six republican senators voted to create an independent commission to investigate the january 6 insurrection allowing that proposal to die by filibuster that sounds auspicious for biden s ability to persuade 10 republicans to overcome a debt limit filibuster this fall yet the white house has reason to hope that they re not going to let us default as the president put it last week senate democrats currently plan to attach a debt limit hike to a september spending bill that would keep the government running as his party has grown increasingly radicalized mcconnell has consistently shown an aversion to self inflicted wounds he displayed pragmatism last week in joining 18 republican senators to back biden s popular hard infrastructure bill the combination of gop triggered shutdown and debt crisis could jeopardize his hope of recapturing the senate in 2022 i d like to believe there are 10 republicans who will vote for this said fratto they need to find a fix the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
something was unsettling beekeeper chris kelly he felt he was being watched he must have been misplacing things more than usual he thought a honey strainer disappeared then some other specialty equipment nothing valuable he said but a couple of weeks ago kelly noticed something strange in a bee yard he d been using to breed queen honeybees frames from one of his hives had been replaced with ones that were unfamiliar he only noticed because koravel was written on the top of one some of his long island survivor stock bees a hearty bunch he hand raised and has been breeding for decades had been stolen and replaced the tale grew stranger within a few days kelly owner of promised land apiaries on new york s long island had heard from two other properties where he has hives more bees had gone missing it s not something wildly obvious but it s been a series of things that are just off kelly said of the sequence of events and the sum total is actually really quite disturbing at this point the saga of kelly s heisted honeybees would rattle the beekeeper and the clients who sought after his specially bred bees it would leave kelly looking over his shoulder hiring a private detective and wondering how anyone outside the tightknit beekeeping community could walk off with a living hive he wondered whether the culprit was one of their own bee rustling or honeybee theft can be a lucrative industry it s more widely reported in commercial settings where beekeepers drive truckloads of hives around to pollinate crops such as almonds and blackberries the thievery has created a worldwide black market so kelly wants to know who is after his bees he doesn t understand the draw to his operation i m a small potato kelly said i m under no illusion that i m a big beekeeper i m a small time beekeeper according to the apiarist community most bee thieves are actually just washed up beekeepers making a last ditch effort to save their businesses bees are fragile to begin with and anyone going to the trouble of stealing a hive would probably want to keep it alive when someone stole 300 of texas beekeeper randy verhoek s colonies in winter 2017 he posted on facebook calling it an inside job in 2012 a california beekeeper was arrested and accused of stealing 80 of a competitor s hives and mixing the pilfered bees in with his own in 1977 23 year old beekeeper david allred was sentenced to serve at least three years in prison for the theft of 10 000 worth of hives from another california beekeeper mother jones reported the outlet deemed allred california s most notorious beenapper after he allegedly continued his spate of heists in 2013 kelly a cornell university trained entomologist who teaches dozens of students every year and takes on beekeeping apprentices has been keeping bees for 50 years his apiary has more than 100 hives and he manages 100 other colonies in the area he said the greatest sadness of this situation is that the thief to be a beekeeper there s one level of hurt because you stole my babies okay he said but there s another level of hurt because you re part of a community that normally is the most beautiful ethical type of individuals you re ever going to meet a facebook post from 1760 homestead farm one of the places where kelly s hives were stolen read this was not the work of an amateur and we don t know what effect this incident will cause on our other hives larry kaiser the farm s owner said he s troubled by the possibility of this crime being more nefarious than a standard theft he s worried that the replacement bees could be infected with a disease or parasite which could lead to the collapse of all 10 hives on his farm he sells honey and relies on the bees to pollinate his watermelons hot peppers lavender and more he said he could lose thousands of dollars if the theft affects future honey production and the monetary ramifications could ripple across his business if the hives collapse kelly saw bee rustling firsthand decades ago he said in 1986 he was working for someone who had him move hives to an orange grove in florida the day after he dropped them off there wasn t a bee left he said but this situation feels completely different the beekeeper said the florida case was a larger operation not theft from a small apiarist he said knowing someone is after his bees in particular has been unnerving kelly breeds what he has termed long island survivor stock bees a special group that he said are more adaptable to long island s volatile weather than standard bees his honeybees aren t commercially available you can only get them from him kaiser said the idea that kelly might be targeted doesn t shock him in my opinion he s the top of his field he s well respected in the community kaiser said so it doesn t surprise me that someone goes after someone who they think is more successful kelly said he filed police reports and put up surveillance cameras at the suggestion of law enforcement reached by phone employees at two departments where kelly filed reports said they hadn t heard of honeybee hive thefts before now kelly also had a private investigator check his phone and truck for tracking devices the monetary loss to his operation was about 500 per hive he said but the loss of the bees themselves is significant to him he just wants the stealing to stop at the end of the day this isn t where i want to be focused he said i want to be focused on really keeping my bees safe and healthy i want to be focused on the joy of beekeeping
us dollar technical forecast talking points this past friday s dollar volatility broke a period of extreme inactivity and pushed the greenback into a path of least resistance range correction there are strong ranges to be found for the likes of eurusd but i prefer audusd which hasn t yet made the break back into its established range while we start off the new week with a dollar bearish bias i am looking at options for bulls to reassert and gbpusd below 1 3800 would suit well for that scenario recommended by john kicklighter get your free usd forecast get my guide technical forecast for us dollar bearish facing the critical decision to either extend a two month advance and clear a 10 month congestion pattern or turn back into the broad range the dollar chose to follow the latter course to end this past week the ice s trade weighted ice dollar index held the former july swing high at 93 20 and put some pace on the correction from that boarder through friday the acceleration on the retreat was notably event driven with a particularly severe shortfall in the university of michigan consumer confidence survey that should matter to technical traders because it suggests the tempo into next week may not be so easy to maintain without additional motivation from the headlines or economic docket generally speaking the financial markets are struggling with building momentum and the dollar is unlikely to be spared that liquidity and volatility curb chart of the dxy dollar index with 100 day moving average daily chart created on tradingview platform another point against the greenback s wholesale bearish potential in the week ahead is the inconsistency across the various dollar based majors for eurusd the principal component of the dxy the friday move and pronounced technicals are perhaps the ideal meanwhile other majors that are ranging like usdjpy don t have wide boundaries to move within and pairs like audusd usdcad and nzdusd are still holding to tight congestion if all of these crosses start to follow the dollar s slide against the euro we may have something more substantial to work with yet in practical terms i believe the focus on the late august early september speculation on fed intent will work against a strong technical move that said my interest for the dollar in the week ahead will be on ranges taking a look at the weekly chart of the dxy there is a large range in play down to approximately 89 50 but i doubt we will stretch that far within the span of the week the active levels on that index for my radar are 93 20 to 91 80 as 38 2 fib of the may to july move and 91 25 as the midpoint of the 2008 low to 2017 bull wave chart of the dxy dollar index with weekly chart created on tradingview platform among the dollar based majors eurusd is appealing for the scale of its range from 1 1700 to 1 2250 i m mindful of how much of this scale we can cover given the backdrop in market conditions at the same time a more modest range like usdjpy s 110 75 to 108 75 doesn t look worthy of the risk reward as it starts the new week in the dead center of the pattern for a range based setup i actually like audusd that may seem a misnomer because the pair is actually in a tight range between 0 7420 to 0 7320 but clearing this congestion only a bullish resolution would appeal for me could generate some short term charge to spur a bigger move up to potentially 0 7550 chart of audusd daily chart created on tradingview platform in generally the dollar will enter the new week on a bearish compass setting so it seems reasonable to find options that align to that bearing that said i like to have options prepared for alternative scenarios so taking the concept i laid out for the an audusd breakout that can pressure a larger range move within a week it seems gbpusd is in a position to break in favor of the greenback with a similar technical pattern in practical terms that would be a break from the tight two weeks

billionaire business owners deployed lobbyists to make sure trump s 2017 tax bill was tailored to their benefit confidential irs records show the windfall that followed was due in large part to assistance from senator ron johnson in november 2017 with the administration of president donald trump rushing to get a massive tax overhaul through congress senator ron johnson stunned his colleagues by announcing he would vote no making the rounds on cable tv the wisconsin republican became the first gop senator to declare his opposition spooking senate leaders who were pushing to quickly pass the tax bill with their thin majority if they can pass it without me let them johnson declared johnson s demand was simple in exchange for his vote the bill must sweeten the tax break for a class of companies that are known as pass throughs since profits pass through to their owners johnson praised such companies as engines of innovation behind the scenes the senator pressed top treasury department officials on the issue emails and the officials calendars show within two weeks johnson s ultimatum produced results trump personally called the senator to beg for his support and the bill s authors fattened the tax cut for these businesses johnson flipped to a yes and claimed credit for the change the bill passed the trump administration championed the pass through provision as tax relief for small businesses confidential tax records however reveal that johnson s last minute maneuver benefited two families more than almost any others in the country both worth billions and both among the senator s biggest donors dick and liz uihlein of packaging giant uline along with roofing magnate diane hendricks together had contributed around 20 million to groups backing johnson s 2016 reelection campaign the expanded tax break johnson muscled through netted them 215 million in deductions in 2018 alone drastically reducing the income they owed taxes on at that rate the cut could deliver more than half a billion in tax savings for hendricks and the uihleins over its eight year life but the tax break did more than just give a lucrative and legal perk to johnson s donors in the first year after trump signed the legislation just 82 ultrawealthy households collectively walked away with more than 1 billion in total savings an analysis of confidential tax records shows republican and democratic tycoons alike saw their tax bills chopped by tens of millions among them media magnate and former democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg the bechtel family owners of the engineering firm that bears their name and the heirs of the late houston pipeline billionaire dan duncan usually the scale of the riches doled out by opaque tax legislation and the beneficiaries remain shielded from the public a trove of irs records covering thousands of the wealthiest americans enabled reporters this year to explore the diverse menu of options the tax code affords the ultrawealthy to avoid paying taxes the drafting of the trump law offers a unique opportunity to examine how the billionaire class is able to shape the code to its advantage building in new ways to sidestep taxes the tax cuts and jobs act was the biggest rewrite of the code in decades and arguably the most consequential legislative achievement of the one term president crafted largely in secret by a handful of trump administration officials and members of congress the bill was rushed through the legislative process as draft language of the bill made its way through congress lawmakers friendly to billionaires and their lobbyists were able to nip and tuck and stretch the bill to accommodate a variety of special groups the flurry of midnight deals and last minute insertions of language resulted in a vast redistribution of wealth into the pockets of a select set of families siphoning away billions in tax revenue from the nation s coffers this story is based on lobbying and campaign finance disclosures treasury department emails and calendars obtained through a freedom of information act lawsuit and confidential tax records for those who benefited from the bill s modifications the collective millions spent on campaign donations and lobbying were minuscule compared with locking in years of enormous tax savings a spokesperson for the uihleins declined to comment representatives for hendricks didn t respond to questions in response to emailed questions johnson did not address whether he had discussed the expanded tax break with hendricks or the uihleins instead he wrote in a statement that his advocacy was driven by his belief that the tax code needs to be simplified and rationalized my support for pass through entities that represent over 90 of all businesses was guided by the necessity to keep them competitive with c corporations and had nothing to do with any donor or discussions with them he wrote by the summer of 2017 it was clear that trump s first major legislative initiative to repeal and replace obamacare had gone up in flames taking a marquee campaign promise with it looking for a win the administration turned to tax reform getting closer and closer on the tax cut bill shaping up even better than projected trump tweeted house and senate working very hard and smart end result will be not only important but special at the top of the republican wishlist was a deep tax cut for corporations there was little doubt that such a cut would make it into the final legislation but because of the complexity of the tax code slashing the corporate tax rate doesn t actually affect most u s businesses corporate taxes are paid by what are known in tax lingo as c corporations which include large publicly traded firms like at t or coca cola most businesses in the united states aren t c corporations they re pass throughs the name comes from the fact that when one of these businesses makes money the profits are not subject to corporate taxes instead they pass through directly to the owners who pay taxes on the profits on their personal returns unlike major shareholders in companies like amazon who can avoid taking income by not selling their stock owners of successful pass throughs typically can t avoid it pass throughs include the full gamut of american business from small barbershops to law firms to in the case of uline a packaging distributor with thousands of employees so alongside the corporate rate cut for the at ts of the world the trump tax bill included a separate tax break for pass through companies for budgetary reasons the tax break is not permanent sunsetting after eight years proponents touted it as boosting small business and main street and it s true that many small businesses got a modest tax break but a recent study by treasury economists found that the top 1 of americans by income have reaped nearly 60 of the billions in tax savings created by the provision and most of that amount went to the top 0 1 that s because even though there are many small pass through businesses most of the pass through profits in the country flow to the wealthy owners of a limited group of large companies tax records show that in 2018 bloomberg whom forbes ranks as the 20th wealthiest person in the world got the largest known deduction from the new provision slashing his tax bill by nearly 68 million when he briefly ran for president in 2020 bloomberg s tax plan proposed ending the deduction though his plan was generally friendlier to the wealthy than those of his rivals a spokesperson for bloomberg declined to comment johnson s intervention in november 2017 was designed to boost the bill s already generous tax break for pass through companies the bill had allowed for business owners to deduct up to 17 4 of their profits thanks to johnson holding out that figure was ultimately boosted to 20 that might seem like a small increase but even a few extra percentage points can translate into tens of millions of dollars in extra deductions in one year alone for an ultrawealthy family the mechanics are complicated but for the rich it generally means that a business owner gets to keep an extra 7 cents on every dollar of profit to understand the windfall take the case of the uihlein family dick the great grandson of a beer magnate and his wife liz own and operate packaging giant uline the logo of the pleasant prairie wisconsin firm is stamped on the bottom of countless paper bags uline produced nearly 1 billion in profits in 2018 according to an analysis of tax records dick and liz uihlein who own a majority of the company reported more than 700 million in income that year but they were able to slash what they owed the irs with a 118 million deduction generated by the new tax break liz uihlein who serves as president of uline has criticized high taxes in her company newsletter the year before the tax overhaul the couple gave generously to support trump s 2016 presidential campaign that same year when johnson faced long odds in his reelection bid against former senator russ feingold the uihleins gave more than 8 million to a series of political committees that blanketed the state with pro johnson and anti feingold ads that media blitz led to the nickname the koch brothers of wisconsin politics for the uihleins johnson s campaign also got a boost from hendricks wisconsin s richest woman and owner of roofing wholesaler abc supply co the beloit based billionaire has publicly pushed for tax breaks and said she wants to stop the u s from becoming a socialistic ideological nation hendricks has said johnson won her over after she grilled him at a brunch meeting six years earlier she gave about 12 million to a pair of political committees the reform america fund and the freedom partners action fund that bought ads attacking feingold in the first year of the pass through tax break hendricks got a 97 million deduction on income of 502 million by reducing the income she owed taxes on that deduction saved her around 36 million

at the peak of the coronavirus pandemic homes across the world were full of family members who had nowhere else to be click start to play today s word search where you can pick out the different members of a family after the initial few weeks of quality family moments the constant hustle and bustle began to grate on people s nerves adults started craving some alone time but studies now show they re not the only ones who needed it children did too before the pandemic children had full schedules with school extracurriculars play groups and homework keeping them constantly engaged but according to a march 2021 report by national geographic when the pandemic hit and lockdowns carried on for months many parents dialed up their helicopter parenting tendencies concerned that their children were lonely schedules were made virtual classes were turned on and games and group exercises became part of the new daily routine but rather than thrive many children became irritable being alone doesn t always equate to being lonely and most parents didn t realise the distinction according to the report a 2019 study by the us based university of california in santa cruz found that teenagers who deliberately sought out solitude experienced greater feelings of creativity self reflection and spiritual renewal moreover a 2012 report published in the science news magazine psychology today found that children who are able to creatively use their time alone rarely feel isolated or lonely alone time can bolster confidence and critical thinking in younger children because they have to depend on themselves for entertainment or problem solving so parents will probably be relieved to hear they do not have to take it upon themselves to entertain or engage their children all the time but it s also worth noting that leaving children alone is very different from leaving them alone with a screen the canadian paediatric society recommends that children two to five years old should have less than one hour of screen time a day and for children older than five it should be less than two hours a day rather than leaving children to their devices encouraging independent play with art building sets or blocks and setting up comfortable quiet spaces around the house with some beloved books at hand can make all the difference
this is a hefty price to pay but is square getting its money s worth we recently learned that fintech giant square sq 0 69 has agreed to acquire buy now pay later leader afterpay in an all stock deal that values the company at about 29 billion this is square s largest acquisition to date so in this motley fool live video clip recorded on aug 2 fool com contributor matt frankel cfp and industry focus host jason moser discuss whether the hefty price tag square is paying makes sense 10 stocks we like better than square when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and square wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of august 9 2021 jason moser let s talk about the afterpay acquisition because i understand the enthusiasm here i really do buy now pay later is a tremendous opportunity 30 billion is a tremendous price tag for this business matt frankel i think this is the biggest acquisition that either square or paypal pypl 1 47 has ever made moser yeah i think you re right they say it s 29 billion all stock deal and i think it s great at least square is doing this at a time when the stock is close to all time highs it s a fairly cheap form of currency but still that s a big price tag for a business that is growing by leaps and bounds but it s still a small business frankel it s an all stock deal so square s diluting shareholders by doing it apparently the market likes this deal the stocks up 11 this makes square almost over 155 billion company all by itself they are really adding to their outstanding share count now after today s pop it s over 30 billion they re paying for afterpay because it s all stock it s based on their stock price so giving a set number of shares afterpay if you re not familiar they re based in australia they re probably the most comparable competitor to affirm afrm 1 70 in the buy now pay later space buy now pay later is when you see the little button when you re about to checkout that says break this into six monthly payments of 100 instead of one 600 payment that s a buy now pay later service paypal has already built its own moser yeah frankel affirm is pretty big especially in the u s peloton nasdaq pton is their big customer afterpay they re an australian company but the majority of the revenue is from north america why they offer interest free financing no credit checks standard buy now pay later features that appeal to customers the no credit checks really is appealing as opposed people always ask the question why wouldn t i just use a traditional credit card because then you have to go through a credit check in the process like that with buy now pay later you just click the button and it s set up and done ninety eight thousand active merchant accounts little over 16 million active customers they re growing fast those numbers are up 78 and 63 year over year they re growing pretty quickly almost 16 billion of gross merchandise volume was financed through afterpay over the past year pretty big company almost 700 million in revenue square is paying a pretty hefty multiple of that moser they are i was looking at this earlier just to try to keep things in context and because you had mentioned affirm i mean affirm very similar business focusing on a little bit of a different market opportunity as you said but regardless affirm generally the same business pretty similar size as far as revenue at this point similar models and that they are still working toward profitability and whatnot but you look at affirm affirm 15 billion company today just to see the premium that afterpay is getting versus something like affirm it s noteworthy i think for a few different reasons it makes you wonder exactly what they saw in afterpay really to offer such a premium perhaps part of that is afterpay and other founder led business it seems to be two very similar cultures though that s one thing that really stood out to me with afterpay and with square very similar cultures and reasons for existing focusing on economic empowerment and economic inclusion and equality acquisitions always present a fair share of risk when it comes to merging two cultures it feels like maybe these are cultures that should mesh together fairly well frankel there are a bunch of good reasons i mean i read through the investor presentation there there are some good reasons they want to integrate afterpay into both the seller side of the business and cash app make it available for all in square seller accounts which is in the millions i mentioned afterpay has 98 000 active merchant accounts square has three or four million i m not sure exactly they don t really announced that number but it s in the millions they want to make afterpay service available to every merchant on square s ecosystem they want to integrate it with the cash app to make it easier for buyers to make their payments and things like that they re going to be a buy now pay later service because square is focused on not just online businesses they re focused on in person merchants as well buy now pay later will be available to anyone who accepts square for in person purchases which is a pretty unique feature afterpay i mentioned they only have 98 000 merchant accounts most of afterpay s customers are large customers i mentioned affirm has peloton afterpay also has a lot of enterprise clients square would love to build relationships with bigger clients they break this down in their earnings reports every quarter how much of their revenue comes from small businesses mid sized businesses larger businesses the larger business portion has been steadily increasing over time this could give that little shot in the arm it expands their merchant relationships on both sides it s a pretty big market that they could go after moser very big market indeed what do you think as far as and we ll move on to squares earnings here in just a minute that old saying sometimes it s easier to buy it than to build it it feels like in this case maybe square felt like you know what this is going to be something that s going to be easier to buy than to build but the flip side of that is i don t know it feels like maybe building it wouldn t have been all that tough if that was something they felt like doing we ve seen paypal build out their buy now pay later offering and they re witnessing a ton of success i guess i wonder do you feel like square may be felt a little pressure here a little pressure on the time side they needed to get into this market opportunity sooner rather than later frankel maybe that s the really the big reason i could think of is time because you mentioned paypal i promise you paypal didn t spend 29 billion to build out their own buy now pay later platform moser no i don t think they did frankel that seems like a big price to pay the natural question is why couldn t square have just built it themselves if they had that much money to throw at it and sees that much value in the buy now pay later business i mean obviously they re not starting from zero and now this buys them 700 million of annual revenue moser absolutely frankel they re not starting from zero but that s a hefty price to pay i m not totally sold on it i like the deal i don t like the number i think that s a hefty price to pay
cnn by john harwood the trumpist republican party has shown it will toy with democracy now president joe biden is testing its willingness to play with economic fire the test comes in the upcoming

republicans have vowed not to provide any it s a credible threat the danger represents a relatively recent development in american history for decades the statutory requirement that congress authorize

customary political slap fight into a brass knuckles brawl their initial refusal to raise the debt limit in 2011 triggered a political and economic crisis it made financial markets plummet and forced the first ever downgrade in us government debt costing taxpayers billions in higher borrowing costs the ransom republicans demanded to end it deep federal spending cuts proved so unrealistic that

these industrial companies face setbacks but remain long term winners whether you re in retirement or simply looking to generate a little extra income you ve come to the right place stocks that pay dividends can be a great way to combine reliable returns with long term upside and with dividend stocks becoming increasingly hard to find any discount the market provides is helpful with that we asked some of our contributors which dividend stocks they think are on sale now caterpillar cat 1 20 3m mmm 0 12 and american electric power aep 0 30 caught their attention here s what makes each a great buy now a dividend aristocrat poised for a breakout daniel foelber caterpillar shares of caterpillar are down more than 13 over the past three months despite posting impressive earnings the heavy equipment manufacturer has hit a rough patch on wall street the main culprit isn t the company s results but expectations in q2 2020 all of caterpillar s segments were hurting as north and south american sales plummeted but things have turned around since then caterpillar s q2 2021 revenue and net income are both down around a mere 10 from their 2019 figures which is impressive considering the business is still in recovery mode metric q2 2021 q2 2020 q2 2019 revenue 12 9 billion 10 billion 14 4 billion earnings per share 2 56 0 84 2 83 caterpillar is still not offering full year guidance but it did hint during its q2 2021 conference call that the third quarter should have strong revenue combined with its first half results caterpillar could be in for a pretty good year caterpillar s stock will look a whole lot cheaper if it can continue to steamroll past expectations however some context is key caterpillar is a cyclical stock its current valuation isn t based on its past results but rather on how business could boom as the economy recovers dependence on the global energy materials and industrial economies has been a double edged sword that leaves caterpillar vulnerable to economic declines but perfectly positioned to capitalize on booms the issue is that caterpillar s last uptrend was largely interrupted by the u s china trade war right now it s in the process of gaining back its momentum first half results gave us a taste of what that boom could look like but sustained growth may be needed to appease wall street s appetite momentum could be derailed by pandemic related interruptions macroeconomic factors oil and gas prices or a slew of other unknowns in short caterpillar stock needs to prove it s worth all the hype but given the company s track record it very well could be in the meantime investors can take solace in the fact that caterpillar is a dividend aristocrat meaning it has increased its annual payout for over 25 consecutive years shares of caterpillar yield 2 1 at the time of this writing 3m faces headwinds but the stock is a good value lee samaha 3m the industrial conglomerate isn t the highest quality industrial stock out there but it is a great dividend option for investors the dividend aristocrat s nearly 3 dividend yield is very well covered by the company s free cash flow as such 3m s dividend is not in doubt and there s ample room for management to increase it that said there are some question marks around the company the rise in raw material prices is pressuring profit margins and 3m faces potential liability from its production of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance pfas chemicals still 3m looks significantly undervalued next to its peers the market appears to have given 3m a valuation that provides a very wide margin of safety for the pfas risk moreover 3m s end markets are all turning up in line with the improving economy so revenue growth is likely to offset margin pressure as the company goes through 2021 all told 3m still offers investors the prospect of an excellent dividend yield and long term growth prospects that s usually good enough for value orientated investors go american to charge up your passive income scott levine american electric power looking to electrify your portfolio with a high yield opportunity american electric power with its 3 3 dividend yield belongs on your radar the company operates the largest electricity transmission network in the united states providing power to approximately 5 5 million customers american electricity power s service territory makes up about 200 000 square miles spanning 11 states while the company hasn t achieved the noble status of becoming a dividend aristocrat its 11 years of growing its annual dividend is certainly noteworthy from 2011 through 2020 in fact the company has increased its payout to shareholders at a 4 9 compound annual growth rate conservative investors wary of whether the company has jeopardized its financial health to satisfy shareholders can rest easily over the past four years american electric power has averaged a payout ratio of 65 forecasting 2021 earnings per share of 4 53 to 4 73 the company seems confident that it will achieve bottom line growth over last year when it reported eps of 4 42 but that s not what s powering my belief that this stock deserves a closer look as momentum behind the infrastructure bill builds american electric power seems poised to benefit considerably besides the 73 billion in spending to upgrade the electric grid the infrastructure bill targets 7 5 billion for developing a nationwide ev charging infrastructure over the past few days shares have dipped a little the stock is now trading around 5 below its 52 week range but it seems like a bargain currently shares are valued at 18 9 times trailing earnings a discount to their five year average multiple of 27 3 and that s not the only perspective from which they seem attractively priced the stock is trading at about 2 8 times sales representing a discount to the s p 500 which has a 3 2 sales multiple
for years wall street was a top destination for star students like tashrima hossain a class president at stanford university with ambitions to change the world hossain had interned for nonprofits and was seriously considering going to graduate school but she figured a detour to wall street would teach her useful skills and provide networking opportunities and the six figure paycheck wouldn t hurt so she took an entry level job at j p morgan her goal was to do it for two years but hossain soon found herself putting in long hours crunching numbers in excel spreadsheets and preparing powerpoint presentations for more senior bankers seven months later she quit i kind of thought about it as a means to an end but when i started i realized that it wasn t necessarily the means to an end that i wanted hossain remembers preston gannaway for npr preston gannaway for npr frustrated by the long hours at j p morgan tashrima hossain decided to quit her high paying job there early she is photographed here in san francisco calif on wednesday august 11 2021 wall street has a big problem on its hands it s experiencing a year of record profits yet many of the young people it needs to fill its talent pool are having doubts about whether the work involved upwards of 80 hours per week is worth it it s a talent war and wall street is fighting hard drew pascarella a lecturer at cornell university s business school calls it a talent war in a fast improving jobs market star students have a lot of options and financial firms are vying with tech companies and private equity for top talent wall street is responding with their weapon of choice compensation most banks including bank of america morgan stanley and goldman sachs boosted pay in recent weeks for young employees and now offer starting salaries of at least 100 000 the pay being offered to junior bankers many straight out of college can sound obscene it can now surpass 150 000 when factoring in a performance bonus or roughly five times the per capita income in the u s i think the investment banks are watching each other and they re also watching other highly competitive industries pascarella says they want to make sure that they re staying on par but it s unclear if more money will be enough to improve recruitment and retention at investment banks especially in the midst of a pandemic that deprives young bankers from the networking and the on site learning that have been essential to the job a few months ago about a dozen young bankers at goldman sachs created a powerpoint presentation that detailed their desperation the bankers said they worked 98 hours per week on average and they slept five hours per night they said their mental health and physical health had declined that document went viral when a more than 100 000 salary is still not enough wall street recruiter anthony keizner a managing director at odyssey search partners has heard similar stories before during the pandemic some junior bankers stayed at their apartments in big cities and continued to work but others returned home and ended up hearing plenty from family and friends angela weiss afp via getty images angela weiss afp via getty images a wall st sign hangs at the new york stock exchange nyse at wall street on march 23 2021 in new york city often keizner says the comments they heard sounded something like this hold on you ve been sitting there it looks like for 48 hours straight with your laptop on the sofa like are they paying you enough to do this and after a few months people began to address that question by saying well maybe not keizner adds wall street is aware of the perception problem on its hands david solomon the ceo of goldman sachs responded to the complaints and criticism hurled by its junior employees in an earnings callwith analysts in this 24 7 connected world we have to help those transitioning into the workforce to understand that goldman sachs is a place where we work very hard to serve our clients but all need to be thoughtful about personal resilience and well being solomon said the goldman ceo pledged to take concrete actions including additional hiring reallocating resources and pursuing stricter enforcements of boundaries and he committed to enforcing one rule in particular prohibiting most work on saturdays to ensure its junior bankers have at least one day a week off meanwhile bank of america sent messages of encouragement to its junior bankers according to an internal memo obtained by npr announcing pay increases for analysts associates and vice presidents your efforts and wellbeing are critical to our success the heads of bank of america s global corporate and investment banking wrote yet doubts persist about whether wall street s efforts to raise pay and address morale will be enough hossain for one says a raise would not have persuaded her to stay at j p morgan she says she wanted the opportunity to build things to feel like she s making an actual impact today hossain is at facebook working on something that interests her more public policy as a program manager she is involved in the company s efforts to improve election integrity after the company came under intense scrutiny over its actions during the 2016 election even if i could have had an increase in salary i don t think that was enough for me to stay she says

you might be thinking about making reservations at a restaurant this weekend but before you smash the confirm button on your favorite app you could be having second or eighth thoughts news about the delta variant of the coronavirus breakthrough infections among vaccinated people and changing guidelines on masking are adding levels of uncertainty that we once assumed were behind us as americans again grapple with the question of whether they should dine out public health experts and epidemiologists agree on one thing there is no such thing as zero risk there are only degrees of risk no matter your vaccination status or the damage the delta variant has done to your community we talked to scientists and industry experts about what diners should know about this new phase saskia popescu infectious disease epidemiologist and assistant professor at george mason university likes to frame the question as a risk assessment she says you should look at three factors before deciding whether you should dine at a restaurant your vaccination status the level of coronavirus transmission in your community as determined by the centers for disease control and prevention s data tracker and your personal risk assessment are you immunocompromised or do you share your home with someone who is vulnerable or can t be vaccinated yet popescu for example resides in phoenix in maricopa county where the transmission rate is high which really sucks she said because it s 110 degrees outside she doesn t feel like dining under the summer sun where a customer can feel as fried as a bucket of chicken i really am just not leaning into dining indoors right now popescu said being indoors is a high risk activity when you re dining because you re eating and you re drinking you have no mask on there s a bunch of other people whose vaccine status you don t really know and who are also unmasked you re there for prolonged periods of time i look at all of those and that s how i make an informed decision so it s not black and white advertisement but that is popescu s situation based on her vaccinated status vaxxed her community and her personal level of risk tolerance everyone will have different factors to weigh vaccination is being required a growing number of restaurants have adopted policies requiring employees and in some cases customers to show proof that they ve been vaccinated in a big shift new york city this week announced that visitors to gyms and indoor dining establishments would have to be vaccinated starting in september such rules might feel like another patch on the country s crazy quilt of covid 19 rules for diners but experts say they serve two purposes they might make dining rooms safer and it s part of a larger movement to nudge vaccination holdouts into getting the shot the more societal pressure we put on people to get vaccine the better said jennifer kolker a professor at drexel university s dornsife school of public health of course there are those who haven t gotten it either because they can t or they don t have access and those people deserve our help and compassion but for the other two thirds who just refuse well i m tired of people who did the right thing being punished the best case scenario advertisement based on interviews with several experts the ideal dining situation would look something like this you are vaccinated the three major vaccines are highly effective against the worst effects of covid and critical illness experts say you are dining with others who are vaccinated and none of them are showing signs of sickness you are eating either outside the best situation or in a restaurant that is well ventilated not packed with diners and located in a community that has a low transmission rate you wear a mask whenever talking to a server or moving about the restaurant if the servers are wearing masks and if they re vaccinated you re not going to have a lot of ping ponging of the virus back and forth inside the restaurant said peter chin hong professor of medicine and infectious disease specialist at the university of california at san francisco advertisement you re basically making a cocoon of safety but that doesn t mean there is zero risk just like when you wear a seat belt you can still get into an accident he adds the worst case scenario you live in a community with a substantial or high level of coronavirus transmission based on the cdc s data tracker your community has a low rate of fully vaccinated residents you are not vaccinated yourself or are dining with people who are not vaccinated you re eating inside a restaurant where the owners have returned to 100 percent capacity and maskless diners and servers are packed together in a poorly ventilated space with no windows advertisement you have no idea the vaccination status of anyone else in the restaurant including the employees you live with someone who is immunocompromised elderly or unvaccinated if you re in an area that you re at moderate risk in your county but everywhere else is substantial or high i d say maybe that might be an indicator that things are potentially increasing and it might be a safer decision to move outside popescu said the murky middle the trouble for people eager to dine out is that things are rarely so black and white since the beginning of the pandemic public health officials have warned diners about the potential of restaurants to spread the virus they re enclosed spaces where people spend long periods of time without masks potentially spreading droplets and aerosols into the environment threatening other diners a few studies have essentially reinforced these concerns including a south korean report that showed two diners were infected in a matter of minutes inside one restaurant advertisement the restaurant industry predictably is offering reassurances larry lynch the senior vice president of certification and operations for the national restaurant association notes that through the pandemic no restaurant has been the site of a superspreader event the way other settings have even when restaurants were taking a lot of hits you didn t see systemic outbreaks among places that followed our guidelines he said the current situation of course is different from when the american economy started to reopen last year millions of americans are vaccinated and ready to return to regularly scheduled activities but the highly transmissible delta variant has cast doubt on a return to normal infection rates and hospitalizations have spiked and not just among the unvaccinated your vaccination is an umbrella said chin hong the infectious disease specialist at ucsf when it s raining it can shelter you but when there is a big thunderstorm you can t always dodge all the rain in other words chin hong said vaccinated folks have to be mindful of the conditions when venturing out in public look for restaurants that require masks mandate vaccinations for employees or maybe even require diners to show proof of vaccination check the level of coronavirus transmission in your county and refrain from indoor dining if the levels are high or substantial especially if you have vulnerable people in your pod even if you are vaccinated new evidence has shown you could pick up the virus without knowing it and potentially transmit it to say your unvaccinated children at home but diners also play a role in creating a safe space they should wear a mask when talking with servers and moving about the restaurant they should avoid crowded spaces and stay at home when they show any signs of illness even if they are vaccinated experts say advertisement the nra is continuing to advise restaurants to find ways to encourage employees to get vaccinated but it has stopped short of calling for mandatory jabs and it recommends that employees wear masks regardless of their vaccination status restaurants across the country are imposing various protocols depending on the rules governing their city or state and many restaurant owners are going beyond what s mandated so lynch advises that would be diners check out a restaurant they re thinking about visiting even if they ve recently dined there to make sure they re still comfortable with the setup check out the establishment s website and social media or give them a phone call other things to consider it s important to remember that no matter where you are dining out isn t what it used to be the delta variant has thrown another curveball at restaurants which were already struggling to find their footing suddenly they have to answer more questions should they require vaccines for their employees or for their customers can they handle an uptick in takeout while doing in person service should they spread out their tables a bit more this comes as they face worker shortages and frequent glitches in supply chains that can have them scrambling to adjust the menu or stock supplies and customers might be snippier than usual these days too all of which makes it harder to provide great service said restaurant consultant larry reinstein it s frustrating for diners and for restaurants right now he said we don t have an adequate supply chain we re figuring we re going to be shorthanded for us to be able to deliver on a great customer experience is hard enough when the guests are happy larry lynch of the national restaurant association said diners shouldn t be afraid to talk to management if they see employees or other customers not complying with protocols it s the same as if your steak wasn t cooked right he said to minimize potential conflict it s best to know before you go do you need a reservation is there a time limit on tables has your favorite dish been nixed from the menu because an ingredient isn t available it s smart to juice up your phone so you can scan the qr codes that have become common and bring proof of your vaccination status if it s required reinstein s overall advice keep your standards high and your spirits too don t go in not expecting a good experience he said but do go in rooting for one and just be happy and kind send questions comments to the editors

by john harwood the trumpist republican party has shown it will toy with democracy now president joe biden is testing its willingness to play with economic fire the test comes in the upcoming showdown over raising the federal debt limit a painful political chore that periodically falls to congress when the treasury exhausts the amount of borrowing that lawmakers had previously authorized performing it is necessary for government to pay its bills and avert a destabilizing financial crisis the white house seeks cooperation from partisan adversaries as well as allies in congress so far republicans have vowed not to provide any it s a credible threat the danger represents a relatively recent development in american history for decades the statutory requirement that congress authorize additional borrowing has provided a venue for harmless skirmishes in which the party out of power flays the party in power for irresponsible borrowing one example march 2006 when it was president george w bush s turn to ask congress for a debt limit increases first term democratic sen barack obama denounced the failure of leadership that made it necessary obama and every other senate democrat opposed bush s request but the republican majority was large enough to approve it without threatening the economy by the time obama reached the oval office however tea party republicans had turned the customary political slap fight into a brass knuckles brawl their initial refusal to raise the debt limit in 2011 triggered a political and economic crisis it made financial markets plummet and forced the first ever downgrade in us government debt costing taxpayers billions in higher borrowing costs the ransom republicans demanded to end it deep federal spending cuts proved so unrealistic that congress repeatedly abandoned them congressional republicans dropped hostage taking once their own party recaptured the white house as much as democrats loathed president donald trump they did not stand in the way of debt limit hikes on his watch including after winning the house in 2018 biden s full court press that s what biden administration officials say must be done again as with every white house they note that a debt limit increase doesn t authorize new spending but merely preserves america s full faith and credit by permitting payment of debts already incurred the economic consequences of failing to do so would be catastrophic which is why that s an unacceptable outcome national economic council director brian deese told cnn in an interview last week in a statement treasury secretary janet yellen warned of irreparable harm to the us economy and the livelihoods of all americans senate minority leader mitch mcconnell insists that democrats shoulder the burden on their own they could do it by including a debt limit hike in the 3 5 trillion human infrastructure bill they seek under special budget rules that will sidestep a republican filibuster at the biden s team behest senate democrats decided not to do that they fear it might fatally weigh down their social spending bill and want to defuse the debt limit as a dangerous partisan weapon the pattern of rising republican aggression suggests that won t be easy when the republican revolution made newt gingrich the speaker in 1995 the house scuttled a procedural maneuver democrats had used to avoid debt limit headaches for the previous 16 years as they sought to thwart obama some congressional republicans went so far as to argue falsely that a federal debt default could be managed by selective prioritization of government s bills in reality the consequences would ripple throughout the american economy of 50 republican senators 46 signed a letter last week promising not to help biden raise the debt limit since this is a problem created by democrat spending in fact tax cuts and spending increases boosted the national debt by roughly 7 trillion or about one third during trump s single term as president it is the republicans who keep reinforcing misinformation for voters observed tony fratto who served as a top aide in the white house and treasury department under president bush a 2021 calling card for republicans in some ways misinformation has become the gop s 2021 calling card after tolerating trump s false claims that he won the 2020 election congressional republicans have stood by while state level gop officials change voting and election administration rules only six republican senators voted to create an independent commission to investigate the january 6 insurrection allowing that proposal to die by filibuster that sounds auspicious for biden s ability to persuade 10 republicans to overcome a debt limit filibuster this fall yet the white house has reason to hope that they re not going to let us default as the president put it last week senate democrats currently plan to attach a debt limit hike to a september spending bill that would keep the government running as his party has grown increasingly radicalized mcconnell has consistently shown an aversion to self inflicted wounds he displayed pragmatism last week in joining 18 republican senators to back biden s popular hard infrastructure bill the combination of gop triggered shutdown and debt crisis could jeopardize his hope of recapturing the senate in 2022 i d like to believe there are 10 republicans who will vote for this said fratto they need to find a fix the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
these tech companies cut their shareholders a check on a quarterly basis the technology sector is filled with high growth companies vying for market share rather than pay dividends many of these businesses prefer to reinvest excess cash in their operations a strategy that makes sense given the quickly changing nature of technology however if you re willing to do a little digging it s possible to find tech companies that buck the trend with that in mind we asked three motley fool contributors to write about tech stocks with strong dividends keep reading to see why texas instruments txn taiwan semiconductor tsm 0 69 and cisco systems csco 0 01 made the list the analog chipmaker trevor jennewine texas instruments texas instruments is a semiconductor manufacturer that specializes in analog chips and embedded processors the former convert real world signals like sound temperature and pressure into digital data and the latter handle specific tasks such as powering calculators home appliances and office machinery these chips aren t as flashy or expensive as high performance central processing units cpus or graphics processing units gpus but they are just as critical in fact analog chips are used in all electronic devices and embedded processors are used in most more importantly texas instruments is the industry leader in both markets of course if you follow the semiconductor space you re probably aware of the global chip shortage despite these headwinds texas instruments business is firing on all cylinders revenue growth accelerated to 29 and 41 in q1 and q2 2021 respectively driving strong double digit earnings growth in both cases so what s the secret behind that performance texas instruments has a few noteworthy advantages first it handles the majority of semiconductor manufacturing assembly and testing in house which translates into fine tuned control of its supply chain second it uses a 300 millimeter wafer production process which costs about 40 less than the 200 millimeter process used by most competitors finally the company makes 80 000 different products for over 100 000 customers meaning its business is highly diversified collectively those advantages have helped texas instruments maintain its industry leading position in fact the company captured roughly 19 of the 55 billion analog chip market last year more than double the market share of the next closest competitor and its financial performance has been just as impressive over the long term between 2004 and 2020 free cash flow per share grew at 12 per year allowing the company to grow its dividend at an annualized rate of 26 for 17 consecutive years currently the quarterly payout sits at 1 02 per share or 4 08 on an annualized basis representing 56 of free cash flow put another way there is plenty of room to grow that dividend in the coming years not to mention the potential for share price appreciation that s why this dividend paying tech stock looks like a smart investment the most important company you ve never heard of jeremy bowman taiwan semiconductor when investors think tech stocks they tend to gravitate to faang stocks like apple or high priced cloud computing stocks but semiconductor companies deserve your attention as well the global chip shortage has made it clear how crucial these companies are to the global economy and none more so than taiwan semiconductor or tsmc tsmc is one of the world s most valuable enterprises with a market cap of 600 billion and its list of customers includes tech giants like apple broadcom and nvidia all of whom design chips for its foundries moreover tsmc has the largest capacity among the world s semiconductor manufacturers and it s a vital supplier of chips for the automotive and smartphone industries according to reporting from the wall street journal it makes 92 of the world s most sophisticated chips and its size and scale give it manifest competitive advantages in an industry that requires heavy capital expenditures taiwan semiconductor is also highly profitable generating a profit margin of 39 last year or 17 6 billion on revenue of 45 5 billion its recent results have been strong as well with sales jumping 28 to 13 3 billion in the second quarter chinese stocks have taken a hit in recent weeks after a government crackdown on the for profit education sector where authorities essentially ordered tutoring companies like new oriental education and tal education group to be non profits the chinese government has also slapped tech giants like alibaba and didi global on the wrist with fines and other restrictions however tsmc is unlikely to see such a backlash since the chinese government has made hardware technologies like semiconductors a strategic priority tsmc s base in taiwan a semi independent republic also gives it some daylight from the chinese government though political tensions have shaken the stock in the past for dividend investors tsmc doesn t disappoint either as the company currently pays a dividend yield of 1 5 and it has the cash and profitability to support further hikes dividends are rare in the tech industry and even better tsmc seems to have something for every type of investor income growth and a wide economic moat that gives the company monopoly like power in a key industry and huge profit margins the networking effect eric volkman cisco systems no matter what trends come and go in the tech sector the world is going to need networking equipment and software supplying much of that will be cisco the reigning and longtime king of networking while networking isn t the newest or most attractive tech sector it is essential and that keeps tens of billions of dollars flowing into cisco s coffers every year with its size the company benefits from economies of scale and as a dominant player in the market it has pricing power too these traits keep profitability high with annual net margins typically in the 20 plus range while revenue has been rather stagnant over the past few years the cash keeps flooding in for cisco on an annual basis it hasn t fallen below 12 4 billion across the past five years a level that frequently tops the company s profitability it s also more than twice what cisco requires to pay its regular quarterly dividend ah yes the dividend cisco initiated it in early 2011 can it really be a full decade it has not only paid it without fail in every quarter since then it has raised it at least once per year so across the 10 years a payout that began at 0 06 per share is now more than six times higher at 0 37 that combined with cisco s status as a respected but generally not beloved tech stock like apple makes for a meaty dividend yield at the moment that yield is 2 6 which beats the pants off apple s 0 6 and database deity oracle s 1 4 it also compares favorably to that of celebrated dividend payers in other segments like consumer goods granted cisco is considered to be running a more mature business than the still growing apple or any one of a number of other tech dividend payers but i don t think anyone should infer from this that the top line will remain still cisco s secret weapon just might be its security products the revenue for which rose by 13 year over year in the most recent quarter that was nearly three times the rate of cisco s applications segment more than double its core infrastructure platforms category and well above the 8 growth in services of all those businesses security is by far the smallest in terms of revenue that combined with the strong potential it has particularly in a world losing sleep over hacking attacks could become a major top line growth driver in the very near future even if it doesn t cisco is sure to remain a cash generating machine and a company that prioritizes its dividend i feel there s much for investors to gain by owning this stock and clocking its regular payout
if you ve read any financial news outlet for long enough you likely know that america is in the middle of a retirement crisis however the crisis isn t affecting everyone while many seniors are understandably struggling due to an inability to save or a forced early retirement spurred by health reasons this is simply not the experience of others in 2016 a merrill lynch study found that 75 of adults aged 65 and above reported often feeling happy the highest of any cohort and having the lowest rates of anxiety last year a u s census department study found that the poverty rate among adults aged 65 were lower than that of adults aged 18 to 64 and nearly 40 lower than that of americans under 18 and while social security is a key reason for lower poverty rates among seniors with some estimates noting it led to a 31 7 percentage point reduction in poverty in elderly populations another study found that most seniors were able to maintain or increase their spendable income after claiming social security for many seniors the golden years are truly golden my mother s wise financial move count my mother among the group of seniors whose fortunes have improved we lived in what could be favorably considered a lower middle income household with her being a single parent for the bulk of my childhood with little external support understandably my mom was forced to work multiple jobs and could spend little on herself the strong work ethic forced on her continues to this very day she still works at her full time job despite being at full social security age because she likes staying busy when she does retire she will receive a pension from her employer and be one of the seniors above able to increase her spendable income her situation has changed but her thrifty mindset has not now that she s found herself with extra spending money she has decided to gift a portion to her grandson my son by contributing to his uniform transfers to minors act utma account perhaps i m biased but i believe it s the smartest move she could make with her social security check three reasons why gifting is smart there are a few reasons to gift money to your grandchildren you are allowed to gift up to 15 000 per child every year without filing for the gift tax 30 000 if married which reduces the amount of your assets eligible for the estate tax federal estate taxes only kick in above 11 7 million but many states have lower estate tax exemption levels as a bonus by transferring directly to your grandkids you skip a generation and prevent your kids from having the same estate issues if they retire wealthy although everyone should have a will and transfer of assets plan in place many do not gifting money to your grandkids while alive helps to ensure your directives are followed and simplifies later estate planning there s a major factor that albert einstein is rumored to have called the eighth wonder of the world compound interest my 3 year old son will have decades to allow his investments to grow and longer if i do a good job of instilling my love of investing for comparison the chart below allows you to easily calculate the value of an investment today based on expected annualized returns and years invested for simplicity s sake i used common milestones in a person s life as age references to see the wonder of compounding simply multiply the figures inside the box by the principal amount of the prospective gift for example a single dollar invested with a 35 year return of 10 annualized would grow to be 28 10 therefore our son s utma account of 20 000 growing under the same conditions would be worth 20 000 x 28 10 562 000 pre tax even modest 6 annual returns will create a nest egg of 154 000 with no further contributions though my wife and i do contribute monthly our son would be nearly 40 at that time and even the lower amount stacks up favorably to what the average 40 year old currently has saved 18 years 21 years 35 years 65 years 10 5 56 7 40 28 10 490 37 8 4 00 5 03 14 79 148 78 6 2 85 3 40 7 69 44 14 admittedly the figures above don t include taxes or fees but we re attempting to limit both by avoiding actively managed mutual funds or excessive trading in fact we re investing my son s utma across three low fee broad based etfs the largest holding is the ishares core s p growth etf iusg 0 05 with about a 55 stake followed by the ishares s p 500 etf ivv 0 25 with a 43 stake and a small starter position in the vanguard extended market index fund etf vxf 0 21 not for everyone it s important to note this strategy isn t for everyone seniors facing retirement shortfalls would be better off using their social security money to fund their own retirement other seniors are wary of the limited nature of utma accounts and want to establish other wealth transfer vehicles like trusts finally there are individuals that want to leave wealth to charities or other organizations instead of their families that said your grandchildren have the greatest asset in investing time and a small gift now could make them a fortune in the years ahead it s a smart move but as a grandparent you already know that
cnn it may not be as long or as well known as russia s iconic trans siberian railway but international recognition is long overdue for the 1 394 kilometer 865 mile trans iranian railway on july 25 the railway was one of 33 new sites awarded world heritage status by the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco joining world famous locations such as venice machu picchu in peru yellowstone national park in the us and ecuador s galapagos islands linking the persian gulf with the caspian sea the strategically important project was a relative latecomer in railway terms it opened in 1938 after 11 years of hugely challenging construction although not widely known outside iran today it can legitimately claim to be one of the greatest engineering feats of the 20th century the railway which carries both freight and passenger trains runs roughly north east from bandar e eman khomeyni formerly bandar shahpur via ahvaz qom and tehran to bandar torkaman previously bandar shah no fewer than 224 tunnels total more than 76 kilometers in length while 174 viaducts and 186 smaller bridges carry the railway across deep ravines and river valleys as it climbs to two 2 134 meter 7 000 foot summits one of 33 sites added to the unesco world heritage list this year the 1 394 kilometer trans iranian railway is an engineering marvel from hossein javadi unesco negotiating two formidable mountain ranges required not just steep gradients but ingenious civil engineering to gain height via spiral tunnels and giant leaps over isolated valleys in fiercely hot rugged terrain unsuited to railway building countless geological and engineering challenges had to be overcome to complete the line some tunnels had to be abandoned during construction after salt and gypsum deposits were found forcing new routes to be located while another tunnel through volcanic pumice could be neither blasted nor dug out with picks and shovels another tunnel encountered a cavernous void under the mountains a problem solved by building a bridge inside the tunnel day to day problems included a lack of fresh water for mixing good quality mortar and concrete and keeping workers and train crews hydrated lengthy gradients take the single track railway high into the mountains on either side of tehran which itself sits on a high plateau highlights for those able to experience it include the se khat tala three golden lines spiral where the line can be seen at three different heights thanks to loops and tunnels that help it to gain height and the spectacular veresk bridge in the alborz mountains built in 1934 35 by an italian contractor the latter soars 110 meters above the valley floor on a 66 meter masonry arch local folklore claims that to assuage fears that the slender structure would not be able to handle the weight of the trains its italian chief engineer and his family were instructed to stand underneath for the passage of the first train spectacular scenery ancient sites tim littler is the founder of uk based golden eagle luxury trains which ran 19 tours to iran between 2014 and 2019 the company included a journey on the trans iranian line on its heart of persia trip from tehran immediately after leaving pol e safid at the northern end of the route the line starts climbing on a ruling gradient of 1 in 35 for around 65 miles limiting speeds to just 20 mph 32 kph says littler during this section the train passes over the famous veresk bridge and several loops and horseshoe curves where the line doubles back on itself inside a tunnel emerging higher up the mountain a freight train passes through lorestan on the trans iranian railways bisheh dorud route from hossein javadi unesco there are more attractions on the line south west of tehran as it continues through qom and climbs through the nuclear center of arak to the summit at noor abad he adds from this spectacular 220 mile section through doround and andimeshk it s possible to visit the ancient city of susa dating back to 4 200bc and two other world heritage sites the ancient hydraulic water system of shustar and the elamite complex at chogha zanbil abandoned as long ago as 640bc he says a symbol of modernization the trans iranian line was the first part of an ambitious network planned by the then leader of the country reza shah pahlevi as he strove to modernize iran s communications and economy in the 1930s other lines were planned or built to link tehran to the soviet union turkey and pakistan which was then british india however construction of the costly north south railway estimated at around 39 million at the time of completion more than 2 7 billion in today s figures weighed heavily on the developing nation making it widely unpopular and eventually contributing to the shah s downfall early proposals for a railway across iran linking the russian empire and british india were mooted in the late 19th and early 20th centuries but diplomatic concerns about the balance of power in the region britain s indifference and russia s war with japan in 1905 focused attention and finite funds elsewhere construction of the trans iranian railway was a collaborative effort involving contractors from many countries three lions hulton archive getty images eventually the german backed baghdad railway linking europe with the middle east via the ottoman empire threatened to increase berlin s influence in the region by building an extension to tehran russia and britain were forced into action but in 1914 with surveying and preparation work underway world war i intervened five years later the world had changed germany had been subdued russia was under new management and iran was technically independent albeit weak and virtually bankrupt despite this the trans iranian railway was seen as a vital tool for modernizing the country and overcoming poor communications across a sparsely settled region when it finally got underway construction of the railway was a remarkable collaborative effort by 43 contractors from many countries including the us uk germany and denmark unusually for a major asian railway of the time it was funded entirely by iran itself it was heralded as a symbol of the independent country s modernization and growing national confidence but financing the project from taxes on commodities such as sugar and tea was also a buttress against foreign exploitation especially by the british empire and soviet union an international syndicate the syndicat du chemin du fer en perse undertook the construction of the initial test lines with an american team starting from the south and a german consortium working from the caspian sea coast to the foothills of the alborz mountains at shahi delays to payments led to the americans pulling out in 1930 and it took three years to find a replacement in the form of danish construction company kampsax the danes sub contracted the project in 43 lots to companies from europe the us and iran overseeing this diverse workforce kampsax managed to complete the line by august 1938 under budget and almost a year ahead of schedule to power trains over the demanding route beyer peacock co of manchester in england supplied four huge articulated garratt steam locomotives these 14 axle behemoths were similar to machines built for british colonial lines in africa and australia combining enormous power with the flexibility to negotiate tightly curved tracks with severe weight limits german railway engineering giants krupp and henschel also supplied conventional heavy steam locomotives although by 1941 many of these were already out of action requiring repairs or modification to withstand the rigors of desert operation in august 1941 just three years after the completion of the showcase project britain and russia invaded iran on the pretext of foiling a german backed coup in reality britain had moved to secure one of the empire s primary sources of oil and establish a wartime supply route to the soviet union via the caspian sea the following month the southern section between bandar shahpur and tehran was taken over by the british army s royal engineers regiment while the line north of the capital was under soviet control new railway yards extra locomotives and rolling stock and experienced railwaymen from britain and the us drove a massive increase in capacity during the war the trans iranian railway includes 224 tunnels 174 viaducts and 186 smaller bridges from hossein javadi unesco in 1941 just one freight train a day could use the line moving less than 1 000 tons of freight two years later with the us army corps of transportation usatc now in charge this had increased to 5 400 tons a day heat dust altitude and a shortage of water for steam locomotive boilers and for their crews made the railway a very harsh environment but by 1944 capacity was up to 6 489 tons per day thanks to the introduction of us built diesel locomotives and thousands of extra freight cars when the european conflict of world war ii ended in may 1945 aid convoys to russia ceased and usatc handed control of the trans iranian railway back to britain which quickly passed it on to iranian state railways predecessor of the current islamic republic of iran railways the future of iranian rail today despite decades of economic sanctions iran is investing heavily in expanding and upgrading its rail network almost 1 100 km of new railway has been completed over the last seven years linking provincial capitals to tehran construction began on the country s first high speed railway in 2015 linking tehran to isfahan via qom at speeds of up to 300km h a second high speed line between arak and qom is also under construction both projects are backed by chinese credit and engineering expertise in april 2020 a 3 56 billion deal was signed to build a 510 km electrified line branching away from the trans iranian railway at ahvaz and crossing the zagros mountains to isfahan china has become increasingly involved in iranian infrastructure as part of its belt and road initiative aimed at expanding its influence across the region in 2015 china unveiled plans for an ambitious 2 000 mile high speed railway from urumqi in xinjiang province to tehran via the capital cities of kazakhstan kyrgyzstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan as well as a new iran turkmenistan link and a standard gauge railway into afghanistan completed in december 2020 there is a proposal to reopen a line to azerbaijan creating a new corridor between iran russia and georgia work also continues on the astara rasht line along the western side of the caspian sea this will complete a north south corridor linking russia with the persian gulf a rail bridge across the river astaraçay border in astara is complete but the line currently terminates just inside iran the trans iranian railway connects the persian gulf with the caspian sea from hossein javadi unesco unesco world heritage status is a highly coveted title that puts a site firmly on the global tourism map it can help to deliver additional funding for maintenance and restoration work opens doors for expert advice and studies and potentially deliver a huge uplift in visitor numbers for some places the latter can become a double edged sword with over tourism threatening the very environment that brought them to unesco s attention in the first place that fate is unlikely to befall the trans iranian railway just yet visiting iran remains a tricky proposition for many foreigners and relationships with western nations continue to be strained however littler hopes to return when conditions allow taking his more adventurous customers back to enjoy the country s cultural and engineering highlights if and when the situation improves we would certainly look at returning to this wonderful destination he concludes during talks with iranian railway management a few years ago they voiced interest in running a tourist train between garmsar and pol e safid using a restored german steam locomotive i m sure that project has been put on ice but who knows what might happen if and when things improve for those able to experience it now or in the future this incredible railway offers an unforgettable journey across a country that few outsiders get the opportunity to see

defensive sectors made a comeback on friday along with a plunge in yields investors searching for another catalyst to maintain record highs friday saw yet another in a string of market records as both the and hit new closing highs albeit on thin summer trading it was the 48th record close for the spx since the start of 2021 recent rallies have been propelled by the reflation trade but it s unclear whether there s enough momentum for the current market paradigm to continue pushing equities higher in the week ahead it will likely depend on this coming week s us retail sales figures and the fomc minutes which will reveal the central bank s thinking on whether the economy is strong enough for the federal reserve to trim its bond buying program treasuries also accelerated after friday s release showed one of the largest drops on record to the lowest level for the index in almost a decade falling yields acted as a drag on the while boosting however the weaker greenback didn t stop from extending a decline why would investors increase their bets on safe haven treasuries even while adding to their risk asset positioning by buying into the most expensive stocks in history the key clue might be gleaned from the sectors that led that rally consecutive records worried investors thin summer trading the broad s p 500 index racked up its the fourth consecutive record in a row however the benchmark hit that record by clawing out a less than 0 2 gain on largely flat trading during the course of the final day of last week s trade and then with an up gap reminiscent of island reversals

closed well off friday s highs nearly wiping out any advance overall we see the dow s chart as considerably stronger than that of its s p 500 peer the dow recently completed a falling flag bullish after the preceding jump the continuation pattern was the device bulls used to complete an even larger bullish pattern an ascending triangle the was almost flat on friday eking out a 0 04 gain while on a weekly basis the tech heavy gauge was 0 1 in the negative the benchmark may have completed a rising wedge bearish after its 13 gain in just seven weeks the psychology behind the pattern is trader

extended for a second day the benchmark was down for the week as well 1 1 indeed the gauge could be facing more trouble ahead the russell 2000 is currently the only major index that hasn t scored a

small double bottom having found resistance by a death cross the university of michigan s preliminary sentiment index plunged to 70 2 dropping by 11 points to its lowest level since december 2011 this

hey there time traveller this article was published 14 08 2021 970 days ago so information in it may no longer be current kansas city mo ap there are plenty of places to turn for accurate information about covid 19 your physician local health departments the u s centers for disease control but not perhaps your local government s public comment session during a meeting of the st louis county council earlier this month opponents of a possible mask mandate made so many misleading comments about masks vaccines and covid 19 that youtube removed the video for violating its policies against false claims about the virus members of the county council joining over video chat participate in the pledge of allegiance at the start of a council meeting at the st louis county council chambers in clayton mo tuesday aug 3 2021 public forums before local school boards and city councils are the latest source of misinformation about covid 19 colter peterson st louis post dispatch via ap i hope no one is making any medical decisions based on what they hear at our public forums said county councilwoman lisa clancy who supports mask wearing and said she believes most of her constituents do too the video was restored but clancy s worries about the impact of that misinformation remain videos of local government meetings have emerged as the latest vector of covid 19 misinformation broadcasting misleading claims about masks and vaccines to millions and creating new challenges for internet platforms trying to balance the potential harm against the need for government openness the latest video to go viral features a local physician who made several misleading claims about covid 19 while addressing the mount vernon community school corporation in fortville indiana on aug 6 in his 6 minute remarks dr dan stock tells the board that masks don t work vaccines don t prevent infection and state and federal health officials don t follow the science the video has amassed tens of millions of online views and prompted the indiana state department of health to push back stock did not return multiple messages seeking comment here comes a doctor in suspenders who goes in front of the school board and basically says what some people are thinking the masks are b s vaccines don t work and the cdc is lying it can be very compelling to laypeople said dr zubin damania a california physician who received so many messages about the indiana clip that he created his own video debunking stock s claims damania hosts a popular online medical show under the name zdoggmd his video debunking stock s comments has been viewed more than 400 000 times so far he said that while there are legitimate questions about the effectiveness of mask requirements for children stock s broad criticism of masks and vaccines went too far youtube removed several similar videos of local government meetings in north carolina missouri kansas and washington state in bellingham washington officials responded by temporarily suspending public comment sessions the false claims in those videos were made during the portion of the meeting devoted to public comment local officials have no control over what is said at these forums and say that s part of the point in kansas youtube pulled video of the may school board meeting in the 27 000 student shawnee mission district in which parents and a state lawmaker called for the district to remove its mask mandate citing medical misinformation the district where a mask mandate remains in effect responded by ending livestreaming of the public comment period district spokesman david smith acknowledged that it has been challenging to balance making the board meetings accessible and not spreading fallacies it was hard for me to hear things in the board meeting that weren t true and to know that those were going out without contradiction smith said i am all about free speech but when that free speech endangers people s lives it is hard to sit through that after hearing from local officials youtube reversed its decision and put the videos back up earlier this month the company which is owned by google announced a change to its covid misinformation policy to allow exceptions for local government meetings though youtube may still remove content that uses remarks from public forums in an attempt to mislead while we have clear policies to remove harmful covid 19 misinformation we also recognize the importance of organizations like school districts and city councils using youtube to share recordings of open public forums even when comments at those forums may violate our policies company spokeswoman elena hernandez said the deluge of false claims about the virus has challenged other platforms too twitter and facebook each have their own policies on covid 19 misinformation and say that like youtube they attach labels to misleading content and remove the worst of it public comment sessions preceding local government meetings have long been known for sometimes colorful remarks from local residents but before the internet if someone were to drone on about fluoride in the drinking water for instance their comments weren t likely to become national news now thanks to the internet and social media the misleading musings of a local doctor speaking before a school board can compete for attention with the recommendations of the cdc winnipeg free press newsletter business weekly monday mornings the latest local business news and a lookahead to the coming week sign up i agree to the terms and conditions cookie and privacy policies and casl agreement it was only a matter of time before misleading comments at these local public forums went viral according to jennifer grygiel a communications professor at syracuse university who studies social media platforms grygiel suggested a few possible ways to minimize the impact of misinformation without muzzling local governments grygiel said clear labels on government broadcasts would help viewers understand what they re watching keeping the video on the government s website instead of making it shareable on youtube could allow local residents to watch without enabling the spread of videos more widely anytime there is a public arena a city council hearing a school board meeting a public park the public has the opportunity to potentially spread misinformation grygiel said what s changed is it used to stay local ____ klepper reported from providence rhode island

these industrial companies face setbacks but remain long term winners whether you re in retirement or simply looking to generate a little extra income you ve come to the right place stocks that pay dividends can be a great way to combine reliable returns with long term upside and with dividend stocks becoming increasingly hard to find any discount the market provides is helpful with that we asked some of our contributors which dividend stocks they think are on sale now caterpillar cat 1 20 3m mmm 0 12 and american electric power aep 0 30 caught their attention here s what makes each a great buy now a dividend aristocrat poised for a breakout daniel foelber caterpillar shares of caterpillar are down more than 13 over the past three months despite posting impressive earnings the heavy equipment manufacturer has hit a rough patch on wall street the main culprit isn t the company s results but expectations in q2 2020 all of caterpillar s segments were hurting as north and south american sales plummeted but things have turned around since then caterpillar s q2 2021 revenue and net income are both down around a mere 10 from their 2019 figures which is impressive considering the business is still in recovery mode metric q2 2021 q2 2020 q2 2019 revenue 12 9 billion 10 billion 14 4 billion earnings per share 2 56 0 84 2 83 caterpillar is still not offering full year guidance but it did hint during its q2 2021 conference call that the third quarter should have strong revenue combined with its first half results caterpillar could be in for a pretty good year caterpillar s stock will look a whole lot cheaper if it can continue to steamroll past expectations however some context is key caterpillar is a cyclical stock its current valuation isn t based on its past results but rather on how business could boom as the economy recovers dependence on the global energy materials and industrial economies has been a double edged sword that leaves caterpillar vulnerable to economic declines but perfectly positioned to capitalize on booms the issue is that caterpillar s last uptrend was largely interrupted by the u s china trade war right now it s in the process of gaining back its momentum first half results gave us a taste of what that boom could look like but sustained growth may be needed to appease wall street s appetite momentum could be derailed by pandemic related interruptions macroeconomic factors oil and gas prices or a slew of other unknowns in short caterpillar stock needs to prove it s worth all the hype but given the company s track record it very well could be in the meantime investors can take solace in the fact that caterpillar is a dividend aristocrat meaning it has increased its annual payout for over 25 consecutive years shares of caterpillar yield 2 1 at the time of this writing 3m faces headwinds but the stock is a good value lee samaha 3m the industrial conglomerate isn t the highest quality industrial stock out there but it is a great dividend option for investors the dividend aristocrat s nearly 3 dividend yield is very well covered by the company s free cash flow as such 3m s dividend is not in doubt and there s ample room for management to increase it that said there are some question marks around the company the rise in raw material prices is pressuring profit margins and 3m faces potential liability from its production of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance pfas chemicals still 3m looks significantly undervalued next to its peers the market appears to have given 3m a valuation that provides a very wide margin of safety for the pfas risk moreover 3m s end markets are all turning up in line with the improving economy so revenue growth is likely to offset margin pressure as the company goes through 2021 all told 3m still offers investors the prospect of an excellent dividend yield and long term growth prospects that s usually good enough for value orientated investors go american to charge up your passive income scott levine american electric power looking to electrify your portfolio with a high yield opportunity american electric power with its 3 3 dividend yield belongs on your radar the company operates the largest electricity transmission network in the united states providing power to approximately 5 5 million customers american electricity power s service territory makes up about 200 000 square miles spanning 11 states while the company hasn t achieved the noble status of becoming a dividend aristocrat its 11 years of growing its annual dividend is certainly noteworthy from 2011 through 2020 in fact the company has increased its payout to shareholders at a 4 9 compound annual growth rate conservative investors wary of whether the company has jeopardized its financial health to satisfy shareholders can rest easily over the past four years american electric power has averaged a payout ratio of 65 forecasting 2021 earnings per share of 4 53 to 4 73 the company seems confident that it will achieve bottom line growth over last year when it reported eps of 4 42 but that s not what s powering my belief that this stock deserves a closer look as momentum behind the infrastructure bill builds american electric power seems poised to benefit considerably besides the 73 billion in spending to upgrade the electric grid the infrastructure bill targets 7 5 billion for developing a nationwide ev charging infrastructure over the past few days shares have dipped a little the stock is now trading around 5 below its 52 week range but it seems like a bargain currently shares are valued at 18 9 times trailing earnings a discount to their five year average multiple of 27 3 and that s not the only perspective from which they seem attractively priced the stock is trading at about 2 8 times sales representing a discount to the s p 500 which has a 3 2 sales multiple

damien peters founder of wealth noir explains how systemic challenges can prevent people of color from achieving financial security the racial wealth gap is one of many systemic challenges that the black community and people of color face when working to secure their financial futures but there are many resources available to help you along your way and groups of people who have similar goals including at wealth noir in this motley fool live video recorded on july 23 wealth noir founder damien peters tells fool com editor desiree jones about the racial wealth gap and why many people struggle to reach financial freedom the 16 728 social security bonus most retirees completely overlook if you re like most americans you re a few years or more behind on your retirement savings but a handful of little known social security secrets could help ensure a boost in your retirement income for example one easy trick could pay you as much as 16 728 more each year once you learn how to maximize your social security benefits we think you could retire confidently with the peace of mind we re all after simply click here to discover how to learn more about these strategies desiree jones hi there fools and welcome to fool live i m dez jones a fool on the editorial team and i m so excited to welcome damien peters the founder of wealth noir damien how are you doing today damien peters i m doing pretty good a little small cold from my son but surviving jones that s good to hear welcome and we re going to go ahead and get started tell us more about yourself and the mission of wealth noir peters my name is damien peters i founded wealth noir back in 2018 our mission really is we focus on high income millennials in particular african american millennials we re really focused on building wealth so increasing net worth the reason i started wealth noir and story behind it was i was a product manager at facebook i was working there enjoying my job i found out that i was having a child and i decided i wanted to take a little bit of time off i wanted to take a year off to be with my son everyone at work they were like how can you afford this when i talked to people outside of work they were also shocked my personal thought was i was very well compensated i had been investing in real estate at the time so at this time i had two rental properties i had six figures in stocks taxable on my own in addition to the same in my retirement account i just felt that there were more people who are in this income bracket they had solved one problem but they weren t building wealth and net worth and they still felt trapped financially at wealth noir we really focus on bringing content services programming that really focuses on helping people transform salary into net worth we have a heavy emphasis on real estate investing and also for accredited investors jones that s awesome that is amazing to know that there s something like wealth noir to help uplift the black community of course we re going to talk more about the impacts of the black community and financial literacy for starters what is the racial wealth gap and why does it matter peters the racial wealth gap i think everyone or there s many different ways to define it or think about it and the way i think about it really is when you tease out salary and other impacts when you look at net worth between african american and the majority races or medium net worth you see a gap given that you re earning the same amount of money we re not accumulating or building net worth at the same rate for example there was a study by the institute of policy studies that showed at above 93 000 so given that you re earning more than 93 000 a white family had about 2 2 times more net worth 320 000 versus 142 000 of black families we see this pronounced in many different aspects where it impacts the ability for african american families to participate in the economy and in wealth building compared to our counterparts
the people s currency could be left in the dust by these fast growing companies for well over a century the stock market has been one of the world s greatest wealth creators stocks may not top housing gold oil or bonds in the return column every year but the average annual return of equities far outpaces the average annualized return of other investment vehicles over the long run but over the past couple of years the supremacy of stocks has been challenged by the rise of cryptocurrencies in particular the people s currency dogecoin doge 0 30 gained as much as 27 000 in a six month stretch between early november and early may that outpaces the total return including dividends for the benchmark s p 500 between 1965 and 2020 dogecoin doesn t do anything particularly well peruse social media and you ll have no trouble finding support for dogecoin from retail investors they appreciate the growing community support the recent interest in dogecoin s underlying blockchain by tesla motors ceo elon musk and the prospect of getting in before broad based retail adoption unfortunately the bull thesis has one major flaw dogecoin doesn t do anything particularly well for example even though dogecoin s transaction fees are lower than the big two in crypto bitcoin and ethereum its fees are actually leaps and bounds higher than at least a dozen other popular cryptocurrencies dogecoin isn t a particularly fast or efficient network either quite a few popular digital currencies such as nano and stellar can validate and settle cross border transactions in mere seconds as for dogecoin it can reportedly handle up to 40 transactions per second but has only seen enough demand on its network to account for one transaction every four seconds of late payment processing giant visa can handle in one second about 24 000 payments per second the number of transactions dogecoin s blockchain has validated and settled in a day over the past month the icing on the cake is that dogecoin isn t accepted by many merchants it s taken eight years just for 1 400 mostly obscure online retailers to accept it as payment in other words dogecoin is being supported by impassioned investors for the time being but has no competitive advantages this would suggest dogecoin is going to eventually head substantially lower this high growth trio can leave dogecoin in the dust although dogecoin has outperformed equities through the first half of 2021 the following trio of growth stocks is a much better bet to run circles around the people s currency and make investors rich over time mastercard at virtually no point in mastercard s ma 0 94 15 years as a publicly traded company has there been a bad time to buy shares if the digitization of financial services has you intrigued forget all about dogecoin and take a closer look at mastercard the beauty of the mastercard operating model is that it s heavily favored to benefit optimists you see even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle the u s and global economy spend a considerably longer period of time expanding than they do contracting this means mastercard navigates its way through recessions for a few quarters but tends to enjoy multiyear periods of spending expansion if investors are simply patient they have a very good chance of being rewarded by mastercard as u s and global gross domestic product expand to add mastercard is no 2 in the u s and globally in terms of credit card network purchase volume the u s is the world s leading consumer and a majority of the world s transactions are still being conducted with cash put another way mastercard is generating significant cash flow from the u s but has a sustainable growth runway in emerging markets something else to note about mastercard is its avoidance of lending while it could probably rake in interest income and fees lending also comes with the prospect of being hit with credit delinquencies during inevitable economic contractions and recessions since mastercard doesn t lend it won t have to set aside capital to cover credit loan losses during a recession this is a big reason why it bounces back so much faster than other financial service companies after recessions columbia care another high growth stock that has the potential to run circles around dogecoin is marijuana stock columbia care cchwf 3 90 i know what you might be thinking but no the federal legalization of cannabis isn t necessary for u s multistate operators like columbia care to thrive as long as the justice department allows individual states to regulate their pot industries the 36 states to have legalized weed in some capacity thus far will provide more than enough growth potential for pot stocks and remember the u s is the unquestioned global leader in legal cannabis revenue there are two things that make columbia care such an intriguing stock to own first there s management s aggressive use of acquisitions to expand its reach just since december we ve witnessed columbia care bolster its mid atlantic presence with the 240 million buyout of green leaf beef up its share in ohio with the cannascend deal and gobble up the vertically integrated project cannabis in california though these deals could weigh on columbia care s bottom line in the very short term it should help the company become a leading cannabis retailer by 2022 and beyond secondly columbia care has predominantly focused on states where license issuance is intentionally limited with the company s competition being purposefully reined in it s allowing columbia care the opportunity to build up its brands and develop a loyal following columbia care is projected to be one of the fastest growing pot stocks for the foreseeable future teladoc health a third growth stock that shouldn t have any problem running circles around dogecoin over the long term is telehealth services giant teladoc health tdoc 1 07 some investors might be leery about teladoc s growth potential in the near term considering that it benefited immensely from the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 with physicians wanting to keep patients out of their offices as much as possible virtual visits on teladoc s platform soared to 10 59 million from 4 14 million in 2019 though this incredible virtual visit growth trajectory is certainly unsustainable telehealth isn t going away in fact it s arguably more important than ever telemedicine services make life substantially more convenient for patients and should allow doctors to keep better track of vital data for chronically ill patients this ease of access is expected to translate to improved patient outcomes and less money out of the pockets of insurance companies all in all we re talking about a more personalized and effective healthcare experience what s more teladoc acquired leading applied health signals company livongo health during the fourth quarter to further differentiate itself livongo uses artificial intelligence to send tips to its enrolled members currently people with diabetes to help them lead healthier lives prior to being acquired livongo had already turned the corner to profitability despite only penetrating about 1 5 of the u s diabetes market whereas dogecoin is nothing special teladoc represents true innovation
this is a hefty price to pay but is square getting its money s worth we recently learned that fintech giant square sq 0 69 has agreed to acquire buy now pay later leader afterpay in an all stock deal that values the company at about 29 billion this is square s largest acquisition to date so in this motley fool live video clip recorded on aug 2 fool com contributor matt frankel cfp and industry focus host jason moser discuss whether the hefty price tag square is paying makes sense 10 stocks we like better than square when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and square wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of august 9 2021 jason moser let s talk about the afterpay acquisition because i understand the enthusiasm here i really do buy now pay later is a tremendous opportunity 30 billion is a tremendous price tag for this business matt frankel i think this is the biggest acquisition that either square or paypal pypl 1 47 has ever made moser yeah i think you re right they say it s 29 billion all stock deal and i think it s great at least square is doing this at a time when the stock is close to all time highs it s a fairly cheap form of currency but still that s a big price tag for a business that is growing by leaps and bounds but it s still a small business frankel it s an all stock deal so square s diluting shareholders by doing it apparently the market likes this deal the stocks up 11 this makes square almost over 155 billion company all by itself they are really adding to their outstanding share count now after today s pop it s over 30 billion they re paying for afterpay because it s all stock it s based on their stock price so giving a set number of shares afterpay if you re not familiar they re based in australia they re probably the most comparable competitor to affirm afrm 1 70 in the buy now pay later space buy now pay later is when you see the little button when you re about to checkout that says break this into six monthly payments of 100 instead of one 600 payment that s a buy now pay later service paypal has already built its own moser yeah frankel affirm is pretty big especially in the u s peloton nasdaq pton is their big customer afterpay they re an australian company but the majority of the revenue is from north america why they offer interest free financing no credit checks standard buy now pay later features that appeal to customers the no credit checks really is appealing as opposed people always ask the question why wouldn t i just use a traditional credit card because then you have to go through a credit check in the process like that with buy now pay later you just click the button and it s set up and done ninety eight thousand active merchant accounts little over 16 million active customers they re growing fast those numbers are up 78 and 63 year over year they re growing pretty quickly almost 16 billion of gross merchandise volume was financed through afterpay over the past year pretty big company almost 700 million in revenue square is paying a pretty hefty multiple of that moser they are i was looking at this earlier just to try to keep things in context and because you had mentioned affirm i mean affirm very similar business focusing on a little bit of a different market opportunity as you said but regardless affirm generally the same business pretty similar size as far as revenue at this point similar models and that they are still working toward profitability and whatnot but you look at affirm affirm 15 billion company today just to see the premium that afterpay is getting versus something like affirm it s noteworthy i think for a few different reasons it makes you wonder exactly what they saw in afterpay really to offer such a premium perhaps part of that is afterpay and other founder led business it seems to be two very similar cultures though that s one thing that really stood out to me with afterpay and with square very similar cultures and reasons for existing focusing on economic empowerment and economic inclusion and equality acquisitions always present a fair share of risk when it comes to merging two cultures it feels like maybe these are cultures that should mesh together fairly well frankel there are a bunch of good reasons i mean i read through the investor presentation there there are some good reasons they want to integrate afterpay into both the seller side of the business and cash app make it available for all in square seller accounts which is in the millions i mentioned afterpay has 98 000 active merchant accounts square has three or four million i m not sure exactly they don t really announced that number but it s in the millions they want to make afterpay service available to every merchant on square s ecosystem they want to integrate it with the cash app to make it easier for buyers to make their payments and things like that they re going to be a buy now pay later service because square is focused on not just online businesses they re focused on in person merchants as well buy now pay later will be available to anyone who accepts square for in person purchases which is a pretty unique feature afterpay i mentioned they only have 98 000 merchant accounts most of afterpay s customers are large customers i mentioned affirm has peloton afterpay also has a lot of enterprise clients square would love to build relationships with bigger clients they break this down in their earnings reports every quarter how much of their revenue comes from small businesses mid sized businesses larger businesses the larger business portion has been steadily increasing over time this could give that little shot in the arm it expands their merchant relationships on both sides it s a pretty big market that they could go after moser very big market indeed what do you think as far as and we ll move on to squares earnings here in just a minute that old saying sometimes it s easier to buy it than to build it it feels like in this case maybe square felt like you know what this is going to be something that s going to be easier to buy than to build but the flip side of that is i don t know it feels like maybe building it wouldn t have been all that tough if that was something they felt like doing we ve seen paypal build out their buy now pay later offering and they re witnessing a ton of success i guess i wonder do you feel like square may be felt a little pressure here a little pressure on the time side they needed to get into this market opportunity sooner rather than later frankel maybe that s the really the big reason i could think of is time because you mentioned paypal i promise you paypal didn t spend 29 billion to build out their own buy now pay later platform moser no i don t think they did frankel that seems like a big price to pay the natural question is why couldn t square have just built it themselves if they had that much money to throw at it and sees that much value in the buy now pay later business i mean obviously they re not starting from zero and now this buys them 700 million of annual revenue moser absolutely frankel they re not starting from zero but that s a hefty price to pay i m not totally sold on it i like the deal i don t like the number i think that s a hefty price to pay
accenture epam systems and cdw just reported earnings here s what we re tracking with these digital stalwarts one of my favorite ways to invest in technology is with the leading digital it service firms companies like accenture acn 0 11 epam systems epam 0 19 and cdw cdw 0 21 are all extremely high quality growing businesses run by excellent management teams and they serve a crucial need by helping clients adapt and thrive in this period of accelerating digital change these three companies are perfectly positioned to benefit from long term tech tailwinds and disruptive innovations such as cloud computing artificial intelligence ai machine learning ml distributed working learning network security and more a bonus point is that they are mostly technology agnostic meaning that they are not overly exposed to disruption risk rather innovation and disruption drive their business each company reported earnings recently and provided fresh insight into their operations let s see how they performed in their most recent quarter spoiler alert they all crushed it and what it could mean for you as an investor accenture s fiscal 2021 q3 earnings it services giant accenture s third quarter fiscal 2021 revenue increased 21 16 in constant currency year over year operating income increased 24 and eps grew 26 as it continues to take what it calls significant market share this operating leverage was driven by an increase in both gross and operating margins compared to the same period last year accenture had a record 20 clients in the quarter each delivering bookings greater than 100 million the company generated a return on invested capital roic of 31 and its net cash cash net of debt including leases grew to 6 5 billion net cash now accounts for 16 of total assets it s important to note that i don t think accenture s normalized constant currency growth rate will stay at that elevated 16 level some of this growth is driven by an easy comp but some is definitely the result of increased demand and market share gains coming out of the pandemic and i do think accenture can be a structurally higher growth company in the post covid 19 world this was obviously an incredible quarter so management once again raised its full year guidance across the board it now expects constant currency revenue growth of 10 to 11 up from 6 5 to 8 5 free cash flow fcf of 8 billion to 8 5 billion up from 7 billion to 7 5 billion and adjusted eps of 8 71 to 8 80 up from 8 32 to 8 50 implying growth of 17 to 18 over adjusted 2020 eps of 7 46 accenture expects its full year fiscal 2021 ratio of fcf to net income to be a whopping 1 4 to 1 5 what sparked this impressive increase in guidance cfo kc mcclure explained on the earnings call importantly organic revenue is the driver of the increase to our updated guidance accenture continues to use some of its fcf to make digital acquisitions it made 39 acquisitions all over the globe through the first three quarters of its fiscal year and it expects to spend a total of 4 billion on acquisitions for the full year two of the ones it made this quarter were purchased for more than 1 billion this is still small relative to accenture s size and financial capacity but i think it indicates that ceo julie sweet is getting more comfortable with slightly larger acquisitions and she could be testing the company s capability to make even larger acquisitions down the road this is something i ll be keeping an eye on accenture is an underappreciated acquisition machine as it has successfully acquired and integrated roughly 200 companies since 2013 its acquisitions have historically added roughly 2 to top line growth each year but it pays for its acquisitions from internally generated cash flow not from debt and its acquisitions do not overly dilute roics using calculations from investment research site new constructs accenture s trailing 12 month roic is 33 compared to its five year average roic of 34 given the larger spend on acquisitions in fiscal 2021 the company estimates that acquisitions will add 4 to top line growth in fiscal 2022 another place where accenture continues to invest is its 569 000 employees it hired a net 32 000 in the quarter and through the first three quarters of the year it promoted a record 117 000 employees including nearly 1 200 to the level of managing director accenture also continues to invest in the communities in which it operates and recently committed to contributing 100 for each of its 540 000 employees at the time of the announcement for a total of 54 million going toward those communities this is something but accenture could do more the key takeaway for long term investors is that accenture s business was extremely resilient during the pandemic and subsequent lockdowns while the pandemic isn t over it is entering the new normal with accelerating growth and market share gains this is because the pandemic made companies realize that they need to immediately digitize their businesses or risk losing relevance in an increasingly digital world accenture benefited from that because it s the biggest brand with the most experience in enterprise wide digital transformations it has compounded digital knowledge and uses its playbook a record of successful digital projects from one company or industry and applies it to similar projects at other companies in other industries its client list includes three quarters of the fortune 500 and 92 of the fortune 100 equally impressive 97 of its top 100 clients have been customers for more than 10 years accenture invested ahead of the digital curve and now has the widest service offering in the industry at a time when digital projects budgets are getting bigger just look at the record 20 clients that committed to bookings of at least 100 million in the quarter the company is perfectly positioned to benefit from the digital revolution in various ways including digital marketing cloud automation the internet of things data analytics ai cybersecurity quantum computing neuromorphic computing and even blockchain it has leading partnerships with amazon web services alphabet s google microsoft oracle salesforce sap workday and apple it is the no 1 software as a service saas it service provider accenture is also the leader in digital marketing with accenture interactive which the company claims is the world s largest provider of digital marketing services the company is currently working on building industry x its supply chain and manufacturing business into the next big line of business on par with its accenture interactive segment the pandemic will force major companies around the world to rework their supply chains to be more agile and more resilient to future disruptions there is probably no company better suited to lead them through this massive digital transition and supply chain operations optimization than accenture as sweet said in the conference call we believe that product development design engineering manufacturing and the supply chain make up the next big digital transformation frontier competition for the top tech talent needed to meet the growing demand for enterprise wide digital transformations will be a hurdle but not necessarily a systemic risk employee attrition churn is elevated at accenture and across the industry and it s something to keep an eye on epam systems fiscal 2021 q2 earnings following epam s first quarter 2020 earnings when the pandemic was breaking out across the world i posted this note into fooliq our internal research management system at the motley fool the most important consideration for long term foolish investors is that epam is a founder led best in class digital engineering firm that went into this crisis with net cash and strong profitability real free cash flow above and beyond sbc which is not fcf and rising returns on invested capital roic epam s business model that stresses profitable growth and a cash rich balance sheet will enable it to remain resilient throughout the crisis and come out ever stronger on the other side remaining resilient throughout the crisis and coming out even stronger on the other side is exactly what epam did its second quarter 2021 revenue increased 39 36 in constant currency year over year and its adjusted eps grew 40 three percentage points of its revenue growth came from acquisitions which is noteworthy because acquisitions are contributing to growth at the same time that the company s roic is rising this is a rare phenomenon because acquisitions at other companies often dilute roic according to stocks analyst new constructs roic for epam has increased every year since 2016 and its trailing 12 month roic is a whopping 32 topping its five year average roic of 25 the increase in roic has been driven by a consistent increase in both net operating profit after tax nopat margins and invested capital turnover which means epam is firing on all cylinders its combination of 20 organic long term revenue growth combined with high and rising roics driven by both consistently higher margins and consistently better balance sheet efficiency is the definition of investing nirvana and its market cap and stock price have responded with market crushing returns epam s growth was strong across all verticals and geographies and it continues to improve its client diversification to rely less on a few large customers revenue growth among epam s top 20 clients was 19 year over year but growth outside of its top 20 was 55 in the quarter to give an idea of the urgent demand for epam s services cfo jason peterson told investors that several customers have gone from doing no business with the company to being one of its top 20 customers in a year or less this level of demand acceleration is pretty incredible on the second quarter earnings call ceo arkadiy dobkin explained that demand for epam s digital engineering and consulting services is being driven by app development cloud integration and massive ongoing digital transformations from both new and existing clients these transformations are driving larger and longer contracts for epam to support what dobkin calls a surge in demand epam is hiring new talent both organically and through acquisitions at an accelerated rate through the first half of 2021 it has already hired more employees than it ever has in a full year and the company is having great success growing its talent base in eastern europe where it has traditionally recruited the best and brightest as well as in india and latin america there is intense competition for top tech talent which means management will be raising wages but the company is carefully offsetting that by exercising pricing power on larger digital transformation projects on the call peterson said the dynamics on the pricing side are certainly improving he added one of the things that we re beginning to see even in the middle of this year which i think is different than certainly last year and probably different even than prior years 2019 and 2018 is we are getting midyear rate increases peterson also said the company expects to see greater than usual rate increases in 2022 following the strong first half of the year management is raising its full year guidance for the second quarter in a row in the fourth quarter of 2020 management originally guided for full year 2021 constant currency revenue growth of at least 22 and adjusted eps of 7 20 to 7 41 then in the first quarter of 2021 epam raised its full year guidance to constant currency revenue growth of at least 28 and adjusted eps of 7 54 to 7 76 and now with the release of its second quarter earnings management is guiding for full year constant currency revenue growth of at least 35 and adjusted eps of 8 25 to 8 44 30 to 33 higher than epam s 2020 adjusted eps of 6 34 on the call dobkin stressed that epam s long term goal is to grow profitably with 20 organic year over year growth keep in mind that through the first quarter of 2020 up until covid really broke out it had grown organic revenue by at least 20 for 37 consecutive quarters as the pandemic eases the company has returned to at least that level of growth as a quality growth investor i appreciate its choice to balance its long term goal for organic revenue growth of at least 20 per year with attractive margins and roic the long term investment thesis for epam should account for the fact that this is a founder led digitally native it services and consulting firm known for its best in class engineering and software services at a time when there is urgent demand for enterprise wide digital transformation projects this increased demand results in larger and longer term contracts that carry higher margins for epam because of the ongoing nature of these transformations the company is a crucial partner to its clients becoming embedded into their workflow leading to 90 recurring revenue from existing clients also its very close relationship with its customers creates a constant feedback loop and enables the business to iterate and innovate at a rapid pace epam s brand name and leading recruiting apparatus give it an advantage in hiring the best and brightest digital engineers in eastern europe and now it s trying to build a scaled presence in india and latin america its balance sheet is rock solid with 1 billion in net cash which equates to 36 of total assets it s a 20 plus organic top line grower and all of the important drivers of value including nopat margins invested capital turns roic and fcf are moving up and to the right cdw s fiscal 2021 q2 earnings before i get into the quarterly results i d like to point out three big differences between cdw and accenture and epam cdw primarily serves small and medium size businesses typically with less than 5 000 employees whereas accenture and epam are implementing digital transformations at larger enterprises in many cases fortune 500 and or forbes global 2000 companies cdw is a value added reseller that carries inventory on its balance sheet and has distribution facilities to ease fulfillment more on that below accenture and epam have large net cash positions but cdw has manageable net debt it has dramatically reduced leverage since being taken private in a leveraged buyout in 2007 and its prudent use of debt allows it to generate sky high returns on equity roe according to s p global cdw s five year average roe is 61 and its trailing 12 month roe is a whopping 89 largely because of its use of debt the company s roe is significantly higher than the roe at accenture or epam more on cdw s balance sheet and returns below second quarter 2021 sales increased 17 9 16 3 in constant currency year over year and adjusted eps grew 29 3 this was cdw s first quarter with over 5 billion in sales because 2020 was such as strange year sometimes it s helpful to look at sales on a two year stack basis cdw s sales grew 11 2 over the second quarter of 2019 impressively this strong top line growth is accompanied by rising roic according to new constructs the company s roic has increased for five consecutive years and its trailing 12 month roic is now 20 compared to its five year average of 15 4 cdw is one of the rare companies whose rising roic is being driven by a consistent increase in both net operating profit after tax margins and invested capital returns in other words cdw is firing on all cylinders right now the company s fcf declined in the quarter but that is to be expected because inventory is a use of cash a cash outflow and the company is carrying higher inventory levels to better serve clients and win market share in a supply constrained environment i discussed cdw s inventory and working capital dynamics in depth in my deep dive on cdw so an investment in its clients success is exactly what you want to see cdw s balances sheet is healthy with a leverage ratio that is below its long term target and an interest coverage ratio ebit interest expense of 9 which is its highest level going back to its ipo in 2013 its strong growth is being powered by clients prioritizing digital transformations across the full tech stack with a focus on cloud and hybrid cloud migrations and network security to further strengthen its cybersecurity practice cdw acquired the firm focal point data risk it does seem that acquisitions will be more of a capital allocation priority under ceo christine leahy for the full year 2021 cdw expects the u s it industry to grow 5 and it expects to win significant market share because its industry leading scale allows it to better procure the inventory that its customers need in a supply constrained environment on the second quarter earnings call leahy said because we can create a solution and deliver to customers we generally get our greater than fair share cdw is guiding for its constant currency revenue to exceed u s it industry growth by 4 25 to 5 percentage points in other words cdw is guiding for 2021 sales growth of 9 25 to 10 and also expects to generate adjusted eps growth of around 16 to 16 5 this rate is very strong and even better than the long term expectations i set out in my deep dive report on cdw but importantly on the second quarter earnings call cfo collin kebo said that demand is strong and that growth is possibly being held back somewhat by supply constraints for hardware even though cdw has the best chance of getting inventory to customers when they need it it is still being affected by supply challenges out of its control just less so than the rest of the industry kebo said on the demand side we continue to see strong activity and momentum particularly with u s commercial customers and in cdw canada on the supply side visibility remains a challenge notebooks displays docking stations certain infrastructure hardware including networking and servers are constrained resulting in longer lead times and a higher backlog with the exception of chromebooks the supply environment has not improved since our last earnings call and most vendor partners do not expect the situation to improve in the second half he added our updated outlook for the balance of the year assumes modest growth in the backlog if supply turns out to be more resilient enabling us to work down the backlog or keep pace with even stronger demand that would be upside to the outlook we feel good about the health of the business and believe supply uncertainty is a question of timing across the second half and into 2022 in other words the company is doing great and could be doing even better if the supply of devices can keep up with demand investor takeaway if you want to invest in the cloud ai ml cybersecurity or distributed hybrid work but you don t know which company will win then you might consider buying a basket of stocks in one or more of these categories it s a fine strategy and i would recommend it another choice would be to just invest in the it services companies that help clients plan implement and monitor their cloud ai ml cyber and distributed work strategies these three stocks in their own ways do just that and could form the basis of an it services basket of shares similarly if you re an investor who wants to invest in tech but who also insists on profitable self funding business models high roic and growing free cash flow you would do well to take a look at accenture epam and cdw individually

it might not be transitory since the economy began opening back up many economists have been pointing to inflation as the next big risk to the stock market in april prices rose the most since 2008 they accelerated in may and june and finally leveled off in july at a robust 5 4 annual rate admittedly some have been calling for inflation ever since the 2008 financial crisis but it has never materialized now with prices racing higher coming out of a global pandemic the u s central bank is saying the increase is transitory many are confused about the term it doesn t mean prices will retreat it means that prices will quit rising as fast as they are now they aren t alarmed but economists aren t running companies and how prices affect the bottom line can have implications for how stocks perform over any period of time that s why it makes sense to hear how the ceos of some of the largest companies in america are feeling about rising prices for hca healthcare hca 0 89 walmart wmt 0 38 and jpmorgan chase jpm 0 95 the message seems clear hca healthcare hca is the largest operator of hospitals in the u s and employs about 275 000 people roughly 80 000 of them part time on the company s second quarter earnings call ceo sam hazen outlined what the company is experiencing with respect to labor costs although gross margin slipped a bit from 84 1 in the first quarter to 83 5 in the second quarter hazen said labor costs were stable across the two periods he acknowledged being in a difficult labor market but listed a few ways the company was addressing inflationary pressures first it is stepping up efforts in recruitment that investment can lead to diminishing returns in a market with few hires available second hca has implemented some compensation adjustments that could mean the quarter s stable labor costs weren t achieved by curbing wage inflation rather by paying fewer workers more money each it s great for employees in the short term but it can stress a thin labor force and ultimately put pressure on other areas like staff turnover and safety the company said only some of the costs of its compensation programs had shown up in the first half of the year it didn t take analysts long to put two and two together they pointed out the company s guidance implied a lower gross margin in the second half of the year than the first it seems like despite efforts to mitigate the impact hca is telling shareholders to brace for labor inflation when they report third quarter earnings this fall walmart as one of the largest employers and retailers in the country walmart is in a prime position to report on inflation it employs 2 3 million associates and generated 555 billion in sales in its fiscal year ending jan 31 as prices rise employees will clamor for higher wages to maintain their standard of living similarly inflation should lead to more revenue for the company as they pass those higher prices on to consumers management believes the environment is an advantage to the company noting how convenience trumped value during the pandemic that led to declines in store traffic because people were willing to pay more to stay close to home or have items delivered government stimulus helped consumers keep making that choice into 2021 with those programs ending and prices rising it sees a return to the cost conscious one stop shopping that walmart offers on the labor side the company isn t immune to rising prices earlier this year it announced it would raise the minimum pay for about one fourth of its u s workers to 15 per hour the company has referred to increased wages as a challenge for a large retailer like itself management might not have made any bold statements about inflation but its words and actions indicate it is expected for the remainder of this year jpmorgan chase another company with a bird s eye view of the economy is jpmorgan chase at the end of 2020 it operated almost 5 000 bank branches across 38 states and washington d c it has nearly 3 7 trillion in assets and 255 000 employees more than 60 in the u s on the second quarter earnings call the cfo said the company wasn t actually seeing inflation in the reported numbers year to date however the firm s research team was in agreement with the fed and the broader consensus that a robust economic recovery would fuel higher prices and interest rates for that reason jpmorgan increased its projection for full year expenses from 70 billion to 71 billion ceo jamie dimon called out the likelihood that increases in home prices and stocks as well as consumer savings incomes and sentiment would stoke inflation surprisingly he said growth in the u s going into the second half of the year could be the strongest it s ever been he topped it off with the summary that those tailwinds could push inflation higher than people think and that it won t all be temporary nobody has a crystal ball obviously no one can predict the future but one of the largest healthcare providers in the country is taking action to raise pay as it struggles to find enough workers perhaps the largest retailer in the country is raising wages for many of its workers and highlighting for analysts how it benefits in an economy with rising prices finally the nation s largest bank is increasing its guidance for expenses and its ceo one of the most respected in the world is saying the u s economy could soon be as strong as it has ever been no matter what fed chair jerome powell says these ceos are painting a picture of persistently higher prices through both their words and actions investors should take note
members of the county council joining over video chat participate in the pledge of allegiance at the start of a council meeting at the st louis county council chambers in clayton mo tuesday aug 3 2021 public forums before local school boards and city councils are the latest source of misinformation about covid 19 colter peterson st louis post dispatch via ap there are plenty of places to turn for accurate information about covid 19 your physician local health departments the u s centers for disease control but not perhaps your local government s public comment session advertisement during a meeting of the st louis county council earlier this month opponents of a possible mask mandate made so many misleading comments about masks vaccines and covid 19 that youtube removed the video for violating its policies against false claims about the virus i hope no one is making any medical decisions based on what they hear at our public forums said county councilwoman lisa clancy who supports mask wearing and said she believes most of her constituents do too the video was restored but clancy s worries about the impact of that misinformation remain videos of local government meetings have emerged as the latest vector of covid 19 misinformation broadcasting misleading claims about masks and vaccines to millions and creating new challenges for internet platforms trying to balance the potential harm against the need for government openness advertisement the latest video to go viral features a local physician who made several misleading claims about covid 19 while addressing the mount vernon community school corporation in fortville indiana on aug 6 in his 6 minute remarks dr dan stock tells the board that masks don t work vaccines don t prevent infection and state and federal health officials don t follow the science the video has amassed tens of millions of online views and prompted the indiana state department of health to push back stock did not return multiple messages seeking comment here comes a doctor in suspenders who goes in front of the school board and basically says what some people are thinking the masks are b s vaccines don t work and the cdc is lying it can be very compelling to laypeople said dr zubin damania a california physician who received so many messages about the indiana clip that he created his own video debunking stock s claims advertisement damania hosts a popular online medical show under the name zdoggmd his video debunking stock s comments has been viewed more than 400 000 times so far he said that while there are legitimate questions about the effectiveness of mask requirements for children stock s broad criticism of masks and vaccines went too far youtube removed several similar videos of local government meetings in north carolina missouri kansas and washington state in bellingham washington officials responded by temporarily suspending public comment sessions the false claims in those videos were made during the portion of the meeting devoted to public comment local officials have no control over what is said at these forums and say that s part of the point advertisement in kansas youtube pulled video of the may school board meeting in the 27 000 student shawnee mission district in which parents and a state lawmaker called for the district to remove its mask mandate citing medical misinformation the district where a mask mandate remains in effect responded by ending livestreaming of the public comment period district spokesman david smith acknowledged that it has been challenging to balance making the board meetings accessible and not spreading fallacies it was hard for me to hear things in the board meeting that weren t true and to know that those were going out without contradiction smith said i am all about free speech but when that free speech endangers people s lives it is hard to sit through that advertisement after hearing from local officials youtube reversed its decision and put the videos back up earlier this month the company which is owned by google announced a change to its covid misinformation policy to allow exceptions for local government meetings though youtube may still remove content that uses remarks from public forums in an attempt to mislead while we have clear policies to remove harmful covid 19 misinformation we also recognize the importance of organizations like school districts and city councils using youtube to share recordings of open public forums even when comments at those forums may violate our policies company spokeswoman elena hernandez said the deluge of false claims about the virus has challenged other platforms too twitter and facebook each have their own policies on covid 19 misinformation and say that like youtube they attach labels to misleading content and remove the worst of it advertisement public comment sessions preceding local government meetings have long been known for sometimes colorful remarks from local residents but before the internet if someone were to drone on about fluoride in the drinking water for instance their comments weren t likely to become national news now thanks to the internet and social media the misleading musings of a local doctor speaking before a school board can compete for attention with the recommendations of the cdc it was only a matter of time before misleading comments at these local public forums went viral according to jennifer grygiel a communications professor at syracuse university who studies social media platforms advertisement grygiel suggested a few possible ways to minimize the impact of misinformation without muzzling local governments grygiel said clear labels on government broadcasts would help viewers understand what they re watching keeping the video on the government s website instead of making it shareable on youtube could allow local residents to watch without enabling the spread of videos more widely anytime there is a public arena a city council hearing a school board meeting a public park the public has the opportunity to potentially spread misinformation grygiel said what s changed is it used to stay local ____ advertisement klepper reported from providence rhode island

i am more concerned about the return of my money than the return on my money said mark twain the famed author of adventures of huckleberry finn ranked among the highest paid authors in 19th century america and married into wealth as well yet he proved even more adept at losing money through venture capital and stock bets than making it he learned his investing lessons the hard way but you don t have to the purpose of investing in stocks is unabashedly to make money the purpose of investing in bonds however is not it s to keep you invested in stocks when not if they levy the predictable pain of loss now it s easy to presume you are capable of enduring said losses when it is gains you ve enjoyed of late but let us remember back to the crisis accompanying the early days of the pandemic no let s look at something less recent but more protracted to determine if you have what it takes to stomach the worst of the market at the worst possible time do you have what it takes imagine you decided to pull the plug on work and launch into retirement on new year s eve 2007 in addition to a healthy social security retirement benefit you ve got a small pension and a nice round 1 000 000 in retirement savings you d survived the tech bubble in the early 2000s thanks to a relatively quick market rebound and consistent dollar cost averaging through the lows in your 401 k this made you confident that you could ride out whatever the market would bring holding onto the handful of large cap growth mutual funds that a demanding personal finance guru insisted would get the job done then in one year 2008 you lost 370 000 but you white knuckle gripped it gulping down a couple of extra helpings of high test eggnog at the family holiday party all while forcing a smile answering a barrage of questions about how much you were enjoying your retirement oh yeah you re retired so you were also taking out the 5 rule of thumb from the ol nest egg even as it got pummeled again in january of 2009 by the end of march you were staring at a roughly 50 loss 500 000 of your million in 14 months what would you have done the downside of downside tim maurer the return of your money now we could talk about a lot of things related to this parable that you hopefully didn t experience better equity diversification across the portfolio the benefits to be gained from a more thoughtful risk tolerance profile or the implementation of a dynamic income creation mechanism to name a few big ones but bigger yet is the point that allocating a material portion of this portfolio to boring bonds would ve helped ensure a degree of capital preservation that likely would ve made it possible to stick with the plan furthermore not all bonds are boring or at least boring enough corporate bonds sometimes mirror corporate stocks too closely leading larry swedroe a true investment guru to conclude the historical evidence suggests investors may be best served by excluding corporate bonds from their portfolios instead opting for the more stable in the fixed income stable like u s treasuries and only the highest rated muni bonds as appropriate just how much of a difference can it make well in 2008 the market as measured by the s p 500 lost 38 49 a little more than our hypothetical friend referenced above a simple portfolio with diversified equities representing 60 of the portfolio with 40 allocated to watching paint dry intermediate term treasuries would ve lost about 18 or 180 000 in the example we used by the way i think it s important to use actual numbers whenever possible rather than percentages so i d recommend looking at your portfolio balance doing a little multiplication and asking yourself the question would you have stuck with it much is touted about the upside potential of stocks and it s true much has also been said especially over the last several years about the dismal performance of bonds and especially the most boring variety and that is true also but the point of bonds isn t to impress and the sexier more aggressive portfolio that you abandon loses to the balanced portfolio you keep so consider following mark twain s advice and dare to be bored by a portion of your portfolio

cnn the trumpist republican party has shown it will toy with democracy now president joe biden is testing its willingness to play with economic fire the test comes in the upcoming showdown over raising the federal debt limit a painful political chore that periodically falls to congress when the treasury exhausts the amount of borrowing that lawmakers had previously authorized performing it is necessary for government to pay its bills and avert a destabilizing financial crisis the white house seeks cooperation from partisan adversaries as well as allies in congress so far republicans have vowed not to provide any it s a credible threat the danger represents a relatively recent development in american history for decades the statutory requirement that congress authorize additional borrowing has provided a venue for harmless skirmishes in which the party out of power flays the party in power for irresponsible borrowing one example march 2006 when it was president george w bush s turn to ask congress for a debt limit increases first term democratic sen barack obama denounced the failure of leadership that made it necessary obama and every other senate democrat opposed bush s request but the republican majority was large enough to approve it without threatening the economy by the time obama reached the oval office however tea party republicans had turned the customary political slap fight into a brass knuckles brawl their initial refusal to raise the debt limit in 2011 triggered a political and economic crisis it made financial markets plummet and forced the first ever downgrade in us government debt costing taxpayers billions in higher borrowing costs the ransom republicans demanded to end it deep federal spending cuts proved so unrealistic that congress repeatedly abandoned them congressional republicans dropped hostage taking once their own party recaptured the white house as much as democrats loathed president donald trump they did not stand in the way of debt limit hikes on his watch including after winning the house in 2018 biden s full court press that s what biden administration officials say must be done again as with every white house they note that a debt limit increase doesn t authorize new spending but merely preserves america s full faith and credit by permitting payment of debts already incurred the economic consequences of failing to do so would be catastrophic which is why that s an unacceptable outcome national economic council director brian deese told cnn in an interview last week in a statement treasury secretary janet yellen warned of irreparable harm to the us economy and the livelihoods of all americans senate minority leader mitch mcconnell insists that democrats shoulder the burden on their own they could do it by including a debt limit hike in the 3 5 trillion human infrastructure bill they seek under special budget rules that will sidestep a republican filibuster at the biden s team behest senate democrats decided not to do that they fear it might fatally weigh down their social spending bill and want to defuse the debt limit as a dangerous partisan weapon the pattern of rising republican aggression suggests that won t be easy when the republican revolution made newt gingrich the speaker in 1995 the house scuttled a procedural maneuver democrats had used to avoid debt limit headaches for the previous 16 years as they sought to thwart obama some congressional republicans went so far as to argue falsely that a federal debt default could be managed by selective prioritization of government s bills in reality the consequences would ripple throughout the american economy of 50 republican senators 46 signed a letter last week promising not to help biden raise the debt limit since this is a problem created by democrat spending in fact tax cuts and spending increases boosted the national debt by roughly 7 trillion or about one third during trump s single term as president it is the republicans who keep reinforcing misinformation for voters observed tony fratto who served as a top aide in the white house and treasury department under president bush a 2021 calling card for republicans in some ways misinformation has become the gop s 2021 calling card after tolerating trump s false claims that he won the 2020 election congressional republicans have stood by while state level gop officials change voting and election administration rules only six republican senators voted to create an independent commission to investigate the january 6 insurrection allowing that proposal to die by filibuster that sounds auspicious for biden s ability to persuade 10 republicans to overcome a debt limit filibuster this fall yet the white house has reason to hope that they re not going to let us default as the president put it last week senate democrats currently plan to attach a debt limit hike to a september spending bill that would keep the government running as his party has grown increasingly radicalized mcconnell has consistently shown an aversion to self inflicted wounds he displayed pragmatism last week in joining 18 republican senators to back biden s popular hard infrastructure bill the combination of gop triggered shutdown and debt crisis could jeopardize his hope of recapturing the senate in 2022 i d like to believe there are 10 republicans who will vote for this said fratto they need to find a fix

for years wall street was a top destination for star students like tashrima hossain a class president at stanford university with ambitions to change the world hossain had interned for nonprofits and was seriously considering going to graduate school but she figured a detour to wall street would teach her useful skills and provide networking opportunities and the six figure paycheck wouldn t hurt so she took an entry level job at j p morgan her goal was to do it for two years but hossain soon found herself putting in long hours crunching numbers in excel spreadsheets and preparing powerpoint presentations for more senior bankers seven months later she quit i kind of thought about it as a means to an end but when i started i realized that it wasn t necessarily the means to an end that i wanted hossain remembers preston gannaway for npr preston gannaway for npr frustrated by the long hours at j p morgan tashrima hossain decided to quit her high paying job there early she is photographed here in san francisco calif on wednesday august 11 2021 wall street has a big problem on its hands it s experiencing a year of record profits yet many of the young people it needs to fill its talent pool are having doubts about whether the work involved upwards of 80 hours per week is worth it it s a talent war and wall street is fighting hard drew pascarella a lecturer at cornell university s business school calls it a talent war in a fast improving jobs market star students have a lot of options and financial firms are vying with tech companies and private equity for top talent wall street is responding with their weapon of choice compensation most banks including bank of america morgan stanley and goldman sachs boosted pay in recent weeks for young employees and now offer starting salaries of at least 100 000 the pay being offered to junior bankers many straight out of college can sound obscene it can now surpass 150 000 when factoring in a performance bonus or roughly five times the per capita income in the u s i think the investment banks are watching each other and they re also watching other highly competitive industries pascarella says they want to make sure that they re staying on par but it s unclear if more money will be enough to improve recruitment and retention at investment banks especially in the midst of a pandemic that deprives young bankers from the networking and the on site learning that have been essential to the job a few months ago about a dozen young bankers at goldman sachs created a powerpoint presentation that detailed their desperation the bankers said they worked 98 hours per week on average and they slept five hours per night they said their mental health and physical health had declined that document went viral when a more than 100 000 salary is still not enough wall street recruiter anthony keizner a managing director at odyssey search partners has heard similar stories before during the pandemic some junior bankers stayed at their apartments in big cities and continued to work but others returned home and ended up hearing plenty from family and friends angela weiss afp via getty images angela weiss afp via getty images a wall st sign hangs at the new york stock exchange nyse at wall street on march 23 2021 in new york city often keizner says the comments they heard sounded something like this hold on you ve been sitting there it looks like for 48 hours straight with your laptop on the sofa like are they paying you enough to do this and after a few months people began to address that question by saying well maybe not keizner adds wall street is aware of the perception problem on its hands david solomon the ceo of goldman sachs responded to the complaints and criticism hurled by its junior employees in an earnings callwith analysts in this 24 7 connected world we have to help those transitioning into the workforce to understand that goldman sachs is a place where we work very hard to serve our clients but all need to be thoughtful about personal resilience and well being solomon said the goldman ceo pledged to take concrete actions including additional hiring reallocating resources and pursuing stricter enforcements of boundaries and he committed to enforcing one rule in particular prohibiting most work on saturdays to ensure its junior bankers have at least one day a week off meanwhile bank of america sent messages of encouragement to its junior bankers according to an internal memo obtained by npr announcing pay increases for analysts associates and vice presidents your efforts and wellbeing are critical to our success the heads of bank of america s global corporate and investment banking wrote yet doubts persist about whether wall street s efforts to raise pay and address morale will be enough hossain for one says a raise would not have persuaded her to stay at j p morgan she says she wanted the opportunity to build things to feel like she s making an actual impact today hossain is at facebook working on something that interests her more public policy as a program manager she is involved in the company s efforts to improve election integrity after the company came under intense scrutiny over its actions during the 2016 election even if i could have had an increase in salary i don t think that was enough for me to stay she says and largely the reason i left and took a significant pay cut to leave was because i wanted to do work that mattered to me and felt fulfilling copyright 2021 npr to see more visit

kansas city mo ap there are plenty of places to turn for accurate information about covid 19 your physician local health departments the u s centers for disease control but not perhaps your local government s public comment session during a meeting of the st louis county council earlier this month opponents of a possible mask mandate made so many misleading comments about masks vaccines and covid 19 that youtube removed the video for violating its policies against false claims about the virus i hope no one is making any medical decisions based on what they hear at our public forums said county councilwoman lisa clancy who supports mask wearing and said she believes most of her constituents do too the video was restored but clancy s worries about the impact of that misinformation remain videos of local government meetings have emerged as the latest vector of covid 19 misinformation broadcasting misleading claims about masks and vaccines to millions and creating new challenges for internet platforms trying to balance the potential harm against the need for government openness the latest video to go viral features a local physician who made several misleading claims about covid 19 while addressing the mount vernon community school corporation in fortville indiana on aug 6 in his 6 minute remarks dr dan stock tells the board that masks don t work vaccines don t prevent infection and state and federal health officials don t follow the science the video has amassed tens of millions of online views and prompted the indiana state department of health to push back stock did not return multiple messages seeking comment here comes a doctor in suspenders who goes in front of the school board and basically says what some people are thinking the masks are b s vaccines don t work and the cdc is lying it can be very compelling to laypeople said dr zubin damania a california physician who received so many messages about the indiana clip that he created his own video debunking stock s claims damania hosts a popular online medical show under the name zdoggmd his video debunking stock s comments has been viewed more than 400 000 times so far he said that while there are legitimate questions about the effectiveness of mask requirements for children stock s broad criticism of masks and vaccines went too far youtube removed several similar videos of local government meetings in north carolina missouri kansas and washington state in bellingham washington officials responded by temporarily suspending public comment sessions the false claims in those videos were made during the portion of the meeting devoted to public comment local officials have no control over what is said at these forums and say that s part of the point in kansas youtube pulled video of the may school board meeting in the 27 000 student shawnee mission district in which parents and a state lawmaker called for the district to remove its mask mandate citing medical misinformation the district where a mask mandate remains in effect responded by ending livestreaming of the public comment period district spokesman david smith acknowledged that it has been challenging to balance making the board meetings accessible and not spreading fallacies it was hard for me to hear things in the board meeting that weren t true and to know that those were going out without contradiction smith said i am all about free speech but when that free speech endangers people s lives it is hard to sit through that after hearing from local officials youtube reversed its decision and put the videos back up earlier this month the company which is owned by google announced a change to its covid misinformation policy to allow exceptions for local government meetings though youtube may still remove content that uses remarks from public forums in an attempt to mislead while we have clear policies to remove harmful covid 19 misinformation we also recognize the importance of organizations like school districts and city councils using youtube to share recordings of open public forums even when comments at those forums may violate our policies company spokeswoman elena hernandez said the deluge of false claims about the virus has challenged other platforms too twitter and facebook each have their own policies on covid 19 misinformation and say that like youtube they attach labels to misleading content and remove the worst of it public comment sessions preceding local government meetings have long been known for sometimes colorful remarks from local residents but before the internet if someone were to drone on about fluoride in the drinking water for instance their comments weren t likely to become national news now thanks to the internet and social media the misleading musings of a local doctor speaking before a school board can compete for attention with the recommendations of the cdc it was only a matter of time before misleading comments at these local public forums went viral according to jennifer grygiel a communications professor at syracuse university who studies social media platforms grygiel suggested a few possible ways to minimize the impact of misinformation without muzzling local governments grygiel said clear labels on government broadcasts would help viewers understand what they re watching keeping the video on the government s website instead of making it shareable on youtube could allow local residents to watch without enabling the spread of videos more widely anytime there is a public arena a city council hearing a school board meeting a public park the public has the opportunity to potentially spread misinformation grygiel said what s changed is it used to stay local ____ klepper reported from providence rhode island
