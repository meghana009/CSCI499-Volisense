ai powered video analytics tools second quarter 2022 financial results it should be noted that the following financial results represent the consolidation of the company with its subsidiaries duos technologies inc and truevue360 total revenue for q2 2022 increased 458 to 3 62 million compared to 649 000 in the second quarter of 2021 q2 2021 total revenue for q2 2022 represents an aggregate of approximately 2 78 million of technology systems revenue and approximately 837 000 in recurring services and consulting revenue the increase in total revenue for q2 2022 compared to q2 2021 was driven by the production and start of installation of new and upgraded railcar inspection portals rip which are recorded in the technology systems portion of the business management expects this trend to continue for the rest of 2022 and into 2023 although supply chain issues continue to extend deadlines for shipment of key components used in duos technology systems while certain orders were delayed from 2021 into 2022 management remains encouraged by the breadth and scope of recent bids in which the company has participated cost of revenues for q2 2022 increased 154 to 2 33 million compared to 918 000 for q2 2021 cost of revenues on technology systems increased during the three months ended june 30 2022 compared to the equivalent period in 2021 which is consistent with the increase in revenues albeit at a slower overall rate the higher level of cost was mainly due to higher costs of materials due to increased production levels and also to supply chain disruptions and inflation while the company expects that macro economic factors will continue to drive prices duos expects its structural realignment to eventually aid in lowering costs as a percentage of the overall system price going forward although inflation may impede this effort as previously noted the company s organization and related cost structure was realigned to provide the capability to manufacture install and support multiple production systems simultaneously in accordance with this shift in structure certain staff were re assigned or replaced and new staff added in key areas particularly engineering software development and ai gross margin for q2 2022 increased 575 to 1 28 million compared to negative 270 000 for q2 2021 as previously discussed the company has revamped its operations to support an anticipated increase in the number of new systems going forward the result in additional cost of revenues was covered by a greater increase in revenues during the second quarter of 2022 the main reason for the increased costs is the higher level of production costs for materials as well as supply chain disruptions and inflation we anticipate further improvements in the overall gross margin for the full year of 2022 certain macro economic factors which are driving increased costs for materials and labor may result in higher costs for project implementation that cannot be wholly or even partially passed on to our customers which may result in delaying our progress towards profitability into 2023 operating expenses for q2 2022 remained flat at 2 68 million compared to 2 68 million for q2 2021 the slight increases in cost for sales and marketing and research and development were offset by the decrease in general and administration costs compared q2 2021 overall the company continues to focus on stabilizing operating expenses while meeting the increased needs of its customers net operating loss for q2 2022 totaled 1 39 million compared to net operating loss of 2 95 million for q2 2021 the decrease in net operating loss for q2 2022 compared to q2 2021 was driven by higher revenues recorded in the quarter resulting from increases in both the company s technology systems and services and consulting revenues slower growth in costs of those revenues and flat operating expenses net loss for q2 2022 totaled 1 34 million compared to net loss of 2 95 million for q2 2021 the decrease in net loss for q2 2022 compared to q2 2021 was driven by an increase in revenues as described above along with slower growing expenses at june 30 2022 totaled 6 27 million compared to 894 000 at december 31 2021 six month 2022 financial results total revenue increased 80 to 5 06 million from 2 80 million in the same period last year the increase in total revenue was driven by the start of production and new installations in the technology systems portion of the company s business along with continuing increases in services and consulting revenues which were driven by anticipated receipt of notices to proceed for new contracts that were expected earlier in the year cost of revenues increased 38 to 3 55 million from 2 57 million in the same period last year cost of revenues on technology systems increased during the six months ended june 30 2022 compared to the equivalent period in 2021 which is not only consistent with the increase in revenues but at a slower rate during this period than the increase in revenues partially due to timing differences the higher level of cost was mainly due to higher costs related to higher revenues but supply chain disruptions and inflation also continue to have an impact additional work previously necessary on certain of the company s installations is in the process of completion some of which will be paid for by the clients as a result of damage done to certain systems while we expect that macro economic factors will continue to drive prices the company expects its structural realignment to aid in lowering costs as a percentage of the overall system price going forward as previously noted the company s organization and related cost structure was realigned to provide the capability to manufacture install and support multiple production systems simultaneously in accordance with this shift in structure certain staff were re assigned or replaced and new staff added in key areas particularly engineering software development and ai gross margin increased 545 to 1 50 million from 233 000 in the same period last year as previously discussed the company has revamped its operations to support an anticipated increase in the number of new systems going forward the resultant additional cost of revenues was covered by a greater increase in revenues during the first half of 2022 the main reason for the continuing high level of cost is higher costs of materials based on more production of systems as well as supply chain disruptions and inflation the company continues to anticipate continued improvement in the overall gross margin for the full year of 2022 with much of the improvement expected to occur in the second half of the year certain macro economic factors which are driving increased costs for materials and labor may result in higher costs for project implementation that cannot be wholly or even partially passed on to customers and which may result in delaying our progress towards profitability into 2023 operating expenses increased 11 to 5 54 million from 5 00 million in the same period last year the increase in operating expenses was driven by costs associated with growing the business and the effects of inflation on salaries and general overhead the company continues to expect overall costs to grow due to macro economic factors in addition to organic growth costs related to the business where possible the company continues to focus on stabilizing operating expenses while meeting the increase needs of customers net operating loss totaled 4 04 million compared to net operating loss of 4 77 million in the same period last year the decrease in losses from operations was primarily the result of higher revenues recorded in the period as a consequence of the start of new projects and receipt of materials for production a positive trend was the higher revenue recorded without a corresponding greater relative cost of sales even with higher costs of materials resulting from supply chain disruptions and inflation net loss totaled 3 99 million compared to a net loss of 3 36 million in the same period last year the greater net loss was driven by the higher costs in 2021 being offset by the ppp loan forgiveness recorded in the first quarter of 2021 as other income financial outlook at the end of the second quarter the company s contracts in backlog represented approximately 14 0 16 0 million in revenue of which approximately 12 0 million is expected to be recognized in calendar 2022 the balance of contract backlog is comprised of multi year service and software agreements as well as project revenues spanning into fiscal 2023 based on these committed contracts and near term pending orders that are already performing or scheduled to be executed throughout the course of 2022 the company is reiterating its previously stated revenue expectations for the fiscal year ending december 31 2022 the company expects total revenue for 2022 to range between 16 5 million and 18 million representing an increase of 99 to 117 from 2021 duos expects this improvement in operating results to be reflected over the course of the full year in 2022 as a result of timing and other factors the company expects revenues in the first and second quarters of 2022 to represent a significantly lower portion of annual revenue than the third and fourth quarters management commentary in the second quarter we executed across all segments of our business and are tracking according to our long term growth plan said duos chief executive officer chuck ferry our financial performance during the period represented an order of magnitude improvement over our results in recent quarters highlighted by triple digit increases in revenues and gross margins along with stabilized expenses the last metric serving as a byproduct of our foundational work over the last year and a half to be able to support a greater number of deployments as we scale operationally we currently have four rail inspection portals at various stages of implementation with three of those projects slated for completion in the coming quarter we have continued to improve our installation procedures in field performance and maintenance capabilities all of which have improved customer relations leading to increased recurring revenue and add on sales opportunities while supply chain and inflationary pressures persist we are continuing to take remedial actions that have mitigated impacts to a degree and have us firmly on the path to meet our

interview with jeff waters by andrew craig photographs by kai swillus the latest album from veteran canadian metal act annihilator is metal ii a quasi re recording of the of the 2007 album metal although all the guest musicians remain from the original release this new version replaces dave padden vocals guitarist in annihilator 2003 2014 and journeyman drummer mike mangini with new full time annihilator vocalist stu block into eternity ex iced earth and former slayer drummer dave lombardo admittedly it seems like a bit of a random release for the band coming out the pandemic but in reality metal ii is the culmination of a series of events that had a huge impact on the legacy of the band and brought band leader jeff waters to the brink of death the original metal album stands out for its collaborations but also the way that waters took chances and played outside the metal box a characteristic that dominates the latter half of the band s career it seems that when annihilator comes up in conversation it s usually worship for the first two releases 1989 s alice in hell and 1990 s never neverland if you go to germany spain holland anywhere over here except maybe a few scandinavian countries alice in hell is not ranked as the number one annihilator album says waters from his uk studio geographically absolutely we dropped out of the north american market but since then we ve sold four million records almost all of them were only released in europe japan and south america 1993 was our last real release in north america our first two albums were pretty big there but i disappeared i had never even tried to get back in to the united states and canada for decades if you re the guy who writes almost all of the songs plays on the album produces mixes engineers masters works on the cover books most of the festivals and most of the tours manages takes care of all the business you could go on and on if you do all that stuff you don t have a lot of time the one good thing that happened to us from getting dropped by roadrunner records in 1993 was i actually found that our following overseas kept ramping up and kept going i got out of this four week depression i had when they let us go and my manager said this is the best thing that could have happened to you your band and your career you re now actually out of a long term typical old school the artist is screwed contract now you re free since then the fanbase labels publishers and press are only interested in us in europe i thought that i d forget my home country and we ll go over there and it just stayed like that up until even today i thought that i d forget my home country and we ll go over there and it just stayed like that up until even today then there s the modern diversity of the annihilator catalogue to be an annihilator fan is to either accept the fact that not every album will be for you or to accept waters vision of a band that can and will explore a variety of sounds with a variety of musicians it s a formula that could be defined as a lack of formula but it s an idea that put annihilator at the top of the charts in japan and cemented their status in europe i write kinda goofy songs one minute about kraft dinner and chicken and corn next minute i m writing a heavy thrash song next minute i m doing some ballady thing next minute it s some disgusting murderous lyrics that should be in a cannibal corpse song but it s acoustic he says chuckling that s actually the wrong way to go if you re trying to develop a big fan base or sell records image sticking to a formula like an ac dc or a slayer did that worked for them and those are my two favorite bands that kind of music was not accepted in the states or canada during a time when the vocals got heavy and screamo ish in the 2000s and onward but i got really lucky for half my career japan was nuts about us like a bon jovi level it was ridiculous it was bed of roses and an annihilator song called only be lonely a ballad fighting for the top spot then i had a fan base in europe it was so varied they were so open to my ridiculous extremes heavy metal with cheesy lyrics sometimes all this wacky stuff thrown together and lack of a focused style for north american fans who don t know anything about us don t worry you shouldn t necessarilyknow anything about us we ve got a whole bunch of singers and different styles of metal music some of it freakin good some of it not so good some of it average we re also trying to get back to north america and do some shows no matter what they re like and have a lot of fun with it if i was lucky to have a real fan base in north america i think my personal life my addiction life health and everything would have gone to shit the rise of the internet did help a cult of fans flourish back in north america although the band does play canadian shows now and then waters makes it clear that doing so more often over the years would not be a pleasant experience and perhaps would have had a negative effect on his entire life when the internet started a few people started going i remember that band or who are these guys why are they not playing in our country he says if i had toured north american more i would have been one of these poor musicians who is thrown into a nasty tour bus by a label on a four band package with no showers i woulda done that for two years and toured the states three times i watched my friends bands go through these bills bands that were on billboard charts you d see machine head trivium children of bodom i remember alexi saying yeah it s the third or fourth time we ve toured america for the same album while the record company s makin all the money and they re starving it was unbelievable if i was lucky to have a real fan base in north america i think my personal life my addiction life health and everything would have gone to shit i m really lucky the way it worked out i can tell you that annihilator s most recent full studio album is 2020 s ballistic sadistic released just before the pandemic hit the album was already out and the band had a successful pre release tour this put waters in a good place when everything shut down he was able to help out a few well known musician friends that were suffering financially and also made a donation against animal cruelty to the rspca in the uk but while he escaped the more severe financial effects of the pandemic waters and his family were unlucky enough to be affected by covid itself it was also an experience that would affect annihilator s very legacy i may have escaped what most musicians end up having to deal with but i got that near death thing goin on at the time he says seriously i got hit with covid severely and my family got hit i m sure a lot of people say this but i had it really bad not as bad as will from death angel but we re talking two weeks where i wasn t sure what was going to happen it felt like someone sitting on my chest each breath in and out was like a fire crackling like a severe asthma attack it was brutal i went to the hospital they turned me away they said if we admit you we re going to put that breathing tube down your throat and you don t want it another one to two percent less oxygen and then you d have to be admitted i took that gamble and i went home and i made it through but it took me about six months to recover my lungs i don t know what it was they say long covid but it devastated my lungs i couldn t sit in this chair i was having problems going up and down stairs it was just nuts it felt like someone sitting on my chest each breath in and out was like a fire crackling like a severe asthma attack it was brutal it was an experience that made waters take a deeper look at his life and career he had just turned 55 had a loving family hadn t had a drink for over 20 years and hadn t smoked in three years but while his own house was order he realized the annihilator legacy was in disarray and as soon as he regained his health he began the huge process of the consolidating the band s entire catalog with the intention of selling the whole thing i took stock of my life in that time and did what some people end up having to do which is sitting back and actually really talking to yourself going oh fuck what if this is the big one he exclaims i thought okay number one my family do they know i love em yes they do number two are they financially okay yes they are number three how s my little music legacy then i realized that if i dropped dead tomorrow i didn t have that in order i had all these releases scattered around they weren t on itunes or spotify no one could get em when i recovered i got everything together 22 releases got them all back got them all here in my studio spent three months working on it all remixing the audio and remastering and then shopped around for record companies this was before everybody started selling their stuff i saw the jimi hendrix debacle way back when the family was fighting about the legacy and the rights going back and forth in court i thought in my case in my little world i m gonna get everything back and i m gonna sell it because nobody knows a record deal and publishing more than a record company and a publishing company so let s get it all to them and write the past off if anybody ever hears of my band and wants to get stuff they ll get the best versions we can give them and they ll always be there so at least that job s done now by me how s my little music legacy then i realized that if i dropped dead tomorrow i didn t have that in order with the remixed and remastered annihilator catalog set for release over the next few years by german label earmusic waters was approached to create something new to help promote the deal this was the final catalyst that led to the creation and release of metal ii for waters the first metal release was the one album that he felt could have been done better under different circumstances waters himself felt rushed with competing schedules and dealing with the rights involved with getting all the featured guest musicians that along with some other external factors led him to feel that he along with padden and mangini just didn t make it work overall he proposed to the label that he partially rerecord the album with a new lineup as well keep plans to reissue the original metal album so as to not insult padden mangini or fans who enjoyed it the first time why don t we redo it with my favorite living drummer and one of my favorite singers says waters happily also put that out let s do it for fun don t do it with the idea that this is a studio album where we re gonna take lots of time on the tracks in fact do the opposite get the singer and the drummer to do it on their own the way they want to do it not the way waters or some producer says they have to do it the two guys were stunned because they were not used to that in any situation i actually wanted to get stu block in annihilator way back when he first started but i couldn t get him in time he said yes right away because he liked the early annihilator records see laughs redoing it was not to do it the way it should have been if i d done that i would have flown lombardo in and we would have done a real studio album and taken a week on the drums we re not trying to top the other one waters credits block as an extremely versatile vocalist able to flow between classic and more extreme metal styles he says he encouraged block to follow his own instincts in terms of his vocals on metal ii which sent the singer into a bit of a panic it wasn t until the song couple suicide featuring danko jones and angela gossow that block found his groove as waters puts it that s the only song on the record that i was scratching my head at going the originals are always better no matter what you do he says some people could probably make better production when they do it or something s better like their drummer s dave lombardo danko and i had written songs together for a couple annihilator records but that song that s the one out of the whole thing where i can honestly say that s smokin the rest are just us having fun doing our thing couple suicide with stu and dave doing it it s fantastic metal ii signifies a new chapter for annihilator waters says that he s working on a project that he calls hard rock and not heavy metal but he also says that the days of new annihilator albums may be over with the catalog secure and having taken stock of his career and legacy waters is hyper aware of the type of album he wants to release and in his mind it s not something that s possible what is possible is to get the music in front of as many people as he can the record we did put out just before the pandemic was probably the best one i m ever going to be able to do again because when you re the main writer and you ve been doing this a long time you do copy yourself and you do draw too much sometimes from other bands he says it is easier to repeat yourself often i have this surge where i get one or two records that are kind of like meh and then you get the one where you re like okay that one brought us back ballistic sadistic that s probably the best i m gonna get we all know the phrase quit when you re ahead we ve all got our favorite bands but we don t like every single song and record that they ve ever done i ve got every iron maiden and priest all the old stuff and new stuff i don t like every record never neverland is our back in black and i m never gonna get that again a record where almost every song on it is badass i wanted to try early on but if ac dc didn t or couldn t do back in black again and slayer couldn t get reign in blood again i knew that wasn t going to be the case for us but the continued part is going to be playing shows playing with some bigger bands in europe and making it to the states and canada again that s my real focus on the band

2022 as compared to 6 5 million for the same period in 2021 and 0 4 million for the three months ended march 31 2022 this is a non gaap financial measure see below for an explanation and reconciliation of this non gaap financial measure to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure several factors impacted financial results in the second quarter of 2022 as previously discussed increased costs associated with the completion and demobilization of three legacy projects continued into the second quarter however two of the projects have now been completed and the third is substantially complete additionally as expected the startup challenges relating to the two large beneficial use projects previously discussed continued in the quarter the company continues to forecast improvement in these long term projects in the second half of the year charah solutions also continues to work closely with customers on contract adjustments and billing milestones that we expect will provide recovery of certain costs incurred to date and improve contractual profitability and cash flow during the second half of the year and throughout the remaining contract period charah solutions business results and growth prospects improved in the second quarter said scott sewell president and chief executive officer of charah solution we are not the same company we were at our ipo or even two years ago with the addition of our highly profitable environmental risk transfer ert business and our first commercial envirosource beneficiation technology agreement we now have five dynamic income streams opportunities across all our business categories remediation and compliance byproduct services which includes envirosource ert and raw material sales are expanding and our pace of new awards is again accelerating though our second quarter continued to be impacted by legacy construction projects and startup challenges relating to two long term beneficial use projects we expect improvement in the second half of 2022 and we are well positioned for future earnings and cash flow growth continued mr sewell first envirosource beneficiation technology award charah solutions is very excited to announce that it has been awarded and the parties have agreed on the principal terms of a long term contract for the company s proprietary envirosource fly ash beneficiation technology to recycle reclaimed ash with a major utility in the western u s the parties are actively working to finalize and sign definitive contract documents charah solutions envirosource technology makes formerly unusable fly ash stored in ponds and landfills marketable to ready mix concrete producers to be beneficially used in the production of concrete providing a superior product at a lower cost the company expects to beneficiate and recycle approximately 130 000 tons of ash per year over the ten year life of the contract from two of the customer s ash ponds all beneficiated ash is expected to be sold into the local ready mix concrete market as a substitute for portland cement by reducing the need for portland cement a leading contributor to greenhouse gases we believe this first environmentally sustainable recycling project will save over 500 000 tons of co 2 from entering the atmosphere deployment of our innovative envirosource technology should also help reduce groundwater risk in and around the current ash storage facilities the company expects construction to begin in the second half of this year with commissioning in the later part of 2023 we are thrilled to reach an agreement on this much anticipated long term contract for our first in the field envirosource unit said mr sewell we believe this ash recycling technology will be a game changer as our customers now have a cost effective and sustainable solution to address their environmental remediation requirements and that will help drive a much needed reduction of greenhouse gases through the replacement of portland cement envirosource requires a far less significant capital investment compared to other alternatives on the market while at the same time increasing the tonnage of beneficiated fly ash used in concrete production and decreasing the use of natural resources we take our esg commitments seriously and we expect that this innovative technology will further enable us to meet and exceed our environmental goals as well as those of our customers with an estimated 3 billion addressable market for environmentally friendly portland cement substitutes and as the efforts to reduce greenhouse gases in the u s continue to accelerate we believe there are substantial opportunities to deploy our envirosource beneficiation technology to address this need we believe the deployment of this inaugural envirosource unit will represent the first of many facilities we expect to install nationwide to benefit our utility partners and ready mix customers concluded mr sewell ert project progress charah solutions closed on two new ert projects in april with genon the avon lake facility in ohio and the cheswick facility in pennsylvania in july the avon lake environmental redevelopment group alerg charah solutions wholly owned ert subsidiary along with the mayor of avon lake and representatives from the avon lake community investment corporation held a public meeting for the citizens of the avon lake area to participate in the unveiling of the company s project redevelopment plans ask questions and provide feedback since closing on the property scrap sales have begun at avon lake and the company expects the income from sales of recyclable scrap and parcels to exceed original projections before beginning operations at the cheswick ert project charah solutions received 35 3 million in restricted and unrestricted cash upfront and recognized a 4 5 million deferred gain based on the excess of cash received for the cheswick parcels over the recorded asset retirement obligations aro the company expects to recognize this deferred gain into earnings as the aro work is performed additionally scrap sales activities have also begun at cheswick at both cheswick and avon lake the company expects to recognize significant positive cash flows over the lives of the projects driven by the redevelopment of attractive real estate parcels and large volume sales of recyclable scrap and equipment with the closing of the avon lake and cheswick erts in the second quarter charah solutions recorded restricted and unrestricted cash receipts of 38 2 million charah solutions continues to believe that the avon lake and cheswick ert projects will be outstanding projects for the citizens of the communities where these facilities are located and for the company s shareholders at the gibbons creek ert project remediation activities continue to run ahead of schedule and the company expects to complete all remediation work in early 2023 all remaining real estate parcels at gibbons creek are under contract to be sold and the company expects closing on these parcel sales to resume in the second half of the year and into early 2023 since the beginning of the gibbons creek project the company has recorded approximately 44 million of gross proceeds from real estate parcel and scrap sales with the anticipated sales of the remaining parcels that are under contract with third parties charah solutions anticipates the total gross proceeds from real estate parcel and scrap sales to be approximately 68 million additionally the company has recognized project to date gains on aro settlements of 7 6 million resulting from differences between the estimated costs used in the initial measurement of the fair value of the company s aros and the actual costs incurred for specific remediation tasks recognized on a proportionate basis charah solutions expects to recognize further gains on aro settlement through the completion of the project alerg charah solutions and our ert partners were very pleased to join with the mayor of avon lake and members of the avon lake community investment corporation to publicly unveil our once in a lifetime lakefront transformation project overview and initial redevelopment options to the citizens of the city of avon lake last month said mr sewell our team along with city leaders has been planning and identifying options for the best use of the property with the intent to benefit all members of the community drive economic impact increase the tax base and create jobs all while sustainably redeveloping the site for the betterment of the environment this project is a generational opportunity to reframe the former power plant site into a regional attraction while restoring the lakefront ecosystem along with the cheswick ert and the highly successful gibbons creek ert that is rapidly concluding we are tremendously excited about the future of our ert business additional business updates new contract awards charah solutions year to date new awards have grown to 328 million driven by a 9 year multi pond ash remediation project with a long term utility partner in the southeast and the first envirosource award the company also announced other awards including three coal ash remediation and byproduct services contracts across louisiana and arkansas we were pleased that new customer awards have accelerated since the first quarter with the four new awards with regulated utilities we announced continued mr sewell we are honored to be trusted by a long term utility partner in the southeast with one of the largest and longest term contracts in charah solutions history additionally we recently announced three ash pond remediation and landfill operations contracts across louisiana and arkansas these remediation and compliance and byproduct services projects are the historic core of our business and we are pleased to continue to be recognized as a leader in this space together these projects bring our year to date new awards to over 328 million concluded mr sewell contracted backlog combined with record new project awards in each of the past three years year to date 2022 awards bring the company s estimated backlog of future work to 1 55 billion of revenue extending 14 years to 2036 in presenting the company s revenue backlog for the first time charah solutions is pleased to provide better visibility and transparency into its long term book of work spread across the remediation and compliance and byproduct services categories which make up 41 and 59 of the backlog respectively this 1 55 billion revenue backlog does not include ongoing ert projects which are recorded through other income instead of revenue or revenue from raw material sales which are not under long term contracts but are expected to continue into the future with this strong and growing backlog of work charah solutions is well positioned to grow top line revenue and cash flow accelerate the positive momentum seen across the company s lines of business and be the partner of choice for solving customers most complex environmental challenges we are very happy to provide more information about the value and term of our 1 55 billion 14 year backlog in the remediation and compliance and byproduct services businesses in addition to having the largest backlog in the company s history we are also expecting over 30 growth in our raw materials business and we are tremendously excited about the continued success and growth of our ert business which we believe will further add to the company s profitability and positive cash flows charah solutions broad range of environmental remediation and byproduct management services are in demand and growing and we are

anticipated requests for proposals that are projected to be awarded over the next two years as previously discussed we expected to see customer activity pick up in the second half of the year following the slowdown we saw earlier this year after the epa s january 11 2022 announcement strengthening the 2015 ccr regulations said mr sewell during the second quarter we saw increased market activity with respect to customer interactions inquiries and rfps our opportunity set continues to expand as our utility and independent power producer customers address their environmental remediation requirements we are encouraged by the continued expansion in the addressable market we are particularly excited about the potential growth in our ert opportunities based on increases in our rfps and unsolicited bids we have made to potential ert customers during the year i want to thank all of our dedicated team members as they work hard every day to operate safely provide

2022 guidance progress charah solutions today updates the guidance ranges previously given on its first quarter 2022 earnings call revenue for the year is now projected to be 310 340 million reduced from the previous range of 325 365 million net loss attributable to charah solutions is now expected to be 10 30 million previously 8 12 million adjusted ebitda 2 guidance is reduced to a range of 25 30 million from previous guidance of 35 40 million and adjusted free cash flow 2 for the year is now projected to be 5 10 million from a previous projection of 5 15 million the company s ability to realize the updated guidance range assumes successful negotiation of the customer contract adjustments previously discussed the reductions in the adjusted ebitda 2 and adjusted free cash flow 2 guidance from the ranges previously provided are due to an expected push out in the timing of earnings recognized from ert projects and increased costs associated with the completion and demobilization of legacy projects previously discussed 2 the forward looking measures of 2022 adjusted ebitda and adjusted free cash flow are non gaap financial measures that cannot be reconciled to net loss attributable to charah solutions inc and cash flows from operating activities respectively as the most directly comparable gaap financial measure without unreasonable effort primarily because

such statement is made and the company undertakes no obligation to correct or update any forward looking statement whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise except as required by applicable law non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are not financial measures determined in accordance with gaap charah solutions defines adjusted ebitda as net loss attributable to charah solutions inc before income from discontinued operations net of tax interest expense net loss on extinguishment of debt income taxes depreciation and amortization equity based compensation impairment expense including inventory reserves gain on change in contingent payment liability and transaction related expenses and other items adjusted ebitda margin represents the ratio of adjusted ebitda to total revenue management believes adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitda margin are useful performance measures because they allow for an effective evaluation of our operating performance compared to our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure management excludes the items listed above from net loss attributable to charah solutions inc in arriving at adjusted ebitda because these amounts are either non recurring or can vary substantially within charah solutions industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net loss attributable to charah solutions inc determined according to gaap certain items excluded from adjusted ebitda are significant components in understanding and assessing a company s financial performance such as a company s cost of capital and tax structure as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets none of which are reflected in adjusted ebitda charah solutions adjusted ebitda presentation should not be construed as an indication that the company s results will be unaffected by the items excluded from adjusted ebitda charah solutions computations of adjusted ebitda may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies charah solutions uses adjusted ebitda margin to measure the company s business s success in managing its cost base and improving profitability a reconciliation between adjusted ebitda to net loss attributable to charah solutions inc charah solutions most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap along with a calculation of the company s adjusted ebitda margin is included in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders and adjusted loss per basic diluted share are not financial measures determined in accordance with gaap charah solutions defines adjusted net loss attributable to common stockholders as net loss attributable to common stockholders less on a post tax basis income from discontinued operations net of tax and plus on a post tax basis loss on extinguishment of debt impairment expense including inventory reserves and transaction related expenses and other items management excludes the items listed above to provide a more meaningful comparison of the company s operating performance when compared to prior periods adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per basic diluted share should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net loss attributable to common stockholders or loss per basic diluted share determined in accordance with gaap a reconciliation of adjusted net loss and adjusted loss per basic diluted share to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap is provided in the supplemental financial data attached to this press release adjusted free cash flow is not a financial measure determined in accordance with gaap we define adjusted free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities cash and restricted cash received from ert transactions and proceeds from the sales of real estate property and equipment less cash used for capital expenditures we include cash and restricted cash received from ert transactions and proceeds from the sales of real estate property and equipment and deduct cash used for capital expenditures because we consider them to be a necessary component of our ongoing operations we consider adjusted free cash flow to be a measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash generated by the business that can be used for investing in our business and strengthening our balance sheet but it is not intended to represent the amount of cash flow available for discretionary expenditures since other non discretionary expenditures such as mandatory debt service requirements are not deducted from this measure the company uses non gaap measures internally as a key performance measure of the results of operations for purposes of evaluating performance these measures facilitate comparison of operating performance between periods and help investors better understand company s operating results by excluding certain items that may not be indicative of the company s core business or operating results the company believes the use of these measures enables management and investors to evaluate and compare from period to period the company s operating performance in a meaningful and consistent manner the non gaap measures are a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by or presented in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to or more meaningful than net income or earnings per basic diluted share as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our operating results backlog backlog amounts are determined based on among other things contracted fixed price and lump sum awards contracted unit price awards contracted byproduct services awards based on customer provided ccr projections with the company s experience based estimates of market sales prices and the recently awarded envirosource project these estimates may prove inaccurate which could cause estimated revenue to be realized in periods later than originally expected or not at all we have occasionally experienced postponements cancellations and reductions in expected future work due to changes in our customers spending plans estimated plant production market volatility supply and demand and regulatory and other factors in certain volume based contracts our customers are not contractually committed to providing certain byproduct volumes there can be no assurance as to the accuracy of our estimates or that contracts included in our backlog will be profitable as a result our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenue and earnings guidance language this guidance is based on our current expectations of no material worsening of the covid 19 pandemic specifically including but not limited to no material customer work stoppages no significant employee absences no exacerbated supply chain or transportation issues and no government mandated quarantines any worsening of the covid 19 pandemic could materially affect our 2022 outlook although we have not experienced significant disruptions thus far from the pandemic due to the critical nature of our customers operations the pandemic or any future major public health crisis could impact our business consolidated results of operations and financial condition in the future we are monitoring the impact on our business of current macroeconomic conditions particularly with regard to the availability and cost of labor and supply chain issues particularly affecting transportation logistics and the availability of certain materials we have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market although we have not experienced any material disruptions due to labor shortages a sustained labor shortage or an increase in turnover whether attributable to the covid 19 pandemic or general macroeconomic conditions could result in higher labor costs for us or our subcontractors supply chain issues including shortages of equipment vehicles and construction supplies affecting us or our subcontractors could increase our costs or cause delays in our ability to complete our projects in addition there are timing uncertainties associated with the startup of recently announced customer awards including ert awards as with our 2021 results the impact of weather including hurricanes excessive rain or moderate temperatures could adversely affect our results

through our customers mr wiens continued the current calendar year has seen the macro economic environment change around us quite significantly with unprecedented levels of inflation global supply chain disruptions and a war in europe the current macro economic environment is not only creating uncertainty for the housing markets in all three regions we do business in but it is also putting pressure on our fiscal year 2023 financial results due to increased input and freight costs that said we are confident we will be able to deliver growth above market and strong returns in fiscal year 2023 and that is reflected in our updated guidance we provided today which at its midpoint represents 22 growth in adjusted net income versus the prior year discussing james hardie s ability to

16 to 11 4 million with an ebit margin of 10 3 the ebit margin was reduced by 280 basis points due to the impact of inflation on key energy prices as well as reduced volumes james hardie chief financial officer jason miele remarked the european team s execution on our high value product mix strategy has resulted in strong price mix growth which underpins the ongoing transformation of the business however our european business is facing significant headwinds from inflationary pressures and a slowing housing market capital resources operating cash flow generation of us 153 6 million in

implementing carbon budgets in new and existing buildings this op ed is the fifth article in a series of svn speaks conversations with industry thought leaders on helping architects and planners to decarbonize our cities amidst a climate crisis over the last two decades the building industry has been developing new ways of decreasing energy use and related carbon emissions in new buildings be it through the use of a range of rating systems or improved building codes such as bc s step code but programs and policies to drive reductions in the existing building stock have proved more challenging in early 2022 the city of montreal rolled out a new requirement for large existing buildings to measure and disclose their fossil fuel usage on an annual basis tracking and disclosing energy usage will be followed by mandatory reduction targets this comes on the heels of legislation implemented by the province of quebec that will prohibit new oil based heating systems and limit new natural gas systems beginning in 2024 these are bold moves and so watching how these policies roll out in montreal will be helpful for informing similar policies across the country i recently spoke with philippe dunsky president of dunsky energy climate advisors as part of svn architects planners linkedin live series svn speaks based in montreal dunsky brings over 30 years of experience supporting governments utility companies businesses and non profits across north america to accelerate the transition to clean energy through policies strategies and investment decisions dunsky s firm played a key role in montreal s climate bylaws first by mapping montreal s greenhouse gas ghg footprint and then assessing reduction opportunities and costs this initial work found that the greater montreal area has the potential to realistically achieve 55 60 ghg reductions by 2030 and 100 or net zero emissions by 2050 the city of montreal adopted those targets and proceeded to develop a plan with dunsky s support to achieve them the plan s focus on emissions from buildings is noteworthy at a high level owners must measure and disclose their buildings emissions to the city by 2024 a reasonably simple requirement because measuring the fossil fuels required to heat buildings doesn t include measuring embodied carbon the disclosure process begins with buildings over 15 000 sq m followed by buildings above 5 000 sq m and 2 000 sq m in 2025 and 2026 respectively after this initial information period mandatory ghg performance requirements take effect starting in 2028 when the largest buildings have to satisfy the first level of mandatory emissions reductions as dunsky noted what s critical is that the emissions caps are going to be laid out in advance so that everyone knows where they need to be at each milestone leading up to 2040 when every building will have to be at net zero what anticipated effects will montreal s energy performance and disclosure have on the building industry will the insurance or finance sectors help or hinder market uptake dunsky explained that disclosure and performance criteria are both necessary for a workable plan adding if the banks have a clear understanding of how standards evolve they will require building owners to make sure their investments are not just near term or simply aesthetic but can achieve net zero to avoid future liability change is inevitable but not all building owners will embrace it still dunsky believes the clarity of the message is essential by setting a hard target of zero net emissions by 2040 building owners and the real estate community at large know the end game and can plan accordingly furthermore in leading by example the city of montreal is requiring that its own buildings achieve net zero a full 10 years earlier by 2030 the city will make it a lot harder to say this is impossible or crazy he also acknowledged a growing consensus on the need to act on climate change with building owners and lenders increasingly stepping up with many supporting strong regulations so that everyone can be on a level playing field while the city of montreal took the lead within the greater montreal area to set net zero targets surrounding municipalities have yet to adopt similar measures could montreal s ambitious policies harm its economy dunsky believed that most stakeholders understand the inevitability of climate change citing the gas utilities who generally supported montreal s policies because they want to be part of the solution gas utilities are currently looking at renewable natural gas as a source of net zero energy he added ultimately the way to address the competitiveness issue between montreal and the surrounding suburbs is not to sit back and do nothing out of fear of a race to the bottom to the contrary montreal is saying we need a race to the top already their approach has been applauded by the province and will likely inspire similarly ambitious moves throughout the province outside quebec the city of toronto announced a similar intent to montreal s net zero policies in may 2022 the city of vancouver announced a similar policy to montreal s setting 2040 net zero targets for large commercial and institutional buildings with toronto montreal and vancouver going in the right direction setting stricter carbon budgets begins to feel normal another important precedent is the bc energy step code an optional compliance path in the bc building code that local governments can use to incentivize or require a level of energy efficiency in new construction that exceeds the requirements of the bc building code builders may voluntarily use the bc energy step code as a new compliance path for meeting the energy efficiency requirements of the bc building code the step code continues to influence other provinces like nova scotia or the federal government as it works to revise its national building code as we move to decarbonize our buildings the proliferation of glassy gas heated condominium developments appears increasingly out of step with our cities desire to achieve net zero condominium are well within montreal s new energy requirements but as dunsky pointed out the city has the authority to regulate ghg emissions not energy efficiency a condo building that uses natural gas as a centralized system will have to have it replaced while upgrades to building envelopes are outside the purview of the current regulation interestingly vancouver plans to move beyond ghg emissions and include energy efficiencies as part of its heat intensity requirements by 2040 will setting net zero targets create disincentives to improve existing buildings possibly resulting in the unintended consequences of replacing rather than retrofitting a building because montreal focuses on energy systems rather than building envelopes changing a natural gas system to either a renewable natural gas system or heat pumps is not cost prohibitive as for creating incentives dunsky noted examples of policies encouraging compliance with decarbonizing regulations he cited the canada infrastructure bank s program building retrofits initiative which dunsky designed part of its green infrastructure support programs where 2 billion was made available to provide low cost financing to help de risk major building retrofits focused on decreasing emissions building owners won t see a cheque from the government but will enjoy cheaper capital to undergo retrofits their bank would offer a higher interest loan for standard projects but a lower interest loan for green developments committed to lowering the building s carbon footprint our current policies need to include embodied carbon in our buildings not just energy use dunsky acknowledged that we could get there but we first need to address the issue of direct ghg emissions once a set of commonly accepted rules for measuring carbon is achieved we can then standardize voluntary incentive programs followed by effective regulatory approaches there is room for evolution and growth when defining standards for carbon budgets of new and existing buildings i m a big believer of the 80 20 rule get the big stuff done now and leave the rest as a next step dunsky added as we continue to evolve net zero strategies the need to implement practical and implementable policies to decarbonize our buildings has never been more urgent jonathan tinney is an urban planner and partner of svn architects planners this op ed is part of an ongoing series of conversations between svn city building and policy experts leading the way in helping the building industry achieve a net zero future

reduce our operating costs going forward we will continue to focus on executional excellence as we work in pursuit of developing riot into the worldâ s leading bitcoin driven infrastructure platform â second quarter 2022 financial highlights riot continues to attain significant milestones while positioning itself for future opportunities driven by its focus on bitcoin mining key financial highlights for the second quarter include increased total revenue by 112 to 72 9 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 34 3 million for the same three month period in 2021 increased mining revenue by 47 to 46 2 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 31 5 million for the same three month period in 2021 driven by an increase in the number of btc mined which was negatively impacted by lower btc values in q2 2022 vs q2 2021 reported data center hosting revenue of 9 8 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of whinstone us in q2 2021 reported 16 9 million in revenue from engineering segment for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of ess metron in q4 2021

and 6 653 btc unaudited all of which were produced by the companyâ s self mining operations second quarter 2022 financial results mining revenue in excess of mining cost of revenues excluding depreciation and amortization was 28 2 million 61 of mining revenue which compares to 22 1 million 70 of mining revenue for the same three month period in 2021 mining revenue margin was modestly lower on a year over year basis primarily due to a 28 decrease in the average price of bitcoin and a 33 increase in the average bitcoin mining difficulty index during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same three month period in 2021 despite the significant decrease in the price of btc and increase in variable mining costs associated with greater btc production this quarter relative to the same three month period in 2021 improved operating efficiencies driven in part by a greater proportion of new generation miners deployed at riotâ s whinstone facility where lower production costs benefited our mining revenue margins power curtailment credits received based on our ability under long term power agreements to sell power back to the ercot grid at market driven spot prices and thereby reducing our operating costs totaled approximately 5 7 million for the quarter ended june 30 2022 if total power curtailment credits were not presented to reduce operating costs but rather allocated

ongoing growth an increase in audit and consulting fees of 2 2 million resulting primarily from assistance on internal control systems and procedures and it projects an increase in insurance expense of 0 8 million and other general operating costs net loss for the quarter ended june 30 2022 was 366 3 million or 2 81 per share as compared to net income of 19 3 million or 0 22 per share in the same

water and sunlight are optimal for growing high quality stevia leaf and other agricultural products will produce and provide the agricultural raw materials for the joint venturers runhai with its 18 years of technical expertise in manufacturing stevia products will use this premium stevia leaf for producing its high purity stevia extracts and other specialized stevia products both in support of the joint venture as well as in support of glg s international customers xiaogang with its history of producing and selling high quality low zero calorie sweetener consumer products will use raw material inputs from both luxiang and runhai to produce its suite of healthful consumer products integrating agriculture with both b2b and b2c product manufacturing streams offers huanyu a uniquely

the production of stevia products leveraging a variety of steviol glycosides for sale to food and beverage companies across china xiao gang has particular equipment and expertise in the natural products space that it will contribute for huanyu s consumer products development production and sales while luxiang will be a major customer of huanyu s the joint venturers are planning on sales of their products to customers and companies throughout china both off the shelf to consumers and to food and beverage companies looking for high quality and innovative natural sweeteners for use in their own products huanyu anticipates production commencing in 2023 in the meantime it plans to access up to 500m rmb from government funding available to support agricultural initiatives this funding if received will help the joint venturers to fund their operation furthermore in runhai s case this funding can be used to substantially if not entirely resolve long standing debt issues as the joint venturers have as a collective goal to clear runhai of its debts this will put runhai and consequently the company on much more solid financial footing dr zhang the company s chairman and ceo commented our new joint venture offers new and greater opportunities for glg to access the domestic markets in china as well as to improve our company s balance sheet we are excited to partner with luxiang sugar and xiaogang health both ambitious companies excited to bring healthful products to our chinese populace runhai will continue producing products for glg s international customers through its active production facilities located in qingdao and anhui provinces serving glg s customers with high quality products remains a central focus for runhai and for glg the joint venture opportunity is entirely additive to the company s business plans 2022 agm voting results the company held its annual general meeting on june 17 2022 the shareholders voted in all nominated directors with favorable votes for each exceeding 99 dr luke zhang continues as chairman of the board and chief executive officer and brian palmieri continues as vice chairman of the board dr hong zhao guang opted not to run for election this year and is therefore no longer a director company outlook in recent quarters one of the most critical items that management has focused on and continues to focus on is the development and implementation of plans to stem the losses that the company has suffered in recent years and to ameliorate the company s financial position as a result of those sustained losses the company lacks the cash necessary to fully fund the business operations and its strategic product initiatives the company continues to manage its cash flows carefully to mitigate risk of insolvency as a result of these efforts management has been successful in improving the company s cash flows in recent quarters nevertheless without an infusion of cash in the months ahead the company may not be able to realize its strategic plans and could eventually cease to be a going concern to address that cash need management negotiated a cad 1 million revolving loan facility with a related party for working capital purposes in 2020 in 2020 management also realized the sale of one of its two idle assets the sale of the runhao facility resulted in significant debt reduction and better positions the company to be able to access additional lines of working capital management also continues to explore options for the sale or repurposing of its idle runyang primary processing facility in jiangsu province to further address its cash needs and balance sheet another factor that continues to contribute to the company s financial situation is the competitive price pressure in the stevia market over the last two years that has reduced mainstream reb a products such as reb a 80 and reb a 97 to the lowest price levels in years although pricing has begun to rise reflecting the increased cost of raw materials in the most recent harvest monk fruit prices have also become increasingly competitive in the marketplace to maintain margins at sustainable levels the company has focused on improving its production efficiencies continues to strive for a mix of products that is weighted more heavily on higher margin specialty products and has focused more on higher margin direct sales the company s focus on maintaining positive cash flow led the company to take decisive steps in 2021 to reduce its sg a costs as well as its production costs both its north american operations and chinese operations have significantly reduced sg a costs for the last several years the company s production capacity has been far greater than its projected order levels as it had sought rapid increases in orders for reb a products the company s aim continues to be to right size its chinese operations i e to optimize its staffing and production planning to meet the company s projected production requirements while retaining the ability to accommodate growth in future order volumes and management made significant progress in this area and continues striving to optimize staffing and production plans as a result this has enabled the company to sell its goods at more competitive and or more profitable prices although the competitive price pressures remain strong the company continues to explore options to significantly improve its balance sheet and cash flows whether through restructuring of debt or other opportunities for infusions of cash to address the debt load one of these options is taking shape as the company entered into a joint venture in china through its runhai subsidiary which has the potential to significantly increase revenues and overhaul the company s balance sheet the company also continues to explore options that may be complementary to the natural sweetener market where it could leverage its production expertise and equipment towards an investment that may help grow the company s revenues and improve its financial position while the company continues to face substantial risks management remains optimistic about the future opportunities for the company having closed the idle asset sale in 2020 and having successfully implemented right sizing efforts to manage costs having entered into the joint venture and continuing to optimize production efficiencies costs and planning management is proceeding down the best available path to increased financial stability and improved profitability selected financials as noted above the complete set of

period last year sales increased by 10 or 0 2 million for the period ending june 30 2022 compared to the prior period the increase in sales is primarily attributable to increases in stevia sales both

their own products huanyu anticipates production commencing in 2023 in the meantime it plans to access up to 500m rmb from government funding available to support agricultural initiatives this funding if received will help the joint venturers to fund their operation furthermore in runhai s case this funding can be used to substantially if not entirely resolve long standing debt issues as the joint venturers have as a collective goal to clear runhai of its debts this will put runhai and consequently the company on much more solid financial footing dr zhang the company s chairman and ceo commented our new joint venture offers new and greater opportunities for glg to access the domestic markets in china as well as to improve our company s balance sheet we are excited to partner with luxiang sugar and xiaogang health both ambitious companies excited to bring healthful products to our chinese populace runhai will continue producing products for glg s international customers through its active production facilities located in qingdao and anhui provinces serving glg s customers with high quality products remains a central focus for runhai and for glg the joint venture opportunity is entirely additive to the company s business plans 2022 agm voting results the company held its annual general meeting on june 17 2022 the shareholders voted in all nominated directors with favorable votes for each exceeding 99 dr luke zhang continues as chairman of the board and chief executive officer and brian palmieri continues as vice chairman of the board dr hong zhao guang opted not to run for election this year and is therefore no longer a director company outlook in recent quarters one of the most critical items that management has focused on and continues to focus on is the development and implementation of plans to stem the losses that the company has suffered in recent years and to ameliorate the company s financial position as a result of those sustained losses the company lacks the cash necessary to fully fund the business operations and its strategic product initiatives the company continues to manage its cash flows carefully to mitigate risk of insolvency as a result of these efforts management has been successful in improving the company s cash flows in recent quarters nevertheless without an infusion of cash in the months ahead the company may not be able to realize its strategic plans and could eventually cease to be a going concern to address that cash need management negotiated a cad 1 million revolving loan facility with a related party for working capital purposes in 2020 in 2020 management also realized the sale of one of its two idle assets the sale of the runhao facility resulted in significant debt reduction and better positions the company to be able to access additional lines of working capital management also continues to explore options for the sale or repurposing of its idle runyang primary processing facility in jiangsu province to further address its cash needs and balance sheet another factor that continues to contribute to the company s financial situation is the competitive price pressure in the stevia market over the last two years that has reduced mainstream reb a products such as reb a 80 and reb a 97 to the lowest price levels in years although pricing has begun to rise reflecting the increased cost of raw materials in the most recent harvest monk fruit prices have also become increasingly competitive in the marketplace to maintain margins at sustainable levels the company has focused on improving its production efficiencies continues to strive for a mix of products that is weighted more heavily on higher margin specialty products and has focused more on higher margin direct sales the company s focus on maintaining positive cash flow led the company to take decisive steps in 2021 to reduce its sg a costs as well as its production costs both its north american operations and chinese operations have significantly reduced sg a costs for the last several years the company s production capacity has been far greater than its projected order levels as it had sought rapid increases in orders for reb a products the company s aim continues to be to right size its chinese operations i e to optimize its staffing and production planning to meet the company s projected production requirements while retaining the ability to accommodate growth in future order volumes and management made significant progress in this area and continues striving to optimize staffing and production plans as a result this has enabled the company to sell its goods at more competitive and or more profitable prices although the competitive price pressures remain strong the company continues to explore options to significantly improve its balance sheet and cash flows whether through restructuring of debt or other opportunities for infusions of cash to address the debt load one of these options is taking shape as the company entered into a joint venture in china through its runhai subsidiary which has the potential to significantly increase revenues and overhaul the company s balance sheet the company also continues to explore options that may be complementary to the natural sweetener market where it could leverage its production expertise and equipment towards an investment that may help grow the company s revenues and improve its financial position while the company continues to face substantial risks management remains optimistic about the future opportunities for the company having closed the idle asset sale in 2020 and having successfully implemented right sizing efforts to manage costs having entered into the joint venture and continuing to optimize production efficiencies costs and planning management is proceeding down the best available path to increased financial stability and improved profitability selected financials as noted above the complete set of

castle rock colo aug 15 2022 globe newswire riot blockchain inc nasdaq riot riot or the company an industry leader in bitcoin btc mining and data center hosting reported financial results for the three month period ended june 30 2022 the unaudited financial statements are available on riot s website and here we are extremely encouraged by riot s financial resilience and operational achievements this quarter said jason les ceo of riot we continued to make substantial progress in executing towards our ambitious growth plans including completion of our first immersion cooled building and the successful transition of all miners which were previously hosted by coinmint to our whinstone facility which will further reduce our operating costs going forward we will continue to focus on executional excellence as we work in pursuit of developing riot into the world s leading bitcoin driven infrastructure platform second quarter 2022 financial highlights riot continues to attain significant milestones while positioning itself for future opportunities driven by its focus on bitcoin mining key financial highlights for the second quarter include increased total revenue by 112 to 72 9 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 34 3 million for the same three month period in 2021 increased mining revenue by 47 to 46 2 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 31 5 million for the same three month period in 2021 driven by an increase in the number of btc mined which was negatively impacted by lower btc values in q2 2022 vs q2 2021 reported data center hosting revenue of 9 8 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of whinstone us in q2 2021 reported 16 9 million in revenue from engineering segment for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of ess metron in q4 2021 increased btc production quantity by 107 to 1 395 btc during the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 675 btc during the same three month period in 2021 raised 267 0 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 30 6 million shares of riot common stock via our previously announced at the market equity offering further strengthening riot s industry leading financial position amid challenging market conditions for the sector reported 496 4 million in current assets as of june 30 2022 with 270 5 million in cash on hand up from 113 6 million at the end of q1 2022 and 6 653 btc unaudited all of which were produced by the company s self mining operations second quarter 2022 financial results mining revenue in excess of mining cost of revenues excluding depreciation and amortization was 28 2 million 61 of mining revenue which compares to 22 1 million 70 of mining revenue for the same three month period in 2021 mining revenue margin was modestly lower on a year over year basis primarily due to a 28 decrease in the average price of bitcoin and a 33 increase in the average bitcoin mining difficulty index during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same three month period in 2021 despite the significant decrease in the price of btc and increase in variable mining costs associated with greater btc production this quarter relative to the same three month period in 2021 improved operating efficiencies driven in part by a greater proportion of new generation miners deployed at riot s whinstone facility where lower production costs benefited our mining revenue margins power curtailment credits received based on our ability under long term power agreements to sell power back to the ercot grid at market driven spot prices and thereby reducing our operating costs totaled approximately 5 7 million for the quarter ended june 30 2022 if total power curtailment credits were not presented to reduce operating costs but rather allocated between cost of revenues mining and cost of revenues data center hosting based on proportional power consumption cost of revenues mining would have decreased by 2 2 million increasing mining revenue margin to 30 4 million 66 of mining revenue on a non gaap basis selling general and administrative sg a expenses increased by 7 2 million to 10 7 million as compared to 3 5 million for the same three month period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in compensation related expense of 2 1 million which came about as a result of the hiring of additional employees to support the company s ongoing growth an increase in audit and consulting fees of 2 2 million resulting primarily from assistance on internal control systems and procedures and it projects an increase in insurance expense of 0 8 million and other general operating costs net loss for the quarter ended june 30 2022 was 366 3 million or 2 81 per share as compared to net income of 19 3 million or 0 22 per share in the same three month period in 2021 net loss for the quarter was negatively impacted by a 349 1 million non cash accounting impairment of goodwill a 99 8 million non cash accounting impairment on bitcoin held and an unrealized loss of 4 8 million on marketable equity securities which was partially offset by an increase in fair value of derivative asset of 60 9 million a gain on exchange of equipment of 8 6 million and a 14 4 million gain on sale of bitcoin non gaap adjusted ebitda for the quarter ended june 30 2022 was 65 2 million as compared to non gaap adjusted ebitda of 2 4 million for the same three month period in 2021 a non cash accounting impairment of goodwill of 349 1 million and a 99 8 million non cash accounting impairment on bitcoin held negatively impacted net income for the quarter which also impacted non gaap adjusted ebitda the company determined starting in q4 2021 to exclude impairments and gains or losses on sales or exchanges of cryptocurrencies from its calculation of non gaap adjusted ebitda second quarter 2022 and recent operational highlights as of june 30 2022 the company had a deployed fleet of 44 720 asic miners with a hash rate capacity of 4 4 eh s subsequent to june 30 2022 received an additional 9 316 new s19j pros and deployed 4 320 s19j pros in riot s immersion cooled buildings with an additional 7 200 miners staged for deployment upon deployment of the staged miners riot expects to have a total of 47 511 miners deployed with a hash rate capacity of approximately 4 9 eh s continued to make significant progress on the company s 400 megawatt mw expansion at its whinstone facility the expansion is expected to be completed in q1 2023 the final components of the buildout of each building are being completed in parallel with miner deployments completed riot s first immersion cooled building at its whinstone facility building f with 23 000 s19 series miners fully operational placement of miners in building g riot s second immersion cooled building continues with initial miners already deployed and hashing began development of the company s previously announced 265 acre 1 gigawatt expansion site in navarro county texas with bitcoin mining operations at the new facility remaining on track to commence summer 2023 currently all miners previously hosted at coinmint llc s massena ny facility have been either relocated to the company s whinstone facility by way of a miner swap agreement with another bitcoin mining counterparty or shipped to the whinstone facility this transition is expected to further improve riot s mining revenue margin through reduced power costs and elimination of all third party hosting fees hash rate growth by q1 2023 riot anticipates a total self mining hash rate capacity of approximately 12 5 eh s assuming full deployment of approximately 115 450 antminer asics and excluding any potential expected incremental productivity gains from the company s utilization of 200 mw of immersion cooling infrastructure substantially all of the company s self mining fleet will consist of the latest generation s19 series miner model in addition to the company s self mining operations riot hosts approximately 200 mw of institutional bitcoin mining clients atm offering as previously disclosed on march 31 2022 the company filed a prospectus supplement with the u s securities and exchange commission to offer and sell up to 500 million of the company s common stock from time to time as of june 30 2022 the company had received net proceeds on sales of 30 6 million of the company s common stock of approximately 270 6 million further strengthening riot s financial position amid challenging market conditions net proceeds are anticipated to be used towards financing riot s ambitious growth opportunities as well as for general corporate purposes subsequent to june 30 2022 and as of the date of filing the company received additional net proceeds on sales of approximately 6 5 million shares of common stock of approximately 31 5 million goodwill impairment due to adverse market conditions in the second quarter of 2022 the company performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2022 assisted by an independent valuation specialist firm this assessment included a comparison of publicly traded peer company valuation multiples and riot s adjusted market capitalization as of june 30 2022 a period of extreme uncertainty in the broader bitcoin ecosystem and near year to date lows for the company and industry market valuations as a result of this assessment riot recorded an impairment to goodwill of 349 1million related to the acquisitions of whinstone us and ess metron in 2021 our acquisitions of whinstone us and ess metron remain the foundation of our vertically integrated strategy and are the reason riot is positioned as an industry leader today said jason les ceo of riot although challenging global market conditions in the second quarter further impacted by a steep decline in the price of bitcoin and resulting decline in market valuations for publicly traded bitcoin miners including riot necessitated non cash impairment charges this quarter these non cash charges had no impact on our solid financial position and ample liquidity both of which were further strengthened this quarter we remain extremely excited by the additional growth and development opportunities including our successfully demonstrated proprietary

business operations of bitcoin mining the adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments equity securities value changes and non cash stock based compensation

performance measurements that represent a key indicator of the company s core business operations of both bitcoin mining and data center hosting these measurements are defined as cost of revenues mining less power curtailment credits and cost of revenues data center hosting less power curtailment credits respectively we believe our ability to sell power back to the grid at market driven spot prices thereby reducing our operating costs is integral to our overall strategy specifically our power management strategy and our commitment to supporting the ercot grid while participation in various grid demand response programs may impact our bitcoin production we view this as an important part of our partnership driven approach with ercot and our commitment to being a good corporate citizen in our communities we believe netting the power sales against our costs can be an important financial measure because it allows management investors and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results including our operating efficiencies from period to period by making such adjustments in the table below we have allocated the benefit of the power sales to our data center hosting and mining segments based on their proportional power consumption during the periods presented cost of revenues mining net of power curtailment credits and cost of revenues data center

u s house of representatives speaker nancy pelosi s visit to taiwan beginning august 2 triggered stark opposition from beijing and sparked concerns within the united states and around the indo pacific about the impacts of the visit and the chinese military response on regional security following the visit beijing launched large scale military exercises raising discussion of a possible fourth taiwan strait crisis in this analysis csis experts explore the regional implications of pelosi s visit to taiwan and provide insight into the trajectory of this crisis and signs to watch for going forward q1 what are the short and near term implications for u s china relations a1 in the wake of pelosi s trip both beijing and washington jostled for control of the narrative about which country instigated the crisis beijing repeatedly stressed pelosi s high rank in the u s political hierarchy in an attempt to frame her visit as escalatory in itself chinese foreign minister wang yi stated the u s side claimed that china is escalating the situation but the basic facts are that the united states first provoked china on the taiwan question and blatantly violated china s sovereignty and territorial integrity the biden administration argued that the people s liberation army s pla military exercises including sending short range ballistic missiles over taiwan was a manufactured crisis and an overreaction by beijing to a normal congressional delegation under secretary of defense for policy colin kahl remarked on pelosi s trip during a press conference nothing about the visit changed one iota of the u s government s policy toward taiwan while both sides argue that their actions were measured and proportionate it is clear that last week s events as well as putin s invasion of ukraine have placed managing tensions over the taiwan straits at the very center of u s china relationship this will increasingly and worryingly be a conversation dominated by military dynamics be it through questions of potential blockades invasions or how to increase taiwan s defensive capabilities the spillover impacts on other areas of the bilateral relationship are already becoming evident china has announced it is halting dialogue with the united states on a number of issues ranging from anti narcotics to military relations to climate change while news reports indicate that the biden administration may decide to keep its long running tariffs on chinese imports in place the political calendar over the next few years does little to help these dynamics beijing is acutely concerned with the possible passage of the taiwan policy act which may come up for a vote after congress returns from its august recess in late october the 20th party congress will be held in beijing with xi jinping destined to assume a third term as the party s general secretary in november both the united states and taiwan will hold midterm elections and while beijing will not be on the ballot the outcome of those elections will have an important effect on future cross strait relations perhaps most consequentially taiwan will hold its next presidential election in january 2024 and owing to term limits president tsai ing wen will relinquish power after eight years in office if her party the democratic progressive party wins an unprecedented third straight election beijing may well conclude that the path to peaceful reunification has further narrowed q2 how was taiwan s economy affected by the pelosi visit a2 there was barely a ripple there was certainly some anxiety in taiwan during the days immediately preceding and following the visit and the occurrence of china s extensive military exercises however the economy came into the crisis stable and exited it with few signs of distress taiwan has a well developed economy although it is known for its manufacturing services comprise 62 percent of its economy compared to 37 percent for industry and 1 percent for agriculture in the united states services account for 77 percent of the economy and per capita income is 28 400 in nominal terms or 55 700 when measured by purchasing power parity ppp taiwan s gross domestic product gdp grew 3 08 percent in q2 on the basis of strong private investment and continued personal consumption taiwan s stock market saw a slight downturn around pelosi s visit but has had as many positive days as negative ones since tech stocks such as tsmc united microelectronics and hon hai foxconn have followed the same trajectory the new taiwan dollar nt has weakened somewhat over the course of the year from nt 28 to nt 30 to the u s dollar but that is a sign of the u s dollar s overall strength against many currencies taiwan s foreign exchange reserves were nearly 550 billion at the end of july sixth largest in the world and more than sufficient to cover imports or overseas debt obligations some flights in and out of taiwan were canceled or rerouted because of the tensions but commercial air traffic has returned to normal q3 is taiwan s economy vulnerable in the event of an actual war or embargo a3 yes but taiwan s economy has thrived in a highly globalized world of international supply chains and transnational innovation ecosystems although it has tried to diversify trade and investment through its new southbound policy 42 percent of taiwan s exports still go to china led by electronic components particularly semiconductors followed by optical equipment similarly 22 percent of taiwan s imports are from china the comparable figures for the united states are 15 percent and 10 percent respectively although some have moved back to the island during the pandemic 158 000 taiwanese still reside in mainland china in short taiwan s economy is heavily dependent on china and a war or blockade would likely be devastating however despite taiwan s small size china s own dependence on stable cross strait trade and investment ties should not be underestimated although china has been developing its own chip producers such as the semiconductor manufacturing international corporation smic china is still absolutely reliant on tsmc and other taiwanese firms which are in turn dependent on fabrication equipment and tool suppliers from the united states europe and japan obviously politics and nationalism could override such considerations but the cost to china s own economy would be monumental q4 how did u s allies and partners respond to speaker pelosi s trip and the people s republic of china prc military exercises around taiwan that followed a4 among u s allies in the region japan was most forward leaning in condemning the prc military exercises although japanese officials avoided commenting publicly on the merits of speaker pelosi s visit to taiwan itself they were sharply critical of beijing after reports on august 4 that five chinese ballistic missiles had landed within japan s exclusive economic zone eez during a breakfast he hosted for speaker pelosi on august 5 prime minister kishida condemned the missile launches emphasizing that china s actions represent a serious issue concerning the security of japan and the safety of its people the prc s response to the speaker s visit will reinforce a growing public recognition in japan that taiwan s security is closely connected with its own and that a cross strait conflict would inevitably implicate japanese interests china s military exercises will strengthen support for increased investments in defense and cooperation with the united states on taiwan related contingency planning more than 80 percent of respondents to an nhk poll released on august 8 said that china s actions will affect japan s security environment australia s thinking about taiwan is undergoing a shift for years the conversation about taiwan had been dominated by legal and political discussions over the extent of australian alliance obligations to the united states but beijing s prolonged military build up the increasingly aggressive use of the pla including against australian forces a ramped up chinese campaign of economic coercion against australia and the expansion of the prc s power projection capabilities have prompted a nascent debate in canberra over the strategic importance of taiwan to regional stability the credibility of the alliance system and australia s own security interests moreover the disproportionate and menacing response from china towards taiwan following pelosi s visit is likely to have an impact on both the internal debate in australia about its taiwan policy and the new government s desire to speed up its acquisition of deterrent capabilities south korea was very cautious about speaker pelosi s high profile visit to taiwan although pelosi s expressed support of democratic taiwan falls in line with the yoon government s foreign policy focus on freedom and democracy seoul had reservations out of concern that the taiwan strait issue could directly spill over to the korean peninsula and undercut china s cooperation with the denuclearization of north korea moreover seoul did not want to face china s wrath amid beijing s growing warnings over chip 4 and thaad issues what made pelosi s visit to south korea controversial both within and outside the country was the confusion involved in her meeting with president yoon at first the u s delegation had no scheduled meeting with yoon because their visit coincided with his summer vacation he planned to be out of seoul to visit local provinces but after his local trip plan got canceled and yoon stayed in seoul he did not meet instead having a phone call with the delegation which triggered speculations that yoon avoided the meeting to not antagonize china despite bad optics of pelosi s visit to south korea seoul s stance on the taiwan issue is consistent with washington s official policy at the east asia summit and asean regional forum arf in phnom penh cambodia foreign minister park jin stated that while south korea supports the one china policy he also made clear that south korea is opposed to the growing instability in the taiwan strait and any attempts to change the status quo by force in less than a week after china began its military drills around taiwan park held a meeting with foreign minister wang yi and reiterated south korea s stance on one china policy and stressed the importance of peace and stability in the taiwan strait the tensions across the taiwan strait reportedly dominated much of the annual asean foreign ministers meeting and asean regional forum in cambodia at which secretary of state antony blinken and foreign minister wang yi were both in attendance unsurprisingly the asean ministers released a tortured joint statement expressing concern and urging dialogue without mentioning china or taiwan by name that does not mean however that individual countries in southeast asia are not concerned by china s aggressive response the consensus among elites and much of the public across southeast asia is that while the trip may have been ill timed or unnecessary beijing s reaction has been beyond the pale and it was imperative that the united states stand firm this is especially true in the philippines where government and thought leaders increasingly recognize that they will likely be party to any conflict over taiwan whether they seek to be or not the philippines northernmost islands are within sight of taiwan and some of the military exercise areas declared by china crossed into the philippine exclusive economic zone nearly 200 000 philippine citizens live and work in taiwan and for the first time the u s and philippine governments are beginning to have honest conversations about their expectations of each other in a taiwan contingency that is part of a process of alliance modernization kicked off at last year s bilateral strategic dialogue which includes ongoing negotiations on new defense guidelines a general security of military information agreement a new maritime security dialogue and the long delayed start of u s funded upgrades of and access to philippine bases under the 2014 enhanced defense cooperation agreement newly installed president ferdinand marcos jr met with blinken in manila over the weekend and was asked by the press about the tensions around taiwan his response underscored the shift

through the six years indemnification period following the closing of the 2degrees sale during the period in which the company continues to report publicly we will continue to be responsible for maintaining appropriate processes and controls around financial reporting however given the significantly reduced risk profile of the company following the sales of both 2degrees and nuevatel we are in the process of significantly reducing the cost structure of our corporate function specifically a significant majority of the existing workforce will cease employment with the company in the third quarter of 2022 with the company retaining only a limited number of resources to ensure compliance with ongoing regulatory and audit requirements the company is also in the process of negotiating with service providers to ensure a significant reduction in costs going forward with these actions the company expects that the historical run rate of corporate costs will be reduced by over half beginning in the second half of 2022 it is also the company s expectation that following the escrow release in may 2023 the company will endeavor to further adjust its cost structure commensurate with the risk

of practices providers and support teams means the company can expect to add meaningful revenue and ebitda without the need to rely heavily on m a these areas of growth come from continued expansion of its ffs business model and more importantly from the growth of its managed care business line including medicare and medicare advantage programs at risk which generate capitated revenue the company expects that its primary driver to organic growth will be through the growth in medicare and medicare advantage medicare lives have been historically based on 100 fee for service with limited to no benefit in shared savings or total cost of care the company is working with its jv partner chs centene in the participation through the aco reach program for 2023 through this program and the jv the company can expect to shift from fee for services to global capitated risk on its existing traditional medicare population the company expects that the shift to global capitation can contribute an organic revenue growth of 25 in 2023 with an associated 10 ebitda margin medicare advantage offers strong growth in the florida market with an aging population and a need now more than ever to improve the quality of care for seniors the company is well positioned with current and potential new ma risk contracts for effective 2023 participation as is the case with ma most health plans focus on

the benefits of ma and the opportunity to select one of the company s locations as the patients home for ma in 2023 the program which runs october through december will be an important period for the company to add to the current membership of ma lives as part of this the company has already begun laying its plan for aep including budgets and working with plan partners in driving new membership growth within its existing medicare only population as the company continues to focus on achieving its goal of adjusted ebitda break even towards the end of the year the goal for 2023 will be cash flow positivity while organic growth efforts remain the focus the company believes it will be in a good position in the near to medium term to utilize its own cash flow from operations to continue strategic m a to grow market density and expand on its medicare lives at risk population the company is pleased to announce that in order to meet demand it has agreed to increase the size of its 2

castle rock colo aug 15 2022 globe newswire riot blockchain inc nasdaq riot riot or the company an industry leader in bitcoin btc mining and data center hosting reported financial results for the three month period ended june 30 2022 the unaudited financial statements are available on riot s website and here we are extremely encouraged by riot s financial resilience and operational achievements this quarter said jason les ceo of riot we continued to make substantial progress in executing towards our ambitious growth plans including completion of our first immersion cooled building and the successful transition of all miners which were previously hosted by coinmint to our whinstone facility which will further reduce our operating costs going forward we will continue to focus on executional excellence as we work in pursuit of developing riot into the world s leading bitcoin driven infrastructure platform second quarter 2022 financial highlights riot continues to attain significant milestones while positioning itself for future opportunities driven by its focus on bitcoin mining key financial highlights for the second quarter include increased total revenue by 112 to 72 9 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 34 3 million for the same three month period in 2021 increased mining revenue by 47 to 46 2 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 31 5 million for the same three month period in 2021 driven by an increase in the number of btc mined which was negatively impacted by lower btc values in q2 2022 vs q2 2021 reported data center hosting revenue of 9 8 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of whinstone us in q2 2021 reported 16 9 million in revenue from engineering segment for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of ess metron in q4 2021 increased btc production quantity by 107 to 1 395 btc during the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 675 btc during the same three month period in 2021 raised 267 0 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 30 6 million shares of riot common stock via our previously announced at the market equity offering further strengthening riot s industry leading financial position amid challenging market conditions for the sector reported 496 4 million in current assets as of june 30 2022 with 270 5 million in cash on hand up from 113 6 million at the end of q1 2022 and 6 653 btc unaudited all of which were produced by the company s self mining operations second quarter 2022 financial results mining revenue in excess of mining cost of revenues excluding depreciation and amortization was 28 2 million 61 of mining revenue which compares to 22 1 million 70 of mining revenue for the same three month period in 2021 mining revenue margin was modestly lower on a year over year basis primarily due to a 28 decrease in the average price of bitcoin and a 33 increase in the average bitcoin mining difficulty index during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same three month period in 2021 despite the significant decrease in the price of btc and increase in variable mining costs associated with greater btc production this quarter relative to the same three month period in 2021 improved operating efficiencies driven in part by a greater proportion of new generation miners deployed at riot s whinstone facility where lower production costs benefited our mining revenue margins power curtailment credits received based on our ability under long term power agreements to sell power back to the ercot grid at market driven spot prices and thereby reducing our operating costs totaled approximately 5 7 million for the quarter ended june 30 2022 if total power curtailment credits were not presented to reduce operating costs but rather allocated between cost of revenues mining and cost of revenues data center hosting based on proportional power consumption cost of revenues mining would have decreased by 2 2 million increasing mining revenue margin to 30 4 million 66 of mining revenue on a non gaap basis selling general and administrative sg a expenses increased by 7 2 million to 10 7 million as compared to 3 5 million for the same three month period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in compensation related expense of 2 1 million which came about as a result of the hiring of additional employees to support the company s ongoing growth an increase in audit and consulting fees of 2 2 million resulting primarily from assistance on internal control systems and procedures and it projects an increase in insurance expense of 0 8 million and other general operating costs net loss for the quarter ended june 30 2022 was 366 3 million or 2 81 per share as compared to net income of 19 3 million or 0 22 per share in the same three month period in 2021 net loss for the quarter was negatively impacted by a 349 1 million non cash accounting impairment of goodwill a 99 8 million non cash accounting impairment on bitcoin held and an unrealized loss of 4 8 million on marketable equity securities which was partially offset by an increase in fair value of derivative asset of 60 9 million a gain on exchange of equipment of 8 6 million and a 14 4 million gain on sale of bitcoin non gaap adjusted ebitda for the quarter ended june 30 2022 was 65 2 million as compared to non gaap adjusted ebitda of 2 4 million for the same three month period in 2021 a non cash accounting impairment of goodwill of 349 1 million and a 99 8 million non cash accounting impairment on bitcoin held negatively impacted net income for the quarter which also impacted non gaap adjusted ebitda the company determined starting in q4 2021 to exclude impairments and gains or losses on sales or exchanges of cryptocurrencies from its calculation of non gaap adjusted ebitda second quarter 2022 and recent operational highlights as of june 30 2022 the company had a deployed fleet of 44 720 asic miners with a hash rate capacity of 4 4 eh s subsequent to june 30 2022 received an additional 9 316 new s19j pros and deployed 4 320 s19j pros in riot s immersion cooled buildings with an additional 7 200 miners staged for deployment upon deployment of the staged miners riot expects to have a total of 47 511 miners deployed with a hash rate capacity of approximately 4 9 eh s continued to make significant progress on the company s 400 megawatt mw expansion at its whinstone facility the expansion is expected to be completed in q1 2023 the final components of the buildout of each building are being completed in parallel with miner deployments completed riot s first immersion cooled building at its whinstone facility building f with 23 000 s19 series miners fully operational placement of miners in building g riot s second immersion cooled building continues with initial miners already deployed and hashing began development of the company s previously announced 265 acre 1 gigawatt expansion site in navarro county texas with bitcoin mining operations at the new facility remaining on track to commence summer 2023 currently all miners previously hosted at coinmint llc s massena ny facility have been either relocated to the company s whinstone facility by way of a miner swap agreement with another bitcoin mining counterparty or shipped to the whinstone facility this transition is expected to further improve riot s mining revenue margin through reduced power costs and elimination of all third party hosting fees hash rate growth by q1 2023 riot anticipates a total self mining hash rate capacity of approximately 12 5 eh s assuming full deployment of approximately 115 450 antminer asics and excluding any potential expected incremental productivity gains from the company s utilization of 200 mw of immersion cooling infrastructure substantially all of the company s self mining fleet will consist of the latest generation s19 series miner model in addition to the company s self mining operations riot hosts approximately 200 mw of institutional bitcoin mining clients atm offering as previously disclosed on march 31 2022 the company filed a prospectus supplement with the u s securities and exchange commission to offer and sell up to 500 million of the company s common stock from time to time as of june 30 2022 the company had received net proceeds on sales of 30 6 million of the company s common stock of approximately 270 6 million further strengthening riot s financial position amid challenging market conditions net proceeds are anticipated to be used towards financing riot s ambitious growth opportunities as well as for general corporate purposes subsequent to june 30 2022 and as of the date of filing the company received additional net proceeds on sales of approximately 6 5 million shares of common stock of approximately 31 5 million goodwill impairment due to adverse market conditions in the second quarter of 2022 the company performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2022 assisted by an independent valuation specialist firm this assessment included a comparison of publicly traded peer company valuation multiples and riot s adjusted market capitalization as of june 30 2022 a period of extreme uncertainty in the broader bitcoin ecosystem and near year to date lows for the company and industry market valuations as a result of this assessment riot recorded an impairment to goodwill of 349 1million related to the acquisitions of whinstone us and ess metron in 2021 our acquisitions of whinstone us and ess metron remain the foundation of our vertically integrated strategy and are the reason riot is positioned as an industry leader today said jason les ceo of riot although challenging global market conditions in the second quarter further impacted by a steep decline in the price of bitcoin and resulting decline in market valuations for publicly traded bitcoin miners including riot necessitated non cash impairment charges this quarter these non cash charges had no impact on our solid financial position and ample liquidity both of which were further strengthened this quarter we remain extremely excited by the additional growth and development opportunities including our successfully demonstrated proprietary

above we believe cost of revenues mining net of power curtailment credits and cost of revenues data center hosting are two additional performance measurements that represent a key indicator of the company s core business operations of both bitcoin mining and data center hosting these measurements are defined as cost of revenues mining less power curtailment credits and cost of revenues data center hosting less power curtailment credits respectively we believe our ability to sell power back to the grid at market driven spot prices thereby reducing our operating costs is integral to our overall strategy specifically our power management strategy and our commitment to supporting the ercot grid while participation in various grid demand response programs may impact our bitcoin production we view this as an important part of our partnership driven approach with ercot and our commitment to being a good corporate citizen in our communities we believe netting the power sales against our costs can be an important financial measure because it allows management investors and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results including our operating efficiencies from period to period by making such adjustments in the table below we have allocated the benefit of the power sales to our data center hosting and mining segments based on their proportional power consumption during the periods presented cost of revenues mining net of power curtailment credits and cost of revenues data center hosting net of power curtailment credits are

riot reports q2 2022 results with 72 9 million in total revenue 1 395 btc produced and strengthened financial position castle rock colo aug 15 2022 globe newswire riot blockchain inc nasdaq riot riot or the company an industry leader in bitcoin btc mining and data center hosting reported financial results for the three month period ended june 30 2022 the unaudited financial statements are available on riot s website and here we are extremely encouraged by riot s financial resilience and operational achievements this quarter said jason les ceo of riot we continued to make substantial progress in executing towards our ambitious growth plans including completion of our first immersion cooled building and the successful transition of all miners which were previously hosted by coinmint to our whinstone facility which will further reduce our operating costs going forward we will continue to focus on executional excellence as we work in pursuit of developing riot into the world s leading bitcoin driven infrastructure platform second quarter 2022 financial highlights riot continues to attain significant milestones while positioning itself for future opportunities driven by its focus on bitcoin mining key financial highlights for the second quarter include increased total revenue by 112 to 72 9 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 34 3 million for the same three month period in 2021 increased mining revenue by 47 to 46 2 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 31 5 million for the same three month period in 2021 driven by an increase in the number of btc mined which was negatively impacted by lower btc values in q2 2022 vs q2 2021 reported data center hosting revenue of 9 8 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of whinstone us in q2 2021 reported 16 9 million in revenue from engineering segment for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of ess metron in q4 2021 increased btc production quantity by 107 to 1 395 btc during the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 675 btc during the same three month period in 2021 raised 267 0 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 30 6 million shares of riot common stock via our previously announced at the market equity offering further strengthening riot s industry leading financial position amid challenging market conditions for the sector reported 496 4 million in current assets as of june 30 2022 with 270 5 million in cash on hand up from 113 6 million at the end of q1 2022 and 6 653 btc unaudited all of which were produced by the company s self mining operations second quarter 2022 financial results mining revenue in excess of mining cost of revenues excluding depreciation and amortization was 28 2 million 61 of mining revenue which compares to 22 1 million 70 of mining revenue for the same three month period in 2021 mining revenue margin was modestly lower on a year over year basis primarily due to a 28 decrease in the average price of bitcoin and a 33 increase in the average bitcoin mining difficulty index during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same three month period in 2021 despite the significant decrease in the price of btc and increase in variable mining costs associated with greater btc production this quarter relative to the same three month period in 2021 improved operating efficiencies driven in part by a greater proportion of new generation miners deployed at riot s whinstone facility where lower production costs benefited our mining revenue margins power curtailment credits received based on our ability under long term power agreements to sell power back to the ercot grid at market driven spot prices and thereby reducing our operating costs totaled approximately 5 7 million for the quarter ended june 30 2022 if total power curtailment credits were not presented to reduce operating costs but rather allocated between cost of revenues mining and cost of revenues data center hosting based on proportional power consumption cost of revenues mining would have decreased by 2 2 million increasing mining revenue margin to 30 4 million 66 of mining revenue on a non gaap basis selling general and administrative sg a expenses increased by 7 2 million to 10 7 million as compared to 3 5 million for the same three month period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in compensation related expense of 2 1 million which came about as a result of the hiring of additional employees to support the company s ongoing growth an increase in audit and consulting fees of 2 2 million resulting primarily from assistance on internal control systems and procedures and it projects an increase in insurance expense of 0 8 million and other general operating costs net loss for the quarter ended june 30 2022 was 366 3 million or 2 81 per share as compared to net income of 19 3 million or 0 22 per share in the same three month period in 2021 net loss for the quarter was negatively impacted by a 349 1 million non cash accounting impairment of goodwill a 99 8 million non cash accounting impairment on bitcoin held and an unrealized loss of 4 8 million on marketable equity securities which was partially offset by an increase in fair value of derivative asset of 60 9 million a gain on exchange of equipment of 8 6 million and a 14 4 million gain on sale of bitcoin non gaap adjusted ebitda for the quarter ended june 30 2022 was 65 2 million as compared to non gaap adjusted ebitda of 2 4 million for the same three month period in 2021 a non cash accounting impairment of goodwill of 349 1 million and a 99 8 million non cash accounting impairment on bitcoin held negatively impacted net income for the quarter which also impacted non gaap adjusted ebitda the company determined starting in q4 2021 to exclude impairments and gains or losses on sales or exchanges of cryptocurrencies from its calculation of non gaap adjusted ebitda second quarter 2022 and recent operational highlights as of june 30 2022 the company had a deployed fleet of 44 720 asic miners with a hash rate capacity of 4 4 eh s subsequent to june 30 2022 received an additional 9 316 new s19j pros and deployed 4 320 s19j pros in riot s immersion cooled buildings with an additional 7 200 miners staged for deployment upon deployment of the staged miners riot expects to have a total of 47 511 miners deployed with a hash rate capacity of approximately 4 9 eh s continued to make significant progress on the company s 400 megawatt mw expansion at its whinstone facility the expansion is expected to be completed in q1 2023 the final components of the buildout of each building are being completed in parallel with miner deployments completed riot s first immersion cooled building at its whinstone facility building f with 23 000 s19 series miners fully operational placement of miners in building g riot s second immersion cooled building continues with initial miners already deployed and hashing began development of the company s previously announced 265 acre 1 gigawatt expansion site in navarro county texas with bitcoin mining operations at the new facility remaining on track to commence summer 2023 currently all miners previously hosted at coinmint llc s massena ny facility have been either relocated to the company s whinstone facility by way of a miner swap agreement with another bitcoin mining counterparty or shipped to the whinstone facility this transition is expected to further improve riot s mining revenue margin through reduced power costs and elimination of all third party hosting fees hash rate growth by q1 2023 riot anticipates a total self mining hash rate capacity of approximately 12 5 eh s assuming full deployment of approximately 115 450 antminer asics and excluding any potential expected incremental productivity gains from the company s

financing riot s ambitious growth opportunities as well as for general corporate purposes subsequent to june 30 2022 and as of the date of filing the company received additional net proceeds on sales of approximately 6 5 million shares of common stock of approximately 31 5 million goodwill impairment due to adverse market conditions in the second quarter of 2022 the company performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2022 assisted by an independent valuation specialist firm this assessment included a comparison of publicly traded peer company valuation multiples and riot s adjusted market capitalization as of june 30 2022 a period of extreme uncertainty in the broader bitcoin ecosystem and near year to date lows for the company and industry market valuations as a result of this assessment riot recorded an impairment to goodwill of 349 1million related to the acquisitions of whinstone us and ess metron in 2021 our acquisitions of whinstone us and ess metron remain the foundation of our vertically integrated strategy and are the reason riot is positioned as an industry leader today said jason les ceo of riot although challenging global market conditions in the second quarter further impacted by a steep decline in the price of bitcoin and resulting decline in market valuations for publicly traded bitcoin miners including riot necessitated non cash impairment charges this quarter these non cash charges had no impact on our solid financial position and ample liquidity both of which were further strengthened this quarter we remain extremely

gaap financial measures we consistently evaluate our use and calculation of the non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda and adjusted earnings per share adjusted eps adjusted ebitda is a financial measure defined as our ebitda adjusted to eliminate the effects of certain non cash and or non recurring items that do not reflect our ongoing strategic business operations ebitda is computed as net income before interest taxes depreciation and amortization adjusted ebitda is ebitda further adjusted for certain income and expenses management believes results in a performance measurement that represents a key indicator of the company s core business operations of bitcoin mining the adjustments include fair value adjustments such as derivative power contract adjustments equity securities value changes and non cash stock based compensation expense in addition to financing and legacy business income and expense items the company determined to exclude impairments and gains or losses on sales or exchanges of cryptocurrencies from our calculation of adjusted non gaap ebitda for all periods presented adjusted eps is a financial measure defined as our ebitda divided by our diluted

center hosting are two additional performance measurements that represent a key indicator of the company s core business operations of both bitcoin mining and data center hosting these measurements are defined as cost of revenues mining less power curtailment credits and cost of revenues data center hosting less power curtailment credits respectively we believe our ability to sell power back to the grid at market driven spot prices thereby reducing our operating costs is integral to our overall strategy specifically our power management strategy and our commitment to supporting the ercot grid while participation in various grid demand response programs may impact our bitcoin production we view this as an important part of our partnership driven approach with ercot and our commitment to being a good corporate citizen in our communities we believe netting the power sales against our costs can be an important financial measure because it allows management investors and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results including our operating efficiencies from period to period by making such adjustments in the table below we have allocated the benefit of the power sales to our data center hosting and mining segments based on their proportional power consumption during the periods presented cost of revenues mining net of power curtailment credits and cost

which was acquired earlier this year by sema4 file photo stamford genomic testing company sema4 announced this week sweeping changes aimed at reining in costs that will include laying off about 240 employees across its facilities in connecticut closing its clinical laboratory in branford and consolidating its stamford real estate while it also disclosed the resignation of its founder and president the job cuts will affect 143 employees at the company s headquarters at 333 ludlow st in stamford s south end 15 employees at its laboratory 1 5 miles west of the headquarters at 62 southfield ave in stamford and 81 employees at the lab at 1 commercial st in branford according to a letter the company sent monday to the state department of labor among those affected workers 122 of them are working remotely outside connecticut but they report to and or have their work assigned from one of those locations those layoffs represent about 13 percent of sema4 s workforce leaving the company with about 1 600 employees combined with downsizing in the first half of 2022 the company said it has eliminated approximately 30 percent of the positions from its original legacy business factoring in the job cuts and other cost cutting measures the company said it is on track to produce more than 150 million in annualized savings and approximately 200 million in cumulative savings by the end of 2023 advertisement article continues below this ad the second quarter results released monday underscored the company s financial struggles quarterly quarter revenues totaled about 36 million down 23 percent from the same period last year it posted a loss of nearly 86 million for the quarter compared with a loss of about 46 million a year ago our new management team has been

on monday as a result we re making changes to ensure we strengthen our foundation and financials so we can continue to realize our mission of unlocking insights from data leading to healthier lives and in doing so realizing value for our shareholders the new developments appeared to rattle investors with company shares closing tuesday at 1 60 plummeting 33 percent from their closing price on

percent of the company s revenues but about 35 million in annual expenses advertisement article continues below this ad at the same time sema4 said it was moving its hereditary cancer testing operations from the stamford lab to its lab in gaithersburg md with the latter location being the hometown of genedx another genomic testing provider that it acquired earlier this year to take

stamford stamford mayor caroline simmons said in a statement that while we are disappointed that there are layoffs in our city we are grateful for the work sema4 did during the height of the covid 19

of genedx which is intended to bolster sema4 s millions of clinical records genomic information that is vital to detecting and treating many diseases such as cancer in january sema4 said that by acquiring genedx it would become one of the largest and most advanced providers of genomic clinical testing in the u s sema4 was heavily involved in covid 19 testing in connecticut after signing an

its transformation into a publicly traded company a process it undertook by merging with a special purpose acquisition company with our focus on profitable growth scalable r d strategy and improved operations efficiency i m confident that these changes will result in better outcomes for key groups including patients health care providers employees and shareholders stueland added
if you google carbon zero buildings you won t find many examples of buildings that actually meet this standard right now only one percent of the world s buildings are classified as net zero striking a balance between the energy they use and the renewable energy created on site or bought off site technically those buildings have net zero emissions it does not mean that they are carbon zero to qualify as carbon zero in the truest sense of the term the energy needed to power the building would come entirely from renewable energy produced onsite building sustainability experts like breana wheeler director of u s operations for the building research establishment bre the organization that created the breeam sustainable building standard are quick to point out the distinction net zero is a mathematical concept that still allows for the burning of fossil fuels that s how you get to net we need to aim for zero carbon emissions created think more zero less net she explains but net zero and carbon zero are often used interchangeably along with carbon neutral when they represent three unique standards varying shades of green carbon neutrality is considered the most foundational of the three it means that the amount of carbon emitted is negated by offsets that absorb carbon sometimes referred to as sinks such as forestation or funding ways to reduce reliance on fossil fuels in other parts of the world while a step in the right direction carbon neutrality is often criticized because it does not mean by definition that any emissions were avoided critics of carbon offsets are quick to point out that they should be used as a last resource for the small percentage of emissions that are unavoidable right now because the technology doesn t exist to eliminate them net zero or carbon net zero buildings take their climate pledges beyond neutrality with a three prong approach reducing emissions through efficiency generating renewable energy on site or off site and using offsets to address emissions that can t be avoided the problem with net zero can boil down to the word off in its definition like with most aspects of real estate location is everything that s especially true when considering the impact of decarbonization and whether or not offsets and off site renewables are creating better outcomes for people not just the buildings themselves joanna frank president and ceo of the center for active design explains there is a direct correlation between health discrepancies and the physical environments where we live we see higher levels of contaminants and air pollution in lower income neighborhoods along with shorter life expectancy and a lower quality of life we want carbon zero buildings to put less carbon in the atmosphere slow climate change and improve actual health outcomes for people that s one of the reasons why local law 97 in new york city puts a significant discount on any renewable energy credits that do not make it back onto the grid in the city john gilbert executive chairman of prescriptive data and a longtime landlord in nyc explains the law is very clear that you will be discounted by 90 percent of any renewable energy credit that you purchased if that energy is not delivered into the city of new york however right now there are no renewables at scale delivered to new york in order for us to get to a carbon zero world we need to deliver renewables at scale into the environments where we operate like zone j in manhattan these nuances and often misused definitions are one of the reasons why the research teams at bre emphasize the importance of carbon zero in perhaps the truest sense of the term highly energy efficient buildings powered by on site renewable energy carbon zero zero combustion most highly efficient buildings are exclusively electric powered with no on site combustion like gas or coal power sources and that s typically the initiation fee for carbon zero status wheeler explains electricity is the only source that can be fully decarbonized if you have on site combustion you go back to the net zero conversation for buildings that need to be electrified the costs of retrofitting are real but electric power provides a pathway to the possibility of carbon zero the move to electric power is one of the reasons why europe is ahead of the u s in terms of decarbonization in a 2020 report by london based energy research firm ember even though the united states halved its coal fired power generation since 2007 65 percent was replaced by natural gas not renewables in comparison the european union also halved its reliance on coal but replaced it entirely with wind and solar production the impact on emission reduction was also a dichotomy 19 percent in the u s vs 43 percent in the eu james fisher who heads up strategic real estate relationships for bre in the uk and europe explains all electric is the only thing that we can absolutely control and guarantee that allows governments to plan their policies and standards accordingly influencing mass changes in terms of transmission efficiencies in the grid to get rid of a dependency on natural gas progress still trumps perfection will most existing buildings ever be carbon zero it s not likely given the costs to retrofit sustainably today fisher notes true carbon zero buildings are very few and far between because it s difficult to achieve for the existing building stock today carbon zero buildings represent the very top of the market even in terms of new builds only a fraction of a percentage of what s being built much like the definitions themselves there are different certifications for net zero and carbon zero buildings however not many buildings meet these standards only one building in the u s has achieved breeam s highest certifications for sustainable buildings the center for sustainable landscapes at phipps conservatory and botanical gardens in pennsylvania in terms of leed s carbon zero certification only 16 buildings in the u s have been certified as carbon zero with an additional 35 currently pursuing that designation these low numbers don t mean that the industry should change what its true north for decarbonization should be it s not all or nothing wheeler shares an important reminder it s not about the perfect buildings but we do need to recognize the danger in only focusing on net zero as a target because if it is anything like our journey to reduce fossil fuels we re going to end up nowhere near zero

terry gross host this is fresh air this year marks the centennial of judy garland s birth you may have watched some of her films when she was star of the month on the turner classic movies channel warner brothers has been reissuing her films on blu ray our classical music critic lloyd schwartz is going to review the most recent of those new releases soundbite of song but not for me judy garland singing they re writing songs of love but not for me a lucky star s above but not for me with love to lead the way i ve found more skies of gray than any russian play could guarantee i was a fool lloyd schwartz byline judy garland s poignant rendition of but not for me was the high point of busby berkeley s 1943 version of the 1930 gershwin musical girl crazy not only because she s in such beautiful voice but because she seems to be singing completely without artifice from the very beginning of her career audiences found garland so lovable because of her rare emotional honesty the only film i know in which she actually sings badly is ziegfeld girl from 1941 and she does it on purpose in the story her father is a retired vaudevillian who coaches her to punch out every song and she s awful until she finally follows her own unerring instincts she demonstrated those instincts in 33 feature films 30 of them musicals before her death at the age of 47 this year the centennial of her birth warner brothers has been reissuing a number of her films in gorgeously restored blu rays joining such previously released classics as the wizard of oz meet me in st louis easter parade and a star is born these new additions also reveal that her most exuberant songs were as good as her tender ones because her joy of singing is so genuine as in the title song from her first film with gene

its name has evoked a mix of emotions in the real estate industry for years to some the company is an innovator bringing the brokerage model to a new level with tech marketing and an agent centric model to others it s a controversial entity leveraging wall street dollars to lure top performers into its camp regardless of where you sit on that spectrum it s difficult to argue that compass inc hasn t been a conversation starter in real estate that proved to be evident recently as the company announced that it was nixing several recruiting perks that have been instrumental in the brokerage s surge to nearly 29 000 agents in over 70 markets nationwide while that surge of growth has garnered praise and scrutiny it is also indicative of a persisting interest among agents to give the brokerage a try be that as it may there are still a lot of questions surrounding compass which is in its second year as a publicly traded company is the tech focused company truly an innovator or is it a novel spin on the traditional brokerage model that it has tried to disassociate with understanding the business model launched in 2012 by robert reffkin and ori allon and going public in 2021 compass has built its reputation on its ability to lure top talent agents as a technology enabled brokerage that provides a mix of resources and support to improve the lives and businesses of their agents at the forefront of that premise and its branding is the compass platform arguably the new york based firm s most significant value proposition compass agents are given access to an end to end suite of software and tools packaged into a seamless one stop shop that they can use to run their business christian wilhelm an agent with compass in the pittsburgh area tells rismedia that the platform has helped him save time because of its user friendly features admittedly a challenge he has experienced at other brokerages he worked at before compass compass has found a way to keep their tech and our files and business organization in one place so you don t have to go too far out of the platform wilhelm says it s one portal where you have your marketing and business tracker and all that stuff for wilhelm compass and its team of support staff helped mitigate much of the paper pushing and have allowed him and his team of agents to focus on working with clients since joining the brokerage in july 2021 wilhelm says compass has been everything that they pitched to him and more compass has found a way to really power agents and puts people and tools in place to help us execute wilhelm says that goes beyond the tech however as compass has a workforce of dedicated support staff referred to as agent office experience managers that assist their assigned agents and teams the concept is aimed at taking some of the non transactional work like marketing off an agent s plate so they can focus on working with clients compass also complements its platform with adjacent services aimed at helping agents better serve their clients that includes compass concierge a program that provides sellers access to interest free capital to front the cost of home improvement services to clients preparing their homes for sale while some may have pedestaled compass tech and tools as its primary appeal others contend that the firm s success at least in recruiting agents through the years is a product of timing that was evident in the years prior to the pandemic according to a former agent who asked that their name be withheld so they could speak candidly about their time at the company referred to as agent x in this article with an industry that was ripe for change the former agent says compass offered a fresh and new environment that they were looking for it seemed at the time as if they understood the gripes of the agent which was one of the important reasons i went over there they say the industry had this one very linear way of operating and a lot of us didn t believe the companies we were with took those concerns seriously it didn t hurt that they were giving large splits and setting up bonuses and in some cases stock options the agent continues adding that they were offered an 80 20 split and stock options compass has been known to offer stock options as part of its compensation package through an agent equity program according to an sec filing the company offers affiliated agents the ability to elect to have a portion of their commissions earned during a calendar year to be paid in the form of restricted stock units rsu however company executives indicated at the end of 2021 that it was winding down the use of equity to recruit agents as january reports showed that less than 10 of the agents recruited elected to receive shares in lieu of commissions company officials doubled down on that effort in a recent announcement claiming that compass would be sunsetting its use of equity or cash incentives to recruit new agents in the future arguably a significant expense that has hindered the new york company s pursuit of profitability during a recent call with investors compass executives indicated that new agents would be required to adhere to a standard commission split that the brokerage offers for a given market when asked how the cutbacks on recruiting with financial incentives would impact commissions reffkin said we decided that any agent that we started talking to as of last monday we would give no financial incentive in any way and that they would be on our policy for that market if their split is better than our policy split they can have that for one year and then they go to our policy reffkin added despite rumors and critiques surrounding the commission splits that compass has offered agents the company has kept that number close to the vest compass regional president rory golod in an emailed statement to rismedia claimed that the brokerage s commission splits have and always will be determined upon a number of factors including industry market standards and agent production history in its latest earnings report compass reported that it raked in 1 397 billion in revenue for the first quarter of 2022 among its list of operating expenses the brokerage paid 1 146 billion in agent commissions and other related expenses based on rough calculations dividing the commissions paid by revenue compass appears to provide an 82 18 split in favor of its agents similar to high performing agents as reported in rismedia s contract and commission study this could vary depending on the individual contract negotiations however compensation and financials have typically been a significant and at times controversial aspect of compass s business model according to wall street journal reports some agents received all the sales commission with nothing going to compass on as many as eight of their first deals reports also indicated that the new york based company fronted sellers money for staging and cosmetic work so agents wouldn t need to foot the bill bill fowler who served as compass senior director of industry relations from may 2018 to january 2022 tells rismedia that the tactics mentioned in the wall street journal report were accurate i know that they were accused of buying agents which is an interesting concept because everyone has always done this fowler says you offer incentives and it worked while he was insulated from much of the company s contract negotiations fowler admits that the agent perks and commission splits were often handled on an individual basis and institutionally compass took the stance that we re going to go out and get the best and brightest and we re willing to pay for it and it s worked he says the company arguably succeeded in that endeavor as it quickly expanded its business in size and production and shot to the top of the list of u s brokerages in terms of sales volume last year compass has deep pockets wilhelm says in my opinion they buy market share which is genius sometimes i m like will they ever make their money back on these agents because they do pay well percentage wise in my opinion while wilhelm indicates that he is unable to comment on the split that he agreed upon with compass due to contract stipulations he notes that the company s financial perks go beyond the commissions as part of his contract wilhelm tells rismedia that compass provided him and his team a budget for marketing and fronted money to cover lost commissions that they were missing from a previous firm in order to recruit them if they didn t give me that lost commission program we would ve lost hundreds of thousands of dollars wilhelm says i was able to bring over my whole team and keep everyone together because everyone was treated fairly and was made whole those perks don t come without their stipulations according to wilhelm as a team leader i had a very big decision to make because they said hey we re going to give you this lost commission and the things to help you get your business up and running however we want a commitment from you to us wilhelm says money talks and so does tech with all the bells and whistles it advertises at the end of the day the lifeblood of compass business model is the agents the company has invested heavily to reel in top performing talent through the years it also doesn t hurt that compass was offering higher initial splits and footing a hefty marketing budget to agents according to another former compass who also asked for anonymity in this article referred to as agent y they also offered several thousands of dollars in the first year toward the marketing budget they say adding that they were also offered stock options and the opportunity to purchase stock with part of their commissions this was pre ipo and the implication was that agents who bought in pre ipo would make much more money they say adding that they declined the option while working under the compass banner agent y says they were given an 80 20 commission split in their original contract with compass however the former agent notes that their commission dropped 5 in their second year with the company according to golod in an emailed statement compass doesn t adjust an agent s agreed upon commission split before the agent s contract is up anything that is outlined in a contract is adhered to just like with any contract he says while many would argue that high financial perks have played a role in compass surging market share golod and company executives maintain that the compass platform is the primary factor bolstering compass ranks there s a massive technology deficit in terms of a single platform that allows agents to grow their business and operate efficiently golod says one of the things we think about as we are working side by side with agents to build a platform is how do we help unlock business growth for them and business efficiency according to jeff shelton broker and co founder of florida based hughes shelton group with compass that was enough of a selling point for him and his partners to join the new york brokerage overall i had a good enough experience at compass but it just seemed like a whole lot of bull about how they were disrupting the industry with technology when in reality they re just doing the same thing all of the other big brokerages are doing former compass agent since joining the company in the fall of last year he says the compass platform complements his business it gives the agent the ability to access all the technology and work in conjunction with your database and your own business shelton says everything kind of integrates together so it takes a lot of unnecessary steps out for the agent by that measure shelton says that it s worth joining the brokerage and paying nominal fees to access compass resources and technology what they actually give you so exceeds what s in the industry he says for the first time i felt like i was actually getting something for the fees i was paying according to documents compass filed with u s securities and exchange commission sec the company charges agents resource fees that are either transaction based collected at the closing of a real estate transaction or in the form of periodic fixed fees which are reflected in the agent s commissions and other related expenses while the sec document didn t show a number amount agent x tells rismedia that compass charged them anywhere between 1 300 to 1 400 annually related read about fee structures referral rates commission splits and more in rismedia s contract and commission study for premier members this spring rismedia took an exclusive guided tour of the compass platform with golod to delve into different backend tools and resources that he says allows the firm s agents to run their business from anywhere sure the platform provides some of the industry basics an internal crm business trackers and client communication tools for example but some of the more advantageous features focus on improving agent production at a time when inventory is tight tracking down listings is a critical component of every agent s business compass attempts to mitigate some of these challenges with features like compass exclusives and its likely to sell software starting with the former golod told rismedia that agents receive an inventory advantage by accessing a cache of pocket listings sourced from agents nationwide because of our market share we have hundreds of listings that are private exclusives that only compass agents have access to in our system he says adding that the advantage comes from having access to more inventory in a centralized place compass has caught some flack for allegedly trying to carve out market share using office exclusives in the bay area that was evident when the mega brokerage was explicitly called out during a recent harvard panel focused on housing issues with likely to sell compass provides its agent with an ai driven client prospecting software that recommends clients within the compass network that have a higher likelihood of selling their home based on several factors including transaction volume in the market and home appreciation value this is helping agents sort of answer that age old question i ve got thousands of contacts whom do i call today and they can go in look at their different likely to sell recs and reach out directly golod says while some view compass as an innovator and disruptor in a seemingly archaic industry agent y tells rismedia that the new york based brokerage offers very little that is not already provided by other brokerages in the industry overall i had a good enough experience at compass but it just seemed like a whole lot of bull about how they were disrupting the industry with technology when in reality they re just doing the same thing all of the other big brokerages are doing they said the former agent acknowledges that compass home search app was a helpful tool however they also indicated that getting agents and clients to use the app was challenging instead of other products already available in the industry compass sells itself as a groundbreaking real estate tech company disrupting the real estate industry but the tech is already out there in similar variations with other companies the former agent says however a unique appeal is that all of the software and tools are in a centralized platform he says if nothing else golod asserts that the compass platform helps save its agents valuable time by offering a streamlined tech stack in one location right now to do this if you re not at compass you need 12 different programs to do what we have he says the push for profitability compass bills itself as a tech company that happens to be in real estate arguably an attempt to differentiate from its competitors but the reality is that it is cut from the same cloth as the traditional brokerages that it has tried to separate from that said the allure of compass that has appealed to many agents through the years has been its ability and willingness with the help of wall street dollars to focus on what matters most to agents their bottom lines and ability to serve clients better with 25 years of experience shelton says joining compass didn t eliminate the identity that he spent his career building instead he and his team have received flexibility to integrate their brand with compass for us it s been a pretty seamless transition because they ve allowed us to brand ourselves in front of compass shelton says it s kind of given us both strengths if that makes sense so for me they have met every expectation i thought of while agent x admits that they believed the company wanted to do right by its agents and still do they also felt that compass may have bit off more than they could chew i feel like they promised more than they were willing to deliver and those signs showed very quickly says agent x while compass tried to offer agents everything they d need to focus on transacting the former agent states they noticed an acceleration of the company and cutbacks in some of the services and support resources as compass continued growing as a company the former agent says that support staff was being spread thin this is a typical feeling in the industry itself that support staff isn t enough agent x says but when you come to compass and you have that it kind of throws them back into the pool of the others going public and the effort leading up to that ipo launch may have had a lot to do with a shift in culture at the compass the former agent claims they tell rismedia that the change was around agent productivity and hitting certain marks you could see things like you may have been an agent who does a certain of business and if you re down at a certain point of the year let s say 30 and that s half of the year you d have six months to do that business and more agent x says according to the former agent compass took a very hard line when renegotiating their contract based on the amount of business they did and would do in the future it was bluntly said we re going public and we can t have agents not meeting their marks and still paying agents the high splits agent x says what they were trying to do in my case was cut back my splits below what industry standard would have been anywhere else at any other major brokerage the culture was no longer about quality it was really about making the deadlines and revenue points which became a concern of mine agent x continues explaining that this was a significant driving factor for them leaving compass it s not uncommon for companies to undergo a culture shift after going public especially when answering to shareholders compass has been no exception according to golod who says that the brokerage has had to be thoughtful prudent and conservative during the changing housing market and economic uncertainty we are living in a new world with regard to investor expectations says golod we believe that we need to operate with the scrappiness we have demonstrated many times over the last nine plus years to get to where we are today since launching its ipo in april 2021 compass has seen its stock dwindle from roughly 20 to just below 5 a share based on recent reports compass raked in 6 4 billion in revenue in its first year as a public company however the brokerage still recorded nearly half a billion dollars 494 million in a net loss leaving an arduous path toward becoming a profitable company admittedly a goal that robert reffkin and company have started working towards the management team and i are committed to executing our plan to deliver strong ebitda and free cash flow reffkin said during a q4 earnings call last year we are committed to increasing profitability and prioritizing free cash flow in 2022 and beyond despite tallying a net loss for 2021 compass claimed it achieved profitability based on the company s adjusted ebitda instead of net income by that measure the company excluded things like stock based agent compensation which accounted for the lion s share of its losses last year during that call reffkin signaled that the company anticipated being free cash flow positive next year while also saying that compass is committed to reaching profitability by 2025 this would imply more than 1 2 billion in adjusted ebitda by 2025 he said adding that compass expects free cash flow to be 8 to 9 of revenue by 2025 compass has a few measures it is looking to implement to make that happen including recruiting agents based on commission splits that are more economically favorable to the brokerage in a chart featured in a q4 2021 shareholder presentation compass outlined its expected trajectory which was predicated on improving agent economics and growth of adjacent services the chart highlights several points where compass could see increased profits through a medium term and long term agent tier mix as compass continues recruiting and hiring agents golod tells rismedia that compass expects to see a massive margin improvement this arguably signals that the new york based company is looking to recruit newer agents at lower commission splits more favorable to compass in the future as it pushes towards profitability it s uncertain how this may impact compass appeal as a landing point for agents but golod maintains that the appeal of the tech platform and the company s support services will continue to drive recruitment in the future all of the big brokerages try to leverage technology to make things easier for their agents says agent y all of them offer some sort of app a website a crm and email and social media templates every brokerage aims to help its agents do their jobs as best they can another thing that the analysts seem to gloss over is that compass s growth while impressive is mostly due to buying market share with signing bonuses and excellent splits versus doing something fundamentally different than the other traditional brokerages jordan grice is rismedia

the big question on investors minds right now is where will inflation go and the related follow up question for everyone is how far will the fed hike rates in response the potential answers cover the full range of possibilities from president biden s happy talk about zero percent inflation to the market bears predicting a full blown economic depression count jpmorgan s chief asset management strategist david kelly among the bulls he s not convinced by the doomsayers and sees the recent drop in inflation as a sign that the worst is getting behind us while current conditions are still hard

higher here so let s follow jpm a little further down this trail the banking giant s stock analysts have picked out two stocks that they believe are ready to surge ahead by the order of 40 or more in fact the jpm experts are not the only ones singing these stocks praises according to the tipranks platform they are rated as strong buys by the street s analysts let s take a closer look beigene bgne the first jpm pick is beigene a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with in its words a broad and deep pipeline that takes a shotgun approach to the field of oncology the company is developing a tremendous number of drug candidates more than 50 both in house and as collaborative efforts to address treatment needs in some 80 of cancer malignancies a pipeline that size gives the company a competitive advantage when compared to peers beigene is a truly international biotech firm operating in asia in europe and in the americas and boasting administrative offices in beijing china cambridge massachusetts and basel switzerland from these offices the company oversees its development activities and the commercialization activities for its line of approved commercial stage products the leading approved products are zanubrutinib branded as brukinsa pamiparib branded as partruvix and tislelizumab branded under its own name as a group these drugs are approved in several international jurisdictions for the treatment of various hematological cancers and solid tumors beigene has been actively commercializing them for several years now and in 2q22 the company realized

the stock an overweight i e buy along with a 296 price target that implies a 50 one year upside backing his bullish stance chen writes we see beigene shares as undervalued given quality of assets growth and highlight the stock as one of our top picks in the sector beigene has grown into a fully integrated biopharma company with best in class clinical development capabilities one of the largest and best oncology commercial platforms in china and unmatched partnership skills with global biopharma companies we expect the company s 16 commercial assets and broad pipeline to drive very attractive diversified long term growth while we remain moderately below consensus on long term sales we see additional pipeline traction as upside to our estimates overall 6 wall street analysts have chimed in on this biotech giant and left 5 buy recommendations against 1 hold for a strong buy consensus rating the shares are priced at 192 77 and their 253 76 average price target indicates an upside potential of 29 in the coming months see bgne stock forecast on tipranks xenon pharmaceuticals xene the second stock we re looking at is xenon another biopharma firm at the clinical stage xenon is working on new therapeutic agents in the field of neurology looking for novel drugs to treat neurological conditions with high unmet medical needs the company has a particular focus on treatments for epilepsy xenon has two leading drug candidates in this field xen496 and xen1101 at phase 3 and phase 2 trials stages respectively xen496 is kv7 potassium channel opener and is being investigated for a rare pediatric form of epileptic seizure disorder the company expects to complete the phase 3 epik study of xen496 during 2023 xen1101 however is the company s flagship drug candidate it is currently undergoing several phase 2 trials for focal onset seizure epilepsy fos primary generalized tonic clonic seizures pgtcs and major depression the phase 2b x tole trial against fos is expected to be completed this year and the company has two identical phase 3 trials x tole2 and x tole3 in preparation to run when the current trial is completed the phase 3 trials will run in parallel and enroll up to 360 patients xenon is also planning the x ackt phase 3 trial to continue its study of xen1101 s efficacy against pgtcs this study will run simultaneously with the x tole trials finally xenon has the phase 2 x nova study ongoing to evaluate xen1101 against major depressive disorder topline results from this x nova study which has enrolled 150 patients are expected in 2023 jpm analyst tessa romero sees xen1101 as the key factor in this stock and lays out a clear case why bolstered primarily by compelling phase 2b x tole data as well as positive physician feedback we view xen1101 as having a high probability of success as an adjunctive treatment in its lead indication of focal onset seizures fos at the same time we also see the potential for xen1101 to work in both patients with focal and or generalized seizures and forecast 1b in peak sales in the u s alone in the combined epilepsy indications 700m of which is fos where our estimates could prove conservative we believe there is an opportunity in xene shares at current levels which under reflect the potential of xen1101 to expand to additional high unmet need indications beyond fos where there is convincing emerging rationale the analyst added romero rates shares in xene as overweight i e buy and her 55 price target implies a 46 upside by the end of next year to watch romero s track record click here wall street is clearly upbeat on this biopharma as all 8 of the recent analyst reviews are positive for a unanimous strong buy consensus rating the stock is selling for 37 57 and its 51 average price target

menafn globenewswire nasdaq castle rock colo aug 15 2022 globe newswire riot blockchain inc nasdaq riot riot or the company an industry leader in bitcoin btc mining and data center hosting reported financial results for the three month period ended june 30 2022 the unaudited financial statements are available on riot s website and here we are extremely encouraged by riot s financial resilience and operational achievements this quarter said jason les ceo of riot we continued to make substantial progress in executing towards our ambitious growth plans including completion of our first immersion cooled building and the successful transition of all miners which were previously hosted by coinmint to our whinstone facility which will further reduce our operating costs going forward we will continue to focus on executional excellence as we work in pursuit of developing riot into the world s leading bitcoin driven infrastructure platform second quarter 2022 financial highlights riot continues to attain significant milestones while positioning itself for future opportunities driven by its focus on bitcoin mining key financial highlights for the second quarter include increased total revenue by 112 to 72 9 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 34 3 million for the same three month period in 2021 increased mining revenue by 47 to 46 2 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 31 5 million for the same three month period in 2021 driven by an increase in the number of btc mined which was negatively impacted by lower btc values in q2 2022 vs q2 2021 reported data center hosting revenue of 9 8 million for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of whinstone us in q2 2021 reported 16 9 million in revenue from engineering segment for the three month period ended june 30 2022 following the acquisition of ess metron in q4 2021 increased btc production quantity by 107 to 1 395 btc during the three month period ended june 30 2022 as compared to 675 btc during the same three month period in 2021 raised 267 0 million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately 30 6 million shares of riot common stock via our previously announced at the market equity offering further strengthening riot s industry leading financial position amid challenging market conditions for the sector reported 496 4 million in current assets as of june 30 2022 with 270 5 million in cash on hand up from 113 6 million at the end of q1 2022 and 6 653 btc unaudited all of which were produced by the company s self mining operations second quarter 2022 financial results mining revenue in excess of mining cost of revenues excluding depreciation and amortization was 28 2 million 61 of mining revenue which compares to 22 1 million 70 of mining revenue for the same three month period in 2021 mining revenue margin was modestly lower on a year over year basis primarily due to a 28 decrease in the average price of bitcoin and a 33 increase in the average bitcoin mining difficulty index during the second quarter of 2022 compared to the same three month period in 2021 despite the significant decrease in the price of btc and increase in variable mining costs associated with greater btc production this quarter relative to the same three month period in 2021 improved operating efficiencies driven in part by a greater proportion of new generation miners deployed at riot s whinstone facility where lower production costs benefited our mining revenue margins power curtailment credits received based on our ability under long term power agreements to sell power back to the ercot grid at market driven spot prices and thereby reducing our operating costs totaled approximately 5 7 million for the quarter ended june 30 2022 if total power curtailment credits were not presented to reduce operating costs but rather allocated between cost of revenues mining and cost of revenues data center hosting based on proportional power consumption cost of revenues mining would have decreased by 2 2 million increasing mining revenue margin to 30 4 million 66 of mining revenue on a non gaap basis selling general and administrative sg a expenses increased by 7 2 million to 10 7 million as compared to 3 5 million for the same three month period in 2021 primarily due to an increase in compensation related expense of 2 1 million which came about as a result of the hiring of additional employees to support the company s ongoing growth an increase in audit and consulting fees of 2 2 million resulting primarily from assistance on internal control systems and procedures and it projects an increase in insurance expense of 0 8 million and other general operating costs net loss for the quarter ended june 30 2022 was 366 3 million or 2 81 per share as compared to net income of 19 3 million or 0 22 per share in the same three month period in 2021 net loss for the quarter was negatively impacted by a 349 1 million non cash accounting impairment of goodwill a 99 8 million non cash accounting impairment on bitcoin held and an unrealized loss of 4 8 million on marketable equity securities which was partially offset by an increase in fair value of derivative asset of 60 9 million a gain on exchange of equipment of 8 6 million and a 14 4 million gain on sale of bitcoin non gaap adjusted ebitda for the quarter ended june 30 2022 was 65 2 million as compared to non gaap adjusted ebitda of 2 4 million for the same three month period in 2021 a non cash accounting impairment of goodwill of 349 1 million and a 99 8 million non cash accounting impairment on bitcoin held negatively impacted net income for the quarter which also impacted non gaap adjusted ebitda the company determined starting in q4 2021 to exclude impairments and gains or losses on sales or exchanges of cryptocurrencies from its calculation of non gaap adjusted ebitda second quarter 2022 and recent operational highlights as of june 30 2022 the company had a deployed fleet of 44 720 asic miners with a hash rate capacity of 4 4 eh s subsequent to june 30 2022 received an additional 9 316 new s19j pros and deployed 4 320 s19j pros in riot s immersion cooled buildings with an additional 7 200 miners staged for deployment upon deployment of the staged miners riot expects to have a total of 47 511 miners deployed with a hash rate capacity of approximately 4 9 eh s continued to make significant progress on the company s 400 megawatt mw expansion at its whinstone facility the expansion is expected to be completed in q1 2023 the final components of the buildout of each building are being completed in parallel with miner deployments completed riot s first immersion cooled building at its whinstone facility building f with 23 000 s19 series miners fully operational placement of miners in building g riot s second immersion cooled building continues with initial miners already deployed and hashing began development of the company s previously announced 265 acre 1 gigawatt expansion site in navarro county texas with bitcoin mining operations at the new facility remaining on track to commence summer 2023 currently all miners previously hosted at coinmint llc s massena ny facility have been either relocated to the company s whinstone facility by way of a miner swap agreement with another bitcoin mining counterparty or shipped to the whinstone facility this transition is expected to further improve riot s mining revenue margin through reduced power costs and elimination of all third party hosting fees hash rate growth by q1 2023 riot anticipates a total self mining hash rate capacity of approximately 12 5 eh s assuming full deployment of approximately 115 450 antminer asics and excluding any potential expected incremental productivity gains from the company s utilization of 200 mw of immersion cooling infrastructure substantially all of the company s self mining fleet will consist of the latest generation s19 series miner model in addition to the company s self mining operations riot hosts approximately 200 mw of institutional bitcoin mining clients atm offering as previously disclosed on march 31 2022 the company filed a prospectus supplement with the u s securities and exchange commission to offer and sell up to 500 million of the

corporate purposes subsequent to june 30 2022 and as of the date of filing the company received additional net proceeds on sales of approximately 6 5 million shares of common stock of approximately 31 5 million goodwill impairment due to adverse market conditions in the second quarter of 2022 the company performed an interim goodwill impairment assessment as of june 30 2022 assisted by an independent valuation specialist firm this assessment included a comparison of publicly traded peer company valuation multiples and riot s adjusted market capitalization as of june 30 2022 a period of extreme uncertainty in the broader bitcoin ecosystem and near year to date lows for the company and industry market valuations as a result of this assessment riot recorded an impairment to goodwill of 349 1million related to the acquisitions of whinstone us and ess metron in 2021 our acquisitions of whinstone us and ess metron remain the foundation of our vertically integrated strategy and are the reason riot is positioned as an industry leader today said jason les ceo of riot although challenging global market conditions in the second quarter further impacted by a steep decline in the price of bitcoin and resulting decline in market valuations for publicly traded bitcoin miners including riot necessitated non cash impairment charges this quarter these non cash charges had no impact on our solid financial position and ample liquidity both of which were further strengthened this quarter we remain extremely excited by the additional growth and development opportunities including our

above we believe cost of revenues mining net of power curtailment credits and cost of revenues data center hosting are two additional performance measurements that represent a key indicator of the

overall strategy specifically our power management strategy and our commitment to supporting the ercot grid while participation in various grid demand response programs may impact our bitcoin production we view this as an important part of our partnership driven approach with ercot and our commitment to being a good corporate citizen in our communities we believe netting the power sales against our costs can be an important financial measure because it allows management investors and our board of directors to evaluate and compare our operating results including our operating efficiencies from period to period by making such adjustments in the table below we have allocated the benefit of the power sales to our data center hosting and mining segments based on their

yoursay let s hope justice prevails and the judges do their duty fearlessly src evidence bid chief justice heads 5 person bench way to go it is said justice delayed is justice denied but in former prime minister najib abdul razak s case justice was delayed not by the courts but by him putting off the court hearings as long as possible meanwhile he lived a king s life as the poster boy of the backdoor regime and umno s social media idol keeping at bay the inevitable the verdict that much can be said of najib s cry of innocence and victimisation he has finally been dragged to the last episode that will decide his fate one way or another whatever it is najib stands convicted in the court of public opinion not only in this case but also in others where justice was not seen to be done by virtue of his unfettered political power this case is significant in that 1mdb lined up an international cast where our hard earned monies were squandered on foreign land making foreigners millionaires and billionaires at the expense of long suffering malaysians credit is due to the us department of justice doj and media like the wall street journal new york times and sarawak report that doggedly clung on to expose this daylight heist malaysia became world renowned as a worst case kleptocracy malaysians have put their trust and faith in the esteemed federal court in the hope that justice is meted fairly we also stand on the podium of an international audience that keenly awaits the verdict malaysians deserve praise for the mammoth task of ridding the kleptocracy at the 14th general elections if not for it 1mdb would never have been exposed and its conspirators never brought to justice the country would have been doomed we need to bring to closure the 1mdb saga that has taken a toll like no other on the people and country the people await with bated breath oct whatever decision by the federal court will be just najib has been given much more leeway than any other convicted felon the court has allowed numerous postponements in this and related cases that range from dog bit hand red eye covid 19 attending grandson s birth in singapore and even sending lead counsel s son overseas to study to name a few najib is perhaps the only convicted felon in the world who is provided with a police escort a policeman is seen kissing his hand he gets full pay benefits perks allowance benefits and even asked for his entitlement of rm100 million house for his disastrous service to the government he behaves like a rock star and poster boy for his party he was even invited to give a keynote address at an international conference nowhere in the world has such a convicted felon vijay47 and finally after many counts of illness to self and staff family commitments encounters with playful dogs and tea with queen elizabeth the moment of reckoning is at hand almost at hand it was a learning curve for all of us offering insights into the judiciary and glimpses of najib s self induced perception of the malaysian legal system which he seems to believe permits him to make all kinds of allegations about judges which he can withdraw when they catch his fancy yet despite all the liberties he enjoyed my personal belief is that for him the worst is yet to come in comparison being termed a national embarrassment would be a mere mild reprimand the chickens are coming home to roost get the sauce ready the gander and goose are going to be cooked the curtain then falls and the circus leaves town what a double celebration for the embarrassed nation selamat merdeka everyone dr raman letchumanan malaysia s future is at stake and at a crucial turning point only the federal court can save the country from the brink of collapse politically economically and socially and become a failed country and a laughing stock of the world if we miss this opportunity no one else can save this country the reformed government the fractious opposition the rakyat who are cowed and threatened by the kleptocrats and shenanigans and not able to exercise free choice and certainly not the aged and veteran has beens who brought this country to its knees and clamouring to burn it down to ashes apache federal court judges please help to strengthen our rule of law accountability and responsibility in the eyes of the world corruption and stealing public funds are never acceptable many of najib s accomplices are charged fined and jailed some are on the interpol alert list and on the run the whole nation and world are waiting for fair judgment poor mothers who stole tins of milk were jailed whilst someone who allegedly stole billions is still walking free world citizen punishment must be meted out where it is due without fear or favour and irrespective of positions people hold let the country move on from this ugly episode and not be mired in this scandal for the rest of our lives ordinary malaysians face the maximum brunt of the law sometimes even unfairly laws must be applied equally or we will become a banana republic let s hope justice prevails and the judges do their duty fearlessly for the sake of the country its constitution and our future generations cogito ergo sum these five federal court judges will determine the course of this nation upon their shoulders rest this huge weight of deciding which path this nation takes politicians have misruled and abused their powers in both the executive and legislative branches of government it is now left to the judiciary to take us back to some semblance of rational thinking and provide hope for millions on the brink as a result of the unchecked kleptocracy this is it there is no turning back the moment of truth not just for the accused but for an entire nation of 30 million the hopes and destiny of the nation hinge on the five let them have clarity in thought and reasoning in coming to a decisive judgment that will forever alter the course and purpose of malaysia

prior 155 3b db s henry allen concludes the overnight wrap whilst the global economy looks to be heading towards a very difficult winter ahead for markets the summer rally has shown few signs of abating indeed the msci world index has now advanced for 4 weeks running for the first time this calendar year and the s p 500 has recovered by a significant 16 5 in less than two months that run of gains has been turbocharged over the last couple of weeks by a number of good news stories that have fed into a narrative about whether we might have seen peak inflation now raising hopes that central banks might not need to be as aggressive as feared about raising rates we ve raised questions about whether this optimism can hold not least given fed officials themselves are discussing a much more hawkish path for rates than what markets are pricing in but for now there s been little sign of a reversal even as an increasing number of recessionary signals like the 2s10s treasury curve have been flashing with growing alarm overnight in asia however we ve seen a slight loss of momentum after chinese economic data for july came in weaker than expected industrial production was up by 3 8 on a year on year basis vs 4 3 expected whilst retail sales were up 2 7 year on year vs 4 9 expected in turn that s prompted the central bank to cut their one year policy loan rate by 10bps to 2 75 and yields on 10yr chinese government debt are down 6 3bps this morning to 2 68 equity markets have also lost momentum with the shanghai comp 0 06 and the csi 300 0 07 seeing modest declines unlike elsewhere in asia where the nikkei 1 15 and the kospi 0 16 have both advanced this morning in fact that advance for the nikkei puts it at a 7 month high and back in positive territory on a ytd basis looking forward now the week ahead is a quieter one on the market calendar as we await the traditional late summer gathering of central bankers at jackson hole next week however we do have a few events to watch out for including the expected signing by president biden of the inflation reduction act which passed the house of representatives on friday by a margin of 220 207 following its earlier tie breaking path through the senate the legislation includes funds for clean energy provisions a 15 minimum tax for corporations with more than 1bn in revenue and a 1 excise tax on stock buybacks it also offers a political win for the biden administration ahead of the mid term elections in early november and if you look at fivethirtyeight s average then president biden s approval rating is now running at its highest in a couple of months now at 40 3 on the central bank side we don t have much in the way of decisions or speakers over the week ahead which will mean this wednesday s release of the fomc minutes from july will take on added importance that meeting saw the fed hike rates by 75bps again following up their similar move in june but investors interpreted the meeting in a dovish light as they latched onto comments that the fed would move away from 75bp moves at some point however officials then moved to push back on that dovish interpretation and by the close on friday futures were almost evenly split between whether the fed would hike by 75bps for a third time or whether they ll step down to a 50bps pace our us economists write that these minutes could well provide some clues about how officials are likely to determine whether a downshift in the pace of rate hikes is warranted and these signals from the minutes and other fedspeak will become more important as the fed moves towards greater data dependency when making decisions staying on the us the week ahead will also see an increasing amount of hard data for july come out what we ve had so far from the jobs report and the cpi has been very positive for markets with investors growing more hopeful about a soft landing after more than half a million jobs were added and inflation came in beneath expectations but in terms of what s still ahead we ve got retail sales on wednesday where our economists expect that headlines sales should be boosted by the rebound in unit motor vehicle sales last month as well as industrial production housing starts and building permits on tuesday also keep an eye out for the weekly initial jobless claims on thursday which have been on a fairly consistent path higher over recent months furthermore our us economists have previously found that an 11 5 rise in the 4 week moving average of continuing claims relative to the minimum over the past year provides the most accurate recession signal so a further move higher this week would only add to the recessionary signals we ve seen like the 2s10s curve that s been moving deeper into inversion territory over recent weeks related asia gobbles up cheap u s crude at opec s expense on the inflation front the week ahead will also bring us a number of countries cpi releases one of them will be the uk where our economist expects headline cpi to have risen to 9 8 in july which would be its fastest pace in four decades meanwhile in japan our economist expects that core inflation excluding fresh food should rise to 2 4 the highest since late 2014 finally in canada the consensus expects that cpi will fall back from its multi decade high of 8 1 in june to 7 6 in july echoing what we saw in the us where year on year inflation has now begun to fall back from its june peak when it comes to earnings this week will see the current season continue to wind down with 455 of the s p 500 having already reported results by now however we ll still get a number of us retailers including walmart tuesday and target wednesday both have cut their profit forecasts over the last couple of months so it ll be interesting to see what their earnings have to tell us about the strength of the us consumer right now recapping last week now it was yet another positive one for risk assets with the s p 500 3 26 gaining for a 4th week running for the first time since november it was a similar pattern across the major global indices with the stoxx 600 1 18 and the nikkei 1 32 both moving higher as well small cap stocks were a particular beneficiary with the russell 2000 seeing a 4 93 advance but the moves were fairly broad based and the s p 500 now stands only 10 20 lower on a ytd basis a key driver behind that optimism were the weaker than expected us cpi and ppi inflation readings last week that led to a growing belief that the fed might not hike by 75bps again at their next meeting in september with the hike priced in by futures coming down from 69 0bps to 62 2bps by the end of the week however at the same time we saw the rate priced in by end 2023 move higher again as fed officials struck a more hawkish tone on the future policy path than markets were already pricing sending the december 2023 implied rate up from 3 08 to 3 20 in turn that sent government bond yields higher with those on the 10yr treasury up by 0 4bps to 2 83 whilst those on 10yr bunds rose 3 2bps to 0 99 finally a major area of continuing concern was the european energy situation natural gas futures rose by 4 99 over the week to 206 per megawatt hour having been trading around 80 as recently as early june power prices for next year have also continued to make significant gains with french power for 2023 up 14 64 on the week to 617 per megawatt hour which also marked its 9th consecutive weekly rise german power was also up by 13 16 to a record 460 per megawatt hour by zerohedge

huanyu anticipates production commencing in 2023 in the meantime it plans to access up to 500m rmb from government funding available to support agricultural initiatives this funding if received will help the joint venturers to fund their operation furthermore in runhai s case this funding can be used to substantially if not entirely resolve long standing debt issues as the joint venturers have as a collective goal to clear runhai of its debts this will put runhai and consequently the company on much more solid financial footing dr zhang the company s chairman and ceo commented our new joint venture offers new and greater opportunities for glg to access the domestic markets in china as well as to improve our company s balance sheet we are excited to partner with luxiang sugar and xiaogang health both ambitious companies excited to bring healthful products to our chinese populace runhai will continue producing products for glg s international customers through its active production facilities located in qingdao and anhui provinces serving glg s customers with high quality products remains a central focus for runhai and for glg the joint venture opportunity is entirely additive to the company s business plans 2022 agm voting results the company held its annual general meeting on june 17 2022 the shareholders voted in all nominated directors with favorable votes for each exceeding 99 dr luke zhang continues as chairman of the board and chief executive officer and brian palmieri continues as vice chairman of the board dr hong zhao guang opted not to run for election this year and is therefore no longer a director company outlook in recent quarters one of the most critical items that management has focused on and continues to focus on is the development and implementation of plans to stem the losses that the company has suffered in recent years and to ameliorate the company s financial position as a result of those sustained losses the company lacks the cash necessary to fully fund the business operations and its strategic product initiatives the company continues to manage its cash flows carefully to mitigate risk of insolvency as a result of these efforts management has been successful in improving the company s cash flows in recent quarters nevertheless without an infusion of cash in the months ahead the company may not be able to realize its strategic plans and could eventually cease to be a going concern to address that cash need management negotiated a cad 1 million revolving loan facility with a related party for working capital purposes in 2020 in 2020 management also realized the sale of one of its two idle assets the sale of the runhao facility resulted in significant debt reduction and better positions the company to be able to access additional lines of working capital management also continues to explore options for the sale or repurposing of its idle runyang primary processing facility in jiangsu province to further address its cash needs and balance sheet another factor that continues to contribute to the company s financial situation is the competitive price pressure in the stevia market over the last two years that has reduced mainstream reb a products such as reb a 80 and reb a 97 to the lowest price levels in years although pricing has begun to rise reflecting the increased cost of raw materials in the most recent harvest monk fruit prices have also become increasingly competitive in the marketplace to maintain margins at sustainable levels the company has focused on improving its production efficiencies continues to strive for a mix of products that is weighted more heavily on higher margin specialty products and has focused more on higher margin direct sales the company s focus on maintaining positive cash flow led the company to take decisive steps in 2021 to reduce its sg a costs as well as its production costs both its north american operations and chinese operations have significantly reduced sg a costs for the last several years the company s production capacity has been far greater than its projected order levels as it had sought rapid increases in orders for reb a products the company s aim continues to be to right size its chinese operations i e to optimize its staffing and production planning to meet the company s projected production requirements while retaining the ability to accommodate growth in future order volumes and management made significant progress in this area and continues striving to optimize staffing and production plans as a result this has enabled the company to sell its goods at more competitive and or more profitable prices although the competitive price pressures remain strong the company continues to explore options to significantly improve its balance sheet and cash flows whether through restructuring of debt or other opportunities for infusions of cash to address the debt load one of these options is taking shape as the company entered into a joint venture in china through its runhai subsidiary which has the potential to significantly increase revenues and overhaul the company s balance sheet the company also continues to explore options that may be complementary to the natural sweetener market where it could leverage its production expertise and equipment towards an investment that may help grow the company s revenues and improve its financial position while the company continues to face substantial risks management remains optimistic about the future opportunities for the company having closed the idle asset sale in 2020 and having successfully implemented right sizing efforts to manage costs having entered into the joint venture and continuing to optimize production efficiencies costs and planning management is proceeding down the best available path to increased financial stability and improved profitability selected financials as noted above the complete set of financial statements

as arizona democrat mark kelly hopes to win a full six year term in the u s senate this fall the co founder of the gun control group giffords is highlighting his support for things like abortion but isn t saying much at all about his embrace of an anti 2a ideology advertisement the u s senate race in arizona is going to be hugely important to both parties this fall republicans are hoping to flip the seat and may very well need to if the party is going to take over the senate or even hold steady at 50 members especially with candidates like dr oz trailing by double digits in pennsylvania we haven t seen any polling of the arizona senate race since the republican primary was held and blake masters won the gop nomination over a crowded field but the election is seen as a toss up by the cook political report in such a close race you d think that kelly would be all in on promoting gun control especially since democrats tell us their ideas are so popular but you ll find little mention of the issue on kelly s campaign website and the candidate himself isn t talking about the issue in his campaign ads the only mention of gun control i could find on kelly s campaign website is in his brief biography and even that takes pains not to portray his activism as gun control mark and his wife gabby made their permanent home in arizona in 2012 after he left nasa and retired from the navy and she resigned from congress to focus on her rehabilitation and recovery mark s daughter claire recently graduated from arizona state university and his oldest daughter claudia lives in tucson in january 2013 in the wake of the tragic shooting at sandy hook elementary school mark and gabby co founded the organization giffords which unites veterans law enforcement officials gun owners faith leaders and americans of all stripes to reduce gun violence and make our communities safer advertisement kelly s campaign site doesn t feature an issues section but it does have all of his campaign press releases archived interestingly kelly s campaign said nothing at all about the passage of the bipartisan safer communities act earlier this summer even though he voted for the bill which many democrats and the anti gun media were quick to call the first meaningful gun control law approved in decades while you won t find any reference to the gun control bill kelly s campaign has repeatedly touted his support for abortion rights so it s not like he s running away from every controversial issue the second amendment and gun control is a very notable exception one that even non 2a advocates like myself have noticed in late june the atlantic ran a big feature on the surprising voice missing from gun control talks and explored some theories about why kelly hasn t been an outspoken gun control advocate during his time in the senate including the recent negotiations on the senate s gun deal one is that because sinema has more seniority than kelly in the senate he would likely defer to her as a negotiator particularly given her deeper relationships with republicans needed for a deal aides to kelly said that he had kept in touch with fellow senators throughout the talks but noted that despite his years of advocacy outside congress most of the other negotiators had more experience navigating the issue within the thorny political dynamics of the senate a more delicate explanation is that kelly s presence at the bargaining table during an election year might have hurt the chances for an agreement more than they would have helped none of the four main negotiators murphy sinema and republican senators john cornyn of texas and thom tillis of north carolina is up for reelection this year nor are most of the 20 senators who initially endorsed the deal democrats believe that republicans would have been more reluctant to sign on if they saw the negotiation as an effort to boost kelly a top gop target this fall kelly s arm s length approach to gun control is also consistent with how he s handled the issue since he became a politician according to democrats who have worked with him despite his biography and experience he deliberately did not make the issue a centerpiece of his 2020 campaign nor has he made it a signature issue as a senator he s made more national headlines breaking with the biden administration on southern border policy and touting legislation to ban members of congress from trading stocks than he has in championing gun control during the 2020 campaign kelly and his advisers reasoned that voters were already well aware of where he stood on gun violence chase hardin a former kelly aide told me so they decided to focus instead on economic issues like job creation and lowering prescription drug costs where his views were less widely known on guns hardin said he almost didn t have to say anything advertisement he didn t have to say anything because as the atlantic points out republican martha mcsally didn t bring up gun control until the final few weeks of the election and when she did finally introduce the topic during their last debate she didn t do a great job of focusing on kelly s views on gun control and instead tried to go after the gun control group he co founded with his wife as i wrote at the time as the co founder of the gun control group that bears his wife s name mark kelly has a record in support of all kinds of ridiculous gun control laws but mcsally used his ties to the giffords gun control organization as a way to attach him to far left democrats like ilhan omar rather than delving into the policies that giffords has been advocating for most voters in arizona don t care about the congresswoman from minnesota and i suspect that trying to tie kelly to omar likely fell flat as an attack on the democratic candidate a much more effective approach would have been to acknowledge the personal stakes for mark kelly in pushing gun control while pointing out that kelly s gun control group is out of step with most arizonans for instance earlier this year giffords gave california s gun control laws an a rating while giving arizona a big fat f mcsally could have followed up with something like mark kelly may love california s gun control laws but we here in arizona feel differently in fact many of you probably know someone who left california and moved here because of how screwy their laws are if mark kelly wants to live in a place with 10 day waiting periods on gun purchases criminalizes the possession of semi automatic rifles and 20 round magazines and has a concealed carry process that allows local sheriffs to deprive almost everyone except for campaign donors of their right to bear arms he should move there instead of trying to impose california s gun control laws on every gun owner in arizona and the rest of america advertisement mcsally was a lackluster candidate in general but the way she approached the gun control issue was just plain dumb thankfully i don t expect blake masters to make those same mistakes especially since he s familiar enough with guns to build his own masters doesn t have to go after kelly for co founding giffords or wanting to make our communities safer a goal that gun owners share as well after all in order to point out the problems with trying to improve public safety by criminalizing the exercise of a fundamental individual right masters can start with the democrats ban on assault weapons that passed out of the house earlier this month as well as the post bruen gun control laws put in place in blue states like california and new york before reminding voters that even if kelly doesn t talk about it much these are the types of laws he believes arizona voters and every other law abiding gun owner across the land should have to live under as well

nationwide higher poverty schools were more likely to go remote the authors of that analysis concluded and suffered larger declines when they did so similarly schools with larger populations of black and latino students were also more likely to remain virtual for longer leading to a widening of racial gaps carvalho s nod to the palatability of the discussion of students academic performance hints at a deeper unease among educators many bristle at the term learning loss arguing that urgent attempts to help students gain ground could backfire if students take to heart the idea that their current performance on standardized tests already an imperfect measure of their academic performance is a predictor of their future potential david zuniga took a break from kindergarten orientation to see to his youngest daughter mariana dale laist students who have experienced the most trauma and disconnection during the pandemic may be assigned to the lowest level and most stigmatized groups children having been told that they are behind will internalize the story of their loss wrote ron berger head of an education non profit and a former teacher in the atlantic last year glimmers of hope there are some glimmers of hope amid the grim data a brief from the testing and research consortium nwea arrived at similar conclusions as the analysis kane co authored lower income students slipped even further behind their more affluent peers especially in math during the first full year after covid s onset 2020 21 most students lagged behind where we might expect them to be absent the pandemic s disruption but in 2021 22 nwea also found evidence that elementary students are starting to catch up if the rate of change we observe this year continues authors megan kuhfeld and karyn lewis wrote we can expect that it will take the average elementary school student at least three years to fully recover my thinking is if we have this money while it lasts it should go directly to the kids oliver ramirez principal korenstein elementary school unfortunately nwea also found older students appear to be rebounding more slowly which is troubling since as chalkbeat pointed out these students have less time remaining in their k 12 careers in july lausd board members approved more than 1 billion in strategic investments that district leaders hope will direct help to students most in need of assistance the funds will pay to add four extra somewhat optional days to the upcoming school year expand tutoring programs and extracurricular activities and target additional flexible funding to high need schools we need and we will have robust services and supports available at our schools said board president kelly gonez whether that s more on campus to help support mental health needs socio emotional learning programs in the classroom but also more academic supports like tutoring gonez said lausd also wants to lean into offerings that ensure students actually enjoy coming to school dual language programs enrichment programs extracurricular activities arts and music that s where the promise of bringing back the joy really comes into play korenstein elementary principal oliver ramirez said dozens of students signed up for new afterschool enrichment programs last year including ballroom dancing theater art and soccer my thinking is if we have this money while it lasts it should go directly to the kids ramirez said i m looking forward to discovering what i m good at as the bright yellow school bus glided through arleta ferrying nicolas ticas toward his first day of a new school year the fifth grader took stock of all the strangeness of his years in elementary school that detour through distance learning in the middle of his elementary career not the greatest learning was harder for people just going on your computer for like three hours nicolas remembered the blue light from the screen would hurt his eyes being confined to virtual classes hampered his grades during the pandemic they were worse he said and when i went back to school they were a lot better nicolas is looking forward to returning to a group of friends and a routine of learning in person that suits him much better you re more active instead of just sitting at a desk while much of the data and discourse about learning loss can feel abstract nicolas is one of the many students who can personally testify to the feeling that they slipped academically if only temporarily during the campus lockdowns i struggled with the computers plummer elementary sixth grader lissett abad recalled of distance learning i prefer paper tk and kindergarten students color on their first day of school in beverly felix s class at korenstein elementary i want them to right away get into the idea or the concept that it s ok to talk about our feelings felix said mariana dale laist felix said the activity also shows her an example of the students fine motor skills such as they can hold a pencil and whether they know how to write their own name mariana dale laist but lissett credits the supportive teachers at plummer with helping her improve once she returned to campus i m looking forward to discovering what i m good at this year she said when the pandemic began lorena gonzalez s daughter only spoke spanish the lockdowns began during her year in transitional kindergarten and she worries that she fell behind but now she is doing better gonzalez reported as she dropped off her daughter now in second grade at melvin avenue elementary on monday when she started school she didn t know how to speak english but now she can i hope this year she can improve her overall literacy david zuniga the parent of an incoming kindergartener is less concerned about the pandemic s effect on his daughter s progress last year she had the help of a friendly pre k teacher at korenstein elementary in north hollywood hopefully this year she has another teacher just like that zuniga said because she was happy to learn happy to come to school every day as he soothed a younger fussier 9 month old during an orientation for his kindergarten aged daughter zuniga looked ahead to both of their academic careers i hope opens doors for them he said and they take advantage of the opportunities she has mariana dale and gillian moran pérez contributed reporting to this story

article to print this article all you need is to be registered or login on mondaq com non fungible tokens nfts emerged as a cultural response to create technical scarcity on the internet developing new types of digital goods or virtual assets and more than that new alternatives to transfer properties online these virtual assets have been drawing attention worldwide mainly due to the high purchase prices of the nfts for instance beeple sold the everydays the first 5000 days nft for 69m at christie s 1 positioning the artist among the top three most valuable living artists in the world and the cheapest available bored ape yacht club nft for sale one of the most well known nfts nowadays which is listed at a record eth 152 or about 429 000 2 thus the surge in nfts collectibles is still fairly new but significant amounts of money have already exchanged hands among collectors3 amounting to over 6 2bn in sales since 2017 according to nonfungible4 which tracks historical sales data of nfts under this scenario the objectives of this brief article are to 1 suggest a definition of an nft considering the two constitutive characteristics of this kind of virtual asset 2 present the main legal impacts stemming from the very concept of nfts and 3 indicate the regulatory scenario both present and future involving nfts according to the brazilian legal landscape perspective it should be highlighted that as a virtual asset nfts are not equivalent to the securities typically subject to regulation by legal systems it is precisely in this context that nfts emerge starting with item 1 as to the definition of nfts for didactic purposes the suggested definition is to be presented by discussing at first the idea of in fungibility and second that of tokens to put it simply a fungible good is one that can be replaced by another of the same kind quality and quantity with that the idea of fungible goods is directly related to goods that can be contracted acquired without any prior specification of specialty or that can be substituted by another identical good similarly one can speak of mutually interchangeable goods as is the case of money and cryptocurrencies themselves eg dodgecoin bitcoin etc because they are all goods that although corresponding to different values can be cumulated and substituted in different ways without affecting their kind quality and quantity logically a non fungible asset can be considered the opposite in other words the idea of a non fungible asset is that it cannot be replaced by another of the same kind quantity and quality this is exactly the first fundamental characteristic of nft that is it corresponds to a virtual asset that cannot be replaced by another without consequently affecting its quality and quantity once an asset is coined on the blockchain as an nft the result is that it becomes irreplaceable as a result of the non fungibility and consequently scarce the token on the other hand is a digital certificate stored in a database called blockchain it is a digital representation of a real asset whose financial value depends on what it represents and the eventual future appreciation this is the reason tokens may come to fit into the concept of securities regulated in brazil by the brazilian securities and exchange commission and law no 6 385 1976 moreover unlike cryptocurrencies the token does not need its own blockchain unlike cryptocurrencies and can be used for several purposes therefore the token represents a digital asset issued by an entity and tradable that can be offered to investors during a public or private offering to create and record the distribution of tokens called initial coin offering ico or initial token offer ito due to the versatility of the use of tokens the swiss financial market supervisory authority finma 5categorises tokens into three types but hybrid forms are possible these are i payment tokens ii utility tokens and iii asset tokens summing up the two essential characteristics related to nft and presented above the suggested concept of nft is that this kind of virtual asset is a digital collectible unique scarce durable and extensible corresponding to the digitally authenticated version of the asset now non fungible through the attribution of digital registration of ownership since the nft has a unique identification code private key and metadata that distinguishes one nft from any other on the blockchain in addition nfts are secured by metamask which is a secure identity vault that provides a user interface to manage their identities across different sites and sign blockchain transactions despite that it so happens that like any technology nfts legally impact a series of issues of the most diverse natures precisely because of their disruptive nature with that in mind continuing with item 2 above the legal impacts stemming from the very concept of nft affect horizontally the legal scenario but most specifically intellectual property ip and data protection from the ip perspective among the most important aspects to be considered when discussing nfts are copyrights considering the nft is just a representation of the underlying work and not the work itself as a result the sale of an nft does not provide the buyer with the copyright to the work it signifies rather when someone purchases a piece of digital art in the form of an nft the buyer merely obtains ownership over an authentic copy of the art the ip rights in the said art remain with the creator or the artist behind the project 6 adding to that another problem is that blockchain can protect and ensure purity of the data once it is stored on it but if the data in itself is something infringing for example in case a given person decides to copy another artist s work and makes nfts based on that original work without prior authorisation enforcing copyright laws and principles on nfts may prove difficult trademarks are also significantly affected by nfts and this very controversy is represented in the lawsuit7 filed by hermès against mason rothschild with the southern district court of new york on 14 january 2022 citing multiple causes including trademark infringement and dilution in this case mason rothschild has openly acknowledged that it elected to sell its nfts as metabirkins because a birkin handbag is a highly valuable asset in the physical world 8 under the data protection standpoint data protection legislations including the brazilian general data protection law law no 13 709 2018 or the lgpd are based on the assumption arising from the maxim of informational self determination that personal data can be corrected modified or deleted whenever requested by the data subject in contrast the nature of blockchain makes it impossible to unilaterally modify data to ensure the integrity of recorded data and increase trust in the network in addition to the challenges of enforcing data anonymisation and purpose limitation requirements this means that the use of blockchain potentially violates the lgpd in this regard as it makes it impossible to fulfill the rights of data subjects the legal implications of the growing adoption of nfts worldwide justify the discussion regarding how to regulate this virtual asset yet regulation in this area faces several obstacles including essentially the difficulty of defining the legal nature of nfts that is the lack of consensus as to whether an nft shall be classified as a commodity or as a financial asset additionally the absence of a central authority to manage the blockchain and to provide assurance to users including the confirmation of transactions and provision of redress mechanisms also can be argued as a difficulty to the regulatory process as does the global nature of the blockchain that is should regulators engage in the effort to design a global regulation to avoid law shopping and regulatory arbitrage either way the fact is decentralisation and the possibility to easily transfer values worldwide are the very competitive advantages of the nft itself and of course of the distributed ledger technology dlt given these challenges moving to the objective of this article point 2 above the regulatory experience observed in brazil very much mirrors the discussions held in the united states and in the european union yet brazil is still in the early stages of regulating virtual assets notwithstanding the country already has important rules in place as indicated further below the copyright law law no 9 610 1998 provides that the author owns the moral and economic rights in the work he she created in other words considering the nature of the nfts the virtual non fungible asset under the brazilian legislation integrates the reproduction of the work with a digital signature of the author and rules pre programmed by the creator cvm circular letter no 1 2018 establishes that in some cases crypto assets can be characterised as securities when they grant the owner participation partnership remuneration or voting rights in a company circular letter sei no 4 081 2020 of the special secretariat for debureaucratization management and digital government ministry of economy ensures that the boards of trade can register the payment of corporate capital with cryptocurrencies and crypto assets eg nfts brazilian federal revenue rfb normative instruction no 1888 2019 provides that transactions carried out in environments made available by crypto exchanges domiciled in brazil must be reported to the rfb by the exchanges themselves with no value limit in addition the normative instruction foresees the mandatory provision of information regarding transactions carried out with crypto products to the rfb it is noteworthy finally that on 26 april 2022 the senate plenary approved in a symbolic vote amendment no 6 a substitute to law bill n 4 401 2021 aimed at regulating the national cryptocurrency market in brazil this proposal provides guidelines for the provision of virtual assets regulates the exercise of companies providing these services and brings measures to combat money laundering and its penalties the bill now returns to the house of representatives for analysis and if approved will be submitted to the president for sanction beyond that the bill brought the definition of virtual assets which shall thereafter be understood as digital representation of value that can be traded or transferred by electronic means and used to make payments or for investment purposes the definition does not apply to traditional national currencies and assets previously regulated by law still on this subject among other obligations the law bill foresees an obligation to the executive branch to indicate a federal public administration body responsible for establishing the financial assets that will be regulated by the future law as well as the need to control and segregate clients funds ten per cent of the world s gross domestic product gdp is stored by blockchain technology on the premise that blockchain is a way to keep track of reliable transactions in a distributed manner 9 but this technology is not all about potentially negative impacts among the positive impacts of blockchain are increased financial inclusion in emerging markets as financial services gain critical mass on the blockchain the disintermediation of financial institutions the explosion in tradable assets as all types of exchange value can be hosted on the blockchain better property records in emerging markets and the ability to turn anything into a tradable asset and increased transparency because the blockchain is essentially a global ledger that stores all transactions therefore this article concludes in the sense that nfts and more specifically blockchain due to their disruptive nature even though they have several positive aspects to be taken into account significantly affect ip rights and data protection this proves that the regulatory perspectives must necessarily take into account the fundamental principles that govern the economic order in brazil without slowing down the technology whilst simultaneously ensuring legal certainty for investors and users of this new technology especially in the metaverse footnotes 1 available at www theverge com 2021 3 11 22325054 beeple christies

over the past two and a half years we ve seen unparalleled innovation and private public collaboration in the global fight against covid 19 the rapid development and roll out of new vaccines diagnostic tests and therapeutics have saved millions of lives however these developments have not benefited everyone equally although more than 67 percent of the global population has received at least one dose of the covid 19 vaccine disparities between the higher and lower income countries are wide as of may 72 percent of people in high income countries have received one dose compared to 18 percent in low income countries according to the undp s global dashboard for vaccine equity this disparity is a pattern that extends across the three most critical medical countermeasures against the pandemic vaccines tests and therapeutics while high income countries have conducted 42 tests for every 1 000 people per day in may low income countries have conducted just 1 95 tests for every 1 000 people according to the global covid 19 access tracker the use of therapeutics while limited across the globe is almost non existent in poorer countries in fact equity is not just a moral imperative it safeguards our collective global health the emergence of the delta and omicron variants saw the virus running unabated in low income countries and quickly spreading to the rest of the world unless we take bold steps to change how we produce and allocate these life saving tools on a global scale we risk repeating the same mistakes in the future rethinking health supply chains meanwhile the markets for vaccines tests and therapeutics are fragile the emergence of a new disease or variant in one area of the world can upend demand and supply in another in order to be more prepared for the next global health emergency we must design supply chains that are built to cope with demand uncertainty and balance effectiveness with equity in may the united states co hosted the second global covid 19 summit to increase global access to vaccines tests and treatments while building preparedness for future health emergencies the summit yielded us 3 2 billion in financial commitments from public private and nonprofit organisations and contributed to the new pandemic financing fund this week at the 75th world health assembly creating a new architecture for health emergency preparedness response and resilience is one of the five priorities to achieve health for peace peace for health however financial pledges and aspirational goals aren t enough vaccines tests and therapeutics require hundreds of inputs produced in countries across the globe therefore we need a global governance structure to oversee the flow of these critical medical supplies but coordination is easier said than done now we must get three components of the supply chain right better sharing of market risks across public and private actors flexibility in manufacturing to allow timely change in product mix and geographical diversity of production facilities for global supply resilience better sharing of market risks typically vaccines therapeutics and diagnostic tests are developed by private companies with private capital and government funding for upstream research setting up large production plants however requires additional investments which may not be as forthcoming when demand is highly uncertain incentives between private companies governments and international organisations have to be aligned to maximise production and ensure sustainable supply to put it simply private companies are unlikely to produce billions of medical supplies when demand can change any moment therefore governments and multilateral organisations must pay producers to take on risks for the benefit of all how through advance purchase agreements that guarantee a minimum order over a defined time period regardless of market demand while some governments implemented advance contracts for vaccines they had not done so with diagnostics and therapeutics for example last fall in the us as hopes soared for a return to normal life mass testing and vaccinations sites closed but when omicron hit self test kits went out of stock and test centre appointments were filled to capacity when president joe biden announced that the government would purchase one billion rapid tests to distribute for free to americans manufacturers could not ramp up production fast enough similarly the demand and supply for the oral antivirals paxlovid and molnupiravir have been volatile alternating between low supply or sufficient supply but limited demand this mismatch between supply and demand could have been avoided had the government shared the risks of demand uncertainty this problem is amplified in lower income countries that lack the financial reserves for advance purchase contracts with a diversity of manufacturers when demand surged they found themselves at the end of the queue ultimately we cannot ignore how market mechanisms work supply is allocated to larger markets with paying power not necessarily markets with the greatest need therefore like covax s advance vaccines contracts for low income countries we need similar risk sharing structures for diagnostics and therapeutics sustainable production decisions product mix and location while there is significant interest in establishing new manufacturing facilities in africa and regions where the production of vaccines diagnostics and therapeutics is currently limited we must design new production sites for long term sustainability the build and decay problem has plagued many public private investments in lower income countries unfortunately it is a common story in development finance a production plant that s heralded to revolutionise local industry lies empty or risks closure years later because it takes two to five years to build new manufacturing plants with the relevant technologies market conditions would have changed by the time production begins if designs are not future proofed to pivot as needed millions of dollars risk being wasted which makes it less likely that investors will finance similar projects in the future as a result the world is not any better prepared for the next health emergency the good news is that we can avoid this grim trajectory by changing how we make production decisions in a global health context the two crucial and interconnected questions are which products should we make and where building flexibility based on the known unknowns new manufacturing plants cannot focus solely on the current market needs for covid 19 medical supplies but must also increase world resilience the best path for emergency preparedness is to build plants for maximum production flexibility in anticipation of future needs like vaccines for sars viruses influenza or unknown endemic diseases this requires agile decision making as well as choosing a plant and equipment that are highly flexible to determine the degree of flexibility required for example should a plant manufacture mrna protein subunit vaccine or both producers must identify where the most uncertainty lies in the market an optimal product mix protects against these unknowns however flexibility is neither infinite nor cheap building a plant with the flexibiliy to pivot production to manufacture different products requires around 25 percent more capital and operating costs than one with fixed products the design of the production facility should build in the maximum flexibility that investors can afford the optimal plant location is equally critical our models reveal that plants in countries with small populations and good logistics like senegal and singapore will increase global emergency preparedness flexible production plants in countries like these can manufacture for domestic markets and also export the surplus when global demand spikes invest in resilience thankfully we are seeing progress in senegal the institute pasteur de dakar is building a us 200 million regional hub for vaccine manufacturing parts of which will become operational in the latter half of 2022 the plant will not only produce covid 19 vaccines but is designed to manufacture a range of vaccines and biological products depending on market needs this is made possible with modular and flexible manufacturing equipment sceptics may argue that production based in senegal cannot be as large or efficient as those based in low cost india or china they are right technical talent and ecosystems are only starting to emerge so input costs can be up to 25 percent higher than in other regions but it is worth it this increased cost which i call a resilience premium benefits all of us it is a sound investment for multilateral organisations and high income countries because resources can be redirected to fit for purpose products that match market needs across the globe in an equitable way it will also make our overall system resilient against localised epidemics or global pandemics the best time for building a sustainable supply chain for life savings tools against health emergencies is between pandemics although covid 19 is still simmering we are no longer in acute crisis mode the time to build is now

with the climate disaster upon us many are revisiting the seminal work of a pioneer in the field of sustainability insead technology management and economics professor robert bob ayres ayres is considered one of the fathers of industrial ecology the study of the flows of materials and energy in industrial and consumer activities his noteworthy contributions over the past half century have linked economics and the physical sciences to shine a light on the fundamental role energy plays in our economies on 29 june insead celebrated ayres s 90th birthday by hosting a conference in recognition of his life s work among the attendees were several of the 15 renowned academics who have supported ayres s nomination for a nobel prize in economic sciences ayres s extensive research underlines the importance of energy as a major driver for the economy since the 1960s he has ceaselessly warned that standard economic models misrepresent and underestimate the role of energy in the economy and its growth and on associated environmental and climate impacts his work demonstrates that our economic and political systems have paid insufficient attention to the physical by products of consumption and production including pollutive waste and emissions this oversight including the lack of attention paid to minimising the physical consequences of economic activities has fuelled the current environmental crisis ayres s findings and warnings even though published in prestigious economic journals were not truly heard nor sufficiently integrated in mainstream economic thinking in celebration of ayres s 90th year we take a closer look at some of his fundamental observations energy makes the world go around for decades ayres has stressed that energy is uniquely necessary for any useful work to be done and therefore a fundamental prerequisite for any economic activity ayres sees energy as the single important driver of the overall economy without energy he argues labour and capital cannot produce anything one of ayres s mentees and co authors professor steve keen summed this up at the bob 90 conference with a metaphor labour without energy is a corpse capital without energy is a sculpture or more simply a human without food or a machine without fuel cannot do any useful work mainstream economic models regard useful energy as a product or an intermediate good created by an accumulation of capital and labour this results in capital and labour being credited with almost all the value added in the economy while the role of energy and its value add are marginalised to address this error ayres introduces the thermodynamic concept of exergy the share of energy flows that can be put to productive use ayres argues in line with other towering figures such as nicholas georgescu roegen and herman daly that economics must account for the first law of thermodynamics this law states that energy transforms into different forms but is neither created nor destroyed by human activity ayres s unique contribution was to calculate exergy measurements to arrive at a better understanding of material cycles such as carbon nitrate and phosphorus that are fundamental to life on earth and thus obtain an improved understanding of the true economic value of energy and resources based on such an approach ayres and benjamin warr were able to explain the solow residual the portion of economic growth that could not be attributed in solow s original growth model to increasing inputs of capital stock and labour supply over time they concluded that the increasing use of energy was the missing explanatory factor that contributed to higher growth higher productivity as well as a more complex economy distinguishing useful energy from wasted energy from a thermodynamic perspective energy consists of the sum of two components a useful component exergy and a non useful component anergy in every action or transformation a fraction of exergy is converted to anergy but the sum total remains the same energy is thus not destroyed but becomes less useful after every interaction in the global system whether carried out by humans or not economists tend to think of markets as places where certain exchange interactions such as buying and selling occur each party supposedly becomes better off after the exchange if it is voluntary in theory exchanges like that do not affect other actors but in the real world third parties can be affected leaving them better or worse off these unintended consequences are called externalities examples of externalities include the dissipation of toxic waste materials pollutants into the environment or the spread of an infectious disease like covid 19 ayres first sounded the alarm on these harmful by products of production and consumption more than 50 years ago in a widely cited article in the american economic review entitled production consumption and externalities together with co author allen kneese ayres pointed out that economic models of physical processes cannot neglect the physical characteristics of materials and transformation processes the models need to be opened up to fully account for the material flows associated with economic activity in his work on material cycles ayres relies on mass balance techniques to trace the flow of materials in the environment the method estimates emissions by calculating the difference between known material inputs into the process and its useful material outputs one of ayres s landmark studies applied this technique to calculate pollution levels in the hudson raritan basin on the east coast of the united states ayres used agricultural and industrial production data to reconstruct the accumulation of pollution in the basin this conclusively demonstrated that pollution levels were much higher than previously estimated through spot checks this work inspired similar studies in river basins around the world resulting in significant policy changes the efficient use of resources one of ayres s early contributions was a book published in 1972 about alternative technologies including electrical propulsion as future substitutes for internal combustion engines ayres observed that the energy from fossil fuels converted into the powertrain of an ordinary car was extremely inefficient yet the auto industry and society in general accepted this waste as normal it is only recently that the industry has taken on board his observations by greatly improving the efficiency of thermic engines and making a radical shift to electric cars more recently ayres in collaboration with eric williams demonstrated the high inefficiencies involved in the manufacturing of semiconductor devices which are now part of even the most basic industrial products they found that geologically scarce metals such as rare earths are being recklessly used up without any recovery or recycling this he notes is just one example of an unsustainable and increasingly complex manufacturing process that requires plenty of energy and generates considerable byproducts ayres makes clear that the more complex the economy becomes the greater the risk of it becoming unsustainable reversing these trends is the major challenge facing our planet today applying ayres s insights on exergy and material flows will be crucial in guiding current environmental and economic policies towards a more sustainable future reid lifset honorary member yale school of the environment jeroen van den bergh and gara villalba mendez institute of environmental science and

accounting policies the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and income and expenses during the periods reported actual results could materially differ from those estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies class a common stock subject to possible redemption we account for class a common stock subject to possible redemption in accordance with the guidance in accounting standards codification asc topic 480 distinguishing liabilities from equity class a common stock subject to mandatory redemption is classified as a liability instrument and is measured at fair value conditionally redeemable class a common stock including class a common stock that features redemption rights that are either within the control of the holder or subject to redemption upon the occurrence of uncertain events not solely within our control is classified as temporary equity at all other times class a common stock is classified as stockholders deficit our class a common stock features certain redemption rights that are considered to be outside of our control and subject to occurrence of uncertain future events accordingly class a common stock subject to possible redemption is presented at redemption value as temporary equity outside of the stockholders deficit section of our condensed balance sheets derivative warrant liabilities we do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow market or foreign currency risks we evaluate all of the company s financial instruments including issued stock purchase warrants to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives pursuant to asc 480 and asc 815 15 the classification of derivative instruments including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity is re assessed at the end of each reporting period we account for our 11 796 667 common stock warrants issued in connection with our initial public offering 11 500 000 and placement warrants 296 667 as derivative warrant liabilities in accordance with asc 815 40 accordingly we recognize the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period the liabilities are subject to re measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised and any change in fair value is recognized in our unaudited condensed statements of operations the fair value of placement warrants issued by us in connection with our initial public offering and private placement has been estimated using monte carlo simulations at each measurement date the fair value of public warrants issued with our initial public offering was initially measured using monte carlo simulations and then measured based trading price once they commenced trading on march 29 2021 25 offering costs associated with the initial public offering we allocated in accordance with the requirements of the asc 340 10 s99 1 and sec staff accounting bulletin sab topic 5a expenses of offering offering costs consist principally of professional and registration fees incurred through the balance sheet date that are related to the initial public offering we allocated the offering costs between common stock and public warrants using the relative fair value method the offering costs allocated to the public warrants will be expensed immediately and offering costs allocated to common stock were charged to temporary equity upon the completion of our initial public offering net income loss per share of common stock we compute net income loss per common stock by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding for the period we have two classes of shares which are referred to as class a common stock and class b common stock income and losses are shared pro rata between the two classes of shares this presentation assumes an initial business combination as the most likely outcome accretion associated with the redeemable shares of class a common stock is excluded from earnings per share as the redemption value approximates

retrospective basis with early adoption permitted beginning on january 1 2021 the company is reviewing the impact adoption would have if any on its financial statements management does not believe that any other recently issued but not yet effective accounting pronouncements if currently adopted would have a material effect on our unaudited condensed financial statements factors that may adversely affect our results of operations our results of operations and our ability to complete an initial business combination may be adversely affected by various factors that could cause economic uncertainty and volatility in the financial markets many of which are beyond our control our business could be impacted by among other things downturns in the financial markets or in economic conditions increases in oil prices inflation increases in interest rates supply chain disruptions declines in consumer confidence and spending the ongoing effects of the covid 19 pandemic including resurgences and the emergence of new variants and geopolitical instability such as the military conflict in the ukraine we cannot at this time fully predict the likelihood of one or more of the above events their duration or magnitude or the extent to which they may negatively impact our business and our ability to complete an initial business combination

million in second quarter of 2021 as invested assets grew to 1 2 billion as of june 30 2022 compared with 834 5 million as of june 30 2021 this increase was offset by a decline in the market value of derivatives annuity direct written premium under statutory accounting principles sap a non gaap measure was 156 0 million up 59 compared to 98 1 million in first quarter of 2022 and up from 125 9 million in 2021 s second quarter the mix of our new business was 45 multi year guaranteed annuities myga and 55 fixed indexed annuities fia ceded premiums sap were 59 9 million compared with 86 1 million in the year earlier quarter the cession rate or that portion of our written premiums that we reinsured was 38 4 compared with 68 4 total expenses benefited from negative interest credited due to the fall in value of the options embedded in our liabilities and the gain on mark to market value of the options allowance classified in other operating expenses georgette nicholas ceo of midwest noted we are seeing strong results from the actions we took in the first quarter to position the company for growth relating to distribution pricing products investment management and reinsurance we are investing in technology and foundational capabilities to strengthen the business we saw strong trends in premiums written in the second quarter we are benefiting from movements in interest rates as consumers seek stable returns and from the performance of our investment portfolio overall the second quarter showed very positive trends and positioned us for a strong start to the third quarter

per share loss reported in the second quarter of 2021 investment income in 2022 s second quarter was 10 5 million compared with 3 2 million in the prior year s second quarter driving the change was an increase in invested assets as well as performance on those assets benefiting from core capabilities developed around sourcing assets with a higher yield generating approximately a 5 5 return on the investment portfolio amortization of deferred gain on reinsurance reached 1 0 million in the second quarter of 2022 compared with 588 000 in the second quarter of 2021 primarily due to growth in the deferred gain on co insurance on our balance sheet which reflects ceding commissions received on reinsurance of business to third parties service fee revenue was 416 000 versus 672 000 in the prior year second quarter service fee revenue consists of fee revenue generated for our asset management services provided to third party clients assets under management for third parties was 471 1 million on june 30 2022 compared to 455 4 million on march 31 2022 other revenue finished at 514 000 compared with 358 000 in the prior year quarter other revenue consists primarily of revenue we generate by providing ancillary services such as policy administration to third parties and policy surrender charges our total expenses on a gaap basis were a negative 1 4 million versus 13 1 million in the prior year second quarter total expenses were helped by negative interest credited due to the decrease in value of the options embedded in our liabilities of 2 0 million and an increase in mark to market value of our options allowance of 5 3 million salaries and benefits were 4 2 million in q2 2022 compared to 4 5 million in q2 2021 as we continue to seek operational improvement and work on technology initiatives guidance we continue to see intense competition in the fixed annuity market around pricing and new competitors we have taken actions to maintain a competitive position and have seen positive results from these actions and improved sales momentum in the second quarter with these positive trends and the premium written so far along with the backlog in process we have had a strong start to the third quarter state expansion efforts remain a key priority we have active applications in process and will provide updates as they progress given these dynamics we are confident in anticipated premiums written being in the range of 500 million to 600 million sap for the year we expect the mix in product sales to be 60 towards myga this year given increasing interest rates and market volatility and 40 fia we would expect that to move back towards 75 fia and 25 myga in future years the goal is to cede on average approximately 70 90 of our premium in the year to generate ceded commission fees and manage capital although currently we are running at approximately 40 timing of closing additional reinsurance deals can be delayed due to various factors and will vary quarter to quarter as new agreements are reached demand from our existing reinsurance partners is strong and we have capacity in place to cover anticipated written premium through them with the potential to grow along with additional potential reinsurance transactions in the pipeline we are making progress towards bringing general and administrative expenses on a management basis a non gaap

planning decisions regarding future operations 5 plan for and prepare future annual operating budgets and determine appropriate levels of operating investments and6 facilitate comparison of results between periods and to better understand the underlying historical trends in our business and prospects these non gaap measures are not a substitute for gaap measures however management believes that when used in conjunction with the gaap measures the non gaap measures can contribute to investors understanding of our business non gaap financial measures used by us may be calculated differently from and therefore may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies these non gaap financial measures should be considered along with but not as alternatives to our operating

the claim earth s oil supplies replenish more quickly than they are extracted oil forms when organic material the remains of living things gets compressed and heated under layers of sediment some social media users are claiming this process occurs as quickly as the substance can be extracted oil regenerates within the earth faster than it could ever be depleted reads a july 5 facebook post the post was shared more than 1 000 times in a month but it s wrong oil takes millions of years to form according to researchers conditions on modern earth do not support replenishment at the rate that it is being extracted follow us on facebook like our page to get updates throughout the day on our latest debunks usa today reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment oil is extracted much more quickly than it forms it takes millions of years for oil to form according to the energy information administration it won t replenish in a human lifetime jonathan redfern a professor and head of petroleum geoscience and basin studies at the university of manchester told usa today in an email many oil fields in the usa have been depleted for decades they haven t refilled the environmental conditions and organic material required to keep pace with contemporary oil extraction could not realistically be supplied by earth s ecosystems according to jeffery dukes a global ecology researcher at the carnegie institution for science in 2021 humans extracted about 32 8 billion barrels of oil worldwide according to a report by petroleum company bp because the creation of oil is a very inefficient geological process dukes estimates that 2 500 metric tons of organic material mostly phytoplankton is required to eventually form just a single barrel this means that even one year s worth of oil extraction represents a simply enormous amount of dead biological material if we were to try to generate oil the old fashioned way to replenish our stocks it would take roughly 750 years worth of all of the oceans phytoplankton production and also tens of millions of years to replenish this year s consumption alone said dukes additionally even if there were enough organic material available there would also have to be plenty of areas on earth with the right conditions to kick off the oil formation process to form oil you need regions with both highly productive phytoplankton and minimal decomposition said dukes areas like that were fairly widespread during some of the main periods of oil formation but today they are pretty rare fact check years old essay falsely claims bakken oil reserve can power us for 2 000 years alex demas a u s geological survey spokesperson also told usa today in an email that oil is not replenished as fast as it s extracted our rating false based on our research we rate false the claim that earth s oil supplies are replenished more quickly than they are extracted oil is not replenished as quickly as it is extracted according to multiple researchers and government agencies it takes millions of years for oil to form further the conditions on modern earth do not support oil replenishment at the contemporary rate of extraction our fact check sources thank you for supporting our journalism you can subscribe to our print edition ad free app or electronic newspaper replica here our fact check work is supported in part by a grant from facebook
atg 018 a global rights asset developed by antengene s internal r d team is an orally bioavailable small molecule ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 associated atr kinase inhibitor that targets the dna damage response ddr pathways the phase i study will evaluate the safety pharmacology and preliminary efficacy of atg 018 monotherapy in patients with advanced tumors and hematologic malignancies shanghai and hong kong aug 16 2022 prnewswire antengene corporation limited antengene sehk 6996 hk a leading innovative commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering developing and commercializing first in class and or best in class therapeutics in hematology and oncology today announced that the first patient has been dosed in the phase i atrium trial to evaluate atg 018 as a monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors and hematologic malignancies in australia the atrium trial is a phase i multi center open label dose finding study of atg 018 monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors or hematologic malignancies the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of atg 018 and to determine the maximum tolerated dose mtd and or recommended phase ii dose rp2d and or biologically effective dose of atg 018 monotherapy and preliminary efficacy if available the secondary objective is to characterize the pharmacology of atg 018 atg 018 is an orally available potent selective small molecule atr inhibitor atg 018 inhibits the atr kinase which limits cancer cells ability to repair damaged dna in a mechanism also known as synthetic lethality or the ddr in human cells a variety of repair mechanisms exist to maintain genomic integrity and defects in these pathways cause genome instability and promote tumorigenesis many cancer cells have high level replication stress and rely on their s g2 checkpoints for survival following dna damage this renders tumor cells more susceptible to inhibition of atr and targeting this may be a novel therapeutic strategy said dr jim coward chair of icon s medical oncology research committee and associate professor at university of queensland school of medicine atg 018 is an oral potent and selective inhibitor of atr preclinical studies have demonstrated potent activity against atr in enzyme inhibition assays and tumor cell lines including both solid tumors and hematological malignancies we are encouraged by these findings and eager to further evaluate the therapeutic potential of atg 018 for patients dr jay mei antengene s founder chairman and ceo said atg 018 is a novel in house discovered and developed drug candidate to enter the clinical stage i am very proud of the joint efforts from the teams at antengene and the clinical organizations to bring this compound to the clinical stage data on atg 018 presented at 2022 american association for cancer research aacr 2022 annual meeting showed that atg 018 has demonstrated promising single agent activity in a robust preclinical program that includes a wide range of tumor types that rely on ddr and have a need for new treatments in addition early work to identify a set of predictive biomarkers could enable atg 018 to be used as a precision medicine we will work closely with our investigators to advance this clinical program and strive to develop a new treatment option for patients around the world about atg 018 developed by the internal r d team at antengene atg 018 is an oral potent selective small molecule inhibitor targeting ataxia telangiectasia and rad3 associated atr kinase atr kinase belongs to the phosphoinositide 3 kinase related family inhibiting atr kinase leads to increased accumulation of single strand dna breaks particularly meaningful for tumor cells which rely on dna damage repair ddr preclinical studies have demonstrated that atr inhibitor monotherapy or combination with other drugs including ddr agents could be promising therapeutic strategies for solid tumors including gastric esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and hematologic malignancies chronic lymphocytic leukemia diffuse large b cell lymphoma and multiple myeloma according to a preclinical poster presented at 2022 american association for cancer research aacr 2022 annual meeting atg 018 has demonstrated potent in vitro and in vivo monotherapy efficacy in solid tumor hematologic cancer models with certain homologous recombination deficiencies these data were supported by a series of genetic alterations that correlated with atg 018 sensitivity and could be potential predictive biomarkers taken together these data suggest that atg 018 could be a promising therapeutic agent for patients with such homologous recombination deficiencies genetic alterations
