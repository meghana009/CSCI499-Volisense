that supplement our comments today as well as on the dow website on slide 2 you will see our agenda for the call jim will begin by reviewing our fourth quarter and full year highlights and operating segment performance howard will then share our outlook and modeling guidance and then jim will discuss how we will continue to execute on our priorities to deliver value growth following that we will take your questions now let me turn the call over to jim jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman thank you pankaj beginning with slide 3 in the fourth quarter dow once again delivered top and bottom line growth year over year with sales growth and margin expansion in every operating segment our results reflect the strength and resilience of our advantaged portfolio and the incredible efforts of the dow team as we continue to ensure well being and safety of our team and our communities we delivered year over year sales growth of 34 with gains in every operating segment business and region while volume declined 4 year over year due to supply constraints from several factors including our own maintenance lingering effects of weather related outages and global logistics challenges we continued to see robust underlying demand across our end markets particularly for higher margin downstream and sustainability led applications prices were up 39 year over year reflecting gains in all operating segments businesses and regions our discipline and agility enabled us to navigate the supply constraints and logistics challenges i just mentioned dual control actions in china and rising energy costs we delivered operating ebit growth of 1 2 billion year over year with margin expansion in every operating segment equity earnings were also up year over year with margin expansion at our joint ventures in saudi arabia thailand and kuwait these results translated into significant cash generation for the quarter with cash flow from operations of 2 6 billion up 901 million year over year and cash flow conversion of 88 and we returned 912 million to shareholders in the quarter including 512 million through our industry leading dividend and 400 million in share repurchases our performance in the fourth quarter capped a record year for dow which you will see highlighted on slide 4 in 2021 team dow capitalized on the economic recovery achieving record sales and earnings performance despite pandemic driven uncertainty and industrywide weather related challenges our focus on cash flow and disciplined capital allocation enabled us to continue to deliver on our financial priorities we achieved 7 1 billion of cash flow from operations bringing our total cash flow from operations since spin to 18 billion we enhanced our balance sheet by reducing gross debt by another 2 4 billion in the year bringing down gross debt by more than 5 billion since spin we have also no substantive debt maturities until 2026 we proactively funded our u s pension plans and successfully executed sadara s debt reprofiling lowering dow s guarantees by more than 2 billion dow has returned a total 7 3 billion to shareholders since spin through our dividend and share repurchases including 3 1 billion in 2021 and we kept capex well within d a as we continue to invest in our higher return and faster payback growth investments in 2021 we achieved a return on invested capital of greater than 22 on strong earnings growth as we turn the corner on the pandemic we do so with a strong balance sheet and a deliberate and disciplined strategy to decarbonize and grow we achieved this record financial performance in 2021 while advancing our esg leadership importantly we announced our disciplined strategy to decarbonize our assets while improving underlying ebitda by more than 3 billion as we capitalize on our participation in attractive high growth end markets and sustainability driven solutions our esg efforts continue to be recognized externally as we were recently recognized by just capital for the third year dow earns the top spot in the chemicals sector overall as well as the no 1 position in the workers and stakeholders in governance categories in the industry i m extremely proud of team dow s dedication to deliver for our customers and drive value for all of our stakeholders we will build on these achievements in 2022 as we advance our ambition moving to our operating segment performance for the fourth quarter on slide 5 in the packaging and specialty plastics segment operating ebit was 1 4 billion up 662 million year over year primarily due to margin improvement and partly offset by lower supply volumes sequentially operating ebit was down 512 million and operating ebit margins declined by 520 basis points on lower olefin and co product pricing combined with higher raw material costs and energy costs the packaging and specialty plastics business reported higher net sales year over year driven by price gains in all regions as well as in key applications such as flexible food industrial and consumer packaging volume declined year over year primarily in asia pacific due to supply constraints moving to the industrial intermediates and infrastructure segment operating ebit was 595 million up 299 million year over year primarily due to continued price strength sequentially operating ebit was down 118 million and operating ebit margins declined 280 basis points primarily driven by higher energy costs in europe and our planned maintenance turnaround activity the polyurethanes and construction chemicals business increased net sales compared to the year ago period on broad based price gains in all regions volume declines were primarily due to a planned transition away from a low margin co producer contract and our planned maintenance turnaround activity the industrial solutions business delivered a net sales improvement compared to the year ago period with local price gains in all regions volume was flat year over year as higher volume from a renewable energy contract was offset by fewer licensing and catalysts sales and finally the performance materials and coatings segment reported operating ebit of 295 million compared to 50 million in the year ago period as margins increased 900 basis points due to strong price momentum for silicones and coatings offerings sequentially operating ebid improved 11 million as price gains were partly offset by our planned maintenance turnaround activity the consumer solutions business achieved higher net sales year over year with local price gains in all regions and across end market applications volume declined as strong demand particularly for industrial electronics and personal care applications was offset by lower supply availability due to our own decision to pull forward maintenance activity to coincide with dual control actions in china the coatings and performance monomers business achieved increased net sales year over year as higher raw material costs and strong industry demand led to price gains in all regions volume declined as stronger demand for architectural coatings and industrial coatings primarily in the u s and canada was more than offset by lower merchant sales of acrylic monomers partly due to dow s own higher captive use i ll now turn it over to howard to review our outlook and modeling guidance howard ungerleider president and chief financial officer thank you jim and good morning everyone turning to slide 6 our diversified portfolio continues to enable us to capitalize on attractive end market trends with higher margin downstream products our four primary market verticals are each growing at rates of 1 3 to 1 5 times gdp and benefiting from sustainability macro trends we are meeting this demand with higher margin solutions such as functional polymers alkoxylates surfactants polyurethane systems sustainable coatings and performance silicones in the packaging vertical demand for lower carbon emissions recyclable and circular materials are driving demand for dow s industry leading plastics portfolio and in house application design capabilities dow s broad suite of products and hybrid innovations targeting infrastructure will continue to benefit from government investments and incentives with particular demand resiliency in the americas europe as well as in the middle east africa and india we see global demand across the diverse consumer market vertical remaining at elevated levels particularly for applications like electronics 5g appliances pharma and home care where several of dow s growth investments are targeted and in mobility dow s portfolio of specialty silicones polyurethanes and elastomers is uniquely positioned to benefit from growing electric and autonomous vehicle trends importantly these attractive market verticals are supported by favorable balances across our key value chains with continued strength across consumer and industrial end markets which we ll see on slide 7 we expect the economic recovery to continue as forecasts call for above historical average global gdp growth in 2022 while the omicron variant has resulted in some near term disruption we do not expect it to materially change the current recovery path particularly as global immunization levels and treatment options continue to increase several factors support continued strength across our end markets consumer balance sheets remain healthy with significant pent up demand driven by more than 5 trillion in additional savings accumulated through the pandemic manufacturing growth is expected to remain robust supported by increasing investments in infrastructure and accelerated adoption for 5g ev and sustainability trends and with retail inventories remaining low and backlogs elevated easing supply chain issues should unleash additional volume growth in 2022 as manufacturing activity increases to meet strong consumer demand this will certainly be a focus for dow as we work closely with our customers to fill order backlogs and replenish inventories to meet the robust demand and increased service levels turning to slide 8 in the first quarter we expect these demand trends to drive growth particularly following the chinese lunar new year demand remains resilient in packaging and specialty plastics although domestic polyethylene supply improved through the fourth quarter comonomer supply remains constrained and trade sources are predicting another year of higher than average turnaround activity these factors coupled with improvements in shipping logistics that will help meet demand in the export market are leading to more constructive supply and demand balances domestically equity earnings are expected to be lower sequentially due to rising feedstock costs impacting asian olefin margins and we anticipate higher raw material and energy costs particularly in europe and asia altogether we anticipate an approximately 200 million impact versus the prior quarter for this segment utilizing our best in class feedstock flexibility and our differentiated portfolio dow will continue to be agile to mitigate potential volatility and meet demand in industrial intermediates and infrastructure strong demand for our high value materials in appliances construction pharma home care and energy applications combined with tight supply and increased global infrastructure investment are supporting a constructive demand outlook we anticipate approximately a 100 million benefit in this segment from completed turnarounds in the fourth quarter including sadara s isocyanate facility and several in our core polyurethane business and we expect the elevated energy costs in europe will be a 75 million impact versus the prior quarter for this segment in performance materials and coatings increasing industrial activity and consumer demand for electronics and construction continues to outpace supply for our differentiated silicone products the industry also anticipates resilient demand for architectural coatings as rebuilding from low inventory levels in preparation for the northern hemisphere spring and summer months the completion of our turnaround in the fourth quarter at our siloxane facility in china will allow us to take advantage of tight global market conditions as silicon metal supplies improve and energy curtailments in china continue to ease we will also be executing a turnaround at our methacrylates facility in deer park all in we expect a 25 million net tailwind versus the prior quarter from turnarounds for this segment turning to the full year we re continuing to provide our best estimates of several income statement and cash flow drivers notably we expect lower equity earnings sequentially due to margin compression versus the tighter conditions in 2021 particularly in asia as oil remains constructive putting upward pressure on the naphtha based feedstock costs in the region total turnaround spending for the year will be up approximately 100 million versus 2021 as we have another heavy turnaround year with three crackers slated for maintenance activity and increased inflationary pressure on materials and labor net interest expense is expected to be approximately 600 million benefiting from our proactive deleveraging actions since spin for cash flow we anticipate higher joint venture dividends from increased earnings in 2021 and a 1 billion tailwind toward pension related items following our actions last year continued investment in our digital initiatives will drive efficiency and enable us to achieve our 300 million ebitda run rate on the program by 2025 we will also complete the spending portion of our restructuring program which is now delivering a full 300 million ebitda run rate as we enter 2022 and finally as we highlighted at our investor day we anticipate increasing our capital expenditures to 2 2 billion well within our dna target as we continue to advance our higher return faster payback projects and execute on our decarbonize and grow strategy overall the macroeconomic backdrop remains favorable in 2022 and dow is well positioned due to our global footprint feedstock flexibility productivity programs and sustainable solutions for our customers we will continue to leverage these advantages as we navigate higher oil prices and continue to deal with inflation and logistics challenges and as the year progresses we intend to drive operating rates and service levels higher and do expect widening oil to gas spreads with that i ll turn it back to jim jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman thank you howard turning to slide 10 at our investor day in october we laid out our disciplined strategy to decarbonize and grow the company supported by a series of inflight earnings growth programs that will drive over 3 billion in underlying ebitda growth in 2022 our capital and operating investments are on track to deliver 200 million to 300 million in run rate ebitda and will serve higher margin differentiated applications where demand is accelerating as customers work to reduce their own carbon footprint in packaging and specialty plastics our fort saskatchewan expansion completed last year will deliver a full year of earnings growth to support increasing polyethylene demand and our fcdh pilot plant in louisiana will start up this year to produce propylene for coatings electronics and durables end markets notably the technology enables lower capex opex and co2 emissions compared to conventional pdh technologies these projects serve faster growing more sustainable market segments such as renewables to drive lower carbon emissions for our customers for example our endurance compounds for cable systems support next generation longer life and lower carbon emissions infrastructure including on and offshore wind farms by reducing the cable manufacturing carbon emissions footprint by 80 and our engage elastomers deliver 35 improved performance and efficiency for solar photovoltaic applications in industrial intermediates and infrastructure our alkoxylates and pu systems expansion projects are closely linked with brand owner demand for higher value differentiated downstream applications across home and consumer care agricultural and infrastructure end markets for example our surfactants offer an improved environmental profile for leading brand owner laundry and home care products and our polyurethane system pascal technology enables up to 10 greater energy efficiency and appliances without raising manufacturing costs in performance materials and coatings we re expanding capacity in formulated solutions for coatings and silicones through incremental debottlenecking projects our products enable higher performing more sustainable solutions targeting mobility consumer and infrastructure end markets for example fastrack coatings enable autonomous mobility infrastructure and have approximately 45 lower greenhouse gas emissions and our dowsil technology enables higher density lower cost battery packs for the fast growing electric vehicle market finally as howard mentioned our restructuring program and digital investment will continue to support our low cost operating model and top quartile cost structure turning to slide 11 the increasing demand for sustainable products represents a significant growth opportunity for dow with attractive pricing that will support longer term higher quality earnings our customers are looking for opportunities to enhance their sustainability and we are meeting those needs with lower carbon emissions solutions beginning with our own operations our alberta project will decarbonize approximately 20 of dow s global ethylene capacity while growing our global polyethylene supply by about 15 we are also working with our suppliers to reduce our scope 3 carbon emissions to date we have more than 150 supplier agreements in place and have adopted third party frameworks like cdp together for sustainability and ecovadis to drive tangible improvements in environmental performance along the value chain we continue to advance a circular economy for plastics and see a consistent trend across our brand owner customer base toward redesigning packages to be recyclable and incorporating 30 post consumer recycled content in their packaging by 2030 six of our largest sites have now received international sustainability and carbon certification plus recognition for tracking the use of sustainable feedstocks we re advancing our partnership with mura technology to scale advanced recycling solutions and secure circular product supply mura broke ground on the new plant with an expected start up around the end of the year earlier this month we announced an investment in mr green africa the first recycling company in africa to be a certified b corporation which includes socially responsible waste collection and plans to codevelop new flexible plastic packaging that will enable more sustainable packaging solutions a first of its kind investment for dow in africa this business model will be scaled to other developing regions around the world we continue to grow our recyclable offerings recently doubling sales with chinese laundry brand liby and increasing our addressable market opportunities and like the partnerships dow recently announced to source pyrolysis oil from gunvor and new hope energy these investments in circularity are examples of our progress and solid foundation as we grow and scale circular solutions to close on slide 12 2021 was an outstanding year for team dow we delivered record financial performance and continued our disciplined execution of our strategic priorities building on this foundation we re focused on advancing our plan to decarbonize our assets and grow earnings our competitive advantage enables us to meet the increasing needs of our customers and consumers who are demanding more circular and sustainable products while we work to achieve zero carbon emissions in our own operations and as we look ahead our priorities remain consistent our focus on profitable growth while maintaining a low cost position and best owner mindset will enable us to deliver on our earnings growth levers we ll continue to maintain our balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation driving higher returns for the company and our shareholders while retaining the financial flexibility that has served us well and we ll continue to advance our leadership in esg with a clear path to achieve our zero carbon circularity and sustainability targets the world and our customers are demanding a more sustainable future as we execute our ambition i am confident that we will create significant long term value for all of our stakeholders with that i ll turn it over to pankaj to open up the q a pankaj gupta director investor relations thank you jim now let s move on to your questions i would like to remind you that our forward looking statements apply to both our prepared remarks and the following q a operator please provide the q a instructions questions answers operator we ll take our first question from david begleiter of deutsche bank please go ahead your line is now open david begleiter deutsche bank analyst thank you good morning jim and howard it looks like there s some recent stability or even strength in polyethylene what are your assumptions for polyethylene prices over the next couple of months could we actually see a price increase maybe in february given some higher oil prices and better demand and balances here jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman good morning david thanks for being with us our view as we go into the quarter we had two increases out in the market plus four plus four and i think those will look like they re going to line up for february and for march as we ended the year we were a little bit constrained on volume really due to some unplanned events of our own both the hurricane as well as the situation we had in terneuzen otherwise december was the best marine packed cargo month for exports that we ve had since last march still not back to where we d like it to be but i think we see signs of gradual improvement and the team is working hard to stay on top of that and i think that s why you see the asia volume number down in the fourth quarter was we just backed off of those exports in the fourth quarter operator we will move on to our next question from hassan ahmed of alembic global please go ahead your line is now open hassan ahmed alembic global analyst good morning jim and howard you know just wanted to sort of get your views on the q1 guidance that you guys have given you know if i m running my numbers correctly it seems you guys you know with some of the tailwinds and headwinds that you talked about you re guiding to around 2 8 billion in ebitda for q1 22 and correct me if i m wrong it seems to me that that does not factor in the sort of polyethylene price hikes that you talked about the four plus four is that a fair assumption jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman let me have howard hassan welcome and let me have howard walk through the guidance and then we can comment a little bit more on the market outlook for q1 howard ungerleider president and chief financial officer sure good morning hassan you know look i think your number or your estimate is reasonable when you look at all the moving parts and the way i would think about it is look we re going to see about 275 million likely of margin moderation sequentially from q4 to q1 and then the net turnaround is actually a tailwind from q4 to q1 of about 125 million so those are the big moving parts jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman and i d say hassan it s possible that margins could open up obviously our view on oil is very constructive because as you look at the market demand has been better than anybody anticipated for oil and because of the investments being so low in oil and gas production in the last three years it takes supply time to catch up so when you look at the spare available capacity for oil that number is relatively low and as this demand grows that shrinking spare available capacity number means the market moves up pretty dramatically and that opens up the spreads meanwhile lng is obviously driving natural gas production i think in the united states as we get through winter we re going to see prices come down to like the 2 75 a million btu range that will mean a pretty good oil to gas spread here and plenty of available ethane for the market operator we will now move on to our next question from vincent andrews of morgan stanley please go ahead your line is now open vincent andrews morgan stanley analyst thank you and good morning everyone wondering if you could talk about the asian polyethylene market just where we continue to see negative margins and i assume some of that is just that the raw material costs have moved faster than pricing but is it your anticipation that we ll see those margins neutralize at least through higher prices or should we anticipate that we ll see some reduction in production there and i guess i asked that in particular because you re referencing increased export capability coming out of the u s so i m just trying to put all of that together thanks jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman yeah good morning vince thanks for that question asia has been underwater because of the rise obviously in naphtha prices and the narrow margins there i d also say a slow start to the year we ve got chinese new year ahead of us here the 1st of february and i think we re watching closely as we come out we ve seen some rate reductions at some asian producers that are higher cost that s what we would expect to see and obviously when coal ramped up and lng ramped up cto and mto down so as we come out of chinese new year we re watching closely on both polyethylene as well as ethylene glycol and what happens to the market eg has come off a little bit from the fourth quarter not terribly dramatic but it s down more than 100 a ton and you know the demand coming out of chinese new year will be something we keep an eye on now that s good for us obviously with our footprint and our advantaged cost positions here we just have to continue to improve on these marine packed cargo shipments and get those numbers moving up to take advantage of that arbitrage with asia operator we will now move on to our next question from jeff zekauskas of j p morgan please go ahead your line is now open jeff zekauskas j p morgan analyst thanks very much in your modeling guidance for 22 you say that your share count is 745 million isn t your share count today i don t know 743 and aren t you buying back shares at 6 million or 7 million a quarter shouldn t your share count be i don t know 735 or 730 for modeling purposes for 2022 and secondly how are your vam operations in the united states are they back to normal running at full capacity or are there still issues jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman good morning jeff let me ask howard to walk through the share count and the modeling guidance data howard ungerleider president and chief financial officer yeah sure good morning jeff i would say look our guidance is for flat because we re focused on making sure we cover dilution with that said you know we re going to continue to be opportunistic we bought 400 million worth in the fourth quarter our expectation is that we will do that same rough amount in the first quarter you know don t forget though as you re doing your math you ve got to think about you know where the stock price is because that will obviously impact the number of shares that we can buy increased exercise of options as the share price hopefully continues to move up and then also the averaging effect right because that will impact the number as well so that s why we say look 745 is a good number could it be slightly lower than that by the end of the quarter it could be jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman and on back to your question jeff on asset utilization we ve seen obviously we saw some impact in the fourth quarter from weather related outages and constraints but as we start the first quarter i think everything s come back to normal on operating rates so we ve been running pretty strong in the gulf coast strong as we have for a long time and that s a nice sign going into the first quarter operator we will now move on to our next question from frank mitsch of fermium research please go ahead your line is now open frank mitsch fermium research analyst yes good morning folks nice end to the year you referenced the terneuzen outage i was wondering if you could talk about your operating rates overall in the p sp segment in the quarter and then also versus the year and i believe howard during your comments you also mentioned that you anticipate higher operating rates in 2022 if you could expand upon that that would be great thank you jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman yeah good morning frank p sp the segment obviously was down a bit in the fourth quarter from what we had been running throughout the year it was down about 5 and so that really hit us and if you think about fourth quarter fourth quarter could have probably been about 150 million better have we not had those outages so we re running at much better rates right now the gulf you know our outlook for rates for the year on ethylene and all the ethylene derivatives is north of 87 we kind of see that as the low watermark and that s the way things are running right now really strong and then terneuzen s back one of the crackers has been back since the beginning of the year the other one is in the start up phase right now and so we ll be back out of that situation any other comments on operating rate howard howard ungerleider president and chief financial officer the only other thing maybe to add frank is remember when you think about year on year for full year in 22 versus 21 last year we had the winter storm you know that knocked out the that knocked out all of texas basically for the industry for about 30 days and then we also had the two hurricanes so we obviously can t predict what weather events or what unplanned events are going to happen but certainly it feels like last year was above normal jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman normal amount of capacity offline for the year so typically planned downtime year to year will be about the same you know we have three cracker turnarounds the three crackers that are there means about the same amount of outage time our expectations on growth global gdp 4 to 4 5 u s 4 china 5 to 6 translates really for us at 1 5 times gdp and about 6 year over year volume growth that s what we re targeting for and that s what we re running for we want to try to obviously also get some inventories back up and service levels back for our customers trying to get back to kind of a normal cadence that they can expect and better availability and reliability for them operator we will now move on to our next question from john roberts of ubs please go ahead your line is now open john roberts ubs analyst thanks the downstream coating customers are obviously struggling with raw materials and it looks like you made some changes to your acrylic mix as well when do you think the supply chains and coatings sort of get back to a steady state where things aren t shuffling around jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman good morning john they are gradually improving i would say the one thing in coatings that s a little bit different than some of our other chains there are quite a few small ingredients that go into that coatings chain so third party suppliers even that supply through us from day to day we still see some disruptions on third party supply and materials we ve got a turnaround right now in the first quarter for deer park but that s planned and then we ll be running hard we ran really hard in the fourth quarter i think we picked up some ground in fourth quarter and we re able to help some things out we ve been using more of our own acrylate monomers in our captive business so that s kind of constrained monomers a bit but my expectation is with the strong contractor demand for housing architecture do it yourself is still holding up really well and housing starts i mean you saw the december housing starts number was up 11 9 in north america which was well above what people expected with rents increasing and the ability to buy or build being there and some of the materials cost coming off i think we re going to see a good housing season in north america and that s going to drive some good business for us operator we ll move on to our next question from mike sison of wells fargo please go ahead your line is now open mike sison wells fargo securities analyst hey good morning guys nice end of the year just curious industry consultants still look for a lot of capacity coming on in you know globally this year 8 million plus and you guys tend to have a better view on what realistically could come on so just any thoughts on sort of the outlook for new capacity and how much of that could be absorbed this year given it seems like the outlook demand for polyethylene remains really strong jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman yeah the demand is very strong and welcome mike thank you for being here for every 1 of gdp growth in the marketplace you need two to three world scale polyethylene plants to come online and our expectation is that is not going to change we see strong demand across all the sectors for plastics products and so that s what s driving it i would say we have very good line of sight to the projects and the timing of the projects and most of them are going to start coming on second quarter midyear impact and so i think the market growth is going to help moderate some of that i think our expectations on operating rates are 2 to 3 percentage points higher than what the industry is expecting on polyethylene and plastics is typically running a bit heavier than that so my outlook is you ve got 4 million tons that are coming in north america about half of that is destined for the export market so that s why we re trying to keep an eye on marine packed cargo and the export shipments about 50 of the global pe capacity adds between now and 2025 are coming on in high cost regions naphtha which is the most of that and a little bit of cto and mto capacity about 60 of all global polyethylene capacity adds through 2025 are in northeast asia so i think with the advantage being in canada u s argentina middle east the places that have really good structural low cost ethane positions we re going to be in a good space and operating rates are going to be very high operator we ll now move on to our next question from bob koort of goldman sachs please go ahead your line is now open bob koort goldman sachs analyst thank you very much good morning gentleman maybe along the same lines jim i was curious it looked like maybe polyethylene exports were down 15 or 20 in total in 21 from the u s as a result of those production issues and i guess by our reckoning production might be up as much as 15 in 22 you mentioned the asian crackers are maybe curtailing a bit where is all the extra polyethylene going to get sent relative to what you saw in the export arena in 21 do you think jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman yeah good morning bob i do think we re going to see a rebound from all that offline capacity as howard said it s unpredictable right i mean a weather event can take some offline but the amount offline due to unplanned events weather related events last year was probably double what we would normally see and that texas freeze had a lot of knock on impacts that are hurting i think yes we re seeing movement into all the markets we ve seen india come back relatively strong which has been a good positive and i think after the chinese new year we ll watch china coming back we re seeing good steady improvements in marine packed cargo we need to keep ramping those rates up and i think as we navigate through omicron and we start to see less of an impact on the labor force we ll see those numbers loosen up and so that s why we re looking for the higher operating rates and the 6 volume growth coming out of the machine this year i think global i m not pessimistic about inflation killing demand honestly inflation has always been a positive for our business and over the last 30 years when the fed raises interest rates that typically tends to drive outperformance in our sector versus the other sectors and so i think you know commodities pull is very strong right now whether it s in petrochemicals or whether it s in minerals and mining for all of the things that we need for evs and alternative energy operator we will now move on to our next question from steve byrne of bank of america please go ahead your line is now open steve byrne bank of america merrill lynch analyst thank you jim you have some pretty ambitious sustainability goals on your slide 11 and when you look across all your businesses across the three segments what would you estimate the fraction of those customers that are asking you for a more sustainable product and then if you drill into that do they want your product to have been derived from some recycled material or do they just simply want their product to be recyclable or does it go even further in that they want your product to be derived from a renewable feedstock or a low carbon feedstock jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman yeah no it s a great question steve and this is an area that s rapidly changing i would say on the brand owner segment the brand owners pull a lot through the packaging so brand owners can be brands that you buy for food or for personal care items could be medical care and other types of applications as well all the brand owners are asking us for more post consumer recycled content and obviously the quality needs to be good and that s why the discussion around advanced recycling is so strong and we re making progress getting more and more acceptance of advanced recycling i think our view is as we go into high value applications that is going to be the way that we tackle this mechanical recycling will still be there but in those cases i think you re going to see more mechanical recycling into more durable type applications different end markets we see the same trend in silicones silicones especially in personal care we see the trend in automotive all the automotive oems and manufacturers are looking for to be able to make claims on sustainability on their products that even goes into polyurethanes for seating and cushioning and so the project we announced last year in france were full recycle of polyurethane foams strong demand for those in the automotive sector now the supply is not there yet and they all want more supply faster and supply challenges making sure that that s all cost competitive and they just don t have a blank check to write for these materials it is going to be more expensive than virgin materials and i think they re all getting their heads wrapped around that just like the whole discussion we re having now about focus too much toward renewable energy really drives up the energy cost for the whole complex and so that s a big debate right now and that s why we re very disciplined about our approach and making bets that we think will be low cost in that future and also will be the quality that customers need for their end product operator we will now move on to our next question from kevin mccarthy of vertical research partners please go ahead your line is now open kevin mccarthy vertical research partners analyst yes good morning jim i was wondering if you could expand on your outlook for volume growth i think you indicated a target or projection of 6 growth just quite a bit above the minus four that we saw in the fourth quarter you touched on supply constraints maintenance turnarounds and dual control actions in china is it the case that fourth quarter was unduly depressed by these sort of fleeting or temporary effects such that you know it will come back quickly to 6 and if so you know might that happen as soon as the first quarter or do you think that takes longer or more patience as the year progresses jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman yeah good morning kevin it s a very good question and we will ramp into this as we go through the year think about it this way it was this time last year i think it was february last year that we had the freeze in texas it took pretty much the whole state of texas down a lot of capacity came out and we by march we were back and we ran hard through the month of march what happened during that time was inventories got depleted pretty much through the chain and then we had a very strong second and third quarter so there wasn t a chance to really rebuild any inventories we had an october hurricane again pressure on inventories and then we had logistics constraints all through the year in fact march was our best marine packed cargo exports after the freeze and december was the best month we ve had since march so it took that long to really kind of scale back out of it so gradually we re seeing improvement month by month on marine packed cargo exports we were constrained by the fact that there you know if you had inventory it might not have been in the right grade for a customer we are constrained a little bit by comonomers comonomer is very tight for the higher alpha olefins sector and we re constrained by logistics and so that s and the terneuzen situation then in europe obviously put a curtailment on taking orders in the fourth quarter so i think that s a bit of an anomaly and that was specific to those issues but i think the underlying demand growth is still there and the order book is still strong operator we will now move on to our next question from john mcnulty of bmo capital markets john mcnulty bmo capital markets analyst yeah thanks for taking my question so i guess maybe two related things on the supply chain impact that you guys had in terms of the hit to volumes in the quarter can you help us to understand what that was and then maybe a little bit more broadly when you think about the really tight freight and logistics markets right now and the impact that they re having on some of these very wide arbs i guess how are you thinking about how that plays out as we look through the rest of 2022 jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman i think a good proxy for the supply chain impact would be to look at the asia volumes year over year and that will give you a good because we had a strong fourth quarter last year and so that would give you a good indication on the age of volumes so if you look at our fourth quarter sales volumes they decreased in asia and that s mostly obviously china and so i think you can look at that and see that opening back up and that will drive some of that 6 growth and then obviously we have other markets that we serve out of the gulf that will come back and some of that outage time was in europe and europe is really you know sized for the domestic market there and the business in europe q1 has been strong there hasn t been an issue with demand in europe so i think we ll work through that team is working hard on the reliability and availability of schedule that s been the biggest challenge is you ve got something scheduled and then worker shortages because somebody has tested positive for omicron means they re not able to pick it up that s the hand to hand that the team is dealing with right now operator we ll move on to our next question from duffy fischer of barclays please go ahead your line is now open duffy fischer barclays analyst yeah good morning two questions the first one on your jvs ebitda is down a couple of hundred million dollars but cash equity dividends to you are up can you walk through the puts and takes on that and then how should we think about those two moving together going forward and then maybe more broadly just on dual control now that you and the government there have had the opportunity to kind of go back and forth on some stuff what do you think the impact in 22 is going to be on your business from dual control and what do you think it s going to do to your end markets jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman howard you ve got a good line of sight on the jv so you want to take a shot at that howard ungerleider president and chief financial officer yes sure hey good morning duffy yeah equity earnings were up year on year they were up 224 well they were 224 million up 118 million really gains in kuwait thailand and jv primarily in p sp in our industrial solutions business and you re right about cash so our dividends are they come a year in arrears so if you think about it the reason why the cash was down this year is because earnings last year were lower in 2020 versus 2019 obviously the equity earnings were up in 2021 and so that s why this year in 2022 we re guiding that the dividends will be up about 250 million so you know you should model in about 500 million to 600 million we targeted the midpoint of 550 of higher cash from our jv dividends in 2022 jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman in china on dual control duffy the biggest thing that we had our eye on was obviously silica metal for silicones is an energy intensive process and early on there was some concern that china was going to curtail some of that manufacturing we were able to move some silicon metal from brazil because we have production there as well to kind of offset but that s why in the fourth quarter we pulled some turnaround time into the fourth quarter for zhangjiagang for silicones and that s done now and over the course of the fourth quarter both our industry and the solar industry you know made sure it was obvious to the chinese government that the impact that that would have on solar pv market and on our market as well so right now those assets are not under the dual control curtailments we keep a close eye on that we are not in some of the other locations that have been more impacted by dual control and i think it could be positive you know for imports for polyethylene although i haven t seen that yet so we just keep a close eye on it but i think for silicones we re in a good track we re going to we re up and going to have a strong first quarter there and the market demand and the volumes are good operator we will now move on to our next question from alex yefremov of keybanc please go ahead your line is now open alex yefremov keybanc capital markets analyst thank you good morning everyone howard i wanted to follow up on your comment about 275 million of sequential margin pressure in the first quarter if you get any of the 0 08 of polyethylene price increases that you nominate does this number become better or does it include the 0 08 howard ungerleider president and chief financial officer yes i think you ve got alex good morning i think you ve got really you ve two moving parts so really three you ve got how much volume we can get which will be the total margin dollars you ve got the price and then you ve got the cost structure i mean clearly what we re seeing is elevated natural gas prices in the u s and also significantly higher you know brent pricing which will impact naphtha so certainly in europe our cost structure is going to be higher but i think the points that jim mentioned earlier demand is very strong and so you know you are likely going to see higher prices around the world it is too soon to tell about asia to the point that jim made about chinese new year we ll see what happens but you ve got good global gdp you ve got good manufacturing output you ve got good consumer spending that will drive demand growth and with the higher feedstock cost whether it s on a natural gas basis in the americas or oil brent naphtha in the rest of the world that will put pressure on price so the best that we can do is our view is that minus 275 a margin offset by 125 million of favorable net positive sequential turnaround and that s how you get to that you know 2 8 plus or minus number operator we ll now move on to our next question from arun viswanathan from rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is now open arun viswanathan rbc capital markets analyst great thanks for taking my question congratulations on a strong year there i guess we ve talked a lot about the polyethylene market so maybe i could also just get you to guys to elaborate on your outlook for polyurethanes as well as silicones could you just comment on those two markets as well thanks jim fitterling chairman and chief executive chairman yeah arun thank you polyurethane market strength in you know furniture and bedding appliances construction everything related to housing is very good in that segment ii i segment also industrial solutions market strength pharma home cleaning food we have some feed additives in there crop defense intermediates for crop defense and electronics are all very strong and what you see is that the supply demand is very constructive to the middle of this decade whether you re looking at mdi polyethylene propylene glycol or ethylene oxide and ethylene oxide derivatives so all very strong through mid decade you know we think that even though automotive is a little bit constrained right now because of semiconductor chip shortages we expect that s going to ease throughout the year and especially in the second half it s going to be better light vehicle production estimates for this year about 85 million units around the world that will be up from last year so that s positive electric vehicle trends are good for us there s more content on an ev for us than there is on internal combustion engine vehicle but both of them continue to look good so i think that s good a little bit slower our operating rates on propylene oxide because the new capacity has come on but net net so the systems business which is a strong driver of the profitability is going to be good just to give you an example on building and construction we re looking at kind of 4 market growth rate similar to last year electronics 6 and so i think we ve got a good trend in front of us pankaj gupta director investor relations i think that s time all that s all the time we have today

stock market pain can present long term opportunities and wall street sees one in this stock the technology centric nasdaq 100 stock market index is down 12 so far in 2022 which is a considerable decline given that it s only january but since history supports taking a long term view for the best investment results this rapid downturn in the market might be a great opportunity to buy quality businesses at a discount tech driven used car dealer carvana cvna 6 88 might fit that bill the company has suffered a stock price decline of 58 since hitting its all time high in august 2021 but leading wall street investment bank morgan stanley ms 0 93 has just come out with a very bullish call here s why an innovation powerhouse artificial intelligence and machine learning are buzz phrases thrown around abundantly in the tech sector but carvana uses them both to deliver an unrivaled used car buying experience to its customers its digital approach is so powerful that morgan stanley analyst adam jonas describes the company as the apex predator in auto retail and since carvana has rocketed up the rankings to become the second largest car dealer in the u s he might be right most consumers would be familiar with buying a used car the traditional way it typically involves a trip to the local dealership with a salesperson guiding you through the vehicles on the lot and that highlights a key issue your options are usually limited to the inventory the dealer holds on that day the internet improved this empowering buyers to seek out the cars they want but they still need to interact with a specific dealership plus arrange delivery if they re out of state carvana on the other hand offers a fully digital process despite having 28 physical vending machine locations to facilitate pick ups and trade ins prospective buyers can purchase a vehicle online and have it delivered to them by a company employed delivery driver but it takes technology a step further using artificial intelligence and machine learning tools it monitors used car auctions to identify the hottest selling vehicles and then ensures it has an adequate supply of them in its own inventory that makes carvana the ultimate one stop shop for prospective buyers scaling up with soaring growth the key to carvana s success is volume adopting a fully digital approach means it has the opportunity to sell significantly more cars simply because it can reach a much wider audience in fact the company claims to serve 80 6 of the u s population and that figure continues to grow it explains in part the company s rapid growth over the last few years metric q3 2018 ttm q3 2021 ttm cagr revenue 1 6 billion 10 8 billion 88 gross profit per unit sold 2 302 q3 2018 4 672 q3 2021 26 vehicles sold 79 875 384 393 68 the company has been helped by soaring used car prices on the back of new vehicle shortages thanks to semiconductor supply constraints during 2020 and 2021 used cars have enjoyed a broad rise in value of 37 over the last 12 months according to the most recent inflation data it s unreasonable to expect this to continue forever so some of carvana s growth is likely to taper off over the next couple of years the university of michigan survey of consumer sentiment also supports this in december 2021 just 27 of consumers thought it was a good time to buy a car compared to 58 in the prior year period as it turns out hardly anybody wants to pay inflated prices for used vehicles but wall street is on board on jan 24 wall street investment bank morgan stanley reiterated its overweight rating on carvana s stock and attached a 430 price target that represents 173 upside from today s price of 157 so even with potential headwinds on the horizon the bank thinks carvana s digital approach is enough for it to continue gaining traction with consumers and morgan stanley isn t alone a total of 13 analysts have a buy rating on carvana s stock and six have a hold with an average price target of 344 which represents 119 growth from here the broad tech sell off might have served up a solid opportunity to add carvana to your portfolio but the market remains uncertain so it s best to adopt a long term strategy if you do buy the stock

31 2020 is primarily driven by loan growth in owner occupied commercial real estate as we remain focused on relationship banking and growing our commercial loan portfolios the increases due to loan growth in owner occupied commercial real estate were partially offset by forgiveness of ppp loans reflected in the commercial and industrial portfolio excluding all ppp loans and other business lending portfolio loans acquired from cheaha of 16 9 million and 17 9 million at december 31 2021 and september 30 2021 respectively investar s total adjusted business lending portfolio was 730 8

of 15 7 million compared to 13 8 million or 0 74 of total loans at december 31 2020 the increase in nonperforming loans compared to december 31 2020 is mainly attributable to one loan relationship discussed further below which added 15 5 million to the balance of nonperforming loans at december 31 2021 included in nonperforming loans are acquired loans with a balance of 4 0 million at december 31 2021 or 14 of nonperforming loans the allowance for loan losses was 20 9 million or 70 6 and 1 11 of nonperforming and total loans respectively at december 31 2021 compared to 20 6 million or 62 4

compared to 21 7 million and 2 4 million for the quarters ended september 30 2021 and december 31 2020 respectively the provision for loan losses for the quarter ended september 30 2021 includes an impairment charge of 21 6 million related to a loan relationship with related borrowers collectively the borrower consisting of multiple loans that are secured by various types of collateral as a result of hurricane ida which made landfall in louisiana as a category 4 hurricane on august 29 2021 the borrower s business operations were disrupted causing a significant reduction in value of some of the collateral supporting the loan relationship including real estate inventory and equipment in the third quarter of 2021 investar instituted a 90 day deferral program for customers who were impacted by hurricane ida since then the bank has provided payment deferrals on approximately 50 million of loans virtually all of those loans deferred have now resumed normal payments at december 31 2021 investar had approximately 2 4 million or 0 1 of the total loan portfolio on a 90 day deferral plan deposits total deposits at december 31 2021 were 2 12 billion a decrease of 183 4 million or 8

deposits to satisfy the required borrowings under its interest rate swap agreements due to more favorable pricing in the third quarter of 2021 the company terminated multiple swap agreements the borrowings for which matured in october 2021 therefore the company had no brokered deposits at december 31 2021 which drove the decrease in deposits compared to september 30 2021 investar acquired approximately 207 0 million in deposits from cheaha at the time of acquisition on april 1 2021 the remaining increase compared to december 31 2020 is due to organic growth the covid 19 pandemic has created a significant amount of excess liquidity in the market and as a result we have experienced large increases in both noninterest and interest bearing demand deposits and in money market deposit accounts and savings accounts compared to december 31 2020 these increases were primarily driven by reduced spending by consumer and business customers related to the covid 19 pandemic and increases in ppp borrowers deposit accounts we believe these factors may be temporary depending on the future economic effects of the covid 19 pandemic our deposit mix continues to improve and reflects our consistent focus on relationship banking and growing our commercial relationships as well as the effects of the pandemic on consumer and business spending compared to the quarter ended december 31 2020 noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits has increased while time deposits as a percentage of total deposits has decreased management made a strategic decision to either reprice or run off higher yielding time deposits and other interest bearing deposit products during 2020 and 2021 which has contributed to our decreasing cost of deposits compared to the quarters ended september 30 2021 and december 31 2020 the following table sets forth the composition of deposits as of the dates indicated dollars in thousands net interest income net interest income for the fourth quarter of 2021 totaled 21 5 million a decrease of 0 1 million or 0 4 compared to the third quarter of 2021 and an increase of 2 3 million or 12 1 compared to the fourth quarter of 2020

the increase in net interest margin for the quarter ended december 31 2021 compared to the quarter ended september 30 2021 was driven by a decrease in the cost of deposits the increase in net interest margin for the quarter ended december 31 2021 compared to december 31 2020 was also driven by a decrease in the cost of the deposits which decreased 46 basis points however the benefit of our reduced cost of deposits was largely offset by excess liquidity the average balance of interest bearing balances with banks for the quarter ended december 31 2021 as shown on our net interest margin table increased 168 6 million compared to the quarter ended december 31 2020 and resulted in downward pressure of 26 basis points on the net interest margin the yield on interest earning assets was 3 95 for

compared to the quarter ended september 30 2021 was driven by a 25 basis point increase in the yield on taxable securities partially offset by an 11 basis point decrease in the yield on our loan portfolio the decrease in the yield on interest earning assets compared to the quarter ended december 31 2020 was driven by excess liquidity discussed above in response to the pandemic during march 2020 the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate 150 basis points to 0 to 0 25 percent which has affected the yields that we earn on our interest earning assets in addition the ppp loans originated have a contractual interest rate of 1 and origination fees based on the loan amount which impacts the yield on our loan portfolio exclusive of ppp loans which had an average balance of 33 2 million and related interest and fee income of 1 0 million for the quarter ended december 31 2021 compared to an average balance of 58 5 million and related interest and fee income of 1 3 million for

quarters ended september 30 2021 and december 31 2020 reflects the decrease in rates paid for all categories of interest bearing deposits the overall costs of funds for the quarter ended december 31

the cost of funds for the quarter ended december 31 2021 compared to the quarters ended september 30 2021 and december 31 2020 resulted from both lower cost of deposits and lower average balances of

were closed in 2021 totaling 1 9 million as other real estate owned the decrease in noninterest income compared to the quarter ended december 31 2020 is mainly attributable to a 1 2 million decrease in other operating income and a 0 9 million difference in the fair value of our equity securities the decrease in other operating income compared to the quarter ended december 31 2020 was attributable to a 1 1 million decrease in derivative fee income noninterest expense noninterest expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 totaled 13 9 million a decrease of 2 5 million or 15 1 compared to the third

september 30 2021 was driven by a 2 6 million decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense and a 0 4 million decrease in acquisition expense partially offset by a 0 4 million increase in other operating expenses primarily attributable to the increase in the provision for unfunded loan commitments the decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense was primarily due to the 1 9 million employee retention credit erc which was recognized as a credit to payroll taxes in the quarter ended december 31 2021 also included in noninterest expense for the quarter ended december 31 2021 is 0 1 million of professional fees incurred in connection with the erc the decrease in noninterest expense for the quarter ended december 31 2021 compared to the quarter ended december 31 2020 is primarily

uncertainty is the enemy of business and it is certain that we are facing uncertain unpredictable times economists and professionals in the restructuring sector of business and real estate have been anticipating a distressed economy for the past 18 months thus far they have been wrong factors influencing the current economy covid 19 the delta and other variants and now the highly contagious omicron variant have caused millions of workers to choose to work from home or to not work at all this has created a serious supply and distribution chain disruption and the threat of a substantial new round of tariffs embargoes and other economic sanctions based on the political climate and there is a looming threat of high inflation on the positive side the stock market and the overall economy are clicking along at a solid and positive pace will these factors ultimately cause the predicted distressed economy no one knows for sure but in analyzing the situation it may be instructive to look at the issues that have prevented the anticipated downturn banks and banking since the pandemic began regulators have not been pressuring banks to take action with respect to defaulted loans historically banks have been willing to kick the can down the road with respect to defaulted loans if they could do so without significantly impairing the accounting value of the loan with respect to the bank s capital requirements the current attitude of the regulators has allowed the banks to do just this while the regulators have a definite positive effect on the economy at some point they will realize that the effect of their actions will cause banks to have misleading financial statements this in turn will most likely create substantial losses not being recognized as a result of defaulted loans not being written down to their true value if they had been classified it is not likely that the regulators lassiez fair attitude will change before the mid term elections later this year but at some point they will have to stop allowing banks to avoid classifying loans otherwise they risk allowing the banking system to mispresent the value of its loan assets to an even great degree with all of the risks of that situation impacting the creditability and stability of the system when the bank regulators change their position with respect to their treatment of defaulted loans the anticipated tsunami of real estate foreclosures and bankruptcies will be upon us additional factors to watch interest rates have historically had a substantial impact on the economy especially in the real estate sector the feds have kept interest rates at almost zero to support the economy now however the specter of high inflation will almost certainly bring an end to near zero interest rates annual inflation during 2022 is projected to be in excess of 6 the fed has already announced its intention to rein in inflation by raising interest rates the issue is not whether interest rates will rise rather it is by how much and when the rates will increase the country is experiencing a real shift in the way americans view work coupled with rising interest rates the country is experiencing a real shift in the way americans view work projections state that about 23 of employees holding mid and upper level jobs will opt to permanently work remotely and never return to the office this shift in the way people will work in the future will have a profound effect on the ability of landlords to keep commercial space leased major shifts in the way people work will result in wins and losses time will tell how this will play out but it is certainly looking like the economy will be disrupted a close corollary to the change in work attitudes is the disruption in the country s supply and distribution system while there are many reasons for the current distribution issues a lack of necessary employees specifically truck drivers is certainly part of the problem the lack of ships necessary to produce new cars will almost certainly negatively impact the auto industry in 2022 similar examples exist in many sectors of the economy the re emergence of the covid cases in the form of the omicron variant has all but destroyed the timetable for society s return to normalcy this is no reliable way to predict the effect of the re emergence of covid on the psyche of the country it is predictable however that the re emergence will negatively impact the money and will further delay a return to normalcy in fact it is likely that normalcy as it existed pre pandemic will never fully return trends like the shift of consumers primarily conducting their shopping online will have a negative effect on brick and mortar retail sales the need for retail space seems poised to continue to decline even more than it has already this problem has been accelerated by the pandemic owners of shopping centers and commercial buildings are girding for the rash of vacancies that are most assuredly on the horizon it is uncertain how the federal state and local governments will react to the situation uncertainty is the enemy of business and it is certain that we are facing uncertain unpredictable times there is the uncertainty of the public s general perception that we cannot trust politicians news outlets and perhaps even doctors and healthcare workers all of these factors will combine to create a perfect storm for companies and real estate investors to experience increasing distressed assets the best advice we can offer is for entities to deal with their distressed assets early on the earlier the intervention occurs the more likely it is that chapter 11 bankruptcy can be avoided this not only saves companies from working out of bankruptcy but also keeps employees in their jobs william bill lobel bill lobel is a bankruptcy lawyer best known for his 30 plus years of experience helping owners of real estate and businesses in financial distress avoid or successfully emerge from chapter 11

has the risk of a full blown bear market risen on wall street a standard issue correction has already arrived for the nasdaq composite however the larger question is whether tighter central bank policies in the western world will lead to deeper declines than we have already seen in major averages and among individual stocks many years ago legendary investor stanley druckenmiller told me that his historical analysis suggested that there are two triggers for meaningful bear markets in stocks rising interest rates and the onset of war now we seem to be staring down the barrel of both as the federal reserve has now acknowledged that it plans rate hikes throughout this year and a reduction in its holdings of treasury bonds meanwhile saber rattling is taking place from the kremlin to kyiv and from tiananmen to taiwan get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters the fed s balance sheet reduction known as quantitative tightening would be a powerful addition to rate hikes in reducing surplus liquidity in markets if history is any guide it would also further weaken equity markets over the course of the tightening cycle just the threat of these events prior to the fed s admissions knocked markets for a loop wringing out speculative excesses in cryptocurrencies meme stocks and spacs or special purpose acquisition companies amc entertainment and gamestop shares are each down about 80 from their memetic highs shares of robinhood and coinbase have been robbed weak assets fall first before being followed by the market s less risky bets the nyse advance decline line is rolling over while the number of new 52 week lows has exploded true some sentiment indicators like the vix or fear indicator recently reached extremes suggesting an oversold rally would ensue yet i don t believe this tumult is nearly over in the intermediate to longer term a time of heightened risk around the world geopolitical risks are rising rapidly the u s has put troops on alert and nato has placed forces on standby and reinforced positions in eastern europe as the threat of a russian invasion of ukraine continues to rise nato allies are also reportedly sending weapons to ukraine to shore up its defenses russia was pessimistic on washington s response to its demands that ukraine never enter nato earlier this week the u s state department told family members of diplomats and embassy staff to leave ukraine a sign of growing concern that russian president vladimir putin is not bluffing this is a belief buttressed by the 100 000 russian troops weaponry and logistical support amassed on ukraine s border and reports that putin is attempting to install a pro russian president in kyiv also it s interesting to note that russian stocks which performed well last year in lockstep with oil prices have tumbled in 2022 against a backdrop of rising oil prices and a flight to quality into u s treasury bonds the combined messages from those markets appear menacing add to those concerns renewed chinese flyovers in taiwan which prompted the taiwanese air force to scramble and chase 39 fighter planes away over the past weekend if there is even an economic war between the west and russia resulting in stiff sanctions like cutting off russian energy exports blocking russia from using swift a mechanism for international financial transfers or placing export controls on goods heading to russia the global economic stakes rise dramatically the stakes are even higher if putin and china s president xi jinping are coordinating their efforts to destabilize western alliances and fracture already frayed relations such a set of developments could freeze central banks in place and result in a friendlier fed that would be relatively better for risk assets but far from a friendly overall environment especially given a three year bull run lofty valuations and speculative excesses in some corners of global markets the pandemic induced bear market in 2020 lasted 21 trading days as the s p 500 tumbled 34 in the most compressed bear phase on record i m considerably less optimistic that the next bear market if this is indeed the start of one will be over so quickly or do so little damage cash may no longer be trash in 2022 ron insana is a cnbc contributor and a senior advisor at schroders

right now and semrush holdings inc wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 10 2022 this video was recorded on jan 12 2022 chinese ride hailing company didi global didi 3 12 gets ready to ipo in hong kong motley fool analyst bill mann analyzes that story and others and discusses the technological excellence of domino s pizza s dpz 1 47 business and the potential for its stock the team also takes a closer look at semrush holdings semr 2 43 a search company that went public in march 2021 chris hill today on motley fool money we ve got an in depth look at a company that s a pure play on search and no it s not google that and more coming up right now i m chris hill joined by motley fool senior analyst bill mann thanks for being here bill mann hey chris how are you doing man you staying warm chris hill staying warm we ve also got some news from the ridesharing industry and the restaurant industry but we re going to start today with the big macro the consumer price index rose seven percent in december compared to 12 months prior and all the headlines bill fastest since june of 1982 however i have to point out this was expected a lot of people came up with this number and when you look at the month over month growth october 0 9 percent november 0 8 percent december 0 5 it seems to be slowing i feel like if you re one of the transitory bulls you ve got a decent case to be made here when you look at what s happening in the market today the market is of shrugging this off bill mann as well they should at least my favorite headline so far comes from bloomberg it s by someone named alexandra tanzi and the headline is cars bacon men s clothes the main drivers of 2021 us inflation chris the bacon trade is back chris hill thank god bill mann it bears remembering you would think that at any point over the last decade if you were to say at some point there s going to be an inflation print of seven percent that people really in some ways they wouldn t have believed you it really bears remembering that the fiscal policy that has been in place literally since the financial crisis 2009 has been all about bringing about inflation and preventing deflation which is the far scarier of the two for public policy and economic policy fools seven percent inflation the market is not really reacting if you were to annualize that over the last decade we still are essentially inflationless the real point i want to make in terms of what you were talking about with it being transitory the highest price increases were gasoline at 49 percent used cars at 37 percent gas utilities at 24 percent then we get down to meat fish and eggs the bacon trade at 12 percent those are commodity driven supply and demand driven components of the economy i would say there s a fairly high chance that next year at this time that those elements are somewhere close to zero inflation chris hill one of the things we talk about a lot at the motley fool on the podcasts in the video livestream certainly in the articles the tension for us as individual investors the head and the gut bill mann yeah chris hill because when you explain it like that when you pull back when you take emotion out of the equation it makes sense at a gut level this is one of those things that just doesn t feel nobody likes to see higher prices bill mann no chris hill as consumers and at gut level that s a scary headline fastest inflation growth in 40 years bill mann it just be instead of a lot of the fiscal policy and it bears remembering that the fiscal policy tools available to us are like the gorilla in the old samsonite ad they ve got a thing that they could throw as hard as they can and that s about it that s their move it is there s nothing precise about it they have to either flood the economy with additional money or pull that money away so when they have flooded the economy with money which is definitely what has happened since 2020 it really has happened for a lot longer than that this is a logical outcome and yes it does hurt to think that your dollar last year buys half as much bacon as this year but this is what policy folks want to have happen because now that it allows them to bring rates more into an historically healthy place we re going to see rates go up over the next year don t know how fast but this is what allows them to do it chris hill on behalf of the small percentage of the audience who like me understood the reference to gorilla in the samsonite ad thank you for making it and for those who didn t get it i ll post that on the motley fool money twitter feed we move on less than six months after it went public on the new york stock exchange didi global was delisted the largest ridesharing business in china appears however to have found a new home there are reports today that didi is in talks to ipo on the hong kong exchange later this year before we get to the underlying business and the stock of didi global let s start with the technical here what should investors expect and how does this work bill mann what s happening here specifically well really with all chinese companies but with didi in particular they had such a bad process coming out of the gate when they went public in the united states they thought they had permission from the chinese government which is the thing that you would like to have but they didn t the chinese government has really grievously harmed didi s business at the same time the us and china are in an argument about disclosures for chinese companies chinese companies across the board need to find a different home and the most likely home is hong kong you ve got a company that the americans are angry at and the chinese are angry at their next step has to be to get onto the hong kong market let s face it didi is not really wanted here on the markets but they have to go somewhere hong kong is hopefully that place where they will go that will give investors continued liquidity chris hill if i can buy shares on the hong kong exchange should i be looking at didi global i will point out that you mentioned the challenges for lack of a better word bill mann i was being nice chris hill i m also trying to be nice bill mann it was a disaster chris hill the challenges that they have with the central government in china you look at the stock it really took a beating in its short life on the new york stock exchange but if i can buy shares it is the largest of its kind in its industry in china bill mann yes it has lost something on the order of seven billion dollars at current run rates it s going to run out of cash i don t think that really most any chinese company is particularly buyable given the current environment in china toward capitol but dd is at the top of the list for me for unbuyable securities they essentially have had their apps taken off of the app stores throughout china they are not allowed to make any public statements this company has made the wrong people angry it would be a pure punt to buy dd even if you want to get exposure to the chinese market i don t think dd is the best way to do it chris hill what is the best way to do it bill mann well not that chris hill no that much is clear bill mann for me i think that the most buyable company in china is jd com remains to be the one way that i would suggest that people get exposure to china chris hill let s close with some data from domino s pizza this comes from the icr conference which is an investment conference earlier this week it features both public companies and private companies one of the data points that domino s shared is that they now get more than 75 percent of their sales through digital channels this cut the attention of david henkes if you re a longtime listener to the show you ve heard david henkes as a guest a number of times he s a senior principal at technomic bill knows him because you two were college roommates somehow he survived that experience to become one of the top industry analysts in the food and beverage space bill mann i served as david s warning for what not to do apparently no he s fabulously smart very insightful the 75 percent that come from digital sales is higher than the amount of revenues that domino s gets from delivery their delivery numbers are only 57 percent chris hill here s what henkes had to say about this you and i were talking to him this morning we think this is worth expanding on he wrote on twitter such an important part of their strategy and one that they ve executed pretty flawlessly other pizza players working to catch up but this is a huge competitive advantage for them bill mann it absolutely yes chris hill a couple of fixtures first the line that ron gross and you and others have said for years about domino s it s not a pizza company it s a technology company is borne out when you look at stats like this we should take a moment and just applaud them because it really is one of those things that is breathtaking now as we look back on what they have built in 2010 when patrick doyle was the ceo and pretty quickly on the job came out and said our pizza is not very good we ve talked to a lot of people and our pizza isn t very good and we re working to fix it bill mann they did ad campaign on that chris hill they did a whole ad campaign on that bill mann it s brilliant chris hill the way that he and his team help transform the business 10 12 years ago if you were a shareholder of this company you never could have dreamed it would turn out this good bill mann no you know who really changed my insights onto domino s pizza was selim bassoul who s a longtime friend of the fool the ceo of middleby corporation the middleby made among other things for kitchens pizza ovens both industrial and in smaller scale pizza ovens selim said the restaurant companies that you wanted to focus on is again this is not glamorous are the ones who are the best at turning their kitchens into factories into rapid production many times making the same move over and over situations and domino s is at the very top of that list and it is 100 percent technology that has gotten them there they absolutely positively deserve the company s since 2014 its shares have outperformed alphabets the google has not performed as well is domino s pizza in the public markets and it s justified chris hill i m still scratching my head over the fact that this is let s just round up and call it an 18 billion company which puts us solidly less than half the size of chipotle that s not a knock on chipotle but when you look at domino s pizza the underlying business as david points out the huge competitive advantage that they have right now that the others are trying to catch up and good luck to them where do you put this stock right now or is this something that wasn t going to suggest that it looks cheap because unlike plenty of stocks over the last six months this thing has actually performed well it s up about 25 percent over the past 12 months is it an expensive stock or if you believe in the future of pizza as i would argue all right thinking people do this is one with room to run bill mann big pizza is not to be trifled with is that what you re saying chris hill i was in love with domino s as big pizza because to take the other side of it for a second there are plenty of people who live in areas where there is amazing local pizza and they think to themselves by the way you and i live in one of those areas i don t remember the last time i bought domino s pizza bill mann there was a children s birthday attached to it for sure chris hill yes other than that though bill mann domino s at this point is 1 6 the size of starbucks that to me is staggering about half the size by market cap by market cap is about half the size of chipotle i know these companies rather well but i bet you a lot of people would say if you were to ask them what s the largest of the three was they may actually pick domino s domino s isn t going to be a fast grower but i really do think that it is a very interesting proxy for starbucks because starbucks has grown at a 20 percent clip which is great growth but they ve done it for 20 years plus i see domino s as having the potential to do that same exact thing chris hill that s a pretty delicious basket of stocks we just put together coffee burritos and pizza bill mann i think we got to go chris hill bill mann thanks for being here bill mann thanks chris chris hill last year a record number of companies came public and when you consider how many of them are trading below the price they closed at on their opening day it s a reminder that being a public company is more challenging than being a private one but some defied expectations and are looking good heading into their second year of being public for a closer look at one such company they re still unnoticed brian stoffel today we are zooming in on a 2021 ipo that we probably should have been paying attention to earlier semrush joining me is brian feroldi brian if you work in digital marketing you have heard the name semrush if you don t there s a hint as to what they do right there in the name brian feroldi yeah the sem in semrush is an acronym that i was unfamiliar with but the sem stands for search engine marketing essentially what semrush does is it s a software company that helps other companies to identify and reach their customers online semrush has a suite of more than 50 tools that enables companies to improve their website improve their social media pages and that helps them efficiently reach and target their audience brian stoffel folks that are listening might say okay digital marketing software provider feel like i ve heard the story a lot looking at the business it s a 2 5 billion software company it seems niche why should i care about this i think the reason i wanted to bring this one to our listeners is understanding this business and really the role that they re playing for anyone that has an online presence is key to understanding what s happening right now when it comes to online content and how businesses are acquiring customers in the digital age brian feroldi if you re a brand it s never been more important to develop a direct relationship with your target audience more and more people are going online to make decisions about who they re going to buy from so if you re a company that doesn t have a strong online presence you are just going to get missed out and that trend is just going to continue overtime now semrush points out that there are basically three primary ways today that brands go online to find and interact with their customers the first and the easiest way is just through paid advertising now that is a plus because you can drive immediate traffic to your website to your aft wherever you want to however it s costly to do that in the short term a medium term strategy is to focus on social media and use things like press releases to build up a base of fans overtime that s a great strategy but it can take a little while to get that going then the long term is to really master content creation and search engine optimization so that way you drive consistent organic traffic to your properties over long periods of time with very little effort however that s something that really pays off in the long term semrush really helps companies to focus on all three of those to make sure they drive immediate traffic to their sites as well as build up a base for the long term and doing so they a provide more than 50 tools that can help with things like seo press releases content marketing search engine marketing and more while there are plenty of competitors in this space semrush is one of the leading providers of a full suite of services that can handle almost anything that a company can need in the company uses a freemium model to get customers on board they currently have more than 400 000 customers that use their free tools and they ve converted more than 79 000 of them into paying customers brian stoffel to route all of what you just said right there brian into the end user experience and what people see online if you ve ever looked for information on a topic say you re exploring new flooring or something like that for your kitchen and you hit a page that is run by a flooring company with a breakdown of all of the different flooring options in the pros and cons of it that looks a lot more informational than salesy that s a company that s focusing very deliberately on their organic acquisition strategy they re trying to create content that ranks on google that will be part of the funnel for them in acquiring customers like you said it s more of a long term strategy you really have to lay those building blocks in there so that you can rank good content continues to win out over the long term periods but it s a very effective strategy because the acquisition costs are so low once you build that content brian feroldi that s correct it really helps you to build trust and loyalty among your consumers companies that are not focused on this strategy today are really going to miss out in the years to come brian stoffel looking over at the financials for semrush this is a company that has all of the markings of a software as a service provider and accompany that is aggressively investing in its own growth brian perhaps not surprising because we are still in a land grab period when it comes to digital real estate brian feroldi yeah that s correct this company s financial results are what you would expect to see from a software as a service company they are essentially really impressive as of the most recent quarter this company s top line was growing at a 53 percent annualized rate in the most recent quarter they did about 50 million 49 million dollars in sales margins here are very strong the gross margin is 77 percent a very good number now the company is purposely putting as much capital as they can into their sales and marketing to drive continued growth so more than half of the company s gross profit goes into sales and marketing but even with that very high level of spending the company is producing a net loss of during the quarter of just 615 000 that s essentially a break even if you look on an adjusted basis the company is profitable that s exactly what the company should be doing at this stage of its growth phase brian stoffel yeah we talk about it often there s a time where it s ok for a company to not be banking a lot of money on the bottom line if they re in a customer acquisition phase where there are a lot of people playing in this space the opportunity is big and really becoming the default or the industry leader is so much more important than showing short term profits i m sure some people are hearing us talk a little bit about this business and saying i ve seen so many saas companies come public over the last couple of years even as we re talking about this business this probably sounds a little bit like hubspot to some people the core financials for these businesses always looking credible the key tests for me with something like this brian is how do they address the needs of their customers and how does that show up in the numbers that we see from the business what do you see there brian feroldi well the most important number that me and you look for us a dollar based net revenue retention rate that s a metric that shows same customer spending from period to period so it adds in upselling and subtracts out churn and then down selling any number over 100 percent is what you want to see for semrush in the most recent quarter this figure was 124 percent that s a very strong number that is a little bit elevated compared to this company s historic comps one reason for that is because management said they had an easier year over year comparison due to what they saw last year that number clearly indicates that semrush is doing a great job at attracting customers retaining them and up selling them over time that s exactly what i want to see as investors brian stoffel yeah we are customers of this product i reached out to some of the seos at the fool just to see how does this product work within your day to day is it something that s really important whereas it stack up in the industry basically if you re an seo and this is the software that your company has chosen to use their selling and interacting with almost every day to monitor the success of your organic traffic strategies i think the best way to sum up where they fit into this landscape brian is they are not necessarily the top dog in every respect but they offer something pretty compelling across the board for people that are focused in all of these zones brian feroldi yeah if you want to help with just search engine optimization or just with press releases there are lots of different choices that you can go with one thing that makes semrush standard apart from those is that they have more than 50 tools and they are among the leader in dozens of different search engine marketing category this isn t the only solution that s out there but it s one of the most biggest and well known brian stoffel of course it can t be all roses we have to talk about risks when we re looking at businesses as well some of the risks for business like this are going to be familiar to folks to high growth business the valuation is going to be a little bit beyond what we might see for more established companies but if you ve been paying attention to online properties over the last year and a half or so especially ad based businesses there are some risks that are specific to this niche that you got to pay attention to brian feroldi yeah for sure just one broad risk that goes really among all the players in the industry is the gradual disappearance of cookies some marketing companies such as semrush do rely on cookies to help them track and follow their users and create insights from them i think it s just a matter of time before cookies become a complete thing of the past and that might impact semrush s ability service its customers on the flip side that s not a company specific risks that s really for the industrywide there s actually an argument to be made that if cookies disappear it could perhaps enhanced semrush s competitive advantage in the industry but no doubt cookies are something to watch brian stoffel in addition to all the strengths we talked about i wanted to get this one in front of listeners because yes it s accompany that is signposting where the world is going and really how businesses work right now but also it s a relatively small business that is serving a specific market really well and we ve seen a lot of saas companies do that and put up incredible returns for shareholders brian feroldi yeah this company is very much in my sweet spot as an investor it s a leader in the category that is primed for growth the financials are very strong it is a founder led and it clearly has compelling economics working for it when you combine that with the fact that the company s market cap is currently about 2 5 billion it doesn t take a lot of imagination for me to believe that this company could be much bigger in the years ahead if it can continue to execute brian stoffel i think it s particularly compelling brian because if you re interested in investing in mega trends like online search like online ads a lot of business that you are going to be looking at are the likes of alphabet and google or facebook and those are huge companies already it s a little

bottomless arthur hayes follow 12 min read jan 26 2022 19 listen share any views expressed in the below are the personal views of the author and should not form the basis for making investment decisions nor be construed as a recommendation or advice to engage in investment transactions dump eve 8 00 pm scanning the horizon you giddily observe the accumulation of snowflakes the forecast calls for dump and you and the rest of the mountain town can barely contain your glee about the upcoming powder day you prepared accordingly you tuned up your skis with temperature appropriate wax and sharpened the edges these planks of plastic wood and metal are going to fly you made sure to stretch aggressively so that your legs are limber and finally you restrained yourself from getting blasted at the local tavern dump day 6 00 am glorious snow glistens in the faint moonlight it s go time but there are a few hours before the first lift opens it s time to prepare yourself for an epic day of shredding first you check your phone in order to ascertain the magnitude of the dump unfortunately you were a bit distracted because crypto prices also observed an overnight dump to the tune of 10 30 ouchie but the markets are not important it s a fucking powder day the sweet smell of single origin central american floral ground coffee beans fills the kitchen you are stoked to try a new micro lot of panamanian geisha beans you brew a proper pour over filtered coffee and sit down on your mat first breath work then a few light movements to limber up 7 00 am your crew is up and milling about the house everyone is preparing their breakfast and chatting about which runs the group will hit first the order of operations is of utmost importance it has been many moons since the last dump and the ski town is restless the group expects errbody to be searching for the same thing untracked lines on steep faces a plan is formed and everyone filters out to their rooms to get dressed 8 30 am a decision is made the group will work its way skier s rightward across the mountain in order to maximise untouched pow pow the group will avoid the obvious choice to ride the tram or gondola up for the first run not only do these lifts open 30 minutes after the first chair lifts but by the time the group reaches the base of the mountain there is already a line small and tall conifers dot the landscape glades of tightly packed trees invite the intrepid skier it is here the group begins the day s powder journey and it is here where nirvana is first achieved your legs are ready for an incredible acceleration of exertion there are no warm up runs on a powder day you find your lines and hit it standing at the top of a steep section you identify a small boulder with sufficient room to land a jump you cannot know for sure the depth of the snow upon landing but you go for it anyway a few turns in you check your speed before launching yourself off the natural feature there is no turning back now in the air you feel the rush of adrenaline and spot your landing as you touch down the fluffy champagne powder envelops you transformed into a snowy jacques cousteau you can barely see as you snorkel through the snow the landing is filled to an unknown depth of powder it is essentially bottomless you yelp with powder screams of joy and shout to your compatriots signifying your joy at the discovery of bottomless powder 4 00 pm a full beautiful day s worth of skiing is behind you it s time to recount your best turns and tricks with the group while imbibing pitchers of alcoholic libations now that the skiing is done you pull out your phone and take a look at the crypto markets bottomless can both describe your magical day of skiing and the state of the markets as resistance level after resistance level was breached you check the mainstream financial press the authors seem to gloat on how the total crypto market cap has lost upwards of 1 trillion since it s ath it s as if the authors wagged their collective elitist fingers and whispered told ya so but enough with the doom and gloom it s time to go home and prepare for tomorrow an epsom salt bath is in order to sooth your muscles and then it s off to dinner and an early bedtime post dump 9 00 am there was no new snow overnight sad face now you must begin a scavenger hunt for overlooked soft snow the way in which you blithely took turns close to trees and jumped off boulders the day previous is not repeated the ruts and grooves of thousands of turns across the mountain the day prior creates hard packed areas of snow you must scout your landings and turns with more care but there are still pockets of heaven to be found on the mountain it requires taking more aggressive lines and eschewing laziness for a steadfast dedication to the hunt for powder 4 00 pm another solid day of skiing complete with a bit more effort patches of untouched or soft snow were located and shredded again it s time to pull out your phone and observe the state of the markets are crypto valuations still bottomless or have the ruts been filled with the blood and tears of those who closed their positions are we done yet three weeks ago i penned an essay called maelstrom and in it i described the thought process that led me to rationalise my crypto portfolio to holding only bitcoin ether and a handful of shitcoins i really believe in while many appreciated my candor and views there were others who correctly pointed out my bearish essay was published weeks after bitcoin and ether had already slumped over 30 from their ath my essays are just that essays they are i hope cogent pieces of prose that advance a thesis supported by logic and evidence i am not here to help you definitively time the market but rather to challenge your point of view and hopefully help you grow as a trader investor the crypto capital markets are the last free financial markets on earth all other major asset classes and the intermediaries who help people trade these financial products have become political targets of governments and their central bankers when a measure becomes a target it ceases to be a good measure goodhart s law equity fixed income and currency markets are infected with the largesse of central and too big to fail banks that means that they can run infinite leverage on the backs of the taxpayer with the consequence being inflation created by wanton money printing these banks balance sheets are used to pin asset prices to politically expedient levels this benefits the wealthy as in every society the distribution of financial asset ownership is highly concentrated in the top 10 or 1 of the citizenry crypto is wholly outside the tradfi system and thus finds a market clearing level well before stonks or bonds crypto is now a real asset class traded by plebes like us hedge fund masters of the universe and a smattering of sell side banks crypto as the last functioning true free financial market will find a clearing price on the up and downside that reflects the current macro economic environment well before all other assets my belief in the above statement leads me to a bit of a conundrum in the first three weeks of the year the crypto markets traded down sharply the american equity markets and by that i only mean the index prices of the s p 500 and nasdaq 100 are slightly off their all time highs equity markets are certainly not in a true bear market yet but the capital destruction visited upon crypto holders suggests that the future removal of usd liquidity by the federal reserve in their renewed fight against inflation will visit equity index holders in short order that is fine but the fed hasn t even stopped purchasing bonds yet nor have they raised their policy rate would i be too greedy and thus miss an amazing entry point to exchange filthy fiat for clean crypto to wait until the march meeting where the markets forecast the fed to hike rates i can t deny if bitcoin trades below 30 000 and ether 2 000 that my trigger finger on the buy button would get quite excited but does this impatience square up with my mental map of the probability cloud of the future let this be an essay that attempts to allow more flexibility in how one determines it is the right time to buy the fucking dip spread em the us president held a solo press conference last week and affirmatively stated that it is the responsibility of the federal reserve to tame inflation regardless of whether or not you believe the fed is both 100 culpable for high and rising us inflation and or they actually can do something about it with their remit of policy levers the fed politically must raise rates however the fed will never 100 commit to any policy they always leave the door open to change their mind should something blow up spectacularly in the financial markets the question becomes can the fed publicly change its future telegraphed restrictive monetary policy in advance of the march meeting where everyone expects them to raise the policy rate 0 25 here are three possible scenarios where the fed could justify a change of course the s p 500 and or nasdaq 100 trades down at least 30 from it s all time high 3 357 for s p 500 and 11 601 for nasdaq 100 some nook and cranny of the us treasury money markets implodes investment grade high yield corporate bond spreads widen considerably i have spoken at length about the importance of points 1 and 2 to the american global economic model it is well believed that if either of those two scenarios occur the fed might go against the political wishes of the ruling party and turn the money printer back to the brrr setting what is less spoken about is the corporate credit sector mostly because everyone assumes the fed solved that problem when they nationalised the market in march 2020 the fed nationalised the us corporate bond market by backstopping all bonds bbb and above and by indicating they can purchase etfs that hold high yield credit read junk bonds such as hyg the two charts below show how the nationalisation crushed credit default swap spreads the cds spread is a good indication of how much interest a corporate in a particular ratings category must pay to issue bonds high yield spreads cdx hy cdsi gen 5y corp investment grade spreads cdx ig cdsi gen 5y corp left to its own devices the market began demanding high levels of interest for corporate borrowers in the face of a pandemic of unknown severity the red color change the fed said naah naah nah nah the market has the wrong level so let s nationalise it by offering an unlimited backstop of printed money the market if you can call it that any longer exhibited right thought which caused spreads to fall and maintain easy borrowing conditions for sufficiently large corporations unfortunately for small businesses they can t access institutional credit markets so they got fucked the market went sideways and quiet until recently if the fed publicly stated it will contract the size of its balance sheet then how can it maintain its pledge to backstop corporate issuers the backstop necessitates buying or threatening to buy any and all eligible corporate bonds as defined by the fed the market has woken up to this inconsistency and yields have begun a small breakout to the upside this is a problem because in 2022 approximately 332 42 billion worth of non financial us corporate bonds mature source bloomberg terminal a company must either pay back investors with cash on hand or issue new debt to pay back the old debt using 2021 issuance statistics as a benchmark source sifma the amount of debt that must be rolled over represents 17 of the yearly total very few companies have pricing power to offset the pernicious effects of wage and commodity inflation profit margins and earnings must contract therefore free cash flow generation with which to pay back bond holders will decline as inflation continues to ravage america and the world as such the market will demand a higher rate of interest on newly issued bonds if the fed is not actively stomping on spreads via expanding its balance sheet the nightmare scenario for the fed is if the market pulls forward expectations of tighter monetary conditions and requires higher and higher rates of interest for the issuance of corporate bonds if companies can t finance themselves they will reduce activity which means job losses at a very inopportune time politically inflation doesn t necessarily mean someone will lose their job but if a company cannot finance itself because its business cannot stomach the rate of interest demanded by the market then said company will terminate workers i believe that politically 7 unemployment is worse than 7 inflation the fed and their political handlers may soon be forced to choose between more goods and wage inflation or job losses if this sector of the credit markets blows up my bet is on a resumption of easy monetary policies which as we know is positive for the crypto markets market conditions change very quickly and should the market believe the fed does not have their back in the corporate bond sector spreads will widen rapidly the play is not to wait for the fed to publicly announce its change of heart but to use the signals provided by these indices as an indication of an imminent pivot crypto will pick up on these signals and trade higher well in advance of a public announcement by the fed about its change in policy resistance levels 28 500 btc usd 1 700 eth usd i don t believe in a bottom until these levels are retested if the level holds amazing this prong has been met if it doesn t then i believe a mega liquidation candle will happen in the 20 000 to 28 500 range for btc and the 1 300 to 1 700 range for ether if either of bitcoin s 2017 and ether s 2018 previous ath 20 000 and 1 400 respectively are breached on a daily candle then i don t even want to think about it maybe bitcoin never breaches 30 000 and or ether never tests 2 000 the market never provides a perfect setup in the absence of a clear test of prior trend channel lows then things become a bit more touchy feely depending on your ideological view of capital markets you may look at one or more statistics such as total open interest on leveraged trading platforms net on chain stablecoin inflows into exchanges growth in the aum of select exchange listed products implied vs realised volatility levels etc a sure thang one can dream about a setup where the fed turns on the tap at the same time bitcoin and ether hold the bottom of the current trend channel however i am pretty certain that ain t happening we must be more flexible in our thinking about which signals inject confidence into our hands so that we can buy buy buy and buy some more but as i write this essay the market like my recently experienced tree skiing powder day is bottomless the traditional markets have not intimidated the fed enough to stop channeling their love for cervantes and cease flailing at windmills that billow with the winds of inflation as far as price action goes over my many years as a participant in the crypto capital markets dumps come in waves this past weekend while brutal has not broken the soul of the bulls remember that the marginal seller determines the price the institutional hoard that holds a small amount of crypto in aggregate will puke it with no abandon if their portfolios of bonds and equities get the stick they haven t started selling yet they don t work on weekends and negative headlines in the mainstream financial media does not provide the confirmatory bias needed for these sell side suckers to stomach the volatility of crypto on the downside the correlation one moment is upon us but is not here yet if the s p 500 and nasdaq continue sliding into the quarter end watch out if it ain t tied to a post with an hermès tie or nailed into the

workers attach labels to bottles of brown forman s jack daniel s single barrel select tennessee whiskey at the company s distillery in lynchburg tennessee in may 2021 photographer luke sharrett bloomberg 2021 bloomberg finance lp the securities and exchange commission charged the creator of the defunct whiskey etf yesterday with defrauding investors david bolton was charged with defrauding investors in a venture to organize and operate exchange traded funds in violation of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws according to the sec s complaint bolton formed millennia shares to launch and maintain exchange traded funds the complaint alleges that bolton solicited ten investors who invested approximately 800 000 in millennia shares between august 2018 and may 2019 the complaint alleged bolton misappropriated at least 215 000 or more than a quarter of the investor contributed funds for his personal use two years prior to the alleged sec violation bolton launched the spirited funds etfmg whiskey and spirits etf he was chief executive officer of spirited funds which created the underlying index it was best known for its ticker symbol wsky the fund was operated by the etf managers group a white label firm in new jersey the sec complaint had nothing to do with the etf or etfmg the sec seeks against bolton permanent injunctions disgorgement of ill gotten gains plus interest civil penalties and an officer and director bar according to the complaint the alleged fraud started just two months after the whiskey etf shut down in june 2018 due to lack of demand launched in october 2016 wsky was a narrowly constructed thematic etf which held the publicly traded stocks of some of the largest producers of alcohol such as diageo deo remy cointreau remyy and pernod richard prndy over its 21 month lifetime it posted a return of 32 vs the s p 500 s 34 over the same period according to eric balchunas senior etf analyst at bloomberg intelligence i would put this in the top ten wackiest etfs that ever launched said balchunas if you re a theme etf you have to be up a lot more than the market to get attention you have to be double the s p 500 to have a shiny object moment many of us were calling this the poster child of what was wrong with thematic etf investing little did we know how big an outlier this truly was said todd rosenbluth head of etf and mutual fund research at cfra research the appeal of thematic etfs was that they provided diversified exposure to a long term investment trend without having to try to pick winners it was then and remains hard to see the long term investment case for an alcohol focused etf and the universe of companies tied to the theme is likely pretty narrow rosenbluth added that the etf never saw much demand raising only 15 million in assets and was more known for its niche focus and eye catching ticker he said before investors buy they have to believe the theme has long term staying power as an investment and that the companies inside the etf are appropriate investments and capture the theme as intended a catchy ticker will not help your portfolio over time said rosenbluth bolton also ran afoul of regulators just before the etf launched in august 2018 right before the time of the sec complaint the financial industry regulatory authority finra found him in violation of its rules in april 2016 just two months before the etf launched a complaint was filed against bolton for unsuitable trading and for stealing the files related to the trading causing a member firm to maintain inaccurate books and records between october 2011 and february 2016 he was also charged with failing to preserve books and records because he later destroyed the files bolton was fined 20 000 and suspended from associating with any finra member firm in any capacity for one year during that year the sec complaint allegedly occurred bolton could not be reached for comment
on may 22 2008 i purchased 300 shares of bank of america bac for my rrsp at 34 66 per share at an exchange of c 1 00 per us 1 00 as i recall i sold most of my oil stocks when oil was in the range of 140 to 150 and i was looking for a bargain to redeploy the cash american bank stocks had already taken a big hit with bac down 20 00 or about 35 per cent exciting for a bargain hunter like me the housing crisis subsequent recession and bear market were well on their way but little did i anticipate the financial tornado that was yet to unfold having successfully navigated the 2000 02 bear market i hubristically thought i could similarly outrun the 2008 bear as every hiker knows you can t outrun a bear advertisement read also the facts we stumble over when i undertook field research trials in alberta in the 1970s on fungicides and insecticides for disease and insect control my bac shares bounced around from may until september before the trap door opened falling a further 90 per cent in the next five months hitting a low of three bucks many american banks crashed similarly coincident with a 55 per cent decline in the s p 500 advertisement as the economy was healing on august 5 2011 i purchased 150 shares of a fellow american bank jpmorgan chase jpm for 37 80 at an exchange of c 0 99 per us 1 00 rather than buy more shares of the same bank i chose to diversify fast forward banks and lifecos perform better in higher interest rate environments rates rose last winter with 10 year bonds moving from paying 1 0 to 1 7 per cent taking bank stocks along with them after this run up in march i sold these shares bac was sold for c 36 55 at a 1 26 exchange and the jpm for c 154 65 at a 1 25 exchange my bac profit was effectively just the conversion rate plus dividends a rather paltry return over 13 years but better than a loss jpm on the other hand gained four times plus dividends an excellent return over a decade i still hold 200 of bac and 100 of jpm what does this story illustrate hubris isn t a good trait in any pursuit especially investing mistakes are common stocks can recover from massive declines if so it s likely to be a long road you might wonder why i held bac for so long while conventional wisdom suggests losers be sold whether i bought at 3 00 or held existing shares those shares delivered 12 times in 12 years from their low an exceptional return some of the best returns can be achieved in recovery naturally it s better to buy at the bottom if possible advertisement every loser contains a visceral lesson one of the benefits of holding a loser is the perpetual reminder of that lesson a recovery is dependent on positive cash flows and profitability bac has been profitable every year since 2011 if an industry is in complete disarray but also represents good value and is recovering it can be helpful to pick a different name to diversify within the industry this leads to more holdings while reducing risk i didn t sell because i thought bac and jpm were grossly overvalued rather banks became too large a portion of my rrsp after the surge and still represent 15 per cent of my u s based rrsp holdings advertisement the stock market doesn t care what you paid for a stock and neither should you any decision to buy more hold or sell should be based on current valuation and balance within your portfolio although to be fair it feels good to recover an initial investment and be rewarded for patience and perseverance isn t this fun and challenging all at the same time big question is the oil and gas industry at the same juncture as u s banks in 2011 only time will tell but i think there are distinct similarities including society s incessant beating on the industry oil stocks took a tumble mid summer due to delta variant concerns however an article on bloomberg com suggested worldwide oil consumption was 98 million barrels per day or 98 per cent of pre covid levels and inventories continued to decline american crude oil inventory was at the low end of its five year range with gasoline inventory actually below its five year range this prompted president biden in an extreme display of political and environmental hypocrisy to plea with opec to increase production proving once again when push comes to shove politicians lose their principles more importantly and my sarcasm aside it illustrates how sentiment can change

gallipolis ohio jan 27 2022 prnewswire ohio valley banc corp the company reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended december 31 2021 of 2 304 000 a decrease of 2 396 000 from the same period the prior year earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 were 48 compared to 98 for the prior year fourth quarter for the year ended december 31 2021 net income totaled 11 732 000 an increase of 1 473 000 or 14 4 from the prior year earnings per share were 2 45 for 2021 versus 2 14 for 2020 return on average assets and return on average equity were 95 and 8 45 respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 94 and 7 83 respectively for the prior year when i think of 2021 the word perseverance comes to mind after all this was the year we were to put covid 19 behind us and return to normal said tom wiseman chairman and ceo of the company instead we dealt with new variants delta and omicron and shuffled our workforce and hours of operation to be there for our customers though the pandemic left us short staffed at times our folks persevered through it all to deliver the outstanding financial services our customers have come to expect as a result we close the books on 2021 with the second highest annual net income earned in the company s history the successful launch of race day mortgage ohio valley bank s new online consumer direct mortgage subsidiary and the continued pursuit of our community first mission proves that perseverance does pay off for the fourth quarter of 2021 net interest income increased 290 000 and for the year ended december 31 2021 net interest income increased 1 031 000 from the same period last year contributing to the increase in net interest income was the growth in average earning assets which was partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended december 31 2021 average earning assets increased 132 million from the prior year the increase was partly due to average loans which increased 30 million from last year due to higher commercial loan balances in general commercial loan demand has been positive in our markets particularly in the counties of pike and athens in ohio and cabell county in west virginia in addition the company participated in the sba s paycheck protection program ppp to assist various businesses in our market during the pandemic the loan fees earned in association with the ppp loans for the year ended december 31 2021 totaled 1 183 000 an increase of 479 000 from the prior year as of december 31 2021 there were 446 000 in ppp loans still outstanding with 15 000 in deferred fees yet to be recognized also contributing to earning asset growth was the 58 million increase in average balances maintained at the federal reserve and a 44 million increase in average security balances in relation to the various stimulus payments received by customers the company experienced a significant increase in deposit balances a portion of the increase in deposits was invested in the securities portfolio and to the extent those deposits are not invested in loans or securities they are invested at the federal reserve to be readily available for future funding needs the earnings contribution from the higher balance of earning assets was partly offset by a decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended december 31 2021 the net interest margin was 3 61 compared to 3 97 for the prior year the decrease was primarily related to the actions taken by the federal reserve to reduce interest rates by 150 basis points in march of 2020 in relation to the decrease in market rates the company experienced a greater decrease in yield on earning assets than the average cost on interest bearing liabilities this trend was partly due to certain deposits already being at or near their interest rate floor which limited the company s ability to reduce deposit costs to the same magnitude as experienced on earning assets furthermore the current rate on balances maintained at the federal reserve is 15 and when combined with the heightened balances it had a dilutive effect on the net interest margin for the three months ended december 31 2021 the provision for loan losses was negative 301 000 an increase of 170 000 from the same period last year the negative provision expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily related to having net recoveries on charged off loans in addition the net recoveries lowered the historical loss factors contributing to lower general reserves for the year ended december 31 2021 the provision for loan losses was negative 419 000 a decrease of 3 399 000 from the same period last year the decrease in provision for loan loss expense was due to a decrease in net loan charge offs of 1 834 000 and to a decrease in the provision expense associated with the establishment of an economic risk factor for the pandemic during the first quarter of 2020 the establishment of this risk factor resulted in additional provision expense of 1 942 000 in the first quarter of 2020 the allowance for loan losses was 78 of total loans at december 31 2021 compared to 84 at december 31 2020 the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans improved to 56 at december 31 2021 compared to 82 at december 31 2020 for the three months ended december 31 2021 noninterest income totaled 1 407 000 a decrease of 906 000 from the same period last year for the year ended december 31 2021 noninterest income totaled 9 864 000 a decrease of 1 574 000 from the same period last year the primary reason for the decrease in year to date noninterest income was due to the receipt of a 2 000 000 settlement payment from a third party tax software product provider for early termination of its contract during the first quarter of 2020 as part of the settlement agreement the ohio valley bank company the bank is processing a certain amount of tax items which started in 2021 and will end in 2025 for the year ended december 31 2021 the bank recognized 675 000 of additional income under the agreement also generating lower noninterest income for the quarter and year to date periods was the loss on the sale of securities during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company sold 49 million in lower yielding securities at a loss of 1 066 000 the proceeds were reinvested in similar higher yielding securities which are expected to increase future interest income contributing to higher noninterest revenue was interchange income on debit and credit card transactions as customers increased spending interchange income increased 156 000 or 15 2 during the three months ended december 31 2021 and 613 000 or 15 2 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same periods in 2020 respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 the company experienced lower mortgage banking income following the heightened refinance boom that occurred during 2020 as a result mortgage banking income decreased 400 000 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 for the three months ended december 31 2021 noninterest expense totaled 9 327 000 an increase of 2 206 000 from the same period last year for the year ended december 31 2021 noninterest expense totaled 37 280 000 an increase of 1 147 000 or 3 2 from the same period last year the company s largest noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits increased 842 000 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased 13 000 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the quarterly increase was partly related to staffing the new mortgage subsidiary race day mortgage also during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company increased performance based compensation in association with the improved financial performance achieved in 2021 lastly we experienced higher workers compensation premiums in relation to receiving refunds in 2020 that were not replicated in 2021 further contributing to higher noninterest expense was an increase in software expense data processing marketing and fdic insurance expense during the three and twelve months ended december 31 2021 software expense increased 168 000 and 404 000 respectively as compared to the same periods in 2020 the increase was related to the purchase of software to enhance the platform used for the loan origination process as well as to process ppp loans data processing expense increased 175 000 during the three months ended december 31 2021 and increased 236 000 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same periods in 2020 the increase was primarily related to the higher credit and debit card transaction volume in relation to the heightened consumer spending for the three months and twelve months ended december 31 2021 marketing expense increased 416 000 and 213 000 respectively from the same periods last year the increase was related to resuming select marketing campaigns in 2021 that had been limited in 2020 due to covid restrictions on lobby access for the year ended december 31 2021 fdic insurance expense increased 161 000 from the same period in 2020 the increase was primarily due to assessment credits received from the fdic in 2020 that were not received in 2021 lastly during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company redeemed 3 2 million in long term federal home loan bank advances that were used to fund fixed rate loans to manage interest rate risk the specific loans being funded were paid off which permitted the company to redeem the advances by redeeming the advances a prepayment penalty of 186 000 was incurred the redemption of debt will reduce interest expense going forward the company s total assets at december 31 2021 were 1 250 billion an increase of 63 million from december 31 2020 the increase in assets was related to a 65 million increase in securities the growth in securities was linked to investing the heightened deposit balances received during 2021 at december 31 2021 total deposits had increased 66 million from year end primarily as a result of customers receiving stimulus payments ohio valley banc corp common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market under the

has the risk of a full blown bear market risen on wall street a standard issue correction has already arrived for the nasdaq composite however the larger question is whether tighter central bank policies in the western world will lead to deeper declines than we have already seen in major averages and among individual stocks many years ago legendary investor stanley druckenmiller told me that his historical analysis suggested that there are two triggers for meaningful bear markets in stocks rising interest rates and the onset of war now we seem to be staring down the barrel of both as the federal reserve has now acknowledged that it plans rate hikes throughout this year and a reduction in its holdings of treasury bonds meanwhile saber rattling is taking place from the kremlin to kyiv and from tiananmen to taiwan get connecticut local news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc connecticut newsletters the fed s balance sheet reduction known as quantitative tightening would be a powerful addition to rate hikes in reducing surplus liquidity in markets if history is any guide it would also further weaken equity markets over the course of the tightening cycle just the threat of these events prior to the fed s admissions knocked markets for a loop wringing out speculative excesses in cryptocurrencies meme stocks and spacs or special purpose acquisition companies amc entertainment and gamestop shares are each down about 80 from their memetic highs shares of robinhood and coinbase have been robbed weak assets fall first before being followed by the market s less risky bets the nyse advance decline line is rolling over while the number of new 52 week lows has exploded true some sentiment indicators like the vix or fear indicator recently reached extremes suggesting an oversold rally would ensue yet i don t believe this tumult is nearly over in the intermediate to longer term a time of heightened risk around the world geopolitical risks are rising rapidly the u s has put troops on alert and nato has placed forces on standby and reinforced positions in eastern europe as the threat of a russian invasion of ukraine continues to rise nato allies are also reportedly sending weapons to ukraine to shore up its defenses russia was pessimistic on washington s response to its demands that ukraine never enter nato earlier this week the u s state department told family members of diplomats and embassy staff to leave ukraine a sign of growing concern that russian president vladimir putin is not bluffing this is a belief buttressed by the 100 000 russian troops weaponry and logistical support amassed on ukraine s border and reports that putin is attempting to install a pro russian president in kyiv also it s interesting to note that russian stocks which performed well last year in lockstep with oil prices have tumbled in 2022 against a backdrop of rising oil prices and a flight to quality into u s treasury bonds the combined messages from those markets appear menacing add to those concerns renewed chinese flyovers in taiwan which prompted the taiwanese air force to scramble and chase 39 fighter planes away over the past weekend if there is even an economic war between the west and russia resulting in stiff sanctions like cutting off russian energy exports blocking russia from using swift a mechanism for international financial transfers or placing export controls on goods heading to russia the global economic stakes rise dramatically the stakes are even higher if putin and china s president xi jinping are coordinating their efforts to destabilize western alliances and fracture already frayed relations such a set of developments could freeze central banks in place and result in a friendlier fed that would be relatively better for risk assets but far from a friendly overall environment especially given a three year bull run lofty valuations and speculative excesses in some corners of global markets the pandemic induced bear market in 2020 lasted 21 trading days as the s p 500 tumbled 34 in the most compressed bear phase on record i m considerably less optimistic that the next bear market if this is indeed the start of one will be over so quickly or do so little damage cash may no longer be trash in 2022 ron insana is a cnbc contributor and a senior advisor at schroders

renewable energy such as solar power over the next five years the plan announced in november has the objectives of enabling mississippi to gain an edge in recruiting industry while also safeguarding entergy customers from volatile natural gas prices entergy has also created new and innovative methods to help industrial customers meet their sustainability goals while many of those customers have long term net zero carbon emissions goals even more have developed shorter term interim goals that require action by the next decade clean electrification and green tariffs are two customer solutions opportunities entergy is leveraging to help customers reduce their scope 2 emissions for example entergy s innovative shore power program enables marine vessels docked at the gulf s port fourchon which plays a role in providing 20 of the nation s oil supply to replace their fossil fuel generated ship power with clean electricity from entergy s grid while docked at port the program facilitates significant reductions in carbon sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides emissions when comparing emissions rates of marine diesel fuel to entergy s at the plug emissions rate entergy is also seeking to facilitate the use of green tariffs for customers looking to meet energy and sustainability goals more than 700 megawatts of combined new green tariff capacity have been proposed in louisiana arkansas and mississippi to help customers meet their own sustainability goals and these tariffs will be scaled up based upon customers needs the progress we ve made reducing carbon emissions from our power

gallipolis ohio jan 27 2022 prnewswire ohio valley banc corp the company reported consolidated net income for the quarter ended december 31 2021 of 2 304 000 a decrease of 2 396 000 from the same period the prior year earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2021 were 48 compared to 98 for the prior year fourth quarter for the year ended december 31 2021 net income totaled 11 732 000 an increase of 1 473 000 or 14 4 from the prior year earnings per share were 2 45 for 2021 versus 2 14 for 2020 return on average assets and return on average equity were 95 and 8 45 respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 compared to 94 and 7 83 respectively for the prior year when i think of 2021 the word perseverance comes to mind after all this was the year we were to put covid 19 behind us and return to normal said tom wiseman chairman and ceo of the company instead we dealt with new variants delta and omicron and shuffled our workforce and hours of operation to be there for our customers though the pandemic left us short staffed at times our folks persevered through it all to deliver the outstanding financial services our customers have come to expect as a result we close the books on 2021 with the second highest annual net income earned in the company s history the successful launch of race day mortgage ohio valley bank s new online consumer direct mortgage subsidiary and the continued pursuit of our community first mission proves that perseverance does pay off for the fourth quarter of 2021 net interest income increased 290 000 and for the year ended december 31 2021 net interest income increased 1 031 000 from the same period last year contributing to the increase in net interest income was the growth in average earning assets which was partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended december 31 2021 average earning assets increased 132 million from the prior year the increase was partly due to average loans which increased 30 million from last year due to higher commercial loan balances in general commercial loan demand has been positive in our markets particularly in the counties of pike and athens in ohio and cabell county in west virginia in addition the company participated in the sba s paycheck protection program ppp to assist various businesses in our market during the pandemic the loan fees earned in association with the ppp loans for the year ended december 31 2021 totaled 1 183 000 an increase of 479 000 from the prior year as of december 31 2021 there were 446 000 in ppp loans still outstanding with 15 000 in deferred fees yet to be recognized also contributing to earning asset growth was the 58 million increase in average balances maintained at the federal reserve and a 44 million increase in average security balances in relation to the various stimulus payments received by customers the company experienced a significant increase in deposit balances a portion of the increase in deposits was invested in the securities portfolio and to the extent those deposits are not invested in loans or securities they are invested at the federal reserve to be readily available for future funding needs the earnings contribution from the higher balance of earning assets was partly offset by a decrease in the net interest margin for the year ended december 31 2021 the net interest margin was 3 61 compared to 3 97 for the prior year the decrease was primarily related to the actions taken by the federal reserve to reduce interest rates by 150 basis points in march of 2020 in relation to the decrease in market rates the company experienced a greater decrease in yield on earning assets than the average cost on interest bearing liabilities this trend was partly due to certain deposits already being at or near their interest rate floor which limited the company s ability to reduce deposit costs to the same magnitude as experienced on earning assets furthermore the current rate on balances maintained at the federal reserve is 15 and when combined with the heightened balances it had a dilutive effect on the net interest margin for the three months ended december 31 2021 the provision for loan losses was negative 301 000 an increase of 170 000 from the same period last year the negative provision expense for the fourth quarter of 2021 was primarily related to having net recoveries on charged off loans in addition the net recoveries lowered the historical loss factors contributing to lower general reserves for the year ended december 31 2021 the provision for loan losses was negative 419 000 a decrease of 3 399 000 from the same period last year the decrease in provision for loan loss expense was due to a decrease in net loan charge offs of 1 834 000 and to a decrease in the provision expense associated with the establishment of an economic risk factor for the pandemic during the first quarter of 2020 the establishment of this risk factor resulted in additional provision expense of 1 942 000 in the first quarter of 2020 the allowance for loan losses was 78 of total loans at december 31 2021 compared to 84 at december 31 2020 the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans improved to 56 at december 31 2021 compared to 82 at december 31 2020 for the three months ended december 31 2021 noninterest income totaled 1 407 000 a decrease of 906 000 from the same period last year for the year ended december 31 2021 noninterest income totaled 9 864 000 a decrease of 1 574 000 from the same period last year the primary reason for the decrease in year to date noninterest income was due to the receipt of a 2 000 000 settlement payment from a third party tax software product provider for early termination of its contract during the first quarter of 2020 as part of the settlement agreement the ohio valley bank company the bank is processing a certain amount of tax items which started in 2021 and will end in 2025 for the year ended december 31 2021 the bank recognized 675 000 of additional income under the agreement also generating lower noninterest income for the quarter and year to date periods was the loss on the sale of securities during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company sold 49 million in lower yielding securities at a loss of 1 066 000 the proceeds were reinvested in similar higher yielding securities which are expected to increase future interest income contributing to higher noninterest revenue was interchange income on debit and credit card transactions as customers increased spending interchange income increased 156 000 or 15 2 during the three months ended december 31 2021 and 613 000 or 15 2 during the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same periods in 2020 respectively for the year ended december 31 2021 the company experienced lower mortgage banking income following the heightened refinance boom that occurred during 2020 as a result mortgage banking income decreased 400 000 for the year ended december 31 2021 as compared to the same period in 2020 for the three months ended december 31 2021 noninterest expense totaled 9 327 000 an increase of 2 206 000 from the same period last year for the year ended december 31 2021 noninterest expense totaled 37 280 000 an increase of 1 147 000 or 3 2 from the same period last year the company s largest noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits increased 842 000 as compared to the fourth quarter of 2020 and increased 13 000 as compared to the year ended december 31 2020 the quarterly increase was partly related to staffing the new mortgage subsidiary race day mortgage also during the fourth quarter of 2021 the company increased performance based compensation in association with the improved financial performance achieved in 2021 lastly we experienced higher workers compensation premiums in relation to receiving refunds in 2020 that were not replicated in 2021 further contributing to higher noninterest expense was an increase in software expense data processing marketing and fdic insurance expense during the three and twelve months ended december 31 2021 software expense increased 168 000 and 404 000 respectively as compared to the same periods in 2020 the increase was related to the purchase of software to enhance the platform used for the loan origination process as well as to

strong shareholder returns culminating in an rotce of 18 89 for the year 10 stocks we like better than alerus financial corp when our award winning analyst team has a stock tip it can pay to listen after all the newsletter they have run for over a decade motley fool stock advisor has tripled the market they just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and alerus financial corp wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 10 2022 our performance is anchored in our diversified business model and fee income for the year was 63 of total revenue maintaining our exceptional levels of fee income continues to be a high priority for our company our mortgage team was again a significant contributor to our results in 2021 as a reminder the 48 5 million of the reported mortgage revenue includes the offset of the hedge unwinds of 8 5 million i m proud of our team who surpassed the record volume in 2020 and finished the year over 1 8 billion of originations in addition we maintained margins and pull through due to our continued industry leading execution alerus has invested in technology and our team members and clients have embraced the option with 91 of the over 5 500 clients served through digital channels you ve heard me say this before alerus is a special company and our mortgage division is special in itself we ve had a high level of repeat business with clients and most of our volume has historically been focused on purchase business we have an exceptional reputation and a great team although the industry statistics are again projecting a 30 decrease in volume in 2022 alerus is a company that outperform we believe we can push to keep our decline closer to 20 in volume in 2022 a decline but still outperforming the industry in our retirement and benefits division we ve surpassed revenue of 71 million and the client base of alerus many of whom see us as their primary source of information for retirement readiness surpassed 440 000 participants our retirement and hsa business is also a significant source of deposits and new balances grew 73 million to total 669 million this year s revenue included approximately 2 5 million of document restatement fees as we ve discussed on previous calls these are recurring but not annual fees we will look to replace both fees with new revenue generation and anticipate holding revenue at 2021 levels our wealth management team members brought peace of mind through advice and planning to more clients than ever with 527 million of new production and assets under management including four consecutive months of new production greater than 50 million here too alerus technology investments shine with a few clicks distribution rollovers are invested managed and a team member is proactively reaching out to understand goals and help establish a plan we rolled out this digital option in late q3 and ended the year with 360 accounts open we have exceptional momentum in this area and have been successful in recruiting experienced talent although the market could be a headwind we look to continue to grow revenue at nearly the same pace in 2022 as we did in 2021 the banking and commercial units of alerus had another strong year our team members have done a great job in serving our commercial clients in total alerus closed 2 500 ppp loans over 20 of our portfolio through the program that puts alerus in the top quartile in the country in 2021 we continued to expand relationships with the new clients we acquired because of ppp overall loan growth was as expected for the fourth quarter while loan production for the year reached new levels we continue to feel the headwind of historical loan utilization and several significant payouts we grew our deposit base by 14 in 2021 which included 450 million in new account balances as team members continue to excel in expanding commercial relationships and treasury management from a balance sheet perspective we opted to invest excess liquidity and pull earnings into equity we more than doubled the size of our investment portfolio and although this has been a drag on net interest margin the move resulted in year over year earnings on the portfolio increasing by 5 million karin will cover credit quality but it is worth repeating that although we released reserves in q4 our allowance continues to remain at a robust level and we look to grow into this balance throughout 2022 and beyond while we exceeded expectations in revenue expenses for the quarter were in line our team members execution in controlling costs continue and we delivered another solid quarter of managed expenses we continue to extract efficiencies in processes operations and facilities closures while growing our client base and engaging clients in our digital offerings looking ahead into 2022 we are looking to continue our execution in cost control and excluding the metro transaction projecting flat expenses we certainly acknowledge and are feeling the wage pressure in current positions as well as in new hires during 2021 we converted and integrated our denver fee income acquisition with nearly 100 client retention we lifted out a highly sought after and nationally recognized sba team this team engaged immediately and production has exceeded expectations we also announced our 25th acquisition of a high performing high growth commercial focused bank in the robust phoenix arizona market our strong earnings and the rebuild of capital through amortization of the purchase price for acquisitions drove a growth in tangible book by 12 in 2021 organic growth remains a priority in addition to our constant focus on building pipelines and acquisition targets and partners in the fee income space i ll now turn it over to karin and then we will open it up for questions karin taylor chief risk officer thank you katie and good morning everyone our pandemic related programs continue to wind down over the past quarter as of january 19 ppp loan balances forgiven totaled 443 million or about 93 of that portfolio leaving approximately 25 million in balances on the books 3 3 million in loans remain on deferral primarily in the residential real estate portfolio credit metrics continued to improve over the fourth quarter as several long term workouts were resolved resulting in a decrease in nonperforming loans to total loans to 12 basis points down from 35 basis points at the end of the third quarter in addition we recorded net recoveries for the quarter of 1 million as a result we released 1 5 million in reserves in the fourth quarter bringing our allowance to total loans excluding ppp loans to 1 83 our team remained agile and resilient over the past quarter despite increased illness and exposures of the omicron variant surge to our markets our teams remain focused on serving clients commercial line utilization dropped to 17 its lowest point in five years while excess liquidity in the system remains challenging loan production met expectations for the quarter and loans net of ppp increased by 27 million or 1 62 in the linked quarter the increase was driven by growth in the commercial real estate and residential real estate first mortgage portfolios market demand for both c i and cre loans continues to improve across our footprint our business advisors remain focused on building their pipelines and momentum is strong early in the first quarter that concludes our prepared remarks and we ll open it up for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from jeff rulis from d a davidson jeff please go ahead jeff rulis d a davidson companies analyst thanks good morning just a follow on on the loan growth or the demand i think karin you touched on that toward the end but do you happen to have linked quarter payoff activity or payoff levels as well as the pipeline quarter over quarter karin taylor chief risk officer i can tell you that our that the payoff activity continued to be elevated through the quarter i don t have the exact numbers still jeff rulis d a davidson companies analyst ok so it s similar you saw similar payoffs in 3q versus 4q karin taylor chief risk officer yes and in fact we had a couple i m sorry we had a couple large paydowns on lines of credit at the end of the year and that contribute obviously to that loan utilization jeff rulis d a davidson companies analyst ok so you talked about demand picking up and i guess just high level thoughts on net growth in 22 i guess ex the ppp is exiting here but just in general katie lorenson chairman president and chief executive officer yeah we still believe that mid to high single digits for the alerus balance sheet and then of course we are still on track with the for the metro deal with all the projections that we gave back in december in that regard we do intend to pull back on some of their participations sold within the metro transaction so we expect mid to high single digits for our growth and high to double digits for the metro balance sheet jeff rulis d a davidson companies analyst great thank you the ppp fees linked quarter do you have those and also what s remaining katie lorenson chairman president and chief executive officer yes there s about 1 million remaining and in the linked quarter let me come back to you on that one jeff jeff rulis d a davidson companies analyst ok no problem i ll just close with maybe one quick last one just housekeeping one on the provision levels karin any expectations for more of an expectation to grow into reserves so would you expect a provision expense in 22 karin taylor chief risk officer i think jeff that s a good way to look at it we expect that as our required reserve related to economic factors decreases as things continue to improve that we would expect that loan growth would offset that at this point we don t see any significant credit deterioration on the horizon and jeff on the for ppp fees and revenue we had 2 2 million in the fourth quarter compared to approximately 2 million in the third quarter so fairly consistent levels jeff rulis d a davidson companies analyst thank you operator thank you jeff our next question comes from nathan race from piper sandler nathan please go ahead nathan race piper sandler analyst yes hi good morning katie and karin katie lorenson chairman president and chief executive officer good morning nathan race piper sandler analyst on the retirement and benefit services revenue obviously a really strong 2021 the rps deal obviously helped to that extent but i imagine you guys are still seeing some opportunities to offset some of the natural attrition within aua within that line of business so i guess how you guys kind of think about rb s revenue growth in 2022 i guess any market volatility that we may see karin taylor chief risk officer right right yeah we certainly had 2021 was strong for a number of reasons of course the denver acquisition and our growth in retention and then the markets were strong and we also had the restatement fees which again are recurring but they re not annual in nature and so those were approximately 2 5 million of the revenue in 2021 and so our outlook for 2022 is to replace that revenue with new business generation so we expect revenue to be fairly flat in 2022 versus 2021 nathan race piper sandler analyst got it very helpful and then maybe just thinking about the expense growth outlook for 2022 obviously you guys have been well ahead of most peers in terms of investing in technology but within that context i understand that that process is never really over and i imagine you guys will have the benefit to some extent in terms of salary expenses coming down in 2022 with lower anticipated mortgage volumes but i also understand that you guys probably expect to outperform the industrywide volume expectations just given some of the hires that you guys have made over the last several quarters so katie i mean maybe high level thoughts just in terms of what you guys are expecting for expense growth on a year over year basis in 2022 katie lorenson chairman president and chief executive officer yes so we are targeting to hold alerus expenses flat with 2021 and metro adds about 5 or so million to that run rate and then of course we ll have some we ll have estimated transaction expenses are approximately 3 million nathan race piper sandler analyst ok so kind of flat on a operating karin taylor chief risk officer right right right which will be a challenge given the wage pressure of course that we re seeing but from a technology investment etc we are looking to hold in that regard nathan race piper sandler analyst ok perfect and then just maybe turning to capital you guys are still operating with ample excess dry powder so to speak and so i would just love to get an update in terms of what you guys are seeing in additional potential acquisition opportunities and within that context if we can expect the dividend to kind of remain near its current levels and just any updated thoughts on the buyback particularly given some valuation pressures not only on alerus but industrywide over the last several weeks here katie lorenson chairman president and chief executive officer ok we continue to evaluate on the dividend and the stock buyback from an acquisition standpoint on the fee income side continue to build the pipeline companies are generally performing quite well and so there is not a huge appetite for selling right now and exiting the business and that being said we re just putting more lines out there and when these companies do look to exit we believe that that will be the first phone call and so as short term or where we sit today we do anticipate that that s the best opportunity organic growth as well as those fee income acquisitions to deploy capital but are continuing to evaluate the buyback as well as dividend increases nathan race piper sandler analyst ok perfect and if i could just ask one more on just overall balance sheet dynamics you guys are not only having good synergistic deposit growth it sounds like you guys also had some deposit growth just given some of the factors going on kind of from an industrywide macro perspective so just any thoughts on just kind of how the earning asset base trajects into this year do you expect some growth just given continued synergistic deposit growth opportunities and should we just kind of expect a remix of the earning assets just given that mid to high single digit loan growth outlook that you described earlier katie lorenson chairman president and chief executive officer yes that is right in regards to we re looking for that mix to change but believe the asset base will hold fairly steady at this point nathan race piper sandler analyst ok great i appreciate you guys taking all the questions and all the color thank you guys on a great quarter operator thank you this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to katie lorenson for any closing remarks katie lorenson chairman president and chief executive officer thank you we finished the year with a level of momentum higher than we ve ever felt in this company and although we face headwinds like others in this industry i am excited about our future 2022 and beyond alerus is positioned to emerge with a stronger than ever alerus culture and approach to growing our company and expanding relationships i m excited to see the alerus team members continue to shine in 2022 by working together to grow we thank our team members our board of directors and all of our shareholders for their investment and continued support and interest in our company again thank you for joining and listening to today s call have a good day everyone

a specific tobacco category or segment refer to existing adult tobacco consumers 21 years of age or older with that i ll turn the call over to billy billy gifford chief executive officer thanks mac good morning and thank you for joining us altria delivered outstanding results in 2021 across our businesses including strong financial performance progress toward our vision and advancements in our esg efforts this morning we ll highlight our accomplishment in each of these areas first altria grew its 2021 adjusted diluted earnings per share by 5 7 driven in part by the resiliency of our cigarette cigar and moist smokeless tobacco businesses additionally we returned more than 8 1 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases this total represents the third largest single year cash return in altria s history and the largest annual return since 2002 we have continued to make progress toward our vision of responsibly leading the transition of adult smokers to a smoke free future our teams took several steps forward in 2021 including accelerating the retail share growth of on and further enhancing the capabilities to expand heated tobacco and other new u s tobacco products advancing the science research and development behind our smoke free products advocating for tobacco harm reduction by encouraging the fda and other stakeholders to address the widely held nicotine misperceptions in society and we made excellent strides in establishing a best in class consumer engagement system to support smoker transition to smoke free products our system leverages robust transactional data and our advanced analytic capabilities to engage with consumers at the point of purchase finally some of our achievements across our responsibility focus areas included publishing six corporate responsibility reports summarizing our progress in critical areas such as harm reduction and underage prevention and publishing our inaugural task force on climate related financial disclosures report we were recognized for the second consecutive year with a aa rating from cdp for climate and water stewardship and we advanced our internal talent and cultural goals embraced workplace flexibility and embedded inclusion and diversity considerations within our performance review process to hold our leaders accountable we re excited to share more about our responsibility efforts and our consumer engagement system next month at cagny 2021 was a dynamic year for the u s tobacco industry and total industry volumes were influenced by several factors including pandemic induced shifts in consumer purchasing behavior and tobacco usage occasions a continued trend toward smoke free alternatives and an evolving regulatory and legislative landscape despite year over year volatility due to pandemic related factors total tobacco volume trends remained stable in fact we estimate that overall tobacco space volumes have decreased by 0 3 annualized for the past two years and by 0 8 over the last five years on a compounded annual basis diving deeper total estimated equivalized volumes for smoke free products in the u s grew to 3 8 billion equivalized units in 2021 and represented approximately 24 of the total tobacco space we estimate the year over year increases in smoke free volumes were driven by the e vapor category which result resumed its growth after a temporary pause in 2020 and on nicotine pouches which continue to grow rapidly from a small base 2021 smoke free volumes also benefited from the geographic expansion of iqos in the heated tobacco category but we re pressured by modest declines in the mst category due to shifts in consumer purchasing behavior and movement to other smoke free categories and in combustibles volume declined to approximately 11 8 billion equivalized units driven by several factors which sal will discuss later in his remarks turning to our smoke free product portfolio we re excited by the exceptional performance of on and on nicotine pouches on retail share of oral tobacco increased by nearly a full share point sequentially reaching 3 9 share points for the fourth quarter and nearly doubling its share over the past six months these strong results were primarily driven by an increase in multi can purchases as of the end of the year on was available for sale in approximately 117 000 u s retail stores the on nicotine pouch category reached a total oral tobacco retail share of 17 9 percentage points in the fourth quarter growing 7 4 share points year over year we re encouraged that on represented more than one third of this growth and the brand is proving to be a highly competitive product in the space our premarket tobacco applications for the entire on portfolio remained pending with the fda and we believe that the fda should determine that the marketing of these products is appropriate for the protection of public health we are actively working on modified risk tobacco product applications for on and expect to submit these applications to the fda by the end of this year we believe an mrtp claim would be an impactful point of differentiation for the brand and an important tool in educating and ultimately transitioning smokers to less harmful products in heated tobacco our teams made excellent progress with iqos in the northern virginia market with marlboro heatsticks achieving a 1 9 retail share of the cigarette category in stores with distribution for the month of october unfortunately pm usa had to remove iqos from the market in november due to the international trade commission s importation ban and cease and desist orders pmi is responsible for iqos manufacturing and we have been in contact regarding product availability at the present time we do not expect to have access to iqos devices or marlboro heatsticks in 2022 however we remain focused on returning iqos to the market as soon as possible our teams are actively working on reentry plans and we expect to be ready to bring iqos back to u s consumers when available our agreement with pmi contemplates disruptions such as those caused by the itc orders and requires the parties to negotiate in good faith to amend the agreement appropriately in the second quarter of 2020 we disclosed two milestones in our iqos agreement with pmi necessary for pm usa to maintain its exclusive license and distribution rights for iqos in the u s and to earn the renewal option for an additional five year term the initial five year term does not expire until april of 2024 but we believe that pm usa has already met these milestones based on the strong performance of iqos in the charlotte and northern virginia markets pmi has communicated that it disagrees with our position we expect to continue discussing these matters with pmi we firmly believe that heated tobacco products can play an important role in u s harm reduction and we are continuing our efforts to support the category s growth we have gained significant knowledge from our iqos commercialization efforts which we expect to use going forward our teams learned how to educate u s smokers on a brand new tobacco category and how to effectively support their transition journey to smoke free alternatives we demonstrated improved performance in each successive market and gained valuable knowledge on leveraging mrtp claims to transition smokers additionally we have built a robust post market surveillance system all of which we believe will position us to successfully achieve our objective of moving beyond smoking moving to the e vapor category the 2021 monitoring the future study was recently released and the data showed positive improvements in underage usage trends both underage use of nicotine vaping products and juul specifically show continued signs of decline the latest data shows that juul underage usage is down by 70 from 2019 with total underage nicotine vaping down 27 over the same period we are encouraged by the progress but more still needs to be done and we remain committed to continuing our work to reduce underage use of all tobacco products turning to the regulatory environment the fda is currently weighing several decisions that we believe will shape the future of harm reduction in the u s in the e vapor category the fda has issued marketing denial orders for many e vapor pmtas predominantly applications for open systems and flavored e liquids these denial orders have resulted in significant litigation across the country in the meantime pmtas for most leading e vapor products including juul are still on an fda review the fda granted its first e vapor market order last year for the tobacco variant of a cigar like product the fda has not reached a final decision for that manufacturer s menthol variant but did deny its submissions for its other flavored cartridges in oral tobacco pmtas for the leading oral nicotine pouch products including on remain pending with the fda last year the fda granted the first market authorizations among innovative oral tobacco products for our verve discs and chews in the flavors of green mint and blue mint these were also the first flavored product authorizations for newly deemed tobacco products additionally mrtp applications previously submitted for copenhagen snuff and competitive snus products remain in fda review finally in combustibles the fda has stated that they are on track to issue proposed product standards by april 2022 regarding menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars as a reminder the fda rule making process for these and all potential product standards has multiple steps and provide several opportunities for stakeholders to provide input there are formal requirements related to public notice and comment and steps requiring the office of management and budget to assess economic consequences at several points in the process importantly if the fda chooses to move forward with their final rules they must address all comments received throughout the rule making process of course any final rule must take into account the potential for unintended consequences and would be subject to legal challenges we plan to review the proposed rules in detail and intend to engage with the fda throughout the rule making process on each of these issues we remain optimistic about the future of harm reduction in the u s we believe we have an unprecedented opportunity to lead the way in shifting millions of smokers away from cigarettes if we follow the science and foster innovation with the support of reasonable regulation we are encouraged that the fda has authorized a product in each of the three major smoke free categories going forward this year we expect the fda to carefully consider the scientific merits of each remaining application and we re hopeful for significant progress in product marketing and claim authorizations i would like to end my commentary regarding 2021 with the message to altria s employees thank you for your dedication passion and creativity through a difficult period we experienced several challenges last year in both our professional and personal lives and i admire your resiliency and fortitude you are a driving force in moving beyond smoking and we are very appreciative of your efforts and commitment let s now move to our financial outlook for 2022 our plans for the year ahead include a continuation of our strategy to balance earnings growth and shareholder returns with investments toward our vision for 2022 our planned investment areas include digital consumer engagement smoke free product research development and regulatory preparations and marketplace activities in support of our smoke free products the external environment remains dynamic however and we re monitoring various factors such as the economy including the impact of increased inflation the impact of current and potential future covid 19 variants and mitigation strategies tobacco consumer dynamics including tobacco usage occasions and available disposable income and regulatory and legislative developments taking these factors into consideration we expect to deliver 2022 full year adjusted diluted eps in a range of 4 79 to 4 93 this range represents an adjusted diluted eps growth rate of 4 to 7 from a 4 61 base in 2021 we expect 2022 adjusted diluted eps growth to be weighted toward the second half of the year our guidance includes anticipated inflationary increases in master settlement agreement expenses and direct materials expenses and our current expectation that we will not have access to the iqos system in 2022 i ll now turn it over to sal to provide more detail on the business environment and our results sal mancuso chief financial officer thanks billy i d like to begin with an update on consumer disposable income mobility and retail store traffic we believe rising gas prices inflation and the reduction of covid 19 relief programs led to a decrease in disposable income on a sequential and year over year basis in addition increased consumer mobility versus the prior year offered consumers more options for their discretionary spending and led to fewer tobacco usage occasions at retail fourth quarter trends were unchanged sequentially we estimate that compared to pre pandemic levels the number of tobacco consumer trips to the store continued to be depressed but tobacco expenditures per trip remained elevated moving to our businesses the smokeable product segment delivered excellent financial performance once again our strategy for this segment continues to be maximizing profitability while balancing investments in marlboro with funding the growth of our smoke free portfolio we believe our teams are successfully executing this strategy and the segment has delivered strong profit growth and stable marlboro marketplace performance throughout the pandemic period in the fourth quarter the segment grew its adjusted oci by 4 9 and expanded its adjusted oci margins to 56 2 the segment also reported strong net price realization of 8 8 fourth quarter smokeable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes decline by 5 9 when adjusted for trade inventory movements and other factors we estimate that segment domestic cigarette volumes for the fourth quarter declined by 8 and that industry volumes declined by 6 5 over the same period as a reminder adjusted cigarette volumes were strong in the fourth quarter of 2020 with our smokeable segment adjusted cigarette volumes declining by just 1 and industry volumes growing by one half percent for the full year smokeable segment adjusted oci grew 3 1 to 10 4 billion adjusted oci margins expanded by 1 2 percentage points to 57 6 these strong full year results were supported by robust net price realization up 9 1 full year smokable segment reported domestic cigarette volumes declined 7 5 due to the strong comparison period and the continuation of pandemic driven changes in the consumer behavior when adjusted for trade inventory movement calendar differences and other factors we estimate that smokable segment cigarette volumes declined by 6 and that the full industry declined by 5 5 we believe it s important to analyze cigarette volume trends over the longer term as decline rates in any one year can be influenced by various factors the covid 19 pandemic has certainly been one of these distorting factors and we believe the best way to assess cigarette volumes during this period is looking at 2020 and 2021 volumes combined in fact the two year average decline rates for adjusted smokable segment and industry cigarette volume declines were 4 and 3 respectively well within the range of historic norms turning to marketplace performance marlboro remains strong and has demonstrated resilience the cigarette category remains very competitive after market share gains in the first half of 2021 marlboro did see share in the fourth quarter we believe the sequential share decline occurred due to macroeconomic pressures on consumer disposable income while the vast majority of marlboro consumers are highly brand loyal we do know that cigarette brand selection for a subset of smokers is dependent on economic conditions these consumers are more likely to select premium brands during economic upswings as demonstrated by marlboro share gains in the first half of 2021 but they are also more likely to trade down in tougher economic situations we remain focused on the long term strength of marlboro and we are very pleased that its full year share grew 0 2 to 43 1 and that the brand remained stable since the beginning of the pandemic in discount total segment retail share in the fourth quarter continued to fluctuate increasing 0 7 sequentially to 26 driven primarily by deep discount products we believe the share increases observed in the discount segment are due to the previously mentioned macroeconomic factors that pressured the consumer in the fourth quarter for the full year discount segment share increased five tenths to 25 4 which was at the high end of its historical ranges we expect fluctuation in discount segment shares to continue as the cohort of price sensitive consumers react to their short term economic conditions and in cigars middleton provided strong contributions to smokable segment financial results reported cigar shipment volume was essentially unchanged for the year as middleton maintained the strength of the iconic black mild brand and successfully managed the supply chain during a challenging year turning to the oral tobacco product segment adjusted oci and adjusted oci margins contracted for the full year primarily due to increased investments behind on total segment reported shipment volume was unchanged for the year when adjusted for trade inventory movements and calendar differences we estimate that total oral tobacco segment volumes declined by 0 5 we remain pleased with the overall performance of the segment as copenhagen continues to generate significant income in the high margin mst category and we re excited about the growth demonstrated by on oral tobacco product segment retail share for the fourth quarter was down slightly sequentially as strong share gains from on nearly offset declines in mst the segment declined 1 6 percentage points versus the fourth quarter last year due to the continued growth of the oral nicotine pouch category turning to our investment in abi we recorded 172 million of adjusted equity earnings in the fourth quarter representing altria s share of abi s third quarter results for the full year we recorded 639 million in adjusted equity earnings up 18 3 versus 2020 as we shared in our previous earnings call we view our abi stake as a financial investment and our goal is to maximize the long term value of the investment for our shareholders in our all other operating category we continue to make progress on our wind down of philip morris capital corporation at year end the net finance assets balance was 114 million down more than 200 million since the end of 2020 due to rents received and asset sales as previously announced we expect to complete the pmcc wind down by the end of 2022 turning to capital allocation we remain committed to creating long term shareholder value through the pursuit of our vision and our significant capital returns as billy mentioned in his opening remarks we returned more than 8 1 billion in cash last year to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases these record cash returns included paying 6 4 billion in dividends raising the dividend for the 56th time in 52 years and repurchasing nearly 36 million shares during the year totaling 1 7 billion we also sold ste michelle wine estates and expanded our share repurchase program from 2 billion to 3 5 billion we have approximately 1 8 billion remaining under this expanded program which we expect to complete by december 31 2022 we continue to have a strong balance sheet and our goal is to maintain an investment grade credit rating as of year end our debt to ebitda ratio was 2 3 times and our weighted average coupon was 4 with that we ll wrap up and billy and i will be happy to take your questions while the calls are being compiled i ll remind you that today s earnings release and our non gaap reconciliations are available on altria com we ve also posted our usual quarterly metrics which include pricing inventory and other items let s open the question and answer period operator do we have any questions questions answers operator we will take questions from the investment community first our first question comes from pamela kaufman from morgan stanley pamela kaufman monness analyst hi good morning mac livingston vice president of investor relations pam this is mac just one quick second before your question we understand that there were some technical issues associated with the webcast so i want to apologize for the disruption to those listening there we will work to get our recorded remarks up on the website as soon as possible thanks and go ahead pam pamela kaufman monness analyst thanks so how would you characterize the current competitive environment within the cigarette category the deep discount segment continues to invest in price and is gaining share given the headwinds that you highlighted that are impacting the tobacco consumer how are you thinking about managing price gaps versus the discount segment and are you prioritizing stabilizing marlboro market share thanks billy gifford chief executive officer good morning pamela and thanks for your question i think i would start with marlboro s share i mean when you look at marlboro s share performance over the past eight quarters it has been stable so you can look at kind of this period in the pandemic to pre pandemic levels and you see marlboro has remained strong throughout that period i think when we went through the pandemic though there were several macroeconomic tailwinds and we ve mentioned them before there was lower consumer mobility there was higher government stimulus payments and what we believe led to increased smoking occasions and when you think about that that led to increased or higher discretionary income for competitive adult smokers who then traded up to marlboro and i think that really showed the continued appeal of premium brands now as we start seeing some of those pressures you re referring to put pressure or decrease the discretionary spend of some of our consumers you see the more price sensitive adult smokers moving back to discount brands and i think that would be expected look we believe that the current discount share to your point is at the high end of historical norms but we do expect quarterly fluctuations in share to continue until the economy begins to stabilize from the pandemic i think overall from a pricing standpoint and i ll be careful not to talk about future pricing you recall the four factors that we look at to make pricing decisions strength of the brand the economic health of our consumers the demographics or relevancy of the brands across the various age cohorts and corporate objectives and i think when you think about the strength of the brand i would remind you that like marlboro has over 90 loyalty and that i think has shown through the eight quarters of stability pamela kaufman monness analyst that s helpful and then just a question on smokeless segment profitability and margins have been under pressure in smokeless over the last several quarters can you elaborate on the investments you re making there and how are you thinking about smokeless investments and profitability in 2022 billy gifford chief executive officer yeah it s a great question i appreciate you raising it i think when you think about it pamela we had talked as we progressed through 2020 that we were really focused on getting past the manufacturing capacity constraints and that would allow us to really start engaging with the consumer so now being in the 117 000 stores you want to have a nice look at retail you re going to want to engage with smokers with equity messages that go to the consumer whether through direct mail or through digital and then because you re introducing a new category and is growing you want to have some disruption at retail both with the look and with some price off and so you have price promotions that take place in the marketplace so those are the major factors that as we re investing in on and it s growing impact the overall oral tobacco category from a margin standpoint i know you would like me to say this is the exact date we expect to end that but i think as you think about a growing category and on certainly participated in that growth we re going to invest appropriately as that category continues to grow pamela kaufman monness analyst thank you billy gifford chief executive officer thank you operator we ll take our next question from bonnie herzog of goldman sachs bonnie herzog goldman sachs analyst hi thank you good morning everyone billy gifford chief executive officer good morning bonnie bonnie herzog goldman sachs analyst hi i have a question on your 22 eps guidance you mentioned you plan to balance earnings growth and shareholder returns with investments toward your vision which includes increased smoke free product r d but at the same time you don t expect to have iqos in the market so two questions one can you give us a sense of your investment spend in r d for instance will your investments in this effort be elevated above 21 levels and then two can you share maybe just a little bit more with us about your 2030 vision and how the development of an additional smoke free product could fit into your portfolio i d be curious to hear what that product might look like when it might be right to test just be curious to hear if it s closed or is this still a year or two out billy gifford chief executive officer yeah thanks for the question bonnie and it was pretty packed up so i ll try to unpack it but if i miss any point please follow up i think when you think about guidance overall right we run a range of scenarios across all the categories we participate in and there are always puts and takes in those various scenarios and it s important to remember when mindful that we re still in a pandemic environment and that we want to ensure we have the flexibility to adapt to our adult consumers as we progress through the year and they re making different choices as far as the investment areas i know you would like us to say this is exactly when we re going to bring this product and here s what it looks like i think it s important to step back and think about where we re investing and it really is marketplace activities for support of the products we have in the marketplace it s also investing in the digital consumer engagement being able to get closer to the consumer on a one on one basis and we ll share more details of that at cagny and then it s not just research and development it s also the regulatory preparations that take place so for instance in 2022 we re preparing the mrtp application for the on portfolio so there s a vast array of investments it does include product development in r d and so that s kind of how we look at 2022 and how we re moving forward i think when you look at the vision even if you look overseas where they re able to innovate much quicker you see the consumer constantly moving from a technology standpoint through the various options that are available to them and so we want to make sure that we re investing appropriately to stay paced or actually be ahead of where the consumer is going to be as we progress through time and so that s how we think about product development in the from a fitting into the portfolio to address that point of your question bonnie herzog goldman sachs analyst ok that s helpful and then just speaking or thinking about your 2030 vision could you give us maybe an update on that and i just keep thinking about any guidepost you guys could share with us that you expect to hit for this business or your business i should say in the next three to five years what ultimately is a realistic target in terms of converting your business to noncombustible products and then in the context of that and executing on this vision curious to hear if you re open to m a to accelerate this or are you going to continue to remain focused on things that you develop in house billy gifford chief executive officer yeah i think from a guidepost standpoint and we get this question often is i think it s a bit different in the u s where we re predominantly based versus overseas remember everything has to go through the fda authorization process and really the entire harm reduction opportunities in front of us in the u s and so i think as we progress and we start seeing some of the fda authorizations come through we ll be sure to share some guideposts on how we re thinking about measuring going forward i know that s what you and the investors want it s just that we need to get through the fda authorization process and understand how they re going to think about and authorize these products going forward and then we can provide some guideposts to be measured against in that regard i think overall though and we ve shared this before call it roughly half to slightly over half of adult consumer cigarette consumers in the u s prefer or would desire an alternative product that satisfies them and has the potential to reduce the risk associated with using nicotine through time so we want to consistently provide those consumers the products and transition them to the smoke free products from a standpoint of the 2030 vision i mentioned that the entire rrp opportunities in front of us and what we feel like we have is we have the infrastructure to support that whether you think about government affairs or regulatory affairs a top notch sales force we have product development we engage with the largest number of u s adult tobacco consumers through our brand premium brands and our digital capabilities and if you step back and we have strong core businesses that produce lots of cash that allow us to fund our investments and i believe if you ask consumers we have credibility with the adult tobacco consumer so your last question if i recall them all correctly was m a versus internal look we monitor what s taking place around the world and we re extremely focused on our organic development staying close to the consumer as we continue with that process bonnie herzog goldman sachs analyst all right thank you i ll get back in queue billy gifford chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from owen bennett of jefferies owen bennett jefferies analyst good morning gents hope you re well i just had a question around some of the details on the automatic renewal of the iqos agreement and firstly did you need to hit certain market share levels by april 24 and then two it sounds like from what you re saying you believe you already hit these levels in 2020 and would that be right it just sounds like if that s the case the share targets were set really low and then three if you believe you ve already hit the share targets what exactly is being renegotiated with pmi currently thank you guys billy gifford chief executive officer yeah i appreciate it i want to appreciate your question look we disclosed what we felt like we could from a standpoint remember we have cross confidentiality in place with pmi and we disclosed that in 2020 because we thought it was important for you guys and the investors to know that there were performance objectives in the contract we feel like we have hit those as far as the extension or renegotiation that s taken place look we described that we feel like we hit on pmi in disagreement with that and their mechanisms in the contract to be able to settle any disputes that take place you can see with any two parties that have an agreement there can be disputes or disagreements and that was all contemplated in the agreement owen bennett jefferies analyst ok thanks a lot very helpful billy gifford chief executive officer thank you operator we ll take our next question from vivien azer of cowen vivien azer cowen and company analyst hi thanks very much i really appreciate the commentary on the health of the consumer and some of the normalization in terms of down trading behavior billy as i kind of think back to the evolution of the marlboro franchise over the last decade there was a big push if i recall correctly coming out of the last recession to balance out the price points that were available for marlboro so can you just remind us kind of where special blend fits into the total marlboro franchise and i recognize your revenue growth management tools have gotten a lot more sophisticated over the last decade but the role that you envision special blend playing to the extent that we see sustained down trading thank you billy gifford chief executive officer yeah thanks for the question vivien i think when you think about the entire marlboro portfolio remember that services four out of every 10 consumers that go to the marketplace you have consumers that the marlboro brand appeals to them and i mentioned it earlier those price sensitive consumers it still appeal to them and when they have extra discretionary income they want to trade up across the portfolio with the tools that you mentioned we can provide the consumer a safe landing with various parts of the portfolio where they can stay in the marlboro franchise and we see that s better for them than actually losing them or having them trade up and try to win them back later and so we have the advanced analytics we have this robust data coming in from retail and now with those tools we re trying to provide it closer and closer to the individual consumer and we feel like we have the tools that allow us to navigate this type of pressure that the consumer is under i think it s important though to remember that our goal is not to grow marlboro share through time it s to stabilize it so that we can grow profitability through time and so that s where our overall goal is specific to the marlboro franchise and then we use the tools in the portfolio to be able to do that vivien azer cowen and company analyst that s really helpful and then as my follow up question is on the on franchise clearly the promotional investments that you guys are making are translating to market share gains which is great to see i was wondering if you could offer any color on where you see on promotional spending relative to the broader competitive backdrop billy gifford chief executive officer sure i think when you think about the promotional spending there look we had to get past manufacturing capacity constraints so we certainly had a competitor get out there much earlier than us and so we want to be a bit disruptive in the marketplace to disrupt the consumers from their normal purchasing behavior in the category or if they re thinking about the category the same tools that you think agree with that we have in the cigarette category we re using those tools in this space as well so we re constantly using those tools with the data we re getting from retail with the feedback we re getting from consumers and understanding what s effective and what s not effective and so we ll be continually adjusting those as we move through time to improve the share growth and through once we get past the investment period to get increased margins and profitability vivien azer cowen and company analyst understood thank you billy gifford chief executive officer thank you operator our next question is from chris growe of stifel chris growe stifel financial corp analyst hi good morning billy gifford chief executive officer good morning chris chris growe stifel financial corp analyst good morning i had a question first of all and this is not even in the situation in the last kind of year and a half or two but you did not provide a volume outlook for the year for example for your cigarette business or smokeless business overall and i m just curious not maybe getting to a number but just to understand is that volatility in volume maybe the uncertainty around that kind of the main factor that could push your eps around within that range is the worst volume conclusion for the year what likely drives the lower end of your eps range and a better volume performance or at the higher end is that one of the main driving factors of your guidance range for the year as you see it billy gifford chief executive officer i think when you think about cigarette volume it s certainly an important factor in that but there are always puts and takes that take place in the p l and so as i mentioned chris we run a range of scenarios and in those scenarios we have puts and takes that take place across the various categories certainly cigarette volume is one of the factors but it s not the only factor chris growe stifel financial corp analyst ok and then i just had a question in relation to marlboro and share there s been a few questions on that front but just one thing i was curious about is that in some of your price increases over the last year year and a half maybe last year you ve set aside some funds that you were going to put toward investing behind marlboro i guess i just want to get a sense of based on the performance and largely flat performance in share even though it s been up and down i guess are those funds being utilized as you expected behind marlboro do you see the need based on some of the growth in deep discount share for example to continue to increase that rate of spending behind marlboro billy gifford chief executive officer it s something we ll certainly monitor chris going through time and we talked about look we re mindful of keeping pace and understanding how we need to adapt to our consumers across all of our categories i think i go back to the comment i made to vivien our goal with marlboro is not to grow share through time it s to have stable share and be able to grow profitability and i think you see we were very successful with that in 2020 yes ok thank you for your time thank you chris operator we ll take our next question from callum elliott of bernstein callum elliott sanford c bernstein analyst thanks for the question look billy i appreciate the color on the dispute resolution process with pm my question is do you guys have contingency plans in place in heated tobacco in the event that that dispute resolution process goes against you and the licensing agreement isn t extended beyond 2024 billy gifford chief executive officer yeah i m not going to go into the hypothetical there callum i think you can appreciate that we feel like we can resolve it it was pretty thought out with the agreement that the mechanism is in place to settle disputes and so we ll go through that process but we re in continued discussions with pmi callum elliott sanford c bernstein analyst ok thanks and just a quick follow up on vivien s question about sort of promotional environment in nicotine pouches i guess my question is are you concerned at all that that heavy promotional environment for on might damage the brand equity and selling today at a huge discount to the market leader as you mentioned are you not at all concerned that that might impact the long term brand perception here billy gifford chief executive officer we are not if you think about even if you go back to the cigarette category when we launch chews and whether it be on marlboro or any of our other brands you always had introductory price promotions it s important to remember when our consumer is going to and c stores is one of the primary locations they go to they re making that decision in 10 to 15 seconds it s the snap of an eye almost and so when you think about that you want to disrupt them at retail not only with price promotions but with a great look at retail or disrupt them either in their mailbox or their email box with through digital and so we re going to use all of those tools available to us but we feel like we have strong equity and building strong equity with on callum elliott sanford c bernstein analyst ok thank you billy gifford chief executive officer thank you operator at this time we d be happy to open up the queue for our media representatives we ll take a question from jennifer maloney of the wall street journal jennifer maloney the wall street journal reporter hi good morning i wanted to follow up on bonnie s questions about your r d and your 2030 vision can you speak specifically to your how e vapor fits into your 2030 vision and rrp portfolio billy gifford chief executive officer yeah i think from an r d portfolio i ll take that first you ll remember our agreement with juul precludes us from being able to do any organic development in e vapor so that s one category that we do not have any organic development going on if you think about the 2030 vision the way we think about the e vapor category certainly as the entire category is going through the fda authorization process as they make decisions the e vapor category will be in a bit of transition but we believe the e vapor category and juul included in that can play an important role in the u s in harm reduction and the future of harm reduction so when you think about that e vapor can play an important role but it s going to be in a bit of a transition as it goes through the fda authorization process jennifer maloney the wall street journal reporter you only have a minority stake in juul so do you i mean what s your strategy there for this 2030 vision in the e vapor category it s just you ll only be able to participate in the e vapor category through your minority stake in juul or do you have some other strategy there billy gifford chief executive officer there our only participation in the e vapor category would be through our minority investment in juul and i think if you step back and see the success juul had in the marketplace with converting adult smokers to the e vapor category you ll see that it still has the lead in market share in the u s with adult tobacco consumers jennifer maloney the wall street journal reporter ok thanks billy gifford chief executive officer thank you operator thank you at this time i would like to turn the call back to mac livingston for closing comments mac livingston vice president of investor relations thanks leo and thank you all for joining us i ll remind you once again we re going to work quickly to get the recording of the remarks back up on the

on our call i ll start with a brief discussion about current market trends and provide an overview of our significant accomplishments in 2021 phillippe will cover our strategy quarterly performance and hilla will provide a financial overview of the fourth quarter and forward looking guidance for 2022 demand in the fourth quarter continued to demonstrate the strength we have seen all year mortgage remained very affordable and home buying demand continued to outpace housing inventory driven by favorable homeland activity from millennials and baby boomers as such meritage again broke several company records in the fourth quarter of 2021 in the face of a prolonged supply chain constraints and a tightening labor market we achieved our highest fourth quarter sales orders and our second highest quarterly home closings while accelerating our spec starts our fourth quarter results include the highest quarterly home closing revenue home closing gross profit and diluted eps as well as the lowest quarterly sg a as a percentage of home closing revenue in our company s history from a full year 2021 perspective i couldn t be more proud of what our team has accomplished we achieved our highest annual sales orders of 13 808 homes and closing of 12 801 homes our 2021 annual home closing revenue was also a record at 5 1 billion as was our full year home closing gross margin of 27 8 price increases due to sustained strong demand coupled with our operational efficiency and the leveraging of our fixed cost over higher home closing revenue drove our lowest full year sg a rate of 9 2 translating to our next full year diluted eps of 19 29 our community count grew 33 year over year we re earning the spring selling season with 259 active selling communities and forecasting continued double digit community growth into 22 we expect that our strategy capitalizing on the solid demand for the entry level and first move of homes will produce increased volume coming from digital communities and will enable us to gain market share in all of our geographies now let s turn to slide 4 in addition to delivering impressive financial results we achieved numerous milestones related to our corporate social stewardship in the fourth quarter as the team organized around an ambition to start with heart meritage employees donated countless hours to deliver a new mortgage free home to a deserving military veteran and his family on veterans day in florida through operation homefront we also donated to various nonprofit organizations to further strengthen diversity equity and inclusion missions and to help families during the holiday season and the communities in which we do business and to support tree planting programs to share our ongoing approach to long term sustainability practices de i commitments and our esg milestones we issued our inaugural esg report during the quarter we also joined more than 2 100 other companies by signing the ceo action for diversity and inclusion pledge we ll have more to share about our esg efforts with you throughout 2022 we re excited about our employees executive and board level commitments to these important issues and with that i ll now turn it over to phillippe phillippe lord chief executive officer thank you steve i want to start by focusing on affordability which with favorable pricing environment and the anticipated rate hikes coming this year is top of mind for everyone affordability is at the heart of our business strategy that is centered around entry level and first move up home when we first shifted to this market segment more than five years ago we did so knowing eventually interest rates would go up continue to buy land for even lower asp products has been our focus over the past two years to act as a counterbalance to the pricing strength all markets have experienced since mid 2020 although we have taken increases in line with the market conditions we expect our new communities to come online at still attractive and affordable asps especially in light of increased fha limits in all of our markets to ensure our product remains affordable we constantly evaluate the credit metrics of our buyers our customers fico scores and dtis remained stable in the fourth quarter and consistent with historical averages demonstrating that they are not streaming financially to purchase our homes given the recent interest rate increases we will continue to monitor the overall affordability of our homes during the fourth quarter we continued to meet our order base in most of our communities to manage margins through supply chain challenges and the tightening labor market and ensure we provide our customers a quality home buying experience by focusing on our construction and simplified product strategy we still achieved record orders and closings in 2021 demonstrating our ability to navigate delays associated with supply materials labor entitlement and permitting in today s rising rate environment we believe selling homes later in the construction cycle offers more favorable options to our buyers as they look to lock in their mortgage rate and close escrow libor rate lock expirations with these quarterly results in 2021 we also displayed our ability to achieve industry leading gross margins this was a function of the favorable pricing environment first and foremost but also our disciplined production approach to managing our construction costs as we have mentioned before spec building typically provide us the opportunity to lock in costs before determining asp however in a rising cost environment riddled with supply chain issues we went one step further to avoid cost risk and to better manage our margins in cases where cost increases such as lumber continued path to start of construction our delayed sales releases allowed us to manage this additional cost exposure managing our order pay helped generate the meaningful list we have experienced in our gross margins although we are not forecasting any improvement in supply chain challenges once they do unwind we expect to remove our sales meeting metering and fully allow our community to capture true market demand while maintaining our margin profile now turning to slide 5 given the long range cycle times our fourth quarter closings totaled 3 526 homes which was down 6 over the challenging comps of prior year entry level comprised 81 of closings up from 72 in the prior year total orders of 3 367 for the fourth quarter of 2021 reflected an increase of 6 year over year driven by a 24 increase in average active community count which was partially offset by the decrease in average absorptions the decline from 5 3 per month in q4 2020 to 4 5 per month in this current quarter was driven by the tightly metered order pace across most of our footprint as well as our new community openings occurring late in the quarter we continue to reiterate that our sales metering is an intentional choice in order to maximize both our margins and the customer home buying process as we manage through the current supply chain issues in the market today looking at our growing interest lift and the early month sellouts in our communities we know that actual demand for our home is much greater than what we were seeing in our absorption pace entry level provided 80 of total orders up from 72 in the fourth quarter last year entry level also represented 79 of our average active communities compared to 67 a year ago moving to slide 6 the regional level trends we continue to experience strong demand in all of our regions our central region comprised of texas led in terms of regional average absorption pace with 5 3 per month this quarter this 5 year over year decline was offset by 17 greater average asset communities which together contributed to an 11 increase in order volume with the state s favorable economic development and growth environment sustained home buying demand generated a 20 year over year increase in asp orders the highest increase in all three regions to address affordability challenges in the market our east region continued to shift its product mix toward entry level which made up 81 of its average asset communities out of our three regions the east region average community count increased the most by 34 year over year which generated order volume growth of 6 the east region increase in community count was offset by a 21 decrease in average absorption pace the west region s fourth quarter 2021 order volume increased 2 year over year mainly due to 19 more average communities which was partially offset by 14 lower average absorption pace overall we had a solid performance from all our regions despite ongoing challenges with the supply chain as we accelerate spec protection in all of our regions we expect total order volume to increase throughout 2022 turning to slide 7 of our home closings this quarter 77 came from previously started spec inventory which increased from 71 a year ago we ended the period with nearly 3 200 spec home in inventory or an average of 12 3 per community as we push to get homes on the ground this compared to approximately 2 500 specs or an average of 12 9 in the fourth quarter of 2020 at december 31 2021 less than 5 of total stacks were completed versus our typical run rate of one third due to sustained demand and supply constraints we accelerate starts to over 3 700 homes in the fourth quarter from approximately 3 400 homes in the third quarter and in line with approximately 3 800 homes in the second quarter and we expect to continue ramping up spec parts in 2022 as our community count increases having available spec is not necessary for our 100 spec building strategy despite improving our total spec home inventory year over year maintaining a four to six month supply of entry level spec has been challenging given the surge in demand and supply chain constraints and we expect that trend to continue at least in the near term we ended the quarter with a backlog of over 5 600 units as our conversion rate declined from 71 last year to 60 this year resulting from elongated cycle times however it was a slight improvement from 57 in the third quarter as we look ahead into 2022 we aren t expecting any improvement in our backlog conversion since we do not anticipate any near term improvements in the current supply chain once the supply chain stabilizes we expect our cycle times will shorten and backlog conversion rate will pick up again while order growth will also reaccelerate as we unwind sales metering during the fourth quarter ongoing supply chain disruptions lengthened construction time by about two weeks sequentially from q3 to q4 this year despite these expanded timelines we still believe our streamlined operations and 100 spec building strategy for entry level homes has given us a competitive advantage in today s supply chain and labor market conditions by locking in volume and providing workable consistency to our traders coupling these with our reduced sku counts and streamlined product library has allowed us with some incremental cost advantages the benefits of pre starting homes with simpler products to build up and our steady predictable and repeatable construction work make us a preferred builder of choice these strong vendor relationships helped us deliver over 12 800 homes in 2021 and are key to accelerating starts in 2022 since we have our facility processes dialed in we ve been able to give our partners more visibility into our business than ever before so they can plan for what we need we provide our schedules to them well in advance to our dealers are preorder our strong partnerships with our suppliers and our limited build to order options also allow us to pivot our product selections based on availability if necessary as we continue to stay nimble in these unusual times our executive team has been meeting with our top vendors to short capacity commitments for 2022 given our significant increase in its big starts as we grow our community count this year we have also backed up our supplier group with secondary alternative sources to help us with incremental needs should that become necessary i will now turn it over to hilla to provide additional analysis and our financial results hilla hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer thank you phillippe let s turn to slide 8 and cover our q4 financial results in more detail the 6 year over year home closing revenue growth to 1 5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 was a result of a 13 increase in asp due to strong market demand even as we shifted our product mix toward entry level homes this was partially offset by a 6 decline in home closing volume due to closing time being impacted by supply chain issues the 500 bps improvement in fourth quarter 2021 home closing gross margin to 29 from 24 a year ago was primarily driven by a full year of pricing power which outweighed accelerated cost pressures in almost all cost categories we believe that despite volatility in lumber and generally higher commodity costs we can sustain strong margins into 2022 sg a as a percentage of home closing revenue was 8 5 for the current quarter an 80 bps improvement over prior year the higher revenue lower broker commissions and the benefits of technology on our sales and marketing efforts allowed us to better leverage our sg a one time items including payments to our general counsel who retired in december of 2021 and a change in the company s retirement vesting eligibility for equity awards totaled 5 million and impacted sg a expenses by 30 bps in the third quarter of 2021 we continue to pursue back office automation and greater technological strides to drive incremental leverage of our sg a the fourth quarter 2021 effective income tax rate was 23 8 compared to 21 9 in the prior years both years reflected reduced rates primarily from the eligible tax credit when qualifying energy efficient home closed under the 2019 taxpayer certainty and disaster tax release act increased profit in states with higher tax rates and the reduced benefit of the energy tax credit due to the greater overall profitability of the company both contributed to the higher tax rate this year since the energy tax rate has not yet been enacted for future periods we re not assuming any such benefit beyond 2021 at this time pricing power expanded gross margin and improved overhead leverage combined with lower outstanding share count all led to the 57 year over year increase in fourth quarter diluted eps to 6 25 to highlight a few full year 2021 results on a year over year basis we generated a 74 increase in net earnings order unit held steady at about 13 800 for both years closings were up 8 we had a 580 bps expansion of our home closing gross margin to 27 8 in 2021 and sg a as a percentage of home closing revenue improved 80 bps to 9 2 diluted eps was 19 29 a 75 increase from 2020 turning to slide 9 our balance sheet remains strong even as we continued investing in land acquisition and development at december 31 2021 our cash balance was 618 million compared to 746 million at december 31 2020 reflecting increased investments in real estate and development and inventory rose 956 million during the year as well as for share repurchases during full year 2021 we repurchased about 640 000 shares of stock for 61 million of which by 244 000 shares totaling 24 million were repurchased during the fourth quarter our net debt to cap ratio was 15 1 at december 31 2021 compared with 10 5 at december 31 2020 our current maximum target for net debt to cap is still in the high 20s which gives us the flexibility to manage liquidity and changing economic conditions in december we extended the maturity date of our 780 million unsecured revolving credit facility to december 2026 given our strong balance sheet we continue to focus our capital spend primarily on growth concentrating on community counts and increased specs both of which we expect will drive profitability and help us gain market share we also plan to continue routine share buybacks to offset new grants and keep our dilution neutral and they opportunistically repurchase incremental shares on to slide 10 at december 31 2021 with over 75 000 total lots under control our land book increased 35 from year end 2020 and we had nearly 60 years supply of lots based on trailing 12 month closing while this is slightly above our goal of four to five year supply of lots since we re in growth mode the calculation on prior year s closings is a bit misleading based on our forward closing projection of about 15 000 homes for 2022 we have a five year supply of lots we secured 9 000 net new lots this quarter compared to approximately 11 200 in the prior q4 this new loss will translate to an estimated 45 net new communities of which 93 are entry level to address the higher orders pace of entry level product the average community size we contracted for this quarter was nearly 200 lots up from the fourth quarter of 2020 where the average lot size was about 150 lots during the fourth quarter of 2021 we navigated around municipal delays and supply and labor constructions to open 48 new communities we grew our community count by 23 net communities from 236 at the start of the quarter to 259 at year end 2021 on a year over year basis we were up 33 or 64 net community during the full year we opened 163 communities up 55 from 105 in 2020 we are already seeing increased volume from our higher community count and expect to continue to benefit from incremental orders and closings in 2022 and beyond we spent about 507 million unlaid acquisition and development this quarter in line with last year s q4 spend and our targeted quarterly run rate we expect land spend to be around 2 billion annually in 2022 and beyond as we get to and maintain our 300 communities to finance plan we use options or staggered purchasing terms to preserve liquidity were financially feasible about 65 of our total lot inventory at december 31 2021 was owned and 35 was optioned compared to prior year with 69 owned inventory and 41 options with over 80 of our own land currently actively under development and ready to open as a new community over the next several quarters we believe we are nearing an inflection point on our owned versus option percentages due to our community ramp up stabilizing over the next several quarters at meritage we re dialed into our land playbook and our growth strategy we are disciplined in our approach to refilling our land pipeline even with strong competition and land price appreciation we underwrite to normalized incentives and absorption although we haven t changed our underwriting gross margin hurdle most deals are penciling above that giving us some breathing room to absorb cost increases in future incentives while still exceeding our minimum margin threshold we do not target an arbitrary percentage of option land instead we focus on managing our capital through balance sheet metrics and margin goals we believe the current market demand trends particularly at the entry level will be sustainable at least for the midterm once the supply chain stabilizes the more communities we have the great incremental market share we can gain in all of our geographies additionally our focus on affordability starts with our land strategy as phillippe already covered our future communities opening later 2022 and into 2023 are expected to have lower asps than what we re seeing in our existing active communities today our land strategy focuses on larger parcels which limit some competition to land lowers the per lot cost by spreading community level overheads across more lot and reduces the churn of new community openings and closings finally turning to slide 11 2022 is off to a great start pointing to a strong spring selling season and we expect home buying demand to remain robust at the same time we will continue to manage our orders pace to preserve margin and maintain a high level of customer experience we expect gross margins to remain elevated and sg a rates to be at all time lows for the full year 2022 we re projecting total closings to be between 14 500 and 15 500 units home closing revenue of 6 1 billion to 6 5 billion home closing gross margin around 27 75 an effective tax rate of about 25 and diluted eps in the range of 23 15 to 24 65 we expect full year community count year over year growth of 15 to 20 as for q1 2022 we re projecting total closings to be between 2 800 and 3 000 units home closing revenue of 1 2 billion to 1 3 billion home closing gross margin of 28 25 to 28 5 and diluted eps in the range of 4 45 to 4 85 with that i ll turn it back over to phillippe phillippe lord chief executive officer thank you hilla to summarize on slide 12 we enter 2022 with momentum and optimism we believe meritage is poised to capitalize on market demand and drive sustainable long term growth with our proven strategy and operating model our healthy land position and flexible balance sheet continued with solid execution we have already demonstrated our ability to grow community count i would like to extend our deepest gratitude hardworking employees and trade partners who contribute to meritage s remarkable 2021 their leadership grow our significant order volume closing as well as a 33 year over year ramp up in community count growth while navigating challenging conditions with that i will now turn the call over to the operator for instructions on the q a operator questions answers operator thank you we will now be conducting a question and answer session one moment please while we poll for your questions our first questions come from the line of alan ratner with zelman and associates please proceed with your questions alan ratner zelman and associates analyst hey guys good morning congrats on a great year so obviously the rate outlook is top of mind for everybody right now and certainly your 22 guidance is encouraging curious if you could share with us any thoughts or any feedback you re hearing directly from the field just given the pretty rapid increase we ve seen over the last few weeks here have you seen any discernible impact on demand on order trends traffic etc what are you hearing from the sales folks in the communities right now phillippe lord chief executive officer thanks alan this is phillippe you know we don t really guide to month over month to trends and etc but what i can share with you is that january feels extremely strong we haven t seen any discernible impact to demand given the projections of interest rates and where interest rates have moved over the last 30 days both in the form of our backlog as we ve gone back to our backlog and given that an indication of what rates are doing the backlog is stable as well as forward looking demand when we think about our priority with and the demand we re seeing across all of our leading indicators if anything it feels like it s accelerating i would it could be because people have fomo and feel like rates are going to move up dramatically toward the back half of this year and they want to get in but it also just feels like more of the same it s really in my opinion being generated by the backdrop of supply which there s none i mean as you look into all the markets that we operate in there s just way more demand for housing than there is supply and so when they go into the market and they re looking for a resell home maybe initially they can t find anything and when a resell home lift in the market into high quality homes there s usually 12 to 15 offers is what we re hearing anecdotally and they go under contract within a day or two so they re migrating over to the new home space and we only not so much to sell as well because we re metering and most other builders are metering so i feel like the demand is being generated by the lack of supply and there is just this tremendous urgency to move because people need to move right now and they want to move right now and there s really no other options out there so to summarize it feels very strong we haven t seen any impact of rates thus far but we ll see how it goes throughout the year as rates continue to elevate alan ratner zelman and associates analyst great appreciate the comments there phillippe i know it s a tough crystal ball to read here but on kind of on that topic you re in a position where your backlog doesn t provide you a ton of visibility for the full year you ve given full year guidance and just focusing on the gross margin obviously full year very very strong it does imply some continued slight easing from kind of the peak levels you put up in the back half of 21 and i m just curious if you could talk through the inputs there what s driving that modest compression is it an assumption for higher costs maybe some creep back of incentives which you kind of spoke about a few quarters ago as a potential possibility you know what are the various drivers of that phillippe lord chief executive officer it s 100 related to costs and what we re seeing on the cost side they re increasing as of right now we feel like we have the pricing power to maintain our margins into next year it feels like the market is going to give us the pricing power we need to and given the lack of supply in the market we will be able to overcome that but it s all costs we are not going any change in incentives right now we re not modeling any additional sales and marketing costs that we need to sell homes so it s all being driven by cost that being said we re coming into the year with 5 500 units in backlog we have 3 200 spec started and we are already have another 4 000 specs slide at the start in q1 so that s why we have strong confidence in what we re going to do there we know what the margin is on those specs that we have teed up to start in the first quarter and once we get to those starts we re almost there on our 15 000 sort of midpoint target so we have a lot of confidence in our margin profile as we move through the year and certainly the ability to raise prices here in the early stages of the spring selling season is giving us even more confidence alan ratner zelman and associates analyst perfect that s really helpful thanks a lot guys operator thank you our next questions come from the line of stephen kim with evercore isi please proceed with your questions stephen kim evercore isi analyst yeah thanks a lot guys thanks for all the information here i wanted to start off by asking a question about your cycle times you talked about the fact that they lengthen i think i heard correctly two weeks they lengthened two weeks from 3q to 4q and was curious if you could give us a little bit more granularity about that to the degree you can i think kb had mentioned that they hadn t seen cycle times increasing i believe in november and december and i was curious if you could talk about it a little bit more granularly therefore and maybe what you re seeing in january and then related to that you said you re not forecasting any improvement in cycle times in your projections are you forecasting any worsening in the near term phillippe lord chief executive officer thanks stephen you know the back end trades were part of the challenge in q4 i think you ve heard everything you need to hear about garage doors but there s some other back end trades that we re just adding some extra weeks into our cycle times to make sure we deliver the house 100 complete to our customers just to assure that things are pretty unpredictable right now that we have the right amount of time to get our homes built and the quality we re looking for as we look into 2022 we feel like that s our best metric today it gives us a little room and we don t see any reason right now for those to improve based on the conversation we re having with our trade partners and our labor they don t expect to improve so we don t expect it to improve through 2022 and we re not modeling either to get better or to get worse from what we saw in q4 it s taken us six or seven months to build the house right now and given our position in entry level we think that s a really good number and we can deliver a great home to our customers stephen kim evercore isi analyst got it that s very helpful so you re basically saying that you re sort of doing this in terms of your that two weeks is sort of what you re sort of embedding in your assumptions to keep yourself some wiggle room just in case something unexpected happens which it s been tending to do here so it sounds like it s a bit of a cushion kind of two weeks hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer i don t know if i can call it a cushion this is our actual cycle time right now stephen so we re modeling our actual cycle time although to your point the delays are occurring from a different trade every day so maybe one trade is getting a little bit better but another trade got a delay so i think that we re comfortable maintaining our current expected cycle time again with a 60 backlog conversion in q4 it s easy to calculate what that is so i think that we re comfortable with that but i wouldn t say that that s two weeks of cushion this is our actual cycle time phillippe lord chief executive officer and as we sit here today just very difficult for us to indicate that we see something out there that would suggest it s going to get better that being said we have a ton of houses permitted and teed up if we can increase the production capacity and it does get better we re in a real great position to go out and capture that we have the communities we have the lots on the ground and we re pre permitting a lot of homes and laying it out so we can always accelerate that if the supply chain does get better stephen kim evercore isi analyst yeah yeah it makes perfect sense no reason to assume all right in terms of your gross margin again very encouraging results the 1q though the quarter move the move from 4q to 1q in is always a little bit tricky because you got community level fixed costs and that sort of thing we also have had lumber gyrating all over the place so can you help us heal maybe disaggregate a little bit about what you re seeing there in the 1q guide on gross margins how much of the headwind are we seeing from fixed level community costs and then in lumber and then as you think further out in your guidance you gave a number for the full year which was obviously welcome but i was curious you mentioned i think earlier about costs that you re taking into consideration there are you also assuming anything in terms of incremental pricing from here in that gross margin outlook for the full year hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer so we don t model expected increases in asp we do model increasing in cost when we can when we know and the other one is market driven and we can t control it quite to the same extent so for us we re modeling the current cost trends that we re seeing plus any known increases we re not modeling incremental increases in asps which is why we guided to margin holding steady at that 27 75 for the full year we believe it will have the pricing power to continue to offset the increases that we re seeing and that slight tick down from the 29 slide for gross margin to 28 25 to 28 5 guidance for q1 you re exactly right a piece of it is lots leveraging number one was just lower volume but number two it s also the ramp up of the communities we continue to ramp up in communities here it s a little bit of that and then a little bit of i don t think that it s a number yet coming through it s a little bit too quick to that lumber locks to show up in the financials in q1 it s a little bit of the other costs that have gone up over the last three to six months that you re seeing come through in that q1 number the rest of the year guidance that s really that the lumber lock that we re seeing start to lead through the financial statement stephen kim evercore isi analyst excellent thanks so much guys appreciate all the help operator thank you our next questions come from the line of michael rehaut with j p morgan please proceed with your question michael rehaut j p morgan analyst hi thanks good morning everyone congrats on the results you know first i just want to make sure i understood your answer before hilla around gross margins obviously a key topic as always you ve said that you re modeling costs some cost inflation as you see it now the cost trends continuing but not modeling any future price increases at the same time i thought i heard you say you expect to be able to continue to offset cost with price so i just didn t know how to reconcile those two statements or is it really the former statement that you re just being for all intents and purposes a little bit cautious on your future pace of price increases hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer i wouldn t say that we re cautious on future pace of price increases i would say that the reason that that full year margin is coming in lower than q4 actual so full year 22 is coming in a little bit lower than what we ve experienced for the last two quarters it s because we know we have some costs that are already i ve already been telegraphed that they re going to be increasing so we know what those increases are we think that beyond that future increases will be offset by future price or asp increases so we re kind of holding our current structure as we see it today and assuming that anything above and beyond that will have the pricing power in the marketplace to offset it michael rehaut j p morgan analyst ok that s helpful i appreciate that i guess secondly maybe just on the topic of price i was wondering if you had a sense of during the fourth quarter and maybe compare that to the third quarter what percent of communities were you able to achieve price increases and by roughly what average either for the quarter or the month phillippe lord chief executive officer we would have to follow up with you on that i don t think we have that data available to us but i would say in the fourth quarter i thought prices were relatively stable we re very mindful of affordability in our business we realize that price is the ultimate amenity really focused on just getting the pace we were looking for and not looking to push pricing on to our customers right now so i don t think we raised prices a lot in q4 although we get in certain places where demand was really strong but once again in january it feels like things have accelerated again which gives us some confidence as we look at our priority list and the people waiting for our homes that are being metered we feel like there s some more pricing power that frankly we didn t think we were seeing in q4 we re seeing now michael rehaut j p morgan analyst phillippe could you be a little more granular in terms of your comments around january when you say extremely strong or accelerating i know you don t want to go to get too detailed on a month to month basis but what are some of the things out there that you re seeing in either foot traffic or perhaps either better pricing power or sales pace what are those things that you re seeing right now that gives you that increased confidence now with the spring selling season right around the corner phillippe lord chief executive officer yeah i mean usually the spring selling season starts a little bit later in the year and we ve just seen a lot of people that wanted to buy a home last year who were able to are back in the market they re very active there s a lot of urgency our priority miss in our communities are growing versus sort of stabilizing or shrinking so we re adding more people we have more people waiting for our homes where we re metering to our homes the quality of the traffic is extremely high these buyers have really strong credit profiles as well as debt payments we re seeing our competitors have strong traffic we re seeing continued and robust activity in the retail market where it exists all of the above it feels like the spring selling season at least as we sit today is going to be relatively strong even if interest rates have risen and i said that earlier maybe it s because people think that rates are rising and they re coming into the market with sort of a photo mindset but it also feels like there s still a lot of people out there their rents have gone up they want to buy a home they re moving into our markets we re in the best housing markets in the country there s a truck ton of job growth and in migration going on i mean across all fronts michael really across all fronts hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer i would add two more other data points the first phillippe mentioned in his prepared remarks that when we need there s a certain number of units we can sell per community and we re seeing us to reach that goal early in the month very early in the month once we release the lots for sale they sell so we re hitting that metering pace earlier than in prior months so that s another indication that the demand out there is really robust and as phillippe mentioned we increased prices but on a much more muted basis in q4 we ve really increased the pace of asp growth in just january here alone part of that is because the market allows us and also we re seeing the increased cost comes through but we ve seen no pushback from our customers as we ve increased pricing so that s another data point that s giving us confidence on the strength of january michael rehaut j p morgan analyst great thanks so much guys operator thank you our next questions come from the line of carl reichardt with btig please proceed with your questions carl reichardt btig analyst thanks everybody i wanted to talk about customers for a second and for a while you ve mentioned in releases about sort of entry level customers millennials and you ve got baby boomers and i was curious if you could talk a little bit about the baby boomer component of the demand curve the move down customer and then also just following on to that do you have any sense as to what percentage of your buyers in fourth quarter whether orders or closings came from a different state than the one that they purchased in hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer those are pretty specific carl let us do a little bit of homework and circle back with you on the in state migration it s obviously largest in florida texas and arizona but we can dig in a little bit more and provide you some metrics there and then as far as the baby boomers i m not sure exactly what data point you re looking for they continue to be a material percentage of our business although we re seeing millennials but the generation coming up right behind them is also starting to entry level home buying years that we think over the next couple of years while baby boomers are still going to be a very active part of our business there will be another buyer cohort that early entry rather than a move down component so we re starting to see that play through although we think that will be much more meaningful over the next two to three years phillippe lord chief executive officer given the affordability of our product and the quality of our community and locations we re seeing a very diverse group of folks come to our stores it s gen z it s millennials it s moved down buyers that are looking for more affordable housing it s all the folks that are moving to florida and texas and the south in arizona and colorado because they re leading colder states or less affordable states it s a very diverse group of customers that are moving through our communities and it s being all driven by the affordability and the location hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer one other data point anecdotally we mentioned for the last several quarters at the size of our community is growing in lot counts as we do that we typically have more robust amenities in those locations and for those baby boomers that are looking for that lifestyle active community type of deals the type of amenities that we re providing in our larger communities align with those needs as well carl reichardt btig analyst thanks i mean obviously the spear point of the question is the interest rate sensitivity of the customer types may be different which is why i asked and just shifting to the balance sheet or cash flow really for a second you were significantly ocf positive in 20 obviously not so much this year as you invest in there what s your thinking hilla on 22 and the sense of whether or not you might be ocf positive or negative looking at the land spend and the delivery pattern thanks hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer it s hard to know to model things on a quarter by quarter basis i mean full year we ve guided to 2 billion of acquisition and development that s the same thing that we did this year on a much lower volume if you look at our guidance for next year versus where we ended up this year so we think there ll be a lot of variability intra quarter for full year we would expect to be neutral or slightly positive i would expect since we re spending similar amount of money walking out the door by bringing in a larger percentage one other data point sorry just to clarify now that i understood your question a little bit better the percentage of our cash buyers hasn t really moved too much in the last 18 to 24 months so if that s a proxy for you for baby boomers that s kind of holding steady carl reichardt btig analyst ok thanks very much operator thank you our next questions come from the line of deepa raghavan with wells fargo please proceed with your questions deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst hi good morning everyone thanks for taking my question it is pretty interesting that you talk about price increases in january but also mentioned that your asp for the upcoming communities could be lower as you want to be mindful of affordability do you have a sense for what s the asp sweet spot range is for your buyers and is that what you would be working toward as you target 15 000 steady state home sales phillippe lord chief executive officer yeah i mean obviously we re in a lot of different markets where the sweet spots are different and then we used to be really kind of thinking about our business below fha with the recent increase in fha we get lower than that i think we re constantly looking for land that allows us to position our products in the 3s and 4s we like those price points depending on the market as interest rates rise we think that payment is very attractive to the people that are seeking at homeownership whether it s millennial or gen z or move down anything with a three or four in front of it we think is very attractive to that consumer segment so i d say it s somewhere around all that and then depending on the concentration by market we figure out kind of where our blended asp is hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer you can see deepa if you look at our backlog our backlog asp is 443 but our sales for the current quarter are 433 so you can start to see the product mix shift starting to impact us because obviously we re continuing to increase prices if our net asp is coming down that trend is due to the new products that we re introducing phillippe lord chief executive officer we bought a lot of great land in 2019 and 2020 that s coming to the market really great deep land position at a very attractive basis and when we underwrote that land a lot of that product was in the 3s so maybe it s high 3s now or low 4s but that s kind of the sweet spot deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst got it it looks like there s good run rate with you know should prices stay pretty stable here that s good to know just switching gears a little bit and just for some peace of mind for investors around here is what kind of sensitivity are we looking with your buyer profile should the 30 year mortgage rate increased about 4 hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer so we constantly look at that to make sure that we re priced according to what our consumers can afford we ran a sensitivity analysis at 50 75 and 100 bps from today s prices so kind of about 4 5 north of that so even in that scenario if we were to increase a full 100 bps from today s rate the deterioration in our backlog is like mid single digit low double digits assuming that they buy exactly the same products and don t buy a slightly less expensive or slightly less amenitized homes so we think that there s a minimal overall impact other than psychologically on the balance sheet of the consumer there s certainly the capacity to be able to absorb 50 75 maybe even 100 bps and the small percentage that would fall out we think could be substituted with additional qualified buyers that are in our prequalified pool deepa raghavan wells fargo securities analyst that s great thanks for the call i ll pass it on operator thank you our next question has come from the line of truman patterson with wolfe research please proceed with your questions truman patterson wolfe research analyst hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions first just wanted to touch on your continued shift to the more affordable areas which generally means a little bit further out in these newer communities that have come online just hoping to get an early gauge are absorptions and wait lists in line with some of your legacy communities and then competitors in tertiary markets kind of the outskirts if you will are you seeing any increased incentives now that rates are moving up phillippe lord chief executive officer i ll take the last and then you work backwards we have not seen any incentive activity in the market across any of the competitive stats private builders public builders rental or the retail market people are getting full ask at least in all of our markets if not above ask so no incentives yet haven t seen anybody push out any sort of lock incentives yet either that tends to show up in the market when the rates start to go up and then as we think about our new communities and i think i said this before but we re not going way far out we re just sort of out with the infrastructure and so we re seeing tremendous interest in our new communities every new community that we scheduled to open we start to build a priority list 90 days out from releasing the homes and they are extremely robust and there is a tremendous amount of interest in these new stores truman patterson wolfe research analyst ok thanks for that and then prior to the pandemic you all basically had gross margins in the 19 maybe 20 range but over the past five years or so you all made just significant changes to your business model and quite frankly i don t know that we can necessarily look at historical gross margin based on the strategic shift but just hoping to understand where you think a long term normalized gross margin level is for you all today you know relative to history hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer so i think you re right truman we can t really look at what we did pre pandemic to where we are today the lift in our margin is not really a function of just the current demand the current demand environment has raised every one but i think it s a change in our product mix and our operating model that s really driving that incremental couple of hundred bps that we re seeing above maybe the industry averages i think that our we discussed this previously we probably reset what averages it s no longer 19 or 20 it s probably a couple of hundred bps above that just because of the nature the type of product and who we are as a builder today i don t know if we re going to put a marker understand on what that number is right now but it s definitely north of 19 or 20 truman patterson wolfe research analyst ok thank you for that operator thank you our next questions come from the line of ken zener with keybanc capital markets please proceed with your question ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst good morning all so we see you re rising inventory units obviously it s a function of starts but it s also partly helping to offset lower cycle time as we measure you talked about two weeks we measured as what as a percent complete my one question is this your five roughly five starts per community that you ve done in the last two quarters you talked about in the first quarter i believe can you talk about that being operational decision to ease lower cycle times right just take time slowed 10 you can have 10 more inventory that would kind of neutralize that as opposed to what you think your business model your production types your production level can be because ultimately your start decisions in our view dictate your order level so it s five kind of a rate per community that is part of your more entry production level or is there some component there that we should think about as governing your kind of longer term thinking thank you very much hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer sure the number is probably a little lower than where we wanted to be obviously we ve addressed the supply chain constraints so we re definitely not starting homes at the pace that we would like our start to pace is significantly below where we d like it to be both on a per community basis and then in the aggregate obviously it s also going to grow just as a function of increasing community so you re kind of going to see a doubling effect there for us we re really focused on four to six month supply of lots in entry level which at this point is like 80 of what we own so probably a good proxy for most of our communities so we re looking at four to six months supply of loss and that s just a function of what the market is going to give us in you know the peak here when we re selling five six units a month in those communities we re going to be starting an equal amount of what we re selling we always want to keep that four to six month supply ahead of us you re going to see a ramping up of that because we don t own or we don t have four to six month supply of inventory on the ground right now so you re going to see us ramp up to that as supply chain constraints unwind but then we re kind of going to maintain that pace if you re at that four to six every month sales are substituted by that one start so you ll see that at somewhere around that five to six per month on the entry level and just a tick below that in the first time move up ken zener keybanc capital markets analyst thank you phillippe lord chief executive officer ok operator we ll take one more question operator thank you our final question for today comes from the line of susan maklari with goldman sachs please proceed with your questions charles perron goldman sachs analyst thank you everyone this is actually charles perron on for susan today i guess my first question is regarding the affordable dynamic these days how quickly can you adjust the specs of your unsold homes such as floor plans or finishing to meet the affordability standard especially when considering how early you need to order certain materials to build those homes in this environment phillippe lord chief executive officer well once we start a house there s not a lot we can do other than the price but on future starts we can start smaller square footages square footages with less features in them or homes to plus features in them to help lower the price but on a pre started home there s really nothing we can do charles perron goldman sachs analyst got it got it and then just as a follow up with this rising rate environment how do you expect this to impact the demand trends across entry level relative to move up buyer and specifically do you still expect the entry level to outperform given their continued desire to own a home that you mentioned in the past or maybe you think that you re going to see more move up buyer coming out in your pipeline as in begin the increased ability to meet higher housing payments given their recent home price appreciation phillippe lord chief executive officer yeah i think both i mean clearly our thesis is that as rates increase people are going to move down price because they still need a home and the entry level buyer in particular need to home and with the pressure on rents they re really looking for homeownership so as rates rise we think the entry level buyer performs relatively well as long as they don t get too high and hilla talked about where we think they re going to go and what the opportunity is and then clearly the one new buyer is especially the move up buyer that we re focused on which is a more affordable move up buyer we think they moved down into the entry level communities when rates go and they don t feel like they want to spend as much money on a home on a per month basis so we see a shifting of that but we re not targeting sort of the what i ll call the very affordable price sensitive entry level buyer we re targeting more of the higher and entry level buyer that s more qualified looking for a nicer home it s not all about the lowest price it s really about the best home for the payment they re looking for hilla sferruzza executive vice president and chief financial officer and we call them entry level and first time move up to themselves they re just a buyer so they re going to sell for a price point so if we can offer them a price point at what we call one and when interest rates are a little bit lower that s fine if not they re going to go to the next community and solve for that monthly price point which is where we have the bulk of our communities charles perron goldman sachs analyst thank you i really appreciate the color on this phillippe lord chief executive officer thank you well thank you operator thank you everyone for your continued trust and support we hope you have a great rest of your day thanks again operator duration 68 minutes call participants emily tadano vice

and lakes have fishable ice thanks to some recent severely cold nights most of the ice is clean and strong but there are still some areas may not have as much formed yet due to water or wind current stumps or springs remember that as you venture out you should be sounding with a staff and or checking a few test holes before you get too far from shore as always it is best to ice fish with a friend

season ice don t forget some creepers for your boots and or some sand to put around the holes to keep yourself from falling on slick ice ice anglers at harveys lake should be reminded that with all the ice eaters working to protect the boathouses the ice in certain areas can be deceptively thin far out from shore extra caution should be used when you get out on this waterway anglers at frances slocum are still struggling to find the magic that provided great catches of slab black crappie last year maybe they are being shy to bite or just haven t moved into the area near the dam and the point where most anglers have been targeting them if one thing was consistent last year when the bite was on it is that the very best times to be out were at sunset and even into the night a few decent bluegill and a bass or two have been helping some anglers bide their time so far view more information on ice safety an ice thickness chart and other safety information northcentral region

officer thanks homer and good morning everyone we saw continued improvement in our business during the fourth quarter with refining margins supported by strong product demand in our system we ended the year with gasoline demand at pre pandemic levels and demand for diesel actually higher than pre pandemic levels we also saw a significant jet fuel recovery as domestic and international travel opened up increasing from approximately 60 of pre pandemic levels at the beginning of the year to approximately 80 at the end of the year product inventories were low as a result of the refining capacity rationalization that s taken place in the last two years and weather related impacts from winter storm uri and hurricane ida on the crude oil side opec increased production throughout the year with improving demand supplying the market primarily with sour crude oils resulting in wider sour crude oil discounts to brent crude oil as a result of all these dynamics we saw a steady recovery in margins throughout the year particularly for our complex refining system in regards to our ethanol segment ethanol prices were near record highs in the quarter supported by strong demand and low inventories strong margins coupled with solid operational performance across all of our segments generated record quarterly operating income for our ethanol segment and record overall fourth quarter earnings for valero i am proud to say that 2021 was our best year ever for employee and process safety in fact we ve set records for process safety for three consecutive years these milestones are a testament to our long standing commitment to safe reliable and environmentally responsible operations and despite the pandemic and weather related challenges in 2021 our growth projects remained on track we started up the pembroke cogeneration unit in the third quarter of 21 which provides an efficient and reliable source of electricity and steam and enhances the refinery s competitiveness in addition the diamond green diesel expansion project dgd 2 commenced operations in the fourth quarter on budget and ahead of schedule the expansion has since demonstrated production capacity of 410 million gallons per year of renewable diesel as a result of process optimization above the initial nameplate design capacity of 400 million gallons per year this expansion brings dgd s total annual renewable diesel capacity to 700 million gallons looking ahead the dgd 3 project at our port arthur refinery is progressing ahead of schedule and is now expected to be operational in the first quarter of 2023 with the completion of this 470 million gallon per year plant dgd s total annual capacity is expected to be 1 2 billion gallons of renewable diesel and 50 million gallons of renewable naphtha blackrock and navigator s large scale carbon sequestration project is also progressing on schedule and is still expected to begin start up activities in late 2024 valero is expected to be the anchor shipper with 8 ethanol plants connected to this system which should provide a higher ethanol product margin the port arthur coker project which is expected to increase the refinery s utilization rate and improved turnaround efficiency is expected to be completed in the first half of 2023 on the financial side the guiding framework underpinning our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged we remain disciplined in our allocation of capital which prioritizes a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating in 2021 we took measures to reduce valero s long term debt by approximately 1 3 billion we ended the year well capitalized with 4 1 billion of cash and 5 2 billion of available liquidity excluding cash and our net debt to capitalization was 33 we continue to honor our commitment to stockholders defending the dividend across margin cycles and delivering a payout ratio of 50 in 2021 and as recently announced the board of directors has approved a quarterly dividend of 0 98 per share for the first quarter of 2022 looking ahead we remain optimistic on refining margins with low global light product inventories strong product demand global supply tightness due to significant refining capacity rationalization and wider sour crude oil differentials we also remain optimistic on our low carbon businesses which we continue to expand with the growing global demand for lower carbon intensity products we ve been leaders in the growth of these businesses and maintain a competitive advantage with our operational and technical expertise in closing our team s simple strategy of pursuing excellence in operations deploying capital with an uncompromising focus on returns and honoring our commitment to stockholders has driven our success and positions us well so with that homer i ll hand the call back to you homer bhullar vice president investor relations thanks joe for the fourth quarter of 2021 net income attributable to valero stockholders was 1 billion

expenses of 4 86 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2021 were 0 46 per barrel higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily due to higher natural gas prices the renewable diesel segment operating

renewable diesel sales volumes averaged 1 6 million gallons per day in the fourth quarter of 2021 which was 974 000 gallons per day higher than the fourth quarter of 2020 the higher operating income and sales volumes were primarily attributed to the start up of diamond green diesel expansion project dgd 2 in the fourth quarter the ethanol segment reported record operating income of 474 million for the fourth quarter of 2021 compared to 15 million for the fourth quarter of 2020 adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was 475 million compared to 17 million for the fourth

two questions if you have more than two questions please rejoin the queue as time permits please respect this request to ensure other callers have time to ask their questions questions answers operator our first question today is coming from theresa chen of barclays please go ahead theresa chen barclays analyst good morning thank you for taking my question joe i d like to revisit your comments earlier about the refining margins outlook through 2022 i mean clearly we seem to have a pretty positive setup with lean global inventories and significant amount of refining rationalization that s happened since and even slightly before the pandemic began while demand continues to recover and remain resilient so looking through the rest of this year can you just give us a sense of puts and takes on the variables that could detract from this thesis either risk to the downside or upside from here joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer sure theresa thanks a lot why don t we let gary take a look take a crack at this garry simmons executive vice president and chief commercial officer sure theresa if you look i mean i ll just kind of go through some of the things we re seeing in our system we saw good recovery last year both gasoline and diesel and even good recovery in jet fuel demand and we expect that rebound to continue through 2022 we started the year gasoline demand is off a little bit from what we would expect some of that is just seasonality and but even if you go back to 2019 or we were in 2019 at this time of the year we re off about 7 with the spike in covid cases and also some weather impacting gasoline demand as well but i would tell you already our seven day average is only off about 3 of where it was in 2019 so it looks like this latest surge in covid cases were already coming out of it and so with where gasoline inventories are very bullish gasoline moving forward as you already pointed out we expect to see gasoline demand back to 2019 levels which was close to peak gasoline demand and we ll be trying to feed that demand with significantly less refining capacity so we expect the gasoline markets to be very tight when you move to diesel of course diesel inventories are not only low in the united states but they re low globally diesel demand actually in our system has been about 7 of where it was in 2019 so some of those factors in particular weather that are negatively impacting gasoline are actually are having a positive impact on diesel demand so we see very strong diesel demand and we actually don t see a clear path in the near future to be able to restock those investors with turnaround activity that s occurring in the industry along with the rationalization that s occurred so for us both gasoline and diesel look very constructive moving throughout the year jet demand will be the unknown our expectation is that as we get through this wave of covid much like we saw last year domestic air travel will pick back up fairly rapidly but it will be a longer period of time before international travel picks back up so although we expect to be close back to 2019 levels by the end of the year probably not fully recovered i think to me when you talk about the wild card really the wildcard for this year is what happens in the crude market obviously a lot of tightness in the crude markets today certainly having an impact on differentials and so for us it s kind of when do we see opec begin to ramp up production as global oil demand picks up we would expect opec to increase production a lot of that will be medium and heavy sour barrels which would be constructive to wider differentials moving throughout the year as well theresa chen barclays analyst that s great color thank you so i got to ask the capital allocation question you have been so consistent on your messaging as well as execution around this and with the progress that you ve made on reducing debt generating free cash flow for the past couple of quarters and generally positive momentum on the near term refining outlook are we at an inflection point where we may soon see a step up in cash return to shareholders joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer jason jason fraser executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is jason i ll take that and you re right we ve made good progress on our goals we have said when we started coming out of this situation we ll rebuild our cash to target keeping more on hand around 3 billion we ve done that we had 4 1 billion at the end of the year we also said we re really going to start working on delevering and in the third and fourth quarters of last year we did two delevering transactions paid off about 1 3 billion net brought our net debt to cap down to 33 at the end of the year and our goal is to ultimately get back to our 20 to 30 long term target we ve had and the pace is going to depend on margins and cash generation but getting on to buybacks and the return of cash to shareholders as you said things are looking better now for 2021 the payout was 50 with just the dividend and some minimal buybacks related to the employee plans but with the margin increase in the fourth quarter and they re continuing to be strong during the first quarter so far if this pattern of recovery does continue we do anticipate we ll be doing buybacks this year to meet our target and we feel we can both continue to our pattern our goal of having aggressive debt paydown this year and also meet our shareholder return commitment via projects via buybacks i m sorry we definitely don t think they re mutually exclusive and it s all driven by our framework and targets we ve had in place for several years theresa chen barclays analyst thank you joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer thanks theresa operator thank you our next question is coming from manav gupta of credit suisse please go ahead manav gupta credit suisse analyst thank you guys i just i had first question was on dgd what we are seeing out there is number of projects getting delayed long lead equipment not getting through everybody is kind of lagging you are an exception your project keeps moving forward and i know you always tell me you have the best people but besides best people what else are you doing right which is allowing you to move the time line forward versus everybody else going backwards joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer wow i don t should we even say anything lane riggs president and chief operating officer i m still going to say we have the best people but hi manav this is lane we also completed diamond green 2 right so we have a really good understanding of what the project execution looks like we have the same business partners that are largely executing diamond green 2 and we ve been able to really improve the schedule and it s really just we ve been we ve built two of these we re in our third and it s just a really good team all the way around not just our people we have good business partners as well and we also do permitting we permit these even better so it s just across the board joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer yeah and it s there s lane there s been a lot of lessons learned as we went through one and so i mean lane riggs president and chief operating officer right that s what i mean we ve built 1 we built we just finished 2 and we ve learned all through all those things we are definitely we have the advantage of being an early mover in this space manav gupta credit suisse analyst perfect guys my second follow up very quickly here is it looks like your partner is moving ahead with kind of an acquisition which would give you guys more used cooking oil more animal fats at this stage i think there was a plan at some point to get in more animal fats from international to feed dgd 3 how is the feedstock situation looking for dgd 3 are you very close to what you would need when dgd 3 is up and running in terms of feedstock now martin parrish senior vice president alternative energy and project development yeah manav this is martin obviously our plan is to continue to feed dgd 1 2 and 3 with waste feedstock we feel good about that the market feedstock market s tightened up relative to soybean oil and we knew that was coming with the start up of dgd 2 we changed trade flows we ve moved everything around and that s had an impact on the market and frankly when we contemplated dgd 2 and 3 we expect feedstock to appreciate relative to soybean oil and we expected carbon pricing to appreciate so we re kind of where we expected to be here and yeah the feedstock situation it s a moving target but it s all tied to global gdp growth and just to sum it up yeah we expect to be able to feed it manav gupta credit suisse analyst thank you for taking my questions joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer thanks manav operator thank you our next question is coming from phil gresh of j p morgan please go ahead phil gresh j p morgan analyst yes hi good morning joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer hey phil phil gresh j p morgan analyst hey joe the gulf coast refining margins in the fourth quarter were the best since 2015 if i have that right and they re even better than 4q 19 when we were talking about imo 2020 and feedstock advantages and things like that so i was just curious if there s anything more to elaborate on about the strength of the gulf coast margins that we saw in the quarter and how you think about the sustainability of that garry simmons executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah so i think a lot of typically in the gulf coast when we see stronger capture rates it s tied to feedstock optimization and so certainly we ve been doing a lot around some of those fuel oil blend stocks and running more of those in our system which has helped supported higher capture rates phil gresh j p morgan analyst got it ok and then second question just a follow up on some of the commentary there on renewable diesel the gross margins there down sequentially it sounds like you expected some of that but the capture rate of the indicator there was i think a bit lower than maybe some had expected were there any transitory factors there in your opinion in the quarter as you started up phase 2 and whether it s with feedstock or other factors or is this how you think about kind of a run rate moving forward martin parrish senior vice president alternative energy and project development sure phil this is martin so margin capture in 2021 was all about the feedstock price in first half of 21 feedstock prices were low relative to soybean oil which resulted in some really high margin capture in the fourth quarter the prices were high relative to soybean oil and that gave us a lower margin capture at 75 with the start up of dgd 2 we re going to have tighter prices for a while we expect feedstock to be around soybean oil going forward for the immediate future and then we ll see how that plays out in the next few months after that but we expect it to be right around soybean oil which would incur closer to this 100 type margin capture and that s what we experienced throughout 2019 if you go back and look at those numbers we averaged right around 100 margin capture so that s kind of how we expect things to shake out in the next few months phil gresh j p morgan analyst great very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from roger read of wells fargo please go ahead roger read wells fargo securities analyst yeah good morning everybody joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer hi roger roger read wells fargo securities analyst thanks i want to come back if possible to the crude tightness comments just what you re seeing in terms of differentials what you d expect and then are we highly dependent here on opec putting more oil in the market or is there some other factor at work and one of the reasons i ask is some of the closures that we saw on the refining side tended to be a light sweet unit so if physical demand is down on that side is that also accounting for some of the tightness of the differentials garry simmons executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah roger it s gary i think there s a number of factors that contributed to the tightness not simply opec we saw the winter weather have an impact on heavy canadian production from western canada we had disruptions from supply in ecuador there s been the pipeline issue between the pipeline between iraq and turkey that took barrels off the market so a number of factors we think going forward again not only getting the opec production ramping up we expect to not only see the western canadian production come back we actually think it will grow with some of the logistics projects coming back on and so most of that production that was off the market is coming back in addition to that production coming on the market the opec production growing will take some of the pressure off the crude markets and certainly pressure off the crude differentials roger read wells fargo securities analyst thanks for that and then my unrelated follow up question is coming to you jason like the insight on the possibility of getting back to more normal cash returns model in 22 i was curious though given the significant improvement in working capital in 21 are we at risk of seeing some of that reverse in 22 or when you think about the outlook do you assume a neutral working capital event and maybe we should assume something going the other way jason fraser executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah well our movements in working capital generally follow flat price so when we re forecasting we just assume neutral cash on working capital as our basis roger read wells fargo securities analyst so just a quick reminder if prices go up positive if prices go down it s going to eat working capital jason fraser executive vice president and chief financial officer right that s right roger read wells fargo securities analyst ok great thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from prashant rao of citigroup please go ahead prashant rao citi analyst good morning thanks for taking the question i wanted to circle back on the capital allocation piece a little bit you ve done a great job reducing debt it looks like you ll be able to take another chunk out this year you ve got high balance sheet cash and it sounds like you re very positive on buybacks i just sort of wanted to ask about the dividend i know if it might be a bit premature at this point but given that we re looking at what could be an above mid cycle year in earnings you ve gotten debt controlled and the yield is starting to come in currently just annualized a little bit under 5 and tighter than that if the share price continues to work is taking a hard look at the dividend something that a potential increase something that you might think of this year or is it too soon to start talking about that jason fraser executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah this is jason it s probably a little soon given what we just came through but we always look at it our commitment is to have a sustainable dividend with a yield at the high end of our peer group and that s where it is now where the peers are and the market is we think it s in a good place prashant rao citi analyst ok perfect and then just joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer prashant remember at this time last year there was a big question on sustainability of the dividend right a lot can change in a short period now you never questioned it you always had faith stuff like that but anyway interesting how things come around prashant rao citi analyst it s true it s like a different world altogether right joe joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer yes sir it is prashant rao citi analyst just another quick question ethanol obviously historically high performance here this is the best quarter we ve seen since you ve been reporting quarterly results out of ethanol just wondering a little bit about strength of carryover i think when we discussed this a couple of months back there were some cautious cautious read across as to what happens in 2022 given how volatile the ethanol market is and all the puts and takes i was just wondering if big picture how to think about how where we level set where we are entering 2022 to think about what the cadence might be there some of that strength carrying over but also there s a lot going on in terms of policy gasoline demand a whole bunch of factors there so just wondered if could get some color and maybe a little bit of clarity as to how we should be thinking about that as we look into 22 martin parrish senior vice president alternative energy and project development sure prashant this is martin well obviously fourth quarter was a great quarter for ethanol when you look at it what really set that up as we in the third quarter the margin started off fairly weak and we were also at the end of crop year corn so that this wasn t and corn available in the industry is pretty very low stocks so there was a lot of run cuts a lot of early maintenance taken and the plants really didn t rebound i m talking across the industry i m not talking just valero and get rates back up until early october and then rates exceeded i mean in early october rates exceeded the five year averages but what was interesting is even with higher rates the inventory just never built so when you have a low inventory situation that leads to high margins and that s what we saw so now the last few weeks of the year and the first few weeks of 2022 we ve had significant inventory build so the margins have come off dramatically but that being said we re still probably where we typically are in the first quarter for ethanol margins and i think what we always are looking at ethanol now though is the longer term and that s the carbon capture that s going to provide a great opportunity for us both from the 45q and the lcfs and also we re producing start to produce more and more gallons of cellulosic ethanol from corn fiber so we re optimistic about both of those we re also just confident that ethanol is going to remain a part of the domestic fuel mix we expect higher octane blends in the future namely 95 ron which means more ethanol blending and globally the renewable fuel mandates are going to drive export growth so we feel really good about ethanol going forward maybe not this quarter next quarter but longer term we feel really good about ethanol prashant rao citi analyst make sense thanks so much for the time appreciate it turn it over operator thank you our next question is coming from doug leggate of bank of america please go ahead doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst hey good morning everyone happy new year joe joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer thanks doug same to you doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst joe i m sorry i m going to hit the capital allocation question one more time maybe from a slightly different angle excuse me one second so the balance between dividends and buybacks is really what i m kind of focused on here because i mean you could easily buy back 5 plus percent of your stock that s a pretty healthy dividend growth for an ordinary business and i remind our business so i m just kind of curious how you think about the balance going forward as you reconsider the right level of debt perhaps and the right balance between that 40 to 50 cash allocation to cash returns between the dividend and the buyback i know it s a broad question but i m just kind of curious i guess what s behind us joe is in years gone by there s been criticism of buybacks at a high price level i m wondering if the buyback is more a tool to manage the dividend burden going forward joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer yeah no doug it certainly would be and when you think about where the yield has been particularly last year i mean if we ve been flush with cash last year we would have bought back a ton of shares but we weren t and you re right it is a double edged sword right we end up with good cash flows and typically a high stock price all at the same time so that s why it s hard to create a formulaic approach to how we look at doing this and so i think jason has laid it out coming out of covid we had a very specific set of priorities that we wanted to put in place and i think he covered those what i ll do is look we got a good strong cfo we ll see what he thinks here you ve got anything you d like to share jason fraser executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah no everything you said was accurate and we have to we have to have a balanced dividend because as we ve proven through the last downturn we re going to defend it in the downturn so you have to be wary of making it too high and the buyback you see be the flywheel joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer yes so doug i wouldn t say i mean we always look at the dividend and we d like to increase it i think there s a time when it will be right to do that and it s a burden that we ve been able to carry certainly it s easy in a good margin environment like we have today but in the down margin environment as jason said we d defended it and it was a bit of a load but we re committed to it and we just don t want to get overextended jason fraser executive vice president and chief financial officer and it s well positioned versus the peers our first step is to look versus our peers we committed to be up near the top of the end and as long as we re the highest that box is checked doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst yeah guys i want to be respectful to everyone else and i m going to take my second question on the same topic if you don t mind because i m looking at for example what some of the canadians have done think about as the companies that have long life sustainable assets obviously your business is very similar to that in some respects in terms of the annuity nature so i wonder then whether some folks did question your dividend last year not as of i might add but why then wouldn t you use your balance sheet take your balance sheet to a much stronger level so that kind of concern can be taken out of the investment case so in other words why is 20 to 30 the right level why not go lower given the shock that we all saw in the past year and i ll leave it there thanks joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer doug that s a fair question and i can tell you that s one of the things that jason homer are looking at consistently the capital markets were very accessible last year even in the downturn and rates were so attractive that we were able to really do a good job of financing the business through this but again you never really know jason jason fraser executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah that s right one thing we did to address this is hold a higher cash balance but we also want to have an efficient capital structure and debt is pretty cheap right now the one to zero debt would give you the maximum flexibility and kind of resilience but then you have the cost of a higher cost joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer but doug are you proposing that we would like lever up to buy back shares or something along those lines doug leggate bank of america merrill lynch analyst well it s really yeah it s really more that so you re opportunistically positioned to lean on the balance sheet when you need to without the market speculating about the dividend it s really more because i think your business can support an annuity dividend discount model type of approach but the balance sheet needs to be rightsized to achieve that and again i was just really trying to take that volatility out of the go forward investment case but i ve taken my quoted time joe so i appreciate the answers and thank you joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer sure ok we ll see you soon operator thank you our next question is coming from paul sankey of sankey research please go ahead paul sankey sankey research analyst good morning everyone joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer hi paul paul sankey sankey research analyst so can i ask you guys about europe just from your perspective as a major refiner there what s going on as regards demand the impact of natural gas prices crude slates the whole bit garry simmons executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah so this is gary i guess what we re seeing in terms of demand is they re kind of ahead of where we are in recovery from the latest spike in covid cases if you look at our seven day in the u k we re up about 10 of where we were month to date so starting to see good recovery in mobility and gasoline demand in the system again very similar situation on diesel ara stocks are very low so diesel looks very constructive as well on the natural gas side you see some switching of crude diets as a result of the high natural gas prices still 30 an mmbtu in northwest europe so you see some people kicking out medium and heavy sour grades of crude running more light sweet i think where we ve seen it the most is optimization around hydroprocessing capacity so people idling and cutting hydrocracking capacity as a result of very high natural gas prices which again puts less diesel in the market and is one of the reasons why we re experiencing all the tightness around diesel that we are paul sankey sankey research analyst excellent answer thank you can i just follow up with california we ve seen margins come off quite a bit there but more importantly could you talk a bit about how renewable diesel will play through in that market where you re you re exposed to both sides so i just wonder what your perspective is because we could see a situation obviously where the market gets quite challenged i think by renewables thanks joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer thanks paul martin parrish senior vice president alternative energy and project development paul this is martin renewable diesel has held up really well from a demand side in california it s kind of amazing to me going through covid what we ve seen out there obviously deficits have decreased and they ve decreased because of less carbob or gasoline use and less diesel use but renewable diesel and for the first half of the year and that s the latest stats we have is running 23 of the diesel pool in california so it s we re blending in an r23 statewide which is pretty amazing and a lot of imports coming into california too of renewable diesel so it s kind of held up remarkably well now you can say well maybe that s why the credit price is down but i think really the credit price has got a lot more to do with just less deficits than it has to do with additional credits from renewable diesel so we that s a great market for us i think what really got hurt demand wise was more in europe on renewable diesel and probably more in canada too with just the kind of waiting for the cfs so we expect those two to rebound and with that more demand globally paul sankey sankey research analyst understood could you just throw the answer forward a little bit as we look over the next couple of years in terms of how the supply demand the balance might play out and i ll leave it there sorry not to make you laugh today joe but joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer paul i ll tell you what we ll have a chance for that here pretty soon won t we martin parrish senior vice president alternative energy and project development i think if you play it forward there s really nothing that stops renewable diesel from you can blend it really any rate with renewable diesel right there s 85 renewable diesel sold in california today i think carb s projections are to get somewhere around r40 by 2030 i think a lot of people think that it could be higher than that so that s california but you ve also got other states considering lcfs you ve got the cfs in canada that we re looking forward to by the end of this year and the canadian diesel market is twice the size of california s market so that s going to be a big market for us and we expect that people will over generate credits early when they can right that s what happened in california there was early credit generation building up a credit bank and we expect to see the same thing in canada which is good for renewable diesel demand paul sankey sankey research analyst great thanks all the best for 22 guys thank you joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer thanks paul operator thank you our next question is coming from paul cheng of scotiabank please go ahead paul cheng scotiabank analyst hey guys good morning joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer good morning paul paul cheng scotiabank analyst two questions please first is for martin i think within the renewable diesel another product seems to be getting some excitement by some of your peers saf just want to see whether the company have any interest in where the economics and what leads to change in order for the economics to be compatible with renewable diesel from your standpoint for you to be interested and if you at that point what kind of investment you will need to make in order to make the switch so that s the first question the second question is probably for lane low of atlantic the fourth quarter margin capture was really good so great just want to see if there s any one off events and also that within the two facility in europe and also back in quebec city i mean which is a stronger unit in terms of the margin capture in the fourth quarter thank you martin parrish senior vice president alternative energy and project development ok it s martin i ll get started there paul i think we were all looking at the build back better bill and what was in that on a tax credit basis for saf and what we saw in that incentive level proposed in that bill was not sufficient to attract additional investment to make saf versus the base case of producing renewable diesel with an existing unit however we re still progressing saf production through our gated engineering process and concurrently we re developing customers there are plenty of customers interested in saf but a favorable tax credit something else is going to be required a tax credit or something else to really get over the hump to where saf is economic to produce relative to producing renewable diesel that being said we re still confident that saf production is a question of when and not if we think the margins will eventually work the saf is the only way to reduce the carbon intensity of air travel paul cheng scotiabank analyst and martin how big is the sorry lane just wanted to follow up on what martin said how big is the gap in terms of the incentive for you to fund saf to be attractive enough compared to the renewable diesel and also technically that what kind of investment you need to make and how big is the investment for you that to make dgd that to be able to produce that call it 20 or 30 in saf martin parrish senior vice president alternative energy and project development yeah on the gaap i mean we re somewhere probably around the 0 70 a gallon gap still paul to make it economic on the investment we re still going through our gated process so we don t have a number on that yet we have preliminary numbers but we don t have a number that we re ready to share yet paul cheng scotiabank analyst ok lane lane riggs president and chief operating officer all right so yes what s interesting about the two refineries we have in the atlantic basin is quebec is seasonally stronger in the fourth and the first quarter because it s largely a distillate very specialized distillate producing refinery when it was configured whereas pembroke is really more of a gasoline producing configured refinery so that s kind of how they work out so really in terms of the fourth quarter performance it s really quebec that particularly did well on their margin capture and obviously you have the issues with around high natural gas prices over in the u k obviously that helped sort of hurt their margin capture pembroke s paul cheng scotiabank analyst and lane is there any one off item that you re benefiting in the quarter or that it s just that you guys have done a phenomenal job in the operation ion being able to fully capture the benefit often in the market lane riggs president and chief operating officer i like the second answer but it s yeah quebec ran they both ran really well in the quarter so paul cheng scotiabank analyst ok thank you joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer thanks paul operator thank you our next question is coming from sam margolin of wolfe research please go ahead sam margolin wolfe research analyst hey good morning everybody thank you joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer hey sam sam margolin wolfe research analyst i wanted to just circle back to the industry capacity questions a few other analysts on the call have alluded to a lot of closures over the past 12 months but there are some third parties and some managements in the industry that are suggesting that the number of closures is even higher than any of us are aware of or any kind of report that we would see might confirm and so i wonder what your thoughts on that are and then secondly this is a two part question but only one theoretically where cracks are today you would think that capacity rationalization would stop here or slow down but there s other factors that are may be driving some closures so if you think that this trend could continue based on noneconomic factors would love your input on that too thanks lane riggs president and chief operating officer hey sam it s lane so we are trying to study the data right now because what we see the similar issue in terms of what where utilization is and versus closures and again it s just sort of what we re sort of preliminarily deciding or looking at as we think that there s probably some slowdowns that are occurring maybe because of maintenance deferrals or turnaround deferrals in the industry we don t that s not something we know but it s a theory as to what you re seeing and certainly where margins are now the call on capacity is pretty much max so other than the turnarounds and the outages the refinery utilization ought to be in this 90 to 95 range once you get all the doe data worked out to make sure all the refineries that you think shouldn t be in and everything but that s kind of where we see it as well sam margolin wolfe research analyst ok thanks so much operator thank you our next question is coming from ryan todd of piper sandler please go ahead ryan todd piper sandler analyst good thanks maybe just one quick follow up on your comments on california from earlier i know you had talked about some of the longer term or at least issues of low carbon fuel standard credits do you have a view on for the next 12 months where you think the lcfs credits go from here we ve gone from 200 to 150 ish do you see further downside or do you think we stabilize here martin parrish senior vice president alternative energy and project development that s a good question this is martin what s difficult about this is you re always driving with your rearview mirror right the last the data lags by six months and i m not complaining about that it makes sense it s a lot of data but so we re always kind of we ve got at the end of this month we ll get the third quarter data i think what s interesting is when you look at it the credit price obviously depends on credit generation versus deficit generation and covid certainly reduced deficit generation and it has been since the second quarter of 20 so you have to think the credit prices have been reduced by covid and then the other thing that s interesting to me is when you look at the credit generation in 2q 21 i d say that it certainly surprised me to the upside but when you dig into that there s really two line items in the credit generation that stand out the first was that bio cng bio compressed natural gas was 13 of all the 2q 21 credits and that line item was up 190 versus 2019 and second off road electricity generated 9 of all credits now this is off road not on road and that was up 146 versus 2019 and more interestingly on the off road 71 of those credits came from e forklifts so when you think about the bio cng the off road the e forklifts you just wonder if that pace of credit generation can continue or the infrastructure and just really the gets in the way right i don t know how many times you can replace your forklift to get an e forklift but it seems like that would run out at some point so we ll see how that shakes out but if you think about those two line items that s what 21 22 of the credits in california from two line items there which really were very small in the past so that s just kind of an interesting bet and then the other is biodiesel renewable diesel and on road electricity credit generation as a percent of total credits were all flat for 2q 21 versus 2019 as a whole that was just a little color hopefully that helps some ryan todd piper sandler analyst yeah thanks that s great and then maybe just one overall i know you ve talked a lot about what you ve seen generally in terms of demand particularly here in the u s any comments in terms of what you re seeing on the product export side that may indicate what you re seeing on international product demand particularly in your primary export markets garry simmons executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah this is gary so i would tell you we re probably seeing we re not seeing the recovery in latin america quite as fast as we ve seen in north america or the u k so demand is still down a little bit we re seeing good export demand into the region i would expect in the first quarter our exports will be down a little bit not really an indication of demand in latin america but more a function of maintenance activity occurring especially in the u s gulf coast during the quarter and really good domestic demand but the demand is there in latin america in our typical export markets ryan todd piper sandler analyst great thanks guys operator thank you our next question is coming from jason gabelman of cowen please go ahead jason gabelman cowen and company analyst hey good morning thanks for taking my questions i m not going to dovetail off a comment that was just made meaning it s in the gulf coast it looks like guidance or throughput is down quarter over quarter for 1q in 4q about 300 000 barrels a day can you just discuss if what maintenance activity you re going to have on 1q if there are other onetime items impacting that guidance and if you think that s indicative of the industry as a whole just given it seems like there was a lot maintenance delayed due to covid over the past couple of years and then my second question is hopefully one you can answer kind of on geopolitics and what s going on with russia valero imports a lot of intermediate feedstock from russia and can you just discuss maybe the margin kind of enhancement that provides and how you re more broadly thinking about both the risks and opportunities these geopolitical issues with russia present for your company thanks lane riggs president and chief operating officer this is lane i ll take the first one so we don t really comment directly on our turnaround activity going into the quarter the volumes are the proxy for that so you can just sort of decide what that means and we certainly don t we also don t comment on our peers on what we think they re doing with respect to turnarounds this is just sort of a policy for us joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer gary you want to talk about russia garry simmons executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah so obviously we don t really until any kind of sanctions are announced we don t really know what they would entail what i can tell you is that when we ve seen things like this happen in the past in other locations it imply results in the change in trade flows so what we would expect to happen here is some of those intermediates that we re running today will be run somewhere else throughout the world and wherever those end up going they ll kick out feedstocks that make it available for us to run so certainly as a commercial team we re looking at what those are today and making sure we have them approved in our system and are ready to run them if we need to in the future jason gabelman cowen and company analyst got it thanks operator thank you our next question is coming from connor lynagh of morgan stanley please go ahead connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst yeah thanks maybe sticking with major exporters i was wondering what you guys made of the discussion around pemex potentially ending crude exports and what do you see as the implications do you think it s likely to occur and what do you think the implications on particularly the gulf coast refining industry would be garry simmons executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah so this is gary i think lane has been pretty public on our views on being able to meaningfully change refinery reliability and utilization he s kind of said two turnaround cycles and a lot of capital so it looks like their goals are pretty aggressive but if they re able to increase refinery utilization if the dos bocas refinery starts up certainly it would decrease the amount of crude for export our view is that the first destinations to be cut will really be european destinations and asian destinations for export from mexico it goes first our experience has been that as they increase refinery runs in mexico they increase the export of high sulfur fuel oil and that s a good feedstock for our high complexity u s gulf coast system it actually serves as a nice complement to a lot of the light sweet grades we run in our u s gulf coast system we ve had a long standing great relationship with pemex and we expect that to continue long into the future connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst got it helpful context maybe just returning to the capacity question but in a global sense the closures obviously you had sort of a net decline in some areas and you re sort of at least in theory flipping back to growth at a global capacity level over the next couple of years here i mean do you are you concerned about that do you see that meaningfully altering the to your earlier point product flows or crude flows just how do you think about that that impact on your margins lane riggs president and chief operating officer this is lane i mean we read the same journals you guys do in trade magazines and we have people that keep up with refinery closures and refineries starting up obviously the middle east has some refineries starting up china has some i guess we sort of believe that china has this longer term plan of having larger refineries run instead of what we call the teapot refineries but at the end of the day it s hard to really sort of have a real strong view on where all this really heads i always go back to when the indian refinery lines were starting up and we were concerned then and we were there were all these theories it s going to cause u s refineries stress and calculated their import parity into our marketing at the end of the day what happened is most of the barrels stayed in the region so you just these are difficult things to work through but what we do is we run our assets we make sure they re competitive not only here in the u s but everywhere in the world and we know that as long as there s brent out there in this industry we ll get our share of it so connor lynagh morgan stanley analyst fair enough thank you i ll turn it back joe gorder chairman and chief executive officer thanks connor operator thank you at this time i d like to turn the floor back over to mr bhullar for closing comments homer bhullar vice president investor relations great thanks donna thanks everyone for joining

remarks will focus on our as adjusted results a reconciliation of gaap to as adjusted results can be found on pages 18 and 19 of the earnings release and on slides 16 through 19 of the earnings presentation yesterday we reported record earnings of 1 24 per share compared with 0 76 in the prior year s quarter and 1 06 sequentially the fourth quarter of 2021 included cumulative adjustments to compensation and benefits and income taxes that lowered our compensation to revenue ratio and effective tax rate respectively revenue was a record 159 7 million for the quarter compared with 116 6 million in the prior year s quarter and 154 3 million sequentially the increase in revenue from the third quarter was primarily attributable to higher average assets under management and open end funds and higher performance fees from certain institutional accounts when compared with the third quarter our implied effective fee rate was 58 1 basis points in the fourth quarter compared with 57 5 basis points in the third quarter excluding performance fees our fourth quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57 basis points and our third quarter implied effective fee rate would have been 57 3 basis points operating income was a record 82 6 million in the quarter compared with 49 4 million in the prior year s quarter and 70 4 million sequentially our operating margin increased to a record 51 7 from 45 6 last quarter primarily due to the cumulative adjustment mentioned a moment ago which reduced compensation and benefits to reflect actual amounts to be paid expenses decreased 8 1 when compared with the third quarter as lower compensation and benefits was partially offset by higher g a the compensation to revenue ratio which included the cumulative adjustment was 26 16 for the quarter for the year the compensation to revenue ratio was 32 22 the increase in g a was primarily due to higher travel and entertainment increased hosted and sponsored conferences and higher recruitment fees and the increase in distribution and service fee expense was primarily due to higher average assets under management in u s open end funds our effective tax rate which was 25 36 for the quarter included a cumulative adjustment to bring the rate to 26 15 for the year the reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily due to a decrease in a nondeductible portion of executive compensation on a higher than previously forecasted pre tax base page 15 of the earnings presentation sets forth our cash and cash equivalents corporate investments in u s treasury securities and liquid seed investments for the current and trailing four quarters our firm liquidity totaled 248 2 million at quarter end compared with 241 million last quarter firm liquidity as of december 31 reflected the payment of a special cash dividend in december of 60 3 million or 1 25 per share over the past 12 years we have paid a total of 15 25 per share in special dividends and we continue to be debt free assets under management totaled a record 106 6 billion at december 31 an increase of 9 4 billion or 10 from september 30 the increase was due to net inflows of 1 8 billion and market appreciation of 9 1 billion partially offset by distributions of 1 6 billion this marks the 10th consecutive quarter that we have recorded net inflows bob steers will be providing an update on our flows and institutional pipeline of awarded unfunded mandates and now i d like to briefly discuss a few items as we begin the new year first regarding our expected compensation to revenue ratio we intend to balance anticipated revenue growth from year end assets under management that exceeded our full year assets under management by about 13 with a disciplined approach toward adding human capital in addition to the full year impact from the new hires we made last year we plan on making controlled investments in order to broaden our product offerings expand our public and private distribution efforts and most importantly to maintain our industry leading investment performance as a result we expect that our compensation to revenue ratio will increase to 33 75 and from the 32 22 recorded in 2021 continuing with the theme of investing in our business we expect g a to increase 10 to 15 from the 47 2 million we recorded in 2021 we intend to make incremental investments this year in technology including the implementation of new systems that will add efficiencies and expand our capabilities cloud migration and upgrades to our infrastructure and security we will also make investments in global marketing focused on hosting virtual and in person conferences as well as expanding our digital footprint and we expect that travel and entertainment costs will increase as global conditions begin to return to normal we expect that our effective tax rate will remain at 26 15 in 2022 and finally you will recall that a year ago we noted that we were anticipating the redemption of 1 billion global real estate institutional account in 2021 i am pleased to inform you that not only do we continue to manage this account but the client has also added assets to it and therefore we no longer consider this account to be at risk and now i d like to turn it over to joe harvey who will discuss our investment performance joe harvey president thank you matt and good morning everyone today i will review our investment performance and discuss the macro environment and its impacts on our asset classes four weeks into january the fourth quarter of last year seems far away but it was very strong for equities 2021 closed with momentum and expectations for post pandemic economic recovery earnings growth stimulus and appetite for risk taking our largest asset class u s reits was the best performing sector in the s p returning over 16 in the quarter for the full year our asset classes performed well with u s reits up 41 global real estate up 26 listed infrastructure up 15 resource equities up 24 and preferred is up nearly 3 with the new year however the market has finally focused on rising inflation which as we shared our views with you last year will likely persist with the last reading at 7 cpi is currently at the largest gap to the federal funds rate in our professional lifetimes reversion of that gap will come by way of both monetary tightening as well as from inflation normalizing at a lower rate we believe inflation could stabilize in the high 2 zip code or 100 basis points higher than the pre pandemic trend line the interest rate and adjustment process will reshuffle the deck of winning and losing asset classes and sectors while exposing vulnerabilities from risk seeking borrowers we believe that the u s economy will continue to enjoy above trend growth supported by a prolonged and oscillating recovery as the pandemic ebbs and flows earnings sensitivity to inflation should be a key differentiator in performance to counteract the impending interest rate adjustment looking at our performance scorecard in the fourth quarter eight of nine core strategies outperformed or equaled their benchmarks for the last 12 months nine of nine core strategies outperformed measured by aum 99 of our portfolios are outperforming benchmarks on a one year basis compared with 79 last quarter the improvement was attributable primarily to global real estate which improved from 25 outperforming in the third quarter to 95 outperforming as of year end for both three and five years 100 of aum are outperforming 86 of our open end fund aum is rated four or five star by morningstar compared with 88 last quarter credit goes to our investment leaders john cheigh our cio and chris parliman chief administrative officer in guiding our teams to these outstanding results in light of the inflation situation i ll kick off our asset class review by highlighting our multi strategy real assets portfolio the benchmark for which returned 21 in 2021 this portfolio is designed to provide equity like returns inflation sensitivity and diversification we outperformed the benchmark by 340 basis points for the year which included outperformance in all five asset class sleeves as well as asset allocation alpha by our portfolio manager vince childers this portfolio is designed to perform best in environments of rising or unexpected inflation commodities and resource equities provided the most inflation sensitivity while real estate is driven more by economic growth and infrastructure tends to be an all weather performer valuations of these listed real assets are as cheap as they ve been to equities in 20 years meantime the beta to equities is just 0 6 times we recently published a white paper on this strategy and its constituent asset classes and is available on our website our three core real estate strategies u s global and international outperformed in both the quarter and year as mentioned global real estate returned 26 with significant dispersion by region the u s returned 41 europe returned 9 and asia returned 4 to address the inflation and interest rate question on prospective performance earnings sensitivity and replacement cost dynamics should help listed real estate globally these companies cash flows should accelerate to an average of 12 over the next few years compared with their long term growth rate of 5 u s reit returns have averaged 10 8 during periods of rising bond yields accompanied by rising growth while in periods of rising yields with declining growth returns have been flat comparatively private real estate unleveraged returns have averaged 10 7 in high inflation environments versus 6 5 in low inflation environments turning to infrastructure the asset class returned 15 in 2021 compared with 22 for global equities lagging for the second year we outperformed our benchmark for the quarter and year sector dispersion was wide with over 40 percentage points best to worst while certain pandemic challenged sectors namely passenger rails toll roads and airports restrained performance the ongoing economic recovery should provide tailwinds for these sectors going forward reflecting the income and stable cash flow growth profile of infrastructure i d characterize infrastructure generally as steady eddie that is it provides solid returns in most market regimes while not at the top of the charts nor at the bottom in part due to president biden s now passed infrastructure spending legislation we are seeing broadening allocations in institutional portfolios and increased flows in wealth preferred securities portfolios had modest negative returns in the fourth quarter but performed well versus fixed income for the full year for the quarter and the year we outperformed benchmarks in both our core and low duration strategies this year likely we ll test fixed income performance generally based on our review for rising bond yields that said preferred credit fundamentals are very strong reflecting the high representation in banks and other financials while spreads are generally in line with long term averages our portfolios are positioned defensively against increases in interest rates with duration of 2 4 years in our low duration strategy and 4 0 years in our core preferred strategy after high yield preferreds offer the second highest yields in fixed income and offer meaningful tax advantages for the taxable investor due to the high percentage of qualified dividend income that they produce in terms of our private real estate initiative we have commenced our investment process and have closed on several property acquisitions for both our income strategy and our opportunistic or capital appreciation strategy this year we will look to add a real estate investment strategist as part of our expansion of multi strategy capabilities to help our teams and clients allocate between listed and private real estate and execute thematic and strategic research we look forward to sharing our progress on this initiative in the future in closing we are very positive about the allocation trends we are seeing for our asset classes in the institutional channel we see a greater need to allocate to real assets by example in the private market dry powder and private equity funds is at 390 billion for real estate and 300 billion for infrastructure investors are becoming more comfortable with listed allocations to complement private despite greater measured volatility some investors want real assets with liquidity particularly in the endowment and foundation and healthcare segments where some plans liquidity has been challenged in our early stage pipeline we have some sovereign wealth opportunities where the plan sponsors are making initial allocations to listed real estate and infrastructure we would expect those initial small allocations to grow meaningfully to make it worthwhile for those plan sponsors to research the asset classes and oversee additional managers in the wealth channel we are seeing earlier stage adoption of private real asset allocations as we ve seen in other markets this will help drive listed allocations over time we believe the inflation environment will help provide additional support for these trends finally manager consolidation and conversions from passive to active are trends also in our favor as our performance continues to be excellent thank you for listening i ll turn the call over to bob steers bob steers chief executive officer thanks joe and matt and good morning everyone 2021 was a record breaking year in myriad ways for cohen steers it marked our 35th anniversary and 17 years as a public company for the quarter and year we achieved a record number of records driven by improving fundamentals a rebounding economy accompanied by the return of meaningful inflation and for the first time in over a decade the prospect of sustained fed tightening as matt discussed assets under management increased to a record 106 billion at year end driven by our 10th consecutive quarter of firmwide net inflows both open end fund and advisory channels ended the quarter with record assets under management for the full year we also achieved record gross and net inflows open end fund and advisory gross sales increased 11 and 13 to 19 5 billion and 4 9 billion respectively most notably open end fund net inflows rose 62 year over year to a record 8 8 billion while the advisory channel also registered a record 1 9 billion of net inflows firmwide organic growth was 12 for the year the seemingly sudden rise of inflation and the expectation from multiple rounds of fed tightening have put into stark relief the importance and value of portfolio allocations to actively managed real asset strategies across client portfolios to enhance returns and provide diversification the wealth channel was by far our strongest business segment and achieved multiple milestones in the quarter net inflows in that channel were a record 2 5 billion for a 22 organic growth rate and represented our 12th consecutive quarter of positive net flows importantly net flows in the quarter were not just strong but also diverse with meaningful contributions from each of the wirehouse regional brokerage and ria segments in addition dcio open end fund net inflows were a record 476 million and marked the 14th consecutive quarter of net inflows dcio assets in our open end funds ended the year at a record 6 billion our non u s open end funds registered net inflows of 45 million in the quarter and a record 202 million for the full year we will continue to invest to support growth in this important channel and we expect that flows will continue on an upward trajectory for the year the powerful combination of strong absolute and relative performance derived from our unique and diversifying asset classes resulted in 25 organic growth in wealth and industry leading market share as well our u s global real estate and preferred securities funds achieved market share records of 33 12 and 46 respectively against other comparable actively managed funds 2021 was a record year for the institutional advisory channel as well with 1 9 billion of net inflows however 2021 was also a year in which we reorganized our sales leadership and converted to a regional approach to our institutional sales coverage we enter 2022 fully staffed and prepared to go higher and deeper into the global institutional marketplace in the quarter the advisory channel had net outflows of 456 million these outflows were driven by a single and unexpected client termination of 400 million however not included in the headline advisory flow results was 564 million of net new mandates from institutional clients which were invested into our open end funds other full year achievements for the advisory channel include positive net flows from each of the u s emea and asian markets additionally all of our core strategies u s real estate global real estate global listed infrastructure and preferred securities registered net inflows the pipeline of awarded but unfunded mandates has increased dramatically 900 million in september to 2 1 billion another new record new awards in the quarter totaled 1 3 billion and included our first relationship in africa a 300 million global listed infrastructure mandate sub advisory flows in the quarter were subdued net outflows in japan were 242 million and distributions totaled 276 million sub advisory net outflows ex japan in the quarter were a modest 56 million at the risk of sounding overly optimistic we believe our current momentum and growth prospects have never been brighter driven as always by our industry leading investment results it bears repeating that virtually 100 of our aums are outperforming their benchmarks for the one three five and 10 year time periods a truly remarkable accomplishment looking ahead the combination of industry leading investment performance rising demand for real asset strategies and our plans for new product introductions designed to meet this demand has us poised for continued organic growth in addition to our open end fund organic growth next month we plan to market the first new listed real estate securities closed end fund in over nine years supported by an exceptionally strong and deep syndicate and as i ve discussed the institutional advisory channel entered this year with a record pipeline fully staffed and the reorganization behind them also under new leadership our emea wholesale business is also poised to deliver meaningful organic growth to capitalize on all of this momentum this year we plan to launch multiple new initiatives which will seek to position cohen steers at the intersection of public and private real estate markets through the introduction of vehicles tailored to the unique requirements of both the institutional and wealth marketplaces these initiatives are designed to take us higher and deeper into real assets and position us for continued future growth with that i will turn the call back to the operator for questions questions answers operator thank you our first question comes from john dunn evercore isi please go ahead john dunn evercore isi analyst hi guys you ve done a good job in the past about laying out all the work you ve done to prepare for an inflationary environment on the investment strategy side could you talk a little bit about the stuff you ve done on the distribution side particularly in the wealth management channel to prepare for inflation bob steers chief executive officer joe do you want to answer that joe harvey president well it s a matter of i believe just making sure that we re educating our client base and wealth management and presenting the strategies that we think are best suited for the environment and one of the an example would be in our preferred strategies to educate and focus on our low duration strategy and we ve been seeing increased flows into that strategy the other vehicle and strategy that we think makes most sense for the wealth channel is our multi strategy real assets portfolio that i highlighted in my discussion and that s a good all round portfolio enhancer that doesn t give clients risk to any one asset class like commodities which could be volatile or over the long term not perform as well as a blended approach to real asset investing so i believe that the wealth channel generally wasn t prepared for inflation because it hasn t been on the radar for a long time and so we ve got a great opportunity to educate and we ve been doing that and highlight the strategies that we have such as the low duration preferred and multi strategy real assets portfolio to put portfolios in a better place i will say too that while reit strategies historically have not been as inflation sensitive in the short term this cycle they ve been very sensitive to the changes in the inflation environment and we have seen and that s demonstrated by our flows into our open end funds very strong interest in reits as a way to protect against inflation john dunn evercore isi analyst got it and then maybe could you give us an update on the private real estate team you know the progress they ve been making over the last several months and then maybe the growth outlook for that team joe harvey president sure well the team is formed and as i mentioned in my comments we ve made our first couple of acquisitions and we re focused on two different strategies one is an income strategy and that is designed for our income related vehicles that we have today and we re in the lab constructing for the future and those will be primarily designed for the wealth channel and there are things like closed end funds and nontraded reits then on the institutional side we ve got a vehicle that is in the early cornerstone capital raising phase and that s a capital appreciation strategy we ve also made a commitment there so we re off and running and we ll be able to report our progress on capital raising over the next year john dunn evercore isi analyst thank you very much joe harvey president just let me finish on that point as both bob mentioned and i mentioned our vision here is pretty broad in that we see opportunities to work with a wide variety of clients to better allocate their real estate allocation between the listed and the private market and that s why we ll be hiring a real estate investment strategist this year to work as part of our listed and private real estate capability and a broader multi strategy capability but the backdrop is that investors are just as i think i outlined in my comments much more comfortable allocating their capital either to a listed market private market no matter where and then but driven by where the best opportunities are and so we want to work with our clients to help them optimize portfolios and it could be done on an advice basis which we re always in the room on with our clients but it can also be done through vehicles so we have this broader vision and we see an opportunity to as bob mentioned kind of sit at the intersection of listed and private and help investors optimize portfolios john dunn evercore isi analyst thank you operator thank you our next question comes from robert lee kbw please go ahead unknown speaker hey good morning this is alex for rob i know you guys gave a little bit of color on expenses maybe increase in tech next year in g a can you add a little bit more color around comp of what the expectation is or pressures heading forward bob steers chief executive officer matt do you want to speak to that matt stadler chief financial officer sure so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we are continuing to build out areas where we have momentum as highlighted in both bob and joe s remarks which include broadening our product offerings joe just mentioned an investment strategist to help explore continued products in public and private blending so we re and continuing of course to invest in the investment department more broadly to maintain our industry leading performance and in addition to that as the firm grows there s some infrastructure in legal and it and fund admin that is required to meet the needs of the growing business so i think 2021 comp year was pretty anomalous in that it showed a huge increase in compensation relative to a huge increase in revenue year over year i think as we get into 2022 it s not expecting to have a reoccurrence of that but yet we have to continue to invest in our business and keep growing our business so i think the 150 basis point increase is reasonable given all of that backdrop unknown speaker great thank you joe harvey president i would just add in terms of being competitive on compensation when you look at our business and i think it s pretty evident based on the comments today that we ve got a lot of things going for us starting with strong investment performance which is and strategies that are in demand which leads to organic growth and so while a lot of the industry has been helped by appreciation our business has drawn has been driven by a combination of things both organic growth and appreciation and so with our business model and strong performance i think we re well positioned to be competitive on compensation no matter what the markets bring us in the foreseeable future bob steers chief executive officer i would also add again the underlying our expectation for the comp ratio just highlights how leverageable our business model is because it includes building from scratch building organically the entire private real estate team which we re not assuming any meaningful revenues this year along with building the team that will sit at the intersection between public and private we don t expect meaningful payoffs from those new initiatives until 2023 and beyond and that s all contemplated in the guidance that we re giving and so it just again it shows that our business model our structure competes very well economically versus other asset managers unknown speaker great thank you for taking my question operator thank you our next question is from marla backer of sidoti please go ahead marla backer sidoti analyst thank you so just continuing on with investments that you re looking at for 2022 particularly in human capital as you said you mentioned the real estate investment strategist can you give us some more color around the potential timeline as to when some of these investments might take place and what you re seeing in your pipeline bob steers chief executive officer joe would you take that joe harvey president sure when you look at you know our plans for headcount additions they re i d say they re broad throughout the functionality of the firm and that s driven by the fact that we re having success on a lot of fronts so i think as you can think about loading that into a model it s going to be spread over the first half of this year in terms of thinking about those headcount additions marla backer sidoti analyst ok and then switching topics given your traditional strength in real estate investing there s been a lot of discussion about just a change in the paradigm of how companies do business and whether people will continue working at offices to the same extent as they do pre covid do you see any potential opportunities for you in terms of investing in any restructuring of existing office property joe harvey president well first of all it s an exciting topic right what we live for is change and the case of the pandemic and how it impacts the commercial real estate industry there s some structural and secular change that s taking place there was a article in the wall street journal yesterday that said that the way we work live and play is changing and that s something we believe in strongly is going to change which regions of the country or getting stronger and which are getting weaker and it s going to change the fortunes of property segments and subsegments within those property types so as active investors that change is what creates opportunity and that s what energizes us so specifically to the topic of the office sector it s one that we ve targeted as an area of opportunity particularly on the private side and so but it s driven by the change taking place of migration to southern states such as florida or texas which is driven by a lot of things including the tax regime and so it s creating opportunities and that s where we that s what we re all about as an active investor marla backer sidoti analyst thank you operator thank you that was our final question i d like to turn the call back over to joe harvey president for any closing remarks joe harvey president thank you since i will have the honor of succeeding bob steers as ceo on march 1 this will be his last earnings call next quarter we will continue with the same format with matt reviewing financials john cheigh providing an investment review and me handling the overall business review no doubt i have large shoes to step into considering that bob co founded cohen steers along with marty cohen over 35 years ago since our ipo in 2004 our aum has grown from 15 billion to 106 billion and our annualized return to shareholders has been 17 3 compared with 11 2 for the s p 500 with that backdrop our executive committee and senior leadership are as strong as ever and we remain intensely focused on continuing our long record of innovation and excellence we will continue to have the counsel of bob and marty as largest shareholders and board members alongside our other active and value added board members for a period of time bob will continue as executive chair to work on our private real estate initiative on behalf of cohen steers employees our board shareholders and clients i would like to thank bob for creating along with marty a great company and for being a great leader in addition i would like to congratulate bob on preparing us for a smooth transition into the future we look forward to talking with you in april bob steers chief executive officer thank you operator operator duration 45 minutes call participants

they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now and southwest airlines wasn t one of them that s right they think these 10 stocks are even better buys see the 10 stocks stock advisor returns as of january 10 2022 so with that i have the pleasure of turning it over one last time to my friend gary kelly gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you ryan and good morning everybody and thank you for joining us for the southwest airlines fourth quarter 2021 earnings call and first and foremost i m delighted to be able to say there were earnings and better than we thought at investor day last month it s obviously a great way to end a tough but much improved year a great way to start a new year we re of course finding our way through the omicron surge in january february and looking forward to a strong rebound in march and thereafter and as always as barring any unforeseen events i expect we ll make great progress in 2022 and will enjoy another much improved year as we all know too well it will not be without its challenges but our people and our leadership are more than up to the task i m enormously proud of all of them and i thank them profusely for their resilience and their perseverance through these myriad of challenges that we ve faced the last two years they ve just done a phenomenal job southwest is on top because our people deliver great service low fares and our business model delivers consistent profits and handsome returns on capital and we ve emerged from two years of pandemic with our balance sheet strength and our liquidity intact and we are perfectly positioned to restore to expand and compete aggressively in the coming years and i could not be more enthused and more excited about our future so with that i m going to turn it over to our outstanding ceo and waiting for five more days mr bob jordan bob jordan executive vice president corporate services well thank you gary and hello everybody we were last together on december 8th at investor day and a lot has happened since then but before i get to that i want to thank my friend gary kelly gary is a phenomenal leader and done so much for southwest and for me personally there s no there s just no way to say thank you enough for his 18 years of leadership as our ceo and i m thrilled that he will be our executive chairman i ll take over the ceo responsibility for investor meetings going forward so this is gary s last earnings call and my friend i just want to stop and say a huge thank you and i love you well 2022 has had a challenging start but that doesn t change our goals for the year getting properly staffed focusing on our people making meaningful progress returning to our historic operational reliability and efficiency providing our legendary hospitality and returning to consistent profitability we made significant progress in 21 including a profitable fourth quarter despite the pandemic and saw strong demand 88 of 2019 revenues restored and managed business demand ahead of our expectations for december while we don t expect to be profitable this quarter the omicron impact does appear to be isolated to january and february and we expect a profit in march expect to be profitable in the remaining quarters and for the full year 2022 based on our current plans our people performed just really well during fourth quarter as they always do and particularly during the holidays and demand held up well through year and despite the omicron variant beginning in early january we experienced a very difficult environment due to rapidly rising covid cases and a decrease in available staffing levels it s amazing when in the first three weeks we had roughly 5 000 employees test positive for covid with employee cases roughly two and a half times what they were during the delta variant the resulting staffing shortage combined with winter weather caused a spike in flight cancels and a significant disruption to the operation i m pleased to report though that over the last few weeks the operation and staffing has stabilized and we ve seen performance even better than during the holidays yesterday for example we were 95 on time which i m just usually proud of to maintain sufficient available staff we extended incentive pay programs for ops employees through early february while that does add temporary cost pressure it s imperative that we have sufficient staff to operate our schedule and minimize our flight cancellations covid case counts are on a downward trend and we intend to normalize our staffing and pay structure as a result hiring is part of the equation of course and we met our 2021 hiring goals and we are on track with plans to add at least 8 000 employees this year we re also raising our starting wage rates to be competitive in the market and due to the impacts from omicron and the variant and recent staffing challenges and we re further moderating our first half 2022 capacity plans to provide additional buffer for the operation we re encouraged by the recent improvement in bookings across the booking curve especially in the march timeframe and we are hopeful that business travel resume the 2021 trend it appears that omicron impacts are pretty well contained to january and february from a revenue perspective and we believe our temporary approach to boost available staffing is working we ll stay flexible of course and we ll be willing to further adjust our plans if needed so several things have transpired since investor day all driven by the pandemic though but for omicron we would be on our investor day q1 and full year 2022 guidance however i want you to know make no mistake we are laser focused on preserving our low cost position in the industry and returning to 2018 productivity and efficiency levels by the end of 2023 we believe q1 casm x as a peak and our plans call for unit cost to ease from here into 2023 looking at 2023 based on current growth plans we expect casm x to be down as compared to 2022 restoring both the network and our fleet efficiency are key to returning to historic efficiency levels and beyond that i m really excited about opportunities that continue network growth as we add gates in key cities such as denver and phoenix and las vegas baltimore nashville and even more beyond 2023 we see opportunities to meet and then beat our historic productivity and efficiency levels as we continue to grow the company and focus on modernizing our operational tools and processes and mike will talk more about that but i want to repeat my main message from investor day despite the near term noise we have a superb business model the substantial underlying competitive advantages we have a great five year strategy and a strong set of initiatives that will drive significant value our new co brand credit card agreement is in place with a partner chase our gds expansion is complete and our southwest business team is armed with the tools they need to grow our business customer base we continue to work on our new fare product and our revenue management system optimization so more to come there but both should begin producing value this year and as we continue retiring older 737 700 aircraft and taking the max aircraft this year in support of our fleet modernization initiatives as well all combined these initiatives are expected to deliver incremental ebit of 1 to 1 5 billion in 2023 and we continue to expect roughly half of that value this year given the initiatives in place like gary said last but not least i just want to thank our amazing people there have been all kinds of challenges and they have performed just superbly they continue to do an incredible job and manage through all of these challenges and i am just in awe of them and together we will emerge from the pandemic and we will seize the opportunities in front of us and with that i will turn it over to tammy tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer right hello everyone and thank you bob i ve worked with bob for a long time and i agree with gary he is going to be a great ceo and my friend gary kelly you are amazing and i just want to thank you for all that you ve done for our company and for all of us and for all of our shareholders and i m not going to say anything else because i will get choked up so instead i m going to provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional color on our outlook beyond what we provided in our press release to you all this morning and i also just want to thank our employees for their incredible resilience as we manage through this dynamic environment it is their hard work dedication and focus that enabled us to achieve an important milestone in our recovery with our first quarterly profit since the pandemic began we reported a 68 million profit in fourth quarter or 0 11 per diluted share and excluding special items we reported an 85 million profit or 0 14 per diluted share as bob mentioned our fourth quarter profit was driven by strong leisure demand during the holidays business travel momentum and incremental revenue from our new co brand credit card agreement with chase our fourth quarter results were all within the guidance ranges provided last month at investor day for full year 2021 our net income was 977 million or 1 61 per diluted share driven by 2 7 billion of payroll support program proceeds excluding this temporary benefit to salary wages and benefits expense and other smaller special items our full year net loss was 1 3 billion or a 2 15 loss per diluted share andrew will cover our revenue trends and outlook here in a minute taking a look at cost we continue to experience inflationary cost pressure experienced in fourth quarter primarily in salary wages and benefits and airport costs as expected a portion relates to hiring and we made great strides toward our hiring efforts in 2021 and remain on track with plans this year and of course the labor market continues to be a challenge which continues to pressure wage rates across the board since investor day we have experienced additional cost pressures related to omicron and winter weather as a result our first quarter unit cost inflation compared with first quarter 2019 and excluding fuel special items and profit sharing has increased about 10 points roughly half of that increase is driven by the 150 million of additional incentive pay we are offering to operations employees to early february and the other half is associated with flying fewer asms than we were planning in light of the significant impact from the omicron wave on available staffing extending the temporary incentive pay and further reducing our capacity were necessary steps to stabilize the operation aside from these impacts we would be on track with our previous unit cost outlook market fuel prices have continued to rise here which also resulted in a 0 10 increase in our fuel cost per gallon guidance our estimated first quarter fuel price in the 2 25 to 2 35 per gallon range is also roughly 0 25 higher than our first quarter 2019 fuel price and that s inclusive of an estimated 0 35 of hedging gains here in the first quarter turning to our full year guidance at investor day we were planning for capacity to be roughly flat versus 2019 levels with no material impact from the omicron variant on either revenues or costs at that time fast forward to today the impact from the omicron variant on available staffing has led us to reevaluate our first half 2022 capacity plans in particular march through may our planned flight schedule adjustments take some capacity upside optimism off the table for this year and reduces our full year 2022 capacity outlook by about four points from roughly flat to down 4 versus 2019 i ve already covered the 150 million of additional incentive pay in first quarter and in order to be more competitive on the hiring front in particular for ground operations we are raising starting wage rates from 15 per hour to 17 per hour which is estimated to be a 20 to 25 million total impact to this year and of course we have contemplated labor rate inflation in our guidance as best we can for this year understanding that the market is somewhat uncertain this is clearly not where we hope to be along our recovery curve nearly two years into this pandemic but we are making great progress while we must remain nimble in this environment it takes the necessary actions to take care of our employees and provide a reliable product for our customers we are very focused on the long term and determined to get back to 2018 levels of productivity and efficiencies as we shared with you all at investor day as bob said our goal is to get there by the end of next year although it is early based on our current plan for 2022 and preliminary plan for 2023 we expect 2023 casm x will decline year over year compared with 2022 longer term our framework that we provided at investor day remains unchanged and that includes a post pandemic target of mid single digit asm growth accompanied by low single digit casm x growth i want to be clear that our longer term casm x framework includes an estimate for labor rate increases as best we can estimate today turning to fleet we currently have 77 max firm orders and 37 max options with boeing this year while our plan assumes we will exercise the remaining 37 options this year we maintain the flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise we continue to believe that taking the additional options this year will yield a positive npv on aircraft replacement if we don t deploy them in the network as i have mentioned to you all before we won t incur a material casm x penalty from holding on to extra aircraft in the event we temporarily park some of our 700 while capacity is moderated this year as we work our way back to an efficient utilization of the fleet we remain in the fortunate position to have the flexibility needed with our retirement plans without a financial penalty i ll wrap up with a quick note on our balance sheet strength we ended 2021 with liquidity of 16 5 billion our leverage is at a very manageable 54 and we continue to be the only u s airline with an investment grade rating by all three rating agencies which i believe is one of our key competitive advantages we have ample liquidity that allows us for a further cushion in the event of further covid wave overall our balance sheet strength puts us in a category of one in terms of our ability to withstand shocks and remain financially healthy with that i will turn it over to andrew andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer thank you very much tammy i ll also start by extending my gratitude to gary i ll be forever grateful for all that he taught me with his words and its actions and i ll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail looking back to our last earnings call in october we were dealing with a delta variant the negative revenue impact to q3 was 300 million at that time we estimated negative revenue impact to q4 of 100 million revenue trends have begun to pick up pick back up and stabilize in mid september and our outlook called for a sequential monthly improvement in revenues throughout q4 we reaffirmed this in our early december investor update and we closed the quarter strong our operating revenues finished within guidance down 11 8 and managed business revenues came in better than guidance down 50 in december we saw solid leisure demand for thanksgiving and christmas and business demand held up well with positive momentum from gds and southwest business the negative revenue impact from the delta variant came in lower than we thought at around 60 million as we saw a continued rebound in demand and yields throughout the quarter however we saw some choppiness in late december from decelerating bookings and increasing cancellations and we had a 30 million negative revenue impact from the omicron variant as covid cases increased combined this 90 million covid impact in q4 was slightly less than our original estimate of 100 million from covid as we were able to mitigate some of the load factor decrease through higher yields and of course the most notable item in q4 was incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement with chase which we covered at investor day and included in our most recent revenue guidance while we can t share the specifics about the incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement you can see that other revenues in fourth quarter 2021 increased 20 compared with q4 2019 while outpacing the recovery in passenger revenue and we are on track for expected benefits in 2022 our new markets continue to develop and perform overall in line with expectations aside from the impacts from the delta and omicron waves hawaiian markets also showed improvement and all of these markets turned in line with a broad based improvement we saw across the rest of the network now looking at first quarter we estimate the weather related and staff related flight cancellations in january resulting in a 50 million negative impact to operating revenues additionally bookings have slowed for january and february which are seasonally low travel periods anyway for leisure and trip cancellations were running quite high beginning in early january but have moderated and are back to normal trends we expect the omicron related negative revenue impact to january and february combined to be roughly 330 million like the delta variant the impact of omicron related trip cancellations has been mainly focused in the closed in window and we remain optimistic about the likelihood of demand recovery and time for spring break travel on the corporate travel side the business demand we experienced in december has slowed but we continue to believe there is pent up demand for business travel and we are hearing from many of our corporate customers that they intend to ramp up travel post president s day i think that will depend on where we are with covid case counts and hospitalizations but we are encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers in terms of their future travel plans we expect first quarter managed business revenues to be down 45 to 55 versus 2019 and improve sequentially from january through march and our southwest and gds business initiatives is also on track for expected benefits in 2022 when you put all these moving parts together that gets us to our first quarter operating revenue guidance of down 10 to 15 versus first quarter 2019 this outlook is in line where we were in the fourth quarter but we are currently expecting a step change in improvement in march as far as our other initiatives new fare product remains on track for deployment by midyear and the new revenue management system continues its progressive rollout and lastly we re in the process of adjusting our published flight schedules in march through may in order to further support the operations and adjust to available staffing trends the result of this exercise combined with the flight cancellations we have experienced so far this month is a three point reduction in first quarter 2022 capacity from down 6 to down 9 compared with the first quarter 2019 and for full year 2022 as tammy mentioned it s a four point reduction from roughly flat to down 4 compared with the full year 2019 our flight schedules remain subject to further adjustments if needed but while this is a slight delay to our previous capacity plan we still have time to get back on track as of march 2022 we are roughly 75 restored based on trips and we continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our route network by the end of 2023 and with that i ll turn it over to mike mike van de ven chief operating officer well thank you andrew and hello everyone our people did face quite a bit of adversity in 2021 and i just am really proud of their tremendous finish to the year and they ve built quite a bit of momentum thus far into 2022 as we ve all said we ve moderated or we began moderating our capacity in the fourth quarter to provide more staffing cushion in the environment but at the same time we knew we had some peak holiday travel periods over thanksgiving and christmas through the new year s time frame and we really did jump up our daily trips and we needed all hands on deck to those periods and we incented folks and we urge them or those that were willing to pick up open time or voluntarily work on their days off with premium pay and that certainly worked our people really responded so if you exclude the day of thanksgiving we averaged about 3 500 trips a day during that thanksgiving holiday period and that was up roughly 320 trips a day above the weeks leading into thanksgiving and our on time performance for that period was 87 and that was better than our five year average so we ran a similar play over the christmas holiday and our daily trips there increased to roughly 3 600 a day and again our people responded so normally during the christmas holiday we deal with weather but this year we also saw the beginning of a sudden and the surging spike in covid cases and because we had those people to pitch in to pick up extra shifts during that week of christmas we had a completion factor of 99 2 and we had less than 1 of our flights canceled in the face of that covid surge all told we ended up the fourth quarter with an on time performance of 72 6 mainly due to some of the challenges we faced in october that s certainly not up to our standards we must do better and we will but our holiday performances were very good and we know that we can operate in our peak travel days when everyone is available so we really have momentum to build on so in contrast to those previous holiday periods january started in the face of severe weather and this omicron variant spreading rapidly and as bob mentioned we had roughly two and a half times the number of employees with covid cases for omicron than we did with delta and we had roughly 5 000 employees become sick in the first three weeks of january and so the biggest impacts were in terms of flight cancellations for the period of time the first week of january january 1 through january 7 and that week we canceled roughly 3 800 flights about 1 900 of those were for weather and about 1 600 of those were for staffing and then our on time performance of that period was 41 5 so we reinstated the incentive pay program to encourage again those who would come in and pick up extra shifts and help cover the flight schedule and again the response was superb we got all that implemented and so from january 9th through the 25th our on time performance jumped to almost 87 and that leads the industry for marketing carriers and the incentive pay program runs through february 8 we re also benefiting from a decline in our employees that were sidelined due to covid our case counts peaked in that first week of january and just by way of example we had over 700 pilots and 1 500 flight attendants that were able to work in that time frame and thus the incentive program to help cover those that were out those covid numbers have dropped substantially since then to roughly 100 to 150 people for each group and that s a lot closer to what we originally expected next we continue to aggressively hire bob mentioned that getting staffed is one of our key objectives of 2022 we also want to make progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency metrics and then a lot of ways those go hand in hand as we re not operating at optimal levels today nor is our network restored to where we want to be relative to 2019 for the over 8 000 employees that we intend to hire this year about 40 of them are fly crews about 40 of them are ground operations so it s very heavily operations focused to support the schedule this year and beyond as we resume the growth as we restore the route network this year into 2023 that should provide the foundation to recapture better operating leverage and we re also working on other initiatives to improve efficiencies of course we ve got the fleet modernization cost initiative but we re also working on things like enhancing our turn times which are already the best in the industry expanding self service options for our customers and investing in daily schedule management tools which will help us manage regular operations more efficiently so we ve got many items in our technology and process improvement pipeline in order to support our low cost position within the industry and improve our overall efficiency and our resilience just in closing as we move forward into 2022 we have an exceptional order book for the fleet with its economics and its flexibility we have new technology foundations in place for our maintenance and our airport systems we have a laser focus on getting staffed and running a reliable operation and we re building an operations modernization portfolio of initiatives that i touched on and our employees have sacrificed they ve worked hard through a challenging and ever changing environment and i think that positioned us well to carry this january momentum through the first quarter and beyond so i am immensely grateful for the grit their determination and of course their care for our customers and so with that ryan back to you ryan martinez managing director of investor relations well thank you mike i believe we have analysts queued up so chad if you please go ahead and begin our analyst q a questions answers operator thank you and the first question will come from jamie baker with jp morgan please go ahead jamie baker j p morgan analyst hey good morning everybody just quickly gary when i first met you back at kidder peabody i could not have been less relevant but you showed me just as much respect as you did to the glenn angles and kevin murphys and sam buttricks of that era and it really meant a lot to me and it gave me the confidence to continue on my career trajectory and i just wanted to thank you for that i will sincerely miss speaking to you on these calls but i do look forward to hopefully being a thorn in bob s side gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer i would expect nothing less jamie baker j p morgan analyst ok good i ll start with tammy though so tammy you emphasized that your cost outlook does envision higher wage rates but i had asked you about that at investor day and at the time you said you weren t accruing for new labor contracts i think i probably got my wires crossed could you just clarify that there s something for new union contracts in your forward cost guide is that accurate tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer yes and thanks jamie and i appreciate the question there so yes we are not currently accruing for open labor contract today so we are not accruing for that so there is nothing in our first quarter guidance longer term though we have incorporated our best estimate of annual labor rate increases into all of our targets so here and then here just to be clear for 2022 we know we have some inflation here so we re doing our very best to incorporate what we think we re going to incur here in 2022 so hopefully that clears that up for you jamie baker j p morgan analyst it does thank you very much and any update on the fourth fare rung that you intend to load this spring are you still on track if you re not ready to disclose what it includes could you share any ideas that maybe you ruled out from a pricing perspective andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer hi jamie it s andrew answering your question we re still on track for a midyear rollout of that we re going through right now the technology user acceptance and it s all going well we expect this to be above one to get away so we ve ruled out taking away features from customers and charging them more these will be features that are in addition to want to get away for which we believe customers will happily pay a little bit extra we also believe these features will be relevant to business travelers especially some small and medium sized business travelers so that s how we want to position it versus say the fair product just above and just below it does that answer your question jamie baker j p morgan analyst it does indeed thank you very much yes that will be it i m sure a lot of accolades coming for gary so i get the punch here take care operator and the next question will be from duane pfennigwerth with evercore isi please go ahead duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst hey thanks i don t actually have any ancient wall street history but i did want to ask you gary if you received any calls from music producers since you dropped your recent tribute gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer we ve always been very circumspect about confidential information here so i m going to have to decline to answer your question duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst fair enough i wish you well on that journey with respect to the four point cut to full year capacity is that all about the rate of demand improvement in first half or was any of that a function of kind of looking at the operation and deciding you needed even more buffer on staffing tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer yes i ll jump in and andrew and others may want to chime in but no we it really was more about adjusting being a little more cautious with regard to our operations obviously omicron had a significant impact on us here in the first quarter so just we felt that it was prudent to take some capacity out and as we have stabilized the operation and as you ve heard us comment here we re doing a great job in that respect with really an outstanding performance here over the last couple of days andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer the only thing i d add to what tammy said is it was designed to make it more offerable and get cushion to the operation so that s both how much we re flying but also where we re flying given the some of our ground based staffing shortages so the combination of those two were the crux of it obviously we look at demand when we re making those adjustments but the motivation here was operational reliability gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes the only thing i would add too is that the it s all the gas right at this point so we re making our best guess based on we have terrific staffing plans i m confident we will meet those here in 2022 if we get ahead of those we obviously we preserve the ability to sort of work on our capacity on the other end in the back end of 2022 we just don t know yet but yes it s really all due to staffing at this point we ve got to run a reliable operation we ve got to have enough staff cushion duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst and then you mentioned it with ground handling but i wonder if you could provide some anecdotes of where you know today you re obviously overstaffed from a longer term perspective what are some of the functions beyond ground handling where you re keeping actively deciding to keep a higher buffer and where predictability is just not there yet thanks for taking the questions gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes i might separate sort of the experience at the beginning of january and then the rest of the year as we had a really rapid rise in covid cases in the first couple of weeks of january you had an overall southwest airlines impact operationally and then you had very locational impacts an example would be the denver ramp we had a rapid rise in our denver cases on the denver ramp and we literally had to quickly moderate the denver schedule to be able to operate there but i think it s really the overall adjustments to capacity is really all groups we need pilots we need flight attendants we need ramp staffing and you need the appropriate amount of buffer in all of those areas until we sort of see our way past covid and understand what more normalized staffing more normalized behaviors more normalized sick leave looks like so i would argue we it s really not one group we have buffer we re looking for buffer in all of those groups duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst very helpful thank you gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer you are welcome operator and the next question will come from hunter keay with wolfe research please go ahead hunter keay wolfe research analyst thank you yes reiterate to you gary you re a legend man it s been a pleasure thank you for keeping it interesting over the years i had a question for you and it s i d love to get your parting thoughts on the industry s outlook over the next two to three years it s not a question about southwest i m sure you re going to say you re leaving the company in a good position to compete and win and succeed but as someone that s made a lot of good predictions over the years what is your view your sort of parting view on how the industry unfolds competitively whatever growth wise over the next two to three years gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer well thanks hunter well i don t know how good of a prognosticator i ve ever been or i don t think i m myself that way i do think that if you compare the u s to other countries the u s has left the commercial airline industry in pretty darn good shape and were it not for the cares act i think we d be having a very different conversation so i think it s just important to acknowledge that upfront having said that there are still significant variations so when you talk about the industry it s hard to think about it that way because there s strong and there s weak there are strong balance sheets there are weak balance sheets and i think what we ve experienced in 2021 is really humbling a year ago and you and i haven t talked in a while but i think everyone i ve run into where we had the sort of video tape replayed i would have never bet a year ago that this is where we would be here in early 2022 i thought we would have this pandemic beat and behind us and it s far from that so i think that just sort of provides the same and even bigger quandary now which is where we think we re going to be with the pandemic two years from now we were honoring a former dallas mayor earlier this week and he and i were having the exact same conversation and his guess was 10 years we re going to be dealing with this for 10 years so i think that has a direct correlation with travel tourism hospitality restaurants all of that we just have to be we need to hope for the best plan for the worst is sort of the age old advice that we ve all gotten it does feel like business travel wants to come back and i think that s encouraging we were hoping for a stronger business travel here in jan feb than what we re realizing we all know why that hasn t happened so just again a perfect example but i think the industry is pretty darn well capitalized it s taken on a lot of debt which is going to have to be carefully managed it s we re going to have to be more heavily dependent on consumer travel than where we were before i think international also kind of fits into that category of it s probably different in the future than it has been in recent history and we ll just have to be prepared to be more successful domestically over the next couple of years but in my opinion and that s why i put it in my remarks i think it s the best service and the lowest price wins and if you have that combination within the industry you re going to win i think it is a low cost gain always but i think that s even more acutely important right now and that will be a laser focus for our leadership team certainly for the next couple of years hunter keay wolfe research analyst that s very helpful thank you i appreciate that and then i asked you this question about a year ago gary but you are a never say never guy if there was anything you d never say never to i guess the same question goes for bob is there anything that we can expect that you would say you d never do as ceo or southwest would never do as long as you re running the company bob jordan executive vice president corporate services there s some easy things here we re not going to charge for bags we re not going to have change fees i mean we re going to state we re going to always be transparent we re going to be open and honest with our consumers now things change over the years for sure in my 34 years here at southwest we ve changed our boarding we ve changed some of our product we ve added wifi we ve added rapid rewards program so things always change but we re always going to lean to our customers so yes i think the number one thing that comes to mind obviously is no bag fees no change fees the other thing is not going to change we re going to treat our employees right we re going to treat our customers right and we re going to stand for service and we re going to stand for serving others before ourselves hunter keay wolfe research analyst thank you very much congratulations gary operator the next question will be from helane becker with cowen please go ahead helane becker cowen and company analyst thank you very much operator yes gary i m going to miss you as well in fact i remember our first meeting when you tell me and me were sitting in my office at lehman brothers and it just seems like we re too young to retire and i wish you the best in whatever you decide to do with your free time going forward although maybe not so much free time that you ll have thank you actually for everything and then separate from that my question is really not sure who wants to answer has to do with the credit card program is there a way for chase to separate out for you the the charges that come for travel and the airline versus charges that come for stuff because as you think about going forward the percentage of stuff should decline as people have their pelotons and their computers and all the other stuff they bought during the pandemic and they should start to shift back to travel so i m wondering if chase can parse that out for you and if you can gain any intelligence from that andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer helane it s andrew yes as part of our relationship with chase we do receive that on a regular basis and we review it on a regular basis and indeed as you probably would have seen through macroeconomic indicators charges during the pandemic skewed toward goods and less toward services and then the services would also mirror the pandemic and we could see when restaurants were more active with our card members or flights activity as well and so that is something that i think tracks very well with what you see in the macroeconomics when you have it sort of in a high frequency basis like this when we see it a bit earlier that does help us with understanding the pace and duration of these waves so it s been very useful for us and we expect a skew toward services going forward which obviously would be beneficial to our industry helane becker cowen and company analyst right so you would expect that the rate of growth would what accelerate with services or decelerate andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer i think it would accelerate given the composition of people spend services are underweight now versus what they were in 2019 and given the customers have very good balance sheets themselves the stimulus program has put a lot of cash in people s pockets and so they have some pent up demand of potential expenditures above and beyond they re kind of normal salary based or compensation based spending and so we expect that composition to revert back more to normal as we would get past the pandemic whatever that might be as gary pointed out so therefore services spending on our card and economies as a whole should increase as the health crisis abates helane becker cowen and company analyst ok that s very helpful thank you and then on the constraining spring capacity due to labor constraints would you be able to offset that with pricing tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer helane i ll jump in on that obviously we don t comment on pricing so we as always we re going to work hard to achieve our financial objectives but we ll decline to comment specifically on pricing bob jordan executive vice president corporate services and i might just point you to back to the fourth quarter which is we had i think we had a really strong performance revenue pricing fare yield so we i think on sort of my memory is that it was 92 or so of capacity restored we had 88 of revenues restored which is leading in the industry and yields and fares were just slightly below 2019 so not speaking to your direct question but just if you look at the fourth quarter we had a very strong revenue performance helane becker cowen and company analyst that s very helpful thanks everybody and bye gary it s very sad operator thank you and the next question will come from mike linenberg from deutsche bank please go ahead mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst hey good morning everyone gary it goes without saying i mean you re going to be missed and to be on a southwest conference call without gary kelly it s going to we re going to get used to it but bob is the right guy in that regard i do want to ask you one final question on a call in your new role or i should say new role but as your continuing role on the board will you still dress up for halloween gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer i don t think anybody can stop me so that was one of my pure joys in life and i do have grandchildren who get a kick out of it so but it s all about me i really enjoy dressing up mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst that s great to hear so gene simmons will live on through gary kelly gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes he ll live on and he s still my pal so mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst that s awesome all right well on to a more serious topic here i just i want to go back to the capacity change for 2022 i mean and i guess tammy this is to you where for the march quarter you re shaving three points but for the full year you re cutting four points and it s obviously having a tremendous upward pressure on your full year unit cost and you did highlight that the june quarter looks like it s going to take obviously a big cut there but as i think about the math it just seems like that you are taking a lot out you did say you re being cautious it s all about returning operations returning the integrity of the operations back to a normalcy it does feel like it s extra conservative or are you is that down 4 for the year assume that you re not going to exercise the 37 remaining options can you just give some additional color there just it seems sizable tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer sure i ll give some color here and then we may have some other chime in here but yes we i guess we haven t given up here on adding additional capacity in the second quarter again we re just going to have to see how things go here on the staffing front and obviously as we ve already said our priority is on the operations but wherever we end up with regard to our capacity for the full year at least at this point in time we intend to exercise all of our remaining options and the reason for that is really straightforward mike we have a really strong npv on those aircraft either way obviously we hope that we re putting those into growing the network either in 2022 or 2023 but we have a lot of flexibility here and the fact is we just don t have to decide right now so if we do not have a need for those in the network we would just simply retire and accelerate the retirements of our 700 so we re in the we ve got a good fortune here of having tremendous flexibility which was by design when we work through our order book with boeing bob jordan executive vice president corporate services and mike i would just add too that this is all forecast if you look at look at omicron and how quickly we have adjusted i think my memory is our network planning team is doing two or three times the number of changes that they would typically and so while we ve got a great plan for 22 it all comes down to hiring and i m pleased that we re on our hiring plans for the fall and we re on our hiring plan so far for january but in the case that we were able to beat those we ve got up you d have some upside but we ll just continue to adjust i think if you look at our fleet today again because we are flying and therefore our asms are constrained based on our staffing you probably have 5 to 6 of the fleet that is effectively unflown in other words we could be generating 5 to 6 more asms with the current fleet but for the staffing so we ll work really hard to make progress there and so i wouldn t call that we ve got a great plan but i wouldn t call it a year done yet in terms of capacity mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst ok so it s very fluid and then just bob i guess just as a quick follow up and this follows on hunter s sort of that never say never you did mention change fees you talked about bags i think i saw about a week or two ago there was something about seat assignments but again it may have been a reporter putting words in your mouth anything that you can highlight with respect to that maybe it was a misinterpretation bob jordan executive vice president corporate services no a reporter would never put words in your mouth right no it was just an illustration i was sort of going through the kinds of things that over time i think you have a duty to look at just like we have a duty to mike talked about our operational tools we have a duty to look at our customer experience and how to enhance that and at some point i think just like we did years and years ago we will probably want to resurrect the work that we did there and just understand what our customers prefer what our business customers prefer what that does to the efficiency of the operation so there was no prediction at all it was just an example of the types of things that you do have to take a look at over time mike linenberg deutsche bank analyst great thanks again gary operator the next question will be from savi syth from raymond james please go ahead savi syth raymond james analyst good afternoon just kind of curious on the managed business revenues i know you kind of talked about expecting a step change in march but how does kind of the trends you re seeing today compared to how you exited the year and just any color on how much that is getting boosted by some of the gds initiatives that you ve rolled out andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer sure this is andrew i ll start off by saying we see that managed business travel like our overall travel fluctuate with covid wave so there will be a period of time early in the wave where cancellations surge and then bookings slow down and then the next part of that is as cases and hospitalization start to come down the backside we see those cancellations attenuate and bookings pick up so we re on the backside of that the bookings right now for managed business and so we can see then that if we go back on its trend that we saw throughout 2021 where buff is ups and downs you were on a solid trend from january through december now with regards to our initiatives we can see that we are having a shift of travel from our previous channels to the gds but we also can see those incremental on top of that now because covid has created such a disruption in travel patterns we don t want to extrapolate and give final numbers on that but we already see that we are achieving our business case and it is causing some channel shift but that was all part of our plan to be able to offer our corporate customers the choice of the channel from which they want to buy with southwest airlines savi syth raymond james analyst makes sense and just curious some shifting gears a little bit on the regional airline side you had some of your legacy competitors cut a lot of small markets regional airlines are struggling a little bit from a piloting standpoint as well as some of the kind of the 5g issues curious if you re seeing a benefit given that southwest to fly into some of the smaller markets than you see some ulccs flying if you re seeing any benefit from maybe this kind of capacity that s being constrained andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer well i can certainly read about their unfortunate situation however the covid wave is such a predominant force in bookings right now it s really hard to tease out a lot of other trends within that and so right now as bob and tammy mentioned we re managing our network for our customers and our employees and so that s really what we re aiming at and so we don t really kind of look outside of our lane so to speak to what s going with others to be opportunistic because right now we re just trying to keep ourselves good stable operation and achieve our financial goals savi syth raymond james analyst thanks all right and then gary i d like to echo a lot of the comments that have been shared on this call and wish you the best thanks operator and the next question will be from david vernon from bernstein please go ahead david vernon sanford c bernstein analyst good afternoon everyone and thanks for the time i wonder if you can give us an update on where you are with boeing on getting the max 7 certified and as you look out over the next two three years obviously there s 136 from orders 60 or so more options how do we think about retirement expectations in relation to that should we be thinking that as these aircraft are going in you re going to be retiring or getting rid of some of the older classics mike van de ven chief operating officer yes so david this is mike so we ve got about 450 ish 700 and so at least half of our order book will probably be focused on replacing those airplanes boeing is telling us that they re targeting atc for the max 7 by the end of the first quarter of course that s contingent on the faa review process which is a little bit different for airplanes after the max grounding once they get that type certificate it will take us about seven months or we re planning on about seven months to be able to bring that airplane on our operating certificate so we ll need to do things like get performance data from boeing for the airplane ingest that performance data into our systems do all the quality assurance work on that update our manuals and then get our own cmo to approve our manuals before we can add the airplane to our ops spec so we ve just got we ve got a lot of flexibility in that order book boeing is a very good partner with us and so we still expect to take the 114 airplanes at this point but we may not be flying the max 7 until early 2023 david vernon sanford c bernstein analyst thank you that s very very helpful and andrew maybe just as a quick follow up i m assuming that despite the lack of business travel the selling efforts on the corporate side have been continuing through the pandemic is there any color you can give to us in terms of how gds enrollment has impacted your traction in terms of like the number of corporate units you have or the win rate in bid process anything you can give us to help us gauge kind of how effective this is going to be in terms of the continuing for corporate share going forward would be really helpful andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer certainly i ll try to give you some color you can also look in the arc data because we went in the gds but also settled into arc so you can track for yourself what we re selling in arc as well but if you look at our accounts even going before going into the gds especially going to sabre we had built up our corporate sales force and in anticipation of this and our overall effort had increased the number of our accounts like we shared at investor day now these accounts they buy through multiple channels already some may be 100 one channel but today you take our largest corporate clients and they will buy through swabiz they will buy through our direct connect and now they ll buy through gds as well it depends on the travel purpose as well as the subsidiary or a population group within that company of how they buy it so what we re doing is we re letting them move in between and we do see some like the government moving pretty strongly toward some gds transactions we see professional services not really abandoning some of the first two the direct connect and the swabiz and adding on gds on top of it so it really depends on the travel purpose and on the corporation as to which channel they prefer which is the thesis of our strategy of let the customer choose and get out of the way and stop having friction and so as i mentioned earlier the covid waves really scramble a lot of trends so you can t be as precise as you would be in normal times but at the highest level we do see incremental volume we re getting and we re hearing from corporate that they are giving us incremental volume when we speak of it because of these channels david vernon sanford c bernstein analyst thank you and gary thanks for all the time and congratulations on the move up operator thank you we have time for one more question we ll take our last question from sheila kahyaoglu from jefferies please go ahead sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst thank you gary i echo those comments and congratulations maybe if i could ask about the bottleneck in terms of ramping capacity from 22 and 23 it seems like a lot of the industry has faced supply constraints rather than demand constraints especially domestically how do you think about southwest overcoming those challenges you take on 200 aircraft or so and i understand maybe half of those are for replacement gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer well i ll jump in and start and you all can add so in 2021 we made some assumptions about the operating environment that we would be in and the environment that people would live in and it was just clear to us as we went through this delta variant that that environment was not appropriate and we ve spent a lot of time in 2021 reacting to that caused our crews to be rescheduled it caused regular operations and we had a reliability challenge for the airline our approach in 2022 really is to just accept that the environment that we re in currently might be the environment that we re in for a while and go ahead and plan the airline and staff the airline like that and so that s what you re seeing with respect to the capacity adjustments here in 2022 is just making the assumption that let s still assume things are going to get better until they actually do so we have a very aggressive plan to go hire people i think our wage rate increases especially in the front line for the ground will help us accelerate our staffing i think we ll have plenty of access to pilots and flight attendants so i feel good that our staffing plan is going to come to fruition and then the question just is as we bring the people on and we mitigate the premium pay we mitigate some of the regular operations we run a more stable operation can we will we see different behaviors and if we do that gives us upside bob jordan executive vice president corporate services well and sheila you add back just sort of what s the constraint at the beginning of the pandemic it was all about managing down your capacity because of demand demand fell 97 and then stayed down 70 for a long time so it was all about managing to lower demand well that s not where we are today again sort of back to the fourth quarter we had stronger obviously strong revenue strong yields strong fares strong demand overall and that s when business demand down 50 so very strong leisure in my mind leisure has returned to 2019 obviously that was interrupted by omicron but i m confident that the leisure demand is restored and we just need to get the staffing levels to the point where we can operate our aircraft operate them reliably produce the kind of operational performance that our customers need and want and deserve and it s just going to take staffing to do that and obviously that staffing in a strong labor market which is why you saw us raise our starting wages but no to me the moderation is all about staffing not because of any concern over demand and so then again you layer on to the fourth quarter the 50 recovery in business continues to recover in 2022 and we re hopeful that it recovers by the end of the year to say down 10 to 20 i think we ll have plenty of demand it s all about getting the hiring to restore the capacity sheila kahyaoglu jefferies analyst all right thank you ryan martinez managing director of investor relations all right any last thoughts before we wrap up gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer yes thanks ryan i just wanted to acknowledge all the kind comments from everyone i m very appreciative of that and some of the old timers that caused me to reminisce when i started as cfo it was 1989 and in those days we didn t do this i talked i was investor relations and tammy is laughing because i had to beg her five years into this to come bail me out but i did the investor relations we had the cfo we had a controller and we had a treasurer and we re cheap now but we were really cheap then so we had one assistant that supported all three of us and i did the investor relations so we would send out we had this auto fax system where we would fax out the press releases and then some of you would be really angry with us because you were at the bottom of the fax list which meant that you were i don t know how long this damn thing took but it was not instantaneous we ll put it that way and then i would talk to each analyst individually on the phone and then when i couldn t take it anymore i said i begged tammy to come over from leading financial reporting to come to investor relations she was the very first investor relations professional in the history of southwest airlines and she modernized all of the things that we enjoy today it took a while for her to beat that in to me but she eventually did the other thing you caused me to reminisce on is tammy who was and is a star she moved on to other jobs and hired marcy and then marcy moved on to other jobs and now we hired ryan and that s pretty remarkable in a 33 years time we ve only had three people three different people leading investor relations so i m very proud of you guys and i and for all my friends here i will tell you and i ve told all my southwest colleagues this i learned more from doing investor relations than i learned going to school and the questions that you all have the ideas the way you challenge me at least over the years has been invaluable and not to mention the very rich friendships that we had helane will remember and this i think i was a controller at the time in the late 80s we would do a show at the big shearson lehman hutton investor conference which was multi days and people would come they would stay for days and then southwest we put on this broadway like parody of the industry we pick on frank lorenzo especially who s a good friend of mine by the way and crandall and others but helane i remember the first year that you came on working for bob joedicke we parodied you and we had an actor walk across the stage i don t remember the song but we had we anointed helane miss shearson lehman hutton because she added a lot of glamour the sales side analyst community to this day but in any event i m very grateful for the friendships very blessed to have been in a really great company for 36 years and i just heard this morning that parker was retiring in march and i didn t translate that into well that means that this is his last analyst call and i was told that he reported that he s done between being ceo and cfo 107 of these quarterly things and i did the math on mine and i want every one of you to know that it s 134 for me so not that i m keeping score with parker but i will leave you all with that and leave southwest airlines in great hands and as you all know i m not going anywhere we ve got lots of work to do and i m going to be here doing my little part so ryan thank you very much back to you sir ryan martinez managing director of investor relations well that s fantastic thank you for sharing of course you are a legend and i think you re the goat not a goat but the goat sign off here and that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today i appreciate everyone joining and have a great day operator thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now begin our media portion of today s call i d like to first introduce ms linda rutherford executive vice president people and communications linda rutherford senior vice president and chief communications officer thank you chad we can go ahead and get started with the media portion of our call today i just want to welcome everyone and you can go ahead chad if you want to just give them instructions to get queued up and we ll get started operator thank you thank you and the first question will come from kyle arnold with dallas morning news please go ahead kyle arnold dallas morning news aviation writer i was wondering with those 5 000 covid calls that you had in january how much will fall from are all of those individuals being sick themselves are you guys seeing much fallout from family members or from schools being closed day care those kind of other hiccups that we re seeing in the economy gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer kyle those were all people that had were tested positive for covid themselves they weren t not coming to work because of some family issues they tested positive and reported the positive covid to us bob jordan executive vice president corporate services and kyle the good thing too is the different than delta the cases came on really quickly so the rise was alarming but on the other side the fall in the cases was similar so the wave was very narrow which was painful on the front end helpful on the back end because we got people back a lot faster than delta tammy romo executive vice president and chief financial officer one thing but no doubt everything that you mentioned kyle i m sure we were incurring to it s just been an incredibly challenging time for everyone so all the additional demands that households have now i m sure impacted that which is be it caring for a sick spouse or child or a school closure or just dealing with everyday live so i think that would be on top of the numbers that we shared with you kyle arnold dallas morning news aviation writer appreciate that operator the next question will be from leslie joseph from cnbc please go ahead leslie joseph cnbc airline reporter good afternoon everyone thanks for taking my question with your hiring for 2022 i was wondering how much of those how many of those people are replacing other workers and net where do you expect to end up in headcount by the end of the year and overall do you expect salaries to be lower than 2019 before the pandemic junior workers are coming in gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer so mostly the 8 000 number that you hear that would be the net increase in our full time active equivalent employees and then one of the benefits that you do get from hiring people is you do get to average down the scale increases in the contract and we ve got about like i said earlier about 40 of that group will be flat cruise 40 will be ground ops all of those are covered work groups and so i do think we ll have an opportunity on our wage rates as we have newer people come in to average those down i haven t looked and see what that means exactly as compared to 2019 and we ll just that s a good question bob jordan executive vice president corporate services and leslie i think leslie joseph cnbc airline reporter ok and then overall your sorry go ahead bob jordan executive vice president corporate services yes one thing embedded in your question maybe and then just the numbers on the totals i think maybe you were implying so what is it an add and what s happening to attrition our attrition is up during covid our attrition is up modestly but it s not up alarmingly which is a good thing but sort of back to the numbers i think we re ending we ended 21 at roughly 55 000 active employees you add the 8 000 plus and so the plan would be to end 2022 at about 63 64 000 active leslie joseph cnbc airline reporter ok thank you operator the next question will come from alison sider with wall street journal please go ahead alison sider the wall street journal air travel reporter hi thanks so much i think we ve probably asked about this pretty much every quarter but just curious what you re hearing or what you re picking up about the mask mandate the likelihood it would get extended yes just curious how you re seeing that playing out in a couple of months gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer alison well yes i don t believe there is any current discussion about extending or terminating the mask mandate right i think it s well established that once you re onboard the aircraft the environment is very healthy with the continuous air refresh adding the mask is an added layer of safety and given the fact that we re right in the midst of this omicron surge now is not really the time to revisit that question in our opinion and i think that s representative of the a4a opinion as well we survey our customers and there are there s still a significant number of customers who feel safer with the mask there ll come a time when the mask won t be necessary i think we all look forward to that but right now is not the right time alison sider the wall street journal air travel reporter and i guess if i could ask about hiring and kind of the challenging labor market in addition to the minimum wage increase just curious if there s anything else you are doing i know last year you talked about kind of making on the spot offers and doing all these stop fares are you are there any other kind of creative tactics here having to utilize to bring in all these people bob jordan executive vice president corporate services yes alison i think in the current tough environment you use every lever that you have and so obviously you ve seen us move our starting wage rates along from sort of where they were to 15 to 17 and some airports there were even 20 at this point we ve got a team that s worked very hard on the processes so how can you take steps out of the process so if it took i m just making this up but if it took 30 days to get from interview to hire can we get that to 10 or eight because the longer that process is the more you run the risk that that person takes a job somewhere else we re doing instant offers in some cases as you mentioned we re using different techniques to get people into the funnel of hiring so a lot of social media a lot of mining for information so i would just tell you we re using every lever out there because i mean southwest is a wonderful company we are we get our share of resumes and interest but it s just tougher than normal one so we re turning over every rock in terms of what we can do to hire employees and a lot of that is yes it s about pay and it s about pace alison sider the wall street journal air travel reporter thanks so much bob jordan executive vice president corporate services you are welcome operator and the next question will be from dawn gilbertson from usa today please go ahead dawn gilbertson usa today consumer travel reporter good morning gary you mentioned 1989 and i sound a little bit like jamie baker here but i m in possession of a gary kelly vice president of finance business card i m wondering maybe i can monetize it through an nft or something i wanted to wish you well gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer thank you dawn i remember all the rough interviews i had to suffer through with you so thanks for all of that dawn gilbertson usa today consumer travel reporter a couple of questions here on the traveler front first pretty quickly on the march to may flight cuts could someone put that capacity decrease into the number of daily flights for me and tell me like how much of that business is already on the books in other words how many people you re going to have to notify again about schedule changes and then more importantly on the new fare category bob i m wondering i think andrew mentioned we re not going to take anything away from one to get away and i m wondering if you re willing to go on the record to say i mean with something like offering people who buy want to get away one bag instead of two is that taking something away and on a related front on that i m trying to figure out what could you guys add that you don t always have and my mind goes to early boarding so are you considering adding early boarding the earlybird fee to that second fare category because i know you in some test a couple of years ago you called it want to get away plus and if you do include earlybird in this new fare category would earlybird has an ancillary item go away gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer dawn i ll let andrew come back to the flight count but you so you need to join our marketing team because you probably put everything that we ve looked at on the table but no i ll just tell you yes it s just too early to give away exactly what for a lot of reasons competitively we re not ready to reveal exactly what that fare product looks like andrew is right we re not taking anything away it s going to be very attractive in terms of where it s positioned i think it will be what you would expect from southwest airlines in terms of consumer friendly but we re just not ready let you know but it s coming soon andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer and just to double down we will not take anything away from one to get away so there ll be one to get away of something above it but we will not take anything away want to get away and for the flight counts the march flight counts have already been prosecuted and so those who have already been handled the april through may have not yet been published so that s what we re we mentioned in the press release and in our conversation that we re in the process of doing that so we don t have a flight count yet to give you on that those we expect to have prosecuted in a couple of weeks time so it will be well in advance of travel and be less disruptive bob jordan executive vice president corporate services but the bookings are that far or pretty much andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer yes bookings that are in covid generally skew closer in and so what we have that far of the book is modest so it will be some customers are impacted but it will be a modest number of customer doing well in advance dawn gilbertson usa today consumer travel reporter if i can ask one very quick follow up on the new fare category what are you going for there and i know it will vary by route etc etc but obviously this is a revenue initiative you ve been talking about for a few years what are you going for in terms of the fare different average fare differential between want to get away and whatever this new product is called and again best to you gary andrew watterson executive vice president and chief commercial officer what we ve done over the pandemic if you look at our website you ll see more modest step ups between want to get away at any time and business select and we think that has had a laudatory effect on our revenues and customers are giving us good feedback and so we like more modest step up compared to what was perhaps there a number of years ago so having a fourth one that comes in there we would desire to have the end four products with modest step ups in between with features that customers are willing to pay that modest step up for so it s designed to be pro consumer and get someone who can will only give us additional money for additional features operator thank you and the next question will come from david slotnick from tpg please go ahead david slotnick tpg senior aviation business reporter congratulations again gary i wanted to know if there is any update on when you re planning to bring back full onboard service including alcohol thanks so much gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer so we had planned to bring that back around the middle of february and we ended up because of the omicron virus and just making sure that we had enough separation in the cabin for one we delayed that and then so we re looking at that here sometime in late in the first quarter maybe early in the second quarter operator thank you and the next question will come from mary schlangenstein from bloomberg news please go ahead mary schlangenstein bloomberg news airlines reporter i wanted to ask two quick questions the first is you ve said that over the past year that you hope to add a total of 25 000 workers over three years i wanted to see if you still think that s a realistic number if that s one you will have to increase and the second question is for gary gary is there something that you were unable to accomplish in your years as ceo that you would like to see bob take on and accomplish bob jordan executive vice president corporate services well let me take the just take the hiring and again sometimes you have to separate gross hiring and net because we always have attrition but the 8 000 as you think about our growth going forward the 8 000 per year that we re talking about here for 22 i can see that persisting we ve got a lot of air into the future in future years we ve got a lot of aircraft coming this year we ve got 114 in our plan we ve got a lot of work to do to restore our network back to what it was in 2019 i think andrew we re roughly 75 restored at this point by memory there s a lot of work to do to add back depth after we opened the 18 cities beyond that we have i mentioned this in my remarks we ve got a lot of growth opportunities we re picking up substantial gates in denver and phoenix and baltimore and nashville and others and so all of that will take aircraft and all of that will take employees so is it exactly 25 000 over three years i can t tell you that but it you sort of take the 8 000 in 2022 and extrapolate that and it s a significant number gary kelly chairman of the board and chief executive officer and mary i hadn t really thought about it the way you asked the question but it is a wonderful question i think the as we think about southwest airlines and year 51 it is so much stronger and better prepared at any point in time in our history and i think back 18 years ago it we had a lot of challenges it was post 9 11 and the world was just different there was a shift from away from short haul travel to longer haul travel we weren t necessarily well prepared for that and a lot of things needed to be retooled and still retain the essence of southwest airlines which i feel like we ve been able to do the speed of change in today s world is just faster than it was 20 years ago and so i would wish for bob that we have a better technology platform in place compared to 18 years ago that would enable a faster and more tactical like decisions for us anything that we wanted to do that was different in the 2000s meant years and millions in terms of construction so it became a really significant strategic choice about which road you took when you came to the fork so i think we have a much more settled and stable strategic outlook today which i know that both of us bob is impatient and i think that that s a good and a bad quality for a ceo but certainly he s urgent and has been a huge contributor of course to getting us to this point and laying out the direction that we re headed so it s not like these are new ideas for bob he s been working on this for a long time like i have i think the one thing that i m grateful for looking back is that the things that we decided to do we had a very supportive board we had willing and eager employees to embrace the change and we were able to fulfill the visions that we had and that s pretty rare a lot of things you try they don t work or for whatever reason they get derailed and for us we were pretty much able to do just about everything we wanted to do there s a couple of things that we engage that we set aside code sharing is an example that eventually we ll come back to but you look at the things that were accomplished and it s a pretty mighty list there so he ll he s got just as ambitious list going forward mike he s detailed with a few words but there s a lot of depth to what mike s strategy is for ops and it s just critical to our future so hats off to the technology and the business leaders who have gotten us to this point we re at far better place today than we were then and i think we re as i said i think we re extremely well positioned certainly for the next five years and beyond i m very excited and i m very enthused and i know bob is too mary schlangenstein bloomberg news airlines reporter thanks very much gary good luck going forward operator ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to ms rutherford for any closing remarks linda rutherford senior vice president and chief communications officer thank you and i just wanted to add gary you know that you had many hats to wear in the roles in the last 18 years and on behalf of the communications team just really wanted to thank you for being our chief spokesperson you ve made

washington jan 27 xinhua a sudden and substantial rise in real interest rates or inflation adjusted rates could lead to a further selloff in u s stocks particularly in highly valued sectors the international monetary fund imf warned on thursday after an exceptional year supported by solid earnings the u s equity market started 2022 with a steep retreat amid high inflation uncertainty about growth and weaker earnings prospects nassira abbas and tobias adrian senior officials at the imf s monetary and capital markets department said in a blog as a result we expect that a sudden and substantial rise in real rates could cause a significant drop for u s stocks particularly in highly valued sectors such as technology they said adding the u s 10 year real yield has already increased by nearly half a percentage point this year stock volatility soared on greater investor nervousness with the s p 500 down more than 9 percent for the year and the nasdaq composite measure tumbling 14 percent they noted the imf officials warning came after the u s federal reserve on wednesday signaled that the central bank is ready to raise interest rates as soon as march to combat surging inflation as it exits from the ultra loose monetary policy enacted at the start of the pandemic the central bank has pledged to keep its federal funds rate unchanged at the record low level of near zero for roughly two years but many fed officials have expressed in recent weeks that they would be comfortable with a rate increase in march due to elevated inflation pressures all things being equal monetary policy tightening should trigger a real interest rate adjustment and lead to higher discount rate resulting in lower stock prices said the imf officials as financial vulnerabilities remain elevated in several sectors monetary authorities should provide clear guidance about the future stance of policy to avoid unnecessary volatility and safeguard financial stability they said warning a higher and sudden increase in real interest rates could lead to an even larger selloff in stocks

these stocks will reward you over time and tide you over in a bear market as we near the end of the first month of a new year the stock market is experiencing a lot of turmoil 2021 was a huge recovery year after the 2020 crash and the market ended on a high with the s p 500 up 26 9 those gains have not been repeated so far in 2022 and the s p 500 is down about 7 as of midday on jan 26 there are a number of reasons for investors to worry high on the list is the omicron coronavirus variant which is still wending its way through the world and shutting down many parts of the economy another factor is premium valuations on growth stocks whose prices are falling more in line with their real growth prospects their prices are also falling on concerns about the federal reserve raising interest rates this year to combat inflation higher rates affect growth focused companies ability to raise cheap capital to fund their expansion investing legend warren buffett is known for his value investing style which looks for stocks that are undervalued relative to their real worth this strategy could be a winner for investors in what might end up being a bear market three stocks that buffett s holding company berkshire hathaway has holdings in that might serve an investor well in a bear market are amazon amzn 1 35 the vanguard s p 500 etf voo 1 27 and store capital stor let s find out a bit more about these investment options 1 amazon an unparalleled e commerce company e commerce giant amazon became a go to shopping spot for millions of people around the globe as the pandemic got underway the pandemic continues and so does amazon s popularity although growth is slowing down as its latest results get compared to 2020 s stellar comps and supply chain issues continue to affect bottom lines a bear market has multiple definitions but it s generally defined as a decline of at least 20 in the s p 500 from recent highs when the broader market tanks you want to keep your most basic investing principles in mind such as focusing on the long term and holding high quality companies that s where amazon comes in amazon is a heavyweight that will continue to grow for many years in various economic environments and it s a company that investors don t have to worry about going under amazon s sales increased 15 year over year in the third quarter and management is forecasting growth of between 4 and 12 in the fourth quarter profitability was pressured as the company focused on long term priorities which for now means delivering an exceptional customer experience even though it means higher shipping costs increased wages and other moves that are straining the bottom line its cloud component amazon web services is still posting phenomenal growth accelerating to a 39 sales increase year over year in the third quarter and it remains profitable ceo andy jassy said it ll be expensive for us in the short term but it s the right prioritization for our customers and partners that commitment is what keeps customers loyal and generates more business if you re worried about a bear market you can be more confident holding on to amazon stock which trades at 56 times trailing 12 month earnings a bargain based on amazon s average performance over the past decade 2 vanguard s p 500 etf don t try to beat the market match it it s not easy to beat the market over the past five years roughly 73 of mutual funds have underperformed the returns of the s p 500 for a lot of people simply placing their money into a passive fund like the vanguard s p 500 etf exchange traded fund which mirrors the benchmark index will get them the highest return this vanguard etf is up 17 annualized over the past five years well above the s p 500 s lifetime average return of 10 5 that s an attractive rate and it comes with less risk and fewer headaches than aiming to time or beat the market by picking individual stocks that ping pong back and forth buffett often recommends investing in the s p 500 granted if we enter a bear market it means this etf will be down but it s a relatively safe place to keep your money as the index invariably returns to a growth trajectory and recovers its losses over time 3 store capital for those focused on dividends one strategy to maintain market gains in a bear market is to invest in dividend yielding stocks while some companies did suspend dividends during the pandemic many dividend stocks were in strong enough financial shape to at least maintain their payout levels in particular investing in a strong real estate investment trust reit can yield high dividends for shareholders since the tax structure of these companies requires them to pay out 90 of their net income as dividends store capital owns nearly 2 800 properties that it leases to single tenant businesses mostly restaurants and other service based organizations it operates a triple net lease arrangement which means the tenant is responsible for most of the property maintenance it s a fairly low risk business model where store buys properties from companies that own their own stores providing those companies with capital they might need for investment or debt reduction these companies tend to sign long term leases for the assets they just sold as a result store s average lease length is roughly 13 5 years that s long enough to get the reit through the ups and downs of a cyclical economy that s a clear benefit to the landlord but it tends to benefit the tenant as well store management sees a huge market opportunity of 2 million properties and 3 9 trillion in market value the dividend generates a yield of 5 at the current stock price and store has raised its dividend annually since it went public in 2014 buffett bought a stake in store capital in 2017 worth 9 8 of shares outstanding you might want to consider adding shares to your portfolio as well especially if we hit a bear market
