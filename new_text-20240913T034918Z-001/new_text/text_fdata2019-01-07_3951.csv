the january 4 monster rally in risk assets which saw major us stock indexes surge by 3 per cent to 4 per cent and the risk free yield on 10 year us treasuries rise by 11 basis points was a stark illustration of the power of a favourable alignment of the trifecta of economic fundamentals central bank liquidity and technical factors whether markets have reached the bottom of what has been a brutal few months for investors is however a much more complicated and uncertain question is the worst yet to come credit ap the strong employment data released early january 4 ensured a solidly higher open for markets not only did the economy create 312 000 new jobs in december or almost twice the rate of consensus expectations but wage growth also picked up to 3 2 per cent annually and revisions bolstered the october and november jobs tallies concerns that the latest report would push the federal reserve into a more hawkish policy stance were offset by another encouraging component in the monthly data a rise in the participation rate from 62 9 per cent to 63 1 per cent which indicated there is a further element of slack in the labour market

oil prices regained more ground on wednesday pushed higher after equity markets rebounded from an initial selloff at the start of 2019 trading the price gains are not entirely convincing wti and brent posted strong gains each up more than 3 percent by midday in new york but come largely after u s equity markets shook off an earlier bout of pessimism in fact the trajectory and health of the global economy has moved to the top of the list in terms of variables exerting influence on oil prices on any given day stock prices offer a clue into investor sentiment in this regard energy markets are following lockstep with what the equity markets are doing here and i think that s going to continue to be the case brian larose at icap technical analysis told reuters advertisement there were not a ton of new indicators to offer further insight into what to expect in early 2019 the most recent piece of data came from china s factory activity which showed a contraction in december for the first time in two years not exactly a positive signal the manufacturing survey data out of china this week is particularly negative for crude oil as it goes to the heart of the key demand center for the market said john kilduff a partner at again capital management according to reuters on the other hand just a few days ago president trump and chinese president xi jingping apparently had a lengthy phone conversation in which they made progress on the trade front xi told trump in a that he had hopes that both teams can meet each other halfway and reach an agreement beneficial to both countries and the world as early as possible according to xinhua trump followed that up in a tweet stating that a deal is moving along very well one that covers all subjects big progress being made trump said a thaw in the trade war could relieve one of the global economy s major headwinds for 2019 oil traders also took heart in news that saudi arabia is following through on major oil export reductions in december saudi arabia slashed oil exports by roughly 500 000 bpd according to bloomberg however it could be some time before these cuts show up in the inventory data inventory draws as a result of cuts by opec may not be so easily visible for a while but avoiding a steep inventory increase in h1 2019 is what the market needs to see bjarne schieldrop chief commodities analyst at seb said in a statement there will be a several month lag before the opec cuts start to be felt by the market oil producers have to first lower output then there will be a corresponding effect on inventories advertisement however the cuts may not be large enough to induce large reductions in storage levels instead inventories may merely stabilise schieldrop said on top of that the iea reports oecd inventory data on a two month lag so data for january won t be available until march however one month s worth of data may not tell us much so the market may have to wait until april or may to get a sense of how the opec cuts are affecting the global supply balance still the cuts could put a floor beneath oil prices a bottoming for the oil price during q1 2019 seems like a fair bet with higher oil prices thereafter schieldrop said there will also be a lag in terms of a potential shale drilling slowdown in response to lower prices during the last downturn the reaction from the rig count data came at least six weeks after major oil price movements as such the recent meltdown in oil prices which began back in october may only now start to show up in the weekly rig counts at the same time the eia just released monthly u s oil production data showing a jump in output in october to 11 537 million barrels per day mb d up from 11 458 mb d a month earlier it was another solid increase in output although to be sure it was a fraction of the monthly increases for much of 2018 oil traders are still awaiting more definitive clues about the supply demand balance but volatility is likely to stick around for a while in the short run oil prices will likely follow global stock markets up or down on any given day until the fundamentals reveal a more discernable pattern
while still twisted in an ugly way the us treasury curve flattened out somewhat as the yield on us 10 year treasuries rallied 11 basis points in response to interest rate markets unwinding bets of a fed rate cut in 2019 gold and the yen pulled back on diminished haven demand while emerging markets currencies and their key proxy the australian dollar went on a tear 5 asx spi futures are indicating a very solid 69 point jump for the asx200 this morning according to that contract s last traded price despite being wedged between the dual global concerns of slower global growth and tighter global financial conditions the australian share market has shown resilience recently aside from a temporary tumble on thin liquidity prior to christmas to new multi year lows the asx200 has more or less traded range bound between 5500 5700 for the last month our share market hasn t quite seen the high octane activity lately that wall street has with volumes below average and swings in price action only really spurred by sentiment from us markets there are general signs of consolidation occurring in the index however a break in either direction particularly upon the return of normal trading conditions appears imminent 6 us china trade talks the fortunes of the asx200 on a macro scale will be dictated first by us markets then by the outlook for china the economic calendar presents as quite thin to begin the week providing traders of riskier assets room to manoeuvre if the newswires remain clear of outside noise the primary focus for now will be on the mid level trade talks due to begin between the us and china today major breakthroughs are unlikely in the absence of each nation s heavy hitter but the communications coming out of this week s talks will be crucial evidence is mounting that the trade war is starting to bite exacerbating existing economic challenges for both sides market participants will be hungry for indications that an urgency amongst policymakers is building now to resolve it 7 the markets balancing act where markets head from here remains uncertain volatility will continue to show up this week and throughout the rest of january an easing of fears regarding the state of us economic growth is helpful but it throws up the paradox strong growth implies likely tighter monetary policy which is bad for stocks and riskier assets weak growth implies the possibility of a recession which is bad for stocks and riskier assets there is a middle way as there often is between both poles within which the fed must traverse they may well do just that and keep this bull market afloat in doing so there will be missteps along the way though meaning as has often been said fear and subsequent volatility will spike as market conditions evolve 8 market watch spi futures up 69 points or 1 2 to 5631 as of 9am aedt saturday aud 1 5 to 71 13 us cents on wall st dow 3 3 s p 500 3 4 nasdaq 4 3 in new york bhp 6 1 rio 5 6 atlassian 3 1 in europe stoxx 50 3 ftse 2 2 cac 2 7 dax 3 4 spot gold 0 6 to us1286 05 an ounce at 5pm friday new york time brent crude 2 to us57 06 a barrel us oil 1 9 to us47 96 a barrel iron ore 0 7 to us73 10 a tonne dalian iron ore 0 5 to 508 yuan lme aluminium 1 6 to us1865 a tonne lme copper 3 2 to us5918 a tonne 2 year yield us 2 49 australia 1 79 5 year yield us 2 50 australia 1 93 10 year yield us 2 67 australia 2 23 germany 0 2 us australia 10 year yield gap as of 9am aedt saturday 44 basis points this column was produced in commercial partnership between fairfax media and ig

highest level of stocks for the region since early september south and southeast gas prices in the south and southeast remain among the cheapest in the country but state averages are declining at a

states whose gas price averages are more expensive compared to january 2018 conversely montana and colorado s averages are 20 and 18 cents less expensive respectively than a year ago not surprisingly gas prices in utah 2 58 wyoming 2 58 and idaho 2 55 are among the 15 most expensive in the country this week the eia reports that gasoline stocks held steady at 7 million bbl for week ending december

approximately 500 000 bbl to 27 1 million bbl stocks are approximately 3 6 million bbl lower than at this time last year which could cause prices to spike if there is a supply challenge in the region this week oil market dynamics at the close of wednesday s formal trading session on the nymex wti increased 1 13 to settle at 46 54 oil prices mostly fell last week as market observers continue to believe that the global crude market is over supplied moreover new concerns are growing of a potential economic slowdown in 2019 that could lead to a decline in global demand for crude however recent price gains in the market underscore how volatile the market is now which could lead crude prices higher if global supply tightens amid robust demand for crude for now new reports indicate that the u s russia and iraq the second largest producer in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries opec saw crude production and export increases in the final months of 2018 contributing to the falling price of crude in related news according to the latest weekly petroleum status report from the eia total domestic crude inventories took a slight step back during the week of december 21st but even with a decline of approximately 40 000 at 441 4 million bbl domestic crude inventories are approximately 10 million bbl higher when compared to a year ago in the coming weeks market observers will look for indications that opec s global pact with large non opec crude producers including russia to reduce crude production by 1 2 million b d for at least the first six months of 2019 will help

populists make empty promises they exploit people s discontent raise expectations but cannot deliver solutions they claim to represent the will of the people yet they spread lies and accuse leaders of other parties particularly progressive ones to be the root cause of all the problems people face populists thrive on divisiveness and partisanship in both america and europe and it is happening in the world s oldest democracies places that should have been inured to the populists siren songs two recent cases are emblematic of what is going on case 1 the united states consider america trump constantly attacks the failing new york times for spreading fake news former nytimes editor jill abramson rips paper s unmistakably anti trump bias ms abramson is 100 correct horrible and totally dishonest reporting on almost everything they write hence the term fake news enemy of the people and opposition party donald j trump realdonaldtrump january 5 2019 he flatly overlooks the fact that the new york times has never been more successful with extraordinary financial results and a fast growing audience forbes estimates nyt s online subscriber base to be its biggest value driver and forecast this growth to pick up in the coming years and reach 4 5 million by 2022 a remarkable performance at a time of great difficulty for the industry battered by digital publications and online news but trump like all populists has an achilles heel he can t deliver on his promises and he never will because his promises are nonsensical none of them can resolve the problems they are meant to address what is happening now with his promised border wall is only the start he incautiously caused the shutdown of government sending home 800 000 government employees without pay and he is doubling down on his mistake with false accusations at the democrats when everyone knows that the democrats have nothing to do with it trump and he alone is the cause of the mess and if the shutdown lasts a year or more as trump says he s ready to do don t go ask all those employees sitting at home how happy they are with him or what they think of his maga policies but what about employment and trump s promise to create more blue collar jobs to revive the rust belt the just published employment data was fantastic almost double what economists had predicted shattering wall street forecasts of doom 312 000 jobs were created in december bringing total employment gains in 2018 to a three year high of 2 64 million the labor department adjusted its figures for october raising them from 237 000 to 274 000 and for november from 155 000 to 176 000 cherry on the cake the average wage rose 11 cents or 0 4 to 27 48 an hour ok 0 4 doesn t sound like a big deal but it s an average and it means some people did get ahead and if the employment rate crept up to 3 9 percent from a 49 year low of 3 7 percent that s a small creep and it was because more people attracted by a booming economy entered the workforce so has trump delivered on his promise first it s too soon to tell the impact of whatever trump did will take some years to show up no political measure is ever instantly translated into measurable economic effects second we need to remember that trump in his first two years has only really achieved two things 1 deregulation of the environment paralyzing the environmental protection agency a boon for the fuel and coal industry and steel and 2 an unprecedented tax break for big business and the one percent at the expense of the middle class and the lower blue collar working class both measures will need time to impact the economy in full but we already see early signs that can tell us which way things will be going the expected early burst due to trump s tax break is much like a wave of fresh funding currently translating into higher overall employment and attracting new people in the labor market problem it is not going into every nook and cranny in the economy as the republicans expected there is a good reason for this shortcoming a considerable amount of the funding freed from the tax is not going into new investment but instead going into stock buybacks to please shareholders for now that makes wall street and the one percent very happy but every cent and dollar going into stock buybacks means it is not going into main street and jobs for blue collar workers the amounts diverted into stock buybacks is extensive by end 2018 it is estimated that of the announced 1 1 trillion in buybacks a record amount already 800 billion have actually been purchased record buybacks are usually a sign that cfos believe their stock is undervalued but not all buybacks have happy outcomes consider the case of apple that was recently badly hit by dropping sales for its smartphones in china then there s another problem robotization this had nothing to do with trump s policies the trend to automation started a long time before trump reached the white house except for one thing he should have foreseen the problem a good leader sees farther than his voting base he should have understood that jobs in the coal and steel aluminum industries that existed twenty years ago are no longer there because of automation for example austria boasts of an almost entirely automated steel plant it only needs 14 people to run the same is true for the united states as a brookings article abundantly documents the last time employment peaked in the coal industry was in the 1920s already by 1980 it was plunging from 785 000 in 1920 to 242 000 and by 2015 it had lost 59 of its workforce compared to 1980 most of the loss due not to trade but to automation the change from pit mining to surface mining using explosives and considerably less labor accelerated the move capital intensive highly productive technologies are already in use everywhere and it is expected that over the next 10 to 15 years their deployment will be ramped up but trump didn t see that coming he is not interested in either automation or the opportunities opened up by artificial intelligence as a result of his tax cut jobs in the steel aluminum and coal industries have rebounded sure but only modestly not enough to change the equation in the rust belt moreover big business hasn t changed its modus operandi as the recent decision of general motors to close down plants in the u s and send 45 000 people home shows bottom line trump is only interested in easy to sell slogans not in resolving difficult problems case 2 europe consider the european union and take a close look at one of its best grounded most emblematic democracies italy the country where after the disaster of world war ii a particularly representative democracy was set up with a carefully crafted constitution intended to avoid the dictatorship of the majority and give equal representation to all citizens excluding none once again matteo salvini the rising star of populism in europe is in the news in italy he is both minister of the interior and one of the two vice premiers along with luigi di maio the leader of the anti establishment 5 star movement a clever and dangerous politician he is the new face of his party the lega that he has cleverly transformed from a northern italian secessionist party calling for independence from rome to a populist national party winning voters in southern italy that is quite an accomplishment if you consider that his party once upon a time when it was still in the hands of its founder umberto bossi jailed in 2017 for embezzlement of funds was filled with people who despised southern italians calling them terroni mud people what has brought salvini in the news is his new security decree an anti immigrant measure that has closed italy s borders to refugees and was adopted by parliament on 28 november over the year end holidays italian ports were closed to the ship sea watch with 49 asylum seekers onboard the ship was then ping ponged between italy and malta the netherlands after announcing it would accept some refugees if others did too recanted malta continued to refuse entrance meanwhile in italy several mayors of big cities led by palermo s mayor leoluca orlando and quickly followed by naples and florence have said they would welcome the refugees salvini roared that they were acting illegally and should obey government orders he asked for their resignation the tragic show exasperated the pope who on january 6 called on the eu leaders to grant asylum to the refugees now stranded in maltese waters the row has now escalated into a major legal mess with questions raised about the constitutionality of salvini s anti immigrant decree that does not recognize international law the geneva conventions and the right to asylum the basis for questioning the constitutionality of salvini s decree something even the president of the italian republic did in a letter to prime minister giuseppe conte dated 4 october 2018 lies in the fact that the italian constitution article 10 requires that the country respects international treaties that it has entered into in this case the 1949 geneva conventions and its protocols 1977 and 2005 protecting people not taking part in hostilities and those who are no longer doing so beyond the legal spat we need to recognize that the immigrant question is exceedingly complex the smugglers who provide boats to migrants to cross the mediterranean are jackals out to make money it s a fragile balancing act between shutting down the human trafficking and saving lives as this video from the bbc shows now that the italian authorities have cracked down on them burning the boats after refugee lives have been saved the smugglers provide migrants with poor quality skiffs as migrants find themselves tightly packed onboard ships that take water their lives are further endangered in fact many italians criticize salvini s approach to the immigrant question saying that by tightening borders and security measures he has only succeeded in driving them further underground raising the level of clandestine operations in any case salvini is far from realizing his promise of expelling 100 immigrants per day up to a total of 600 000 persons an impossible task all he has achieved is to close italian ports to asylum seekers at an absurd inhuman cost none of the rest has been done expulsions are not the answer what is required is a humane policy of integration of those migrants who are valid and willing and expulsion of those who are not an italian solution does exist but it has never been considered by salvini the so called riace model first invented and tried by domenico lucano the mayor of riace a small town in southern italy salvini got him arrested on what are likely to be trumped up charges but even if the charges prove true this changes nothing to the value of the riace model started in the late 1990s the model worked successfully for 20 years all that was needed was to scale it up and extend it to the whole country problem solved go tell salvini this is why populists are dangerous all you get are broken promises related article the false migrant crisis

while president trump was all by myself in the white house over christmas watching the guys out on the lawn with machine guns russia s vladi mir putin seemed to be contemplating another war with ukraine while his top aides issued threatening statements the ukrainian government and some western observers warned of suspicious movements of russian aircraft and equipment the institute for the study of war reported on dec 23 that the data suggests putin is preparing to attack analyst michael kofman of the wilson center judged an invasion unlikely but concluded that moscow is looking to bloody ukraine at the first available opportunity so far nothing has happened though russia continues to hold the two dozen sailors it captured when it assaulted three ukrainian ships near crimea on nov 25 and it is still hindering shipping to several ukrainian ports but putin s maneuvering points to how the united states adversaries are likely to react to the steadily increasing chaos of the trump presidency they will spend 2019 testing how much they can gain at the expense of a u s president who has sidelined most of his national security team and has been making a display of his ignorance of and disregard for u s interests if there is to be no u s response and so far there hasn t been putin has reason to step up military attacks on ukraine ahead of its presidential election in march which he hopes will unseat pro u s incumbent petro poroshenko now that trump has declared that iran can do what they want in syria expect tehran to entrench more forces and missiles near the border with israel while the government of benjamin netanyahu won t be happy with that it has taken its own advantage of trump s passivity launching what the associated press described last week as what could be the largest construction binge in years in the occupied west bank advertisement national security advisor john bolton said on jan 6 the withdrawal of troops depends on a guarantee that turkey will not target kurdish forces video reuters the leader whose calculation of trump s weakness may matter most is china s xi jinping who reacted to barack obama s retreat from enforcing u s red lines by taking over much of the south china sea xi and trump are engaged in a trade negotiation that could be crucial to the fortunes of both countries this year china starts at a seeming disadvantage u s tariffs already have helped induce a sharp slowdown in consumer spending and a 25 percent drop in the shanghai stock market the largest decline in the world in 2018 but xi no doubt has been listening as trump has revealed an obsession with u s stock prices and anxiety over their decline last week trump predicted the markets will rebound once we settle trade issues xi s most likely conclusion he can wait trump out beijing will offer to settle the trade war for token measures such as a promise to buy more u s products xi will bet that trump won t seek to truly break chinese mercantilism if it means more plunges in the standard poor s 500 meanwhile china s step by step bid for hegemony over east asia will continue xi will quietly encourage north korea s kim jong un to continue resisting any denuclearization deal with trump that doesn t include a withdrawal of u s forces and assets from the region after all he would have heard trump say that patrick shanahan the inexperienced former boeing executive he appointed to fill in for departed defense secretary jim mattis agrees with him that we re giving military protection to countries that are very wealthy and they re not doing anything for us in trump s mind that means south korea advertisement putin was no doubt listening to that rant in front of the cabinet as well he would have heard trump defend of all things the soviet invasion of afghanistan while dumping on the performance of u s commanders there he would have heard him describe syria as sand and death and he would have noted that there was not a word about ukraine despite russia s unprovoked attack on the ukrainian ships illegal restriction of commercial shipping and deployment of forces capable of initiating a new ground offensive share this article share any other u s president would have by now taken common sense steps to deter putin from further aggression in conjunction with allies such as germany britain and france allied ships would be appearing in the black sea and stopping at ukrainian ports and teams of observers from nato would be deploying in eastern ukraine to monitor russian activity u s diplomats would be negotiating with the european union on a new round of sanctions on russia specifically in response to its naval belligerence but trump has no interest in such matters and he has driven off or stopped his ears to the advisers who might explain them to him he wallows in his ignorance and his prejudices all alone in the white house ukraine and all other nations that used to depend on the united states are on their own advertisement
on its 20th birthday the best that can be said of the euro the european currency used by 19 countries is that it has survived two decades after being introduced in 1999 it has not achieved its central goals increasing economic growth and strengthening public support for european political institutions in many ways just the opposite has occurred the economy of the euro zone all of the countries that adopted the euro britain and some others declined to join still lags behind the united states in growth for 2019 growth is forecast at only 1 6 percent compared with 2 6 percent for the united states even worse the contentious negotiations over rescuing the euro zone s weaker members greece spain portugal and italy have left a bitter aftertaste debtor countries feel they were treated badly by the wealthier creditor countries particularly germany meanwhile the creditors resent having to bail out their poorer neighbors animosities remain advertisement all this looms over europe s present political crisis its rising populism its anger over immigration and the conflict over britain s exit from the european union another euro crisis a clear possibility would make things worse italy seems especially vulnerable with little economic growth and government debt at about 130 percent of its gross domestic product notes rebecca patterson in a report for bessemer trust a financial services firm to its advocates the euro s appeal was simple eliminating separate currencies for the e u s member countries would reduce the nuisance of money conversions promote stable exchange rates and stimulate trade faster economic growth would make the case for more centralized control a more powerful e u at first things went well interest rates dropped sharply especially for weaker borrowers in january 1999 rates on italian 10 year government bonds were virtually the same as rates on similar german bonds though the german economy and its repayment prospects were much better than italy s advertisement by contrast italian interest rates had been much higher before the euro the gap or spread between german and italian rates was 5 percentage points in early 1995 other debtor countries got similar relief from higher interest rates the apparent justification for the lower rates was this investors believed that the discipline of a single currency would force many poorer e u countries to improve their economies and less optimistically if they got in trouble they would be bailed out by others so the risk of lending had declined more could be lent the result should have surprised no one there was a credit boom says economist adam posen of the peterson institute for international economics german french dutch and belgian banks lent to greek spanish italian and portuguese borrowers money flooded into greek bonds and spanish real estate advertisement everyone was happy greece spain and other debtors enjoyed the pleasures of easy money germany and other creditor nations benefited from strong exports that in turn were ultimately financed by loans from these countries banks share this article share the trouble was that the creditors overlent and the debtors overborrowed the united states 2007 2009 great recession was fatal its side effects including a steep fall in global trade hurt many european borrowers and lenders some lenders were unwilling or unable to renew their loans there were sudden stops as posen puts it to stay solvent borrowers had to get government credit from central banks and international agencies such as the international monetary fund or cut spending and raise taxes it was here that the toughest negotiations occurred as lenders and borrowers argued over terms advertisement one possible solution was for debtor countries to abandon the euro and revert to national currencies and to do so at conversion rates that favored borrowers this didn t happen though there was much speculation that it might almost everyone agreed that ditching the euro would have involved hugely difficult legal political operational and moral issues still it was a possibility if a few countries had jettisoned the euro what would have happened nothing many countries doing likewise a deep global recession none of this occurred in part because no one could confidently answer these questions another reason is that the euro remains popular at home by one survey 74 percent of euro users support it people favor the euro though not the measures needed to make it workable in the end the european central bank bought 2 6 trillion euros worth of bonds nearly 3 trillion at current exchange rates to prop up the currency after mario draghi president of the ecb pledged in mid 2012 to do whatever it takes to save the euro advertisement the story continues eventually we re going to have another u s recession says patterson who wrote the bessemer trust report then we ll see whether europe s governments banks and businesses can withstand the pressures created by high debt and low economic growth and whether the euro can still survive read more from robert samuelson s archive

in the late 1970s the united aut omobile workers union had a brazen idea during negotiations for a new contract members asked chrysler to give workers representation on its board a practice called co determination that had been germinating all over europe the proposal was far outside the bounds of management labor relations in america at the time and chrysler was initially immovable but the union had helped secure a federal loan for the company which shielded it from bankruptcy and management eventually relented in 1980 chrysler s chief executive lee iacocca nominated the u a w leader douglas fraser to the board as a reward but the presence of a single labor representative on a 17 member board did not translate into meaningful results for workers at one point mr fraser did vote against a plush executive pay package but he was the only nay he stepped down in 1984 and chrysler eliminated the union seat altogether in 1991 only a handful of other companies tried worker representation the unions didn t fight for it and the american experiment in co determination was over before it began in today s gilded age when chief executives are making well over 300 times what the typical worker brings home in pay the idea is getting new life senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts who recently announced her bid for president introduced a bill last year to give workers the right to vote for two fifths of all corporate board seats with a companion bill in the house by representatives introduced by ben ray luján of new mexico a similar bill by senator tammy baldwin of wisconsin would entitle workers to elect one third of the seats
bank stocks have quietly become some of the market s biggest winners as the federal reserve has slowly increased rates a quarter point at a time rising interest rates have helped the banking industry grow net interest income driving double digit profit growth let s look at the financial sector from top to bottom explain how banks work and consider why you might want to invest in banks then we ll give you five bank stocks to consider for your portfolio the exterior of the federal reserve building image source getty images the basics of banking at their core banks are rather simple they take deposits from individuals businesses and governments and they use the money to make loans to individuals businesses and governments banks are middlemen for money if you have 10 000 of cash you can deposit it at a bank and earn interest if you need to borrow 10 000 you can go to a bank to borrow it and pay interest advertisement advertisement banks make the bulk of their money from the spread between what they pay on their deposits and earn on their loan portfolios the old joke is that banks operate under a 3 6 3 model in which they borrow at 3 lend at 6 and hit the golf course by 3 p m of course banks also make money from a variety of fee businesses they charge fees for basic banking services think account fees and atm charges but they also help individuals manage retirement portfolios and they help businesses accept debit and credit cards the largest make money by helping companies raise money by selling stocks and bonds to the public in short if it involves money in some way or form a bank is probably involved why invest in banks banks can be a great industry to invest in just ask warren buffett easily the greatest investor to ever live who has stuffed his portfolio to the brim with banks and keeps buying more there are many reasons you might want to invest in banks aside from following buffett s lead advertisement advertisement practicality investing in banks requires some specific knowledge but if you can understand one bank you can probably understand them all the business of banking is highly commoditized which means most banks are doing the same things as their peers making it easy to compare them to one another interest rates bank stocks are some of the very few investments that tend to rise in value when interest rates increase so when rate increases weigh on your stock and bond portfolio rising rates will give life to your bank stocks which makes banks a great way to diversify your portfolio dividends bank stocks can be dividend machines particularly the largest u s banks which earn more money than they can reliably reinvest to support deposit and loan growth in recent years the largest u s banks have paid out virtually all of their earnings to shareholders by paying dividends and buying back stock choice don t like a certain bank no problem there are several hundred more for you to choose from the united states has more banks than virtually any other country in the world so you won t have to look too hard to find yet another bank stock to analyze local investment your knowledge of the economy in the 50 or 100 miles surrounding your home can be a huge asset when investing in banks with so many publicly traded banks on the market the odds are good that one of your hometown banks is publicly listed that bank would be a good place to start your analysis since you probably have a good understanding of local employment trends real estate prices and so on the risks of investing in banks banks are inherently cyclical their profits are driven by the ups and downs of interest rates as well as the performance of the economy as a whole during economic expansions banks benefit from increased loan demand and lower loan losses as fewer people and businesses struggle to make ends meet however during periods of economic distress bank earnings naturally tumble as a rule of thumb the very best banks will earn about 1 to 2 on assets meaning that for every 1 of assets they have they ll report 0 01 to 0 02 in net income thus even a small increase in bad loans can have a huge impact on their bottom line profitability at the depths of the financial crisis in 2009 if you added up all the profits or losses of all banks in the united states you d find that they lost money as a whole chart of u s banking industry s return on assets since 1988 data source federal reserve chart by author advertisement advertisement the chart shows the earnings of all banks divided by the assets of all banks for each year you ll notice that profits dip during recessions 1991 2001 and 2008 the more severe the recession the greater the drop in bank profits the short recession of the early 2000s barely registers on the chart compared with the plunge during the great financial crisis the dip in the early 1990s was accompanied by falling real estate prices in certain areas particularly in texas and california where a glut of commercial real estate led to plunging prices and bad loans this point leads perfectly into another important thing to understand about banks the banking industry is highly local a bank in detroit is likely to have different growth prospects and outcomes than a bank in santa clara california the best bank in a place where unemployment is 10 home prices are falling and residents are fleeing will probably underperform the worst bank in a geographic area where unemployment is 4 home prices are soaring and the population is increasing important metrics for bank investors to know bank stocks are unlike few others whereas most companies make their money by selling a product or service banks make their money by taking risks with money thus analyzing a bank stock requires different financial metrics from what you d find in other industries advertisement advertisement here are five of the most important metrics for banks 1 net interest margin nim this figure is designed to show the difference between what a bank earns on its assets loans and securities minus what it pays for deposits and other borrowings if a bank has 500 million of earning assets earns 30 million in interest and pays 10 million in interest it would have a net interest margin of 4 30 million 10 million 500 million 0 04 or 4 i like to benchmark banks against the national average every quarter the federal reserve publishes the net interest margin all banks earn in the third quarter of 2018 for example the average nim for u s banks was 3 33 banks that earn higher than average nims may do so because they have cheap deposits or because they make riskier loans credit card companies for example earn higher nims than commercial banks that make safer loans to businesses a bank may earn lower than average nims because it makes safer loans or because it has to pay depositors a higher rate on their deposits advertisement advertisement the trajectory of a bank s nim is also important particularly when interest rates are rising and falling the fed started increasing rates in 2016 giving lift to the banking industry s net interest margin banks that have seen their nim increase at a rate faster than average are probably good bets for banks that will capitalize on future rate increases 2 return on assets roa return on assets is simply a bank s annual net profit divided by the assets on its balance sheet thus a bank that earns 2 million on assets of 100 million would have a return on assets of 2 generally speaking an roa above 1 is good and an roa above 1 5 is exceptional many bank investors buffett included consider this one of the best measures of a bank s true profitability roa is often used in other industries but it s especially important in the banking industry as there is a very direct link between the assets a bank has on its balance sheet and its profitability banks that generate higher returns on assets over long periods may have a competitive advantage stemming from their ability to analyze risks hold down expenses or earn fees from non lending business lines or from their ability to win deposits from competing banks 3 nonperforming loans npls a nonperforming loan is generally one in which the borrower has failed to make contractual payments for more than 90 days banks typically place nonperforming loans on non accrual which means they stop recognizing income from the loan because it may not be collected advertisement advertisement any bank no matter how well managed will have some loans that simply go bad investors often use a bank s npl ratio non performing loans divided by all loans to see how the bank s loan portfolio is performing the npl ratio is best used to compare a bank s recent performance to prior periods for example a bank s npl ratio in 2019 versus the same bank s ratio in 2011 or to compare similar loan types across lenders for example one bank s mortgage npls versus another s 4 tangible book value tbv this financial metric is useful because it tells you what a bank would be worth if it were liquidated if all the assets were sold liabilities were paid back and whatever was left over was distributed to shareholders bank investors often divide tbv by the number of shares outstanding to arrive at tbv per share a bank s share price compared to its tbv per share is useful as a valuation metric if a bank trades at 1 5 times tbv then you know shares trade at a 50 premium to the bank s liquidation value advertisement advertisement banks that earn higher returns on assets have more growth opportunity and or have a history of taking better risks in their loan portfolios typically trade at higher multiples of tbv than slower growing banks and banks that earn poor returns on assets 5 efficiency ratio the efficiency ratio is designed to tell you how much a bank spends to generate a dollar of revenue the formula is as follows non interest expenses net interest income non interest income banks have to spend money to generate revenue a bank needs to have and maintain atms to earn fees it needs to have loan officers and credit analysts if it wants to lend taking in deposits often requires adding more branches yes even today branches still matter unlike some other ratios on this list a lower efficiency ratio is better if a bank has a 40 efficiency ratio that means it spends 40 of its revenue on non interest expenses such as office space and labor but like other ratios this one is most useful when used to measure a bank s performance over time or in comparing banks with similar business models advertisement advertisement if a bank ceo announces a a three year plan to be more efficient and the efficiency ratio only increases well you have a way to know things aren t going according to plan if one community bank in your city has a 60 efficiency ratio and another is at 80 even though both make the same kind of loans and have the same deposit gathering strategy then the second bank may require more investigation it could just be that the second bank has recently opened new branches that have only begun to take in more deposits or it could be something less benign such as oversized paydays and car allowances for its executives why banks in 2019 there are many positive trends in the banking industry that should bode well for profits in 2019 and beyond lower taxes when the u s government reduced corporate taxes to 21 from 35 the resulting tax regime was extremely favorable for u s based banks over time one would expect that the advantage of lower taxes will go away as banks start competing more aggressively on rates for deposits and loans but for now banks are practically printing money thanks to the step down in tax rates that took effect in 2018 deregulation in the years following the financial crisis of 2008 regulators clamped down on the banking industry they required banks to hold more capital to protect against losses made them stop offering certain types of riskier loans and took aim at key sources of income such as debit card fees as time goes on without any banking disasters rules that restricted risk taking at major u s banks could be reversed allowing banks to add more loans to their balance sheets to drive profit growth rate increases additional rate increases could bolster bank profits particularly for banks that tend to make floating rate loans meaning the interest rate changes with the market rate as well as banks that have low or no cost deposits that allow them to capture all the benefit of rising rates as profit advertisement advertisement the banking industry has come a long way over the past decade banks have aggressively eliminated expenses and derisked their balance sheets by letting riskier loans run off and adding more capital to their balance sheets to stomach loan losses with that in mind here are some banks that could be great buys in 2019 and beyond bank stock quick case for buying this bank bank of america

more efficiently than their smaller competitors in an extreme case a one branch bank that has 1 billion in deposits will have expense advantages over a one branch bank that has 100 million in deposits the costs to run a bank don t scale directly with the size of the bank giving bigger banks an edge few banks have the scale to match bank of america which has more than 10 of all deposits in the united states by spreading its expenses across a large balance sheet bank of america is extremely efficient in 2018 its consumer banking unit had an impressive efficiency ratio of less than 50 an impressive result that can only be achieved with scale bank of america s performance has improved markedly since the financial crisis the bank spent the better part of the past decade investing in its mobile banking features which enabled it to serve its customers while closing down roughly one fourth of its branches the bank also dialed down the risk in its loan portfolio cutting back on risky credit card and home equity loans and lending more to businesses than to consumers the biggest mistakes bank of america made going into the financial crisis were acquiring other banks at high prices the charlotte n c based bank acquired countrywide and merrill lynch in costly and poorly timed acquisitions but investors don t have to worry about acquisitions anymore bank of america holds more than 10 of the nation s deposits which means it can t legally acquire another bank even if it wanted to given its size basic mathematics suggest bank of america is unlikely to grow much faster than the banking industry average but investors may still eke out favorable returns with acquisitions ruled out bank of america can do little more than grow its loan portfolio at a slow single digit rate while showering shareholders with rich dividends and share repurchases 2 svb financial a riskier tech bank some banks have unique exposures that make them different from their peers svb financial the parent company of silicon valley bank is one such banking institution given that it makes its money from being the bank for silicon valley tech companies and the funds that invest in them whereas most banks make only plain vanilla business loans svb financial often lends to riskier start ups on terms that give it the right to buy stock in the company at a later time that gives it additional upside potential when it finances companies that go on to be runaway winners the company has monetized stakes in companies that include fitbit roku and acacia communications among others booking large but less predictable profits svb financial s exposure to the technology industry and the financial firms that invest in high flying tech companies does make it a little riskier than the average bank but its tech focus also helps particularly when it comes to attracting quality deposits that help it earn more money when rates rise this is also one of the most rate sensitive banks on the market more than 80 of its customers deposits are non interest bearing meaning it doesn t pay a dime in interest to its customers for keeping those balances at the bank in the first nine months of 2018 rising rates helped drive its net interest margin up from 3 2 to 3 62 as its interest income rose considerably faster than its interest expenses a focus on high growth technology companies means this bank s fortunes are inherently tied to wealth creation in silicon valley tech companies have found it easy to raise more and more money but a slowdown in venture capital activity could turn the boom into bust for this reason i regard it as the most speculative bank on this list 3 first republic a fast growing bank for the wealthy high growth banks are few and far between an industry watcher rule is that deposits and loans at the nation s banks will generally increase at a rate equal to economic output over long periods thus if over a 10 year period the economy grows at 4 per year assets in the entire banking industry are likely to increase at about 4 per year to grow any faster than the average banks will have to steal deposit and loan market share from other institutions small banks are most likely to exhibit faster rates of growth one intriguing and fast growing bank is first republic bank which caters to high net worth households and commercial customers in major metropolitan areas the bank s largest markets include silicon valley new york city los angeles and boston bar chart of first republic s deposits from 2012 to 2018 data source first republic chart by author first republic grows by stealing the most valuable customers from larger banks by offering more attention and personalized service the model works well as first republic can attract highly profitable clientele who keep 96 000 on average in their personal bank accounts nearly 2 5 times the average amount americans held in all of their transaction accounts in 2016 according to the federal reserve taking deposits and making loans to the wealthy enables first republic to make high quality loans that are less likely to default since 2002 the bank s loan losses peaked at 0 48 of loans in 2009 well below the 1 67 of loans the top 50 u s banks charged off that year as of the end of the third quarter in 2018 nonperforming assets stood at just 0 04 of total assets more deposits per client relationship mean first republic can spend heavily on customer service without threatening its bottom line the bank s efficiency ratio which teeters in the low 60 range is impressive given that it s constantly hiring more bankers to grow the business investing in new hires and new branches cost first republic in the here and now for long term gain thus its efficiency ratio overstates somewhat the expenses it would incur if it simply turned off the growth machine since 2012 first republic s deposits have grown at an impressive average annual clip of 19 primarily by opening new offices and grabbing a greater share of ultra wealthy customers in the markets in which it competes yet even today less than 5 of millionaire households in its key geographies bank with first republic which gives it a lot of room for growth by stealing share from competitors 4 bb t a slow and steady regional bank if there s a place for an old school regional bank in your portfolio bb t would be a good choice this slow growing bank operates under the bb t name in the southeast united states earning its money by taking deposits and making loans to individuals and to small and mid sized businesses its commercial franchise enables it to attract piles of low cost deposits as roughly one third of deposits are non interest bearing as a result bb t earned returns on assets in excess of 1 even during the banking doldrums of 2014 to 2016 when low interest rates weighed on bank profits since then rising rates helped propel the bank s return on assets to 1 48 in the first nine months of 2018 what separates bb t from other banks is its conservative culture and its ability to get compensated for lending risks loan losses peaked shortly following the financial crisis in 2010 when bb t charged off 2 41 of loans far more than some other lenders but though it may have charged off more loans than its similarly sized rivals did bb t wasn t taking undue risk in the years leading up to the financial crisis throughout the downturn bb t earned more in interest income than it set aside for bad loans in contrast with many other regional banks which had loan losses in excess of interest income bb t s loan portfolio may have been more risky than those at other banks but it was adequately compensated for taking those risks all banks take risk but few manage to get paid for it the way bb t does this bank is a natural acquirer that grows by buying smaller banks rolling up their customers into its franchise before closing down branches and eliminating duplicated expenses recent transactions have included other non banking businesses such as insurance brokerages which enable it to generate steady commission income that diversifies its income sources in the first nine months of 2018 fee income made up roughly 42 of the bank s total revenue this is both a quintessential regional bank stock and an impressive commercial bank it won t blow the doors off with double digit annual growth in loans or deposits but it is one of the few sleep well at night banks that plays close to the chest by putting loan quality above loan growth 5 wells fargo a fixer upper big bank stock once one of the stock market s darlings wells fargo has lost its luster in recent years in 2016 its fake account scandals tarnished its image and cost it dearly in fines and reputational capital in 2018 after several more scandals regulators took the unprecedented step of capping wells fargo s size to 2 trillion in assets halting its growth until it proves that its errors are behind it though the headlines aren t friendly to wells fargo it still has advantages that separate it from the pack often called america s largest community bank wells fargo is a big bank that looks nothing like its trillion dollar peers because complex businesses like investment banking are a rounding error to its results it makes most of its money taking deposits and making loans to individuals and small businesses which insulates it from the large and unpredictable losses that have a way of popping up from wall street trading desks its underwriting record is also worthy of envy many consider wells fargo a canary in the coal mine for its ability to spot and dodge the worst lending disasters it never got involved in rampant subprime lending in the years leading up to the housing crisis and it famously rejected the notion that it should take bailout funds to help hide the lending missteps of its rivals in recent years it pulled back from aggressive lending in car loans worrying that lenders weren t being compensated for the risk though the strict asset cap means wells fargo can t grow until it gets regulatory approval it also means the bank is unlikely to take undue risk in its loan portfolio since it s limited to 2 trillion of assets loan applicants are competing for a limited amount of space on its balance sheet the asset cap has also forced wells fargo to remove some bloat from its operations nearly a decade after the financial crisis the bank is finally closing or selling less productive branches that other banks would have probably closed years ago i expect that regulators will eventually allow wells fargo to grow again but for now the bank seems plenty happy to plow its earnings into buying back its stock at depressed prices which could be a boon for long term investors more from the motley

new york city experienced another record setting crime reduction in 2018 continuing a more than two decade decline that has cut the number of homicides to a fraction of the 2 000 that were seen in 1990 police commissioner james o neill said the city recorded its second consecutive year of less than 300 homicides with 289 last year down from 292 in 2017 there were fewer than 800 shootings for the second consecutive year and robberies and burglaries fell to a record low according to police department statistics rapes increased 22 percent the only crime to see a significant rise mayor bill de blasio said that was likely because more women felt empowered to report sexual assaults to the police o neill and de blasio attributed the continuing success to the department s emphasis on better relations with minority communities and organized neighborhood based anti violence efforts it s unbelievable to think how far we ve come de blasio said we re in the new normal now and we intend to go farther the steady drop in crime coincided with record reductions in the city jail population and a rollback in the so called stop and frisk practices of new york police officers a tactic sharply reduced after civil rights advocates cited data showing it was disproportionately used in minority neighborhoods there were 94 percent fewer stop and frisk street encounters between police and city residents since the practice peaked before de blasio took office in 2014 bloomberg
as we begin 2019 the energy markets and the stock markets are experiencing incredible volatility both underwent steep declines during the latter part of last year how might this play out in 2019 below are my predictions for some of the significant energy trends i expect this year as i often point out the discussion behind the predictions is more important than the predictions themselves that s why i provide extensive background and reasoning behind the predictions i also provide predictions that are specific and measurable at year s end there are specific metrics that will indicate whether a prediction was right or wrong 1 oil prices will rise at least 25 bbl in 2019 six months ago when oil prices were pushing above 70 bbl i was preparing to make a more conservative oil price prediction for 2019 i thought the price rise would slow heading into 2019 but what i didn t foresee was the collapse in prices that took place in the second half of 2018 that collapse in oil prices makes this prediction a lot easier the price of west texas intermediate wti closed the last day of 2018 at 45 15 bbl after falling 30 bbl in the last three months of the year oil closed 15 bbl lower than it opened the year meanwhile u s crude oil inventories are almost exactly where they were a year ago the difference is in the perception of where the oil market is going market bears foresee electric vehicles taking a larger bite out of oil consumption and they see continued growth of u s oil production contributing to an oversupply of crude oil globally they are also concerned about an economic slowdown opec is the wild card here a big reason oil prices collapsed is that president trump convinced saudi arabia to increase production to make up for oil that would be lost as a result of iranian sanctions but at the last minute the trump administration granted generous exemptions to allow countries to continue importing iranian oil these exemptions are supposed to be for 180 days but they suddenly created too much oil in the market saudi arabia was furious and they immediately cut oil production at the next opec meeting the cartel agreed to cut production to balance the market i expect they will have success with this strategy in 2019 the same way they did the last time they went down this path opec hasn t lost its pricing power yet as long as they maintain discipline i expect their previous success will be repeated this year the u s energy information administration projects that wti will average 54 bbl in 2019 i think that s too conservative it s hard to project an average price because i don t know how long it will be before sentiment shifts and there are still going to be those who think electric vehicles are soon going to put oil out of business those sentiments will impact prices but i expect that by the end of the year opec s strategy will be working and you will see oil prices get back to the 70 bbl level 2 u s oil production growth will slow in 2019 versus 2018 except for an opec induced dip in production in 2016 u s oil production has risen like a rocket since 2011 none of those years was bigger than 2018 when domestic oil production rose by 1 5 million barrels per day bpd in the six of seven years since 2011 when production did increase it rose by an average of one million bpd while i do expect u s oil production to grow again in 2019 i think the combination of lower oil prices to begin the year and a potential economic slowdown stemming from trade tensions will result in a slowing of production growth for 2019 however average production for all of 2018 was 10 9 million bpd by the end of the year this level had reached 11 7 million bpd thus it won t take much of a rise to add another average of one million bpd to 2018 levels i believe this will happen but i don t believe we will add a million bpd from the year end level of 11 7 million bpd as we did in 2018 all we need to do is sustain another 300 000 bpd in 2019 to year end 2018 levels to average a million bpd over 2018 i can see that happening but i don t see a repeat of 2018 s huge growth 3 despite president trump s best efforts gasoline prices will end the year at least 0 30 gallon higher than they began the year i typically make a natural gas prediction but the fundamental picture is mixed inventories are still extremely low which should call for higher prices but natural gas prices are quite low to start the year if the inventory picture improves they will stay low if not we will see a lot of volatility it s a coin flip so i am going to forego a natural gas price prediction this year but here s one where i think the picture is clearer on new year s day president trump tweeted robert rapier gasoline prices have fallen sharply because oil prices have collapsed president trump did influence that by conning saudi arabia into increasing production and then letting iran continue to export oil this prediction is related to my oil price prediction but i expect that gasoline prices are going to end the year significantly higher than they began the year further december gasoline prices are usually low because seasonal demand is low and it s cheaper to produce winter gasoline the price of wti averaged 65 23 bbl in 2018 given that we are starting the year nearly 20 bbl below that price i think it s unlikely that the 2019 average will top that in turn i don t think the national average 2019 retail gasoline price will top the 2018 average price of 2 81 gallon but i do think gasoline prices are going to rise well above the year end price of 2 36 gallon on the flip side u s gasoline inventories are currently pretty high and that will provide headwinds for a while with respect to gasoline prices they only reached 3 00 gallon during two weeks in 2018 and i think there is a good chance they don t reach that level at all in 2019 it hinges on how quickly oil prices make a move higher i think we will see a gasoline price spike this year albeit it not as high as in previous years however we don t normally see year end gasoline prices rise by at least 0 30 gallon higher than the previous year it has only happened once since 2010 but i predict it happens again this year 4 the diesel premium over gasoline will at least double in 2019 one issue that hasn t gotten nearly enough attention in my view is the impact of a pending deadline that will impact the fuel markets on january 1 2020 the international maritime organization imo will require the sulfur content in marine fuel to drop from a maximum of 3 5 down to 0 5 the result is likely to be a spike in the price of low sulfur marine fuels which will likely impact several types of fuel prices for low sulfur crude oils will likely expand their premium over high sulfur crudes and diesel will likely get more expensive compared to gasoline as i pointed out in a previous article the u s began to phase in ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd in 2006 in the decade prior to the implementation of ulsd retail gasoline traded on average at a 0 04 gallon premium to retail diesel in 2005 the year before the phase in of ulsd began diesel traded at an average of 0 09 gallon over the price of gasoline and in the decade following implementation diesel averaged 0 23 gallon over the price of gasoline in 2018 retail diesel prices averaged 3 18 gallon a 0 37 gallon premium over gasoline i expect that premium to reach 0 75 gallon in 2019 as suppliers scramble to comply with the new guidelines however one wildcard may impact this prediction and that is that the new rules are postponed to allow more time for compliance i don t think that s likely but it is possible 5 solar sector equities recover by at least 20 there are some significant disconnects in the energy markets as we begin the year master limited partnerships for instance are trading far out of sync with the underlying fundamentals and as a result i expect them to outperform in 2019 but the largest disconnect is in the solar sector concerns about the impact of trade wars and tariffs have negatively impacted sentiment in the solar sector this resulted in a significant decline in solar stocks in 2018 the mac global solar energy index total return index sunidx is a diversified exchange traded fund etf that is traded on the new york stock exchange the index covers all major solar technologies and includes companies from around the world in 2018 it saw its value decline by nearly 30 meanwhile china s solar panel exports soared by 66 in the 3rd quarter year over year and numerous countries continued to install record levels of solar power costs for solar photovoltaics continue to decline mitigating part of the tariffs that the trump administration imposed in 2018 i expect that investors will again conclude that the future is very much about solar power and the long term growth rates there will continue to be phenomenal despite the negative perceptions of 2018 i predict that solar equities as represented by the sunidx will rise by at least 20 in 2019 conclusions there you have my 2019 energy predictions the themes are that u s oil production will start to slow that oil prices will begin to recover because of actions taken by opec that gasoline prices will move higher but not nearly as quickly as diesel prices and that solar equities will experience robust returns
in the current digital age we are living in it is sad to see where other forms of communication and services are becoming outdated the places that are being hurt the most are our local post offices ever since e mail came around i know i can t tell you the last time i wrote someone a handwritten letter i know it s common to send and receive christmas and holiday cards around the end of the year but other than that i text my friends or keep up with them on social media you could argue that the united states postal service usps is still in use because of the online orders they process and delivery unfortunately it s not enough to keep them in the positive i saw on nj com that the usps lost about 3 9 billion during their 2018 fiscal year and that s their 12th consecutive year that they have lost money i guess the bad news keeps rolling in because i also saw in the same article that forever stamps are going up along with other mailing services on january 27th forever stamps will cost an extra 5 cents per stamps going from 50 cents to 55 cents per stamp so now s the time to stock up if you want to get them before they go up in price here s a look at other usps price increases according to nj com priority small box will go from 7 20 to 7 90 priority medium box will go from 13 65 to 14 35 priority large box will go from 18 90 to 19 95 priority flat rate envelope 12 5 inch x 9 5 inch or smaller will go from 6 70 to 7 35 priority express flat rate envelope will go from 24 70 to 25 50

slowdown in sight for u s economy in 2019 as uncertainty intensifies experts u s economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019 due to factors including the diminishing effect of fiscal stimulus further tightening of financial conditions rising market volatility and trade uncertainty experts have said with annualized growth rates of 2 2 percent 4 2 percent and 3 4 percent for the first three quarters of 2018 respectively and a 2 percent range expected for the fourth quarter the federal reserve estimated that the u s economy would wrap up the year with a 3 percent expansion much higher than the average 2 2 percent annual rate between 2010 and 2017 however economists warned that the boom is by and large led by the u s government s tax cuts and spending increases and that there are signs that the dividends of those measures are diminishing while the fed s monetary tightening will weigh more on u s growth fiscal boost becoming a fiscal drag and more tightening in financial conditions are going to mean that the growth is going to decelerate jeremie cohen setton research fellow at the peterson institute for international economics a washington think tank told xinhua in a recent interview he expected the u s economy to expand at around 2 5 percent in 2019 the slack is diminishing therefore you re going to have more wage pressures he said adding the fed would continue tightening monetary policy as u s inflation is going to overshoot the target of 2 percent a little bit the fed raised interest rates for four times in 2018 and most fed officials envisioned two rate hikes in 2019 it is more likely that the economy will grow in a way that will call for two interest rate increases over the course of next year fed chairman jerome powell told a press conference on dec 19 the fed anticipated that u s economic growth would decelerate to 2 3 percent in 2019 powell also emphasized at the press conference that the fed s policy decisions are not on a preset course there s a fairly high degree of uncertainty about both the path and the destination of any further increases he said but some experts argued that the fed s latest rate hike in december amid market volatility was questionable and an error it felt like a model driven decision occurred despite market turmoil that had continued too long to be ignored tim duy of the university of oregon wrote recently in his fed watch column duy noted that there was no pressing reason for a rate hike other than fed officials insist on defining policy on the back of long run forecasts and feel compelled to follow through with that policy what will add to the downside risks analysts said is the prospect of a protracted stalemate over government budget which has paralyzed a quarter of the federal government for more than a week now leaving some 800 000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay although the impact of the partial government shutdown on the overall economy remains limited for the time being it will no longer be negligible if the closure were to persist especially in a time of market volatility concerns about a loss of growth momentum in asia and europe would also likely weigh on u s growth for the rest of the world there seems to be some air coming out of the balloon that will come back and also affect the u s the international monetary fund s outgoing chief economist maurice obstfeld told reporters in early december meanwhile u s president donald trump s alleged displeasure with powell the stock market turbulence and ongoing trade disputes are all stoking uncertainties in the u s economy heading into 2019 following the imposition of steel and aluminum tariffs worldwide on the ground of national security it is not yet clear whether the u s government will slap new duties on imported cars and car parts in 2019 the european commission warned in a written document sent to the u s commerce department in june that some 300 billion u s dollars worth of u s exports will likely be hit by retaliatory measures from other economies subject to the potential auto tariffs in addition whether the u s government is capable enough to respond to a slowing economy or other contingencies and stabilize the market remains to be seen investors fear that a lack of experience coupled with personnel shortage may lead the u s government to miscalculation and policy failure further unsettling the market the u s treasury department had been blamed by market participants for sending at times muddled and confusing signals according to u s media in a move to quell market volatility treasury secretary steven mnuchin on dec 23 convened individual calls to chief executive officers of six major u s banks the banks all confirmed ample liquidity is available for lending to consumer and business markets the treasury department said in a statement mnuchin s effort to reach out to the private banking sector was not only rare for a senior government official but also of no avail as the dow the s p 500 and the nasdaq all tumbled more than 2 percent on the first trading day following the treasury department s statement the new york times said that mnuchin conducted the type of discussions usually reserved for moments of crisis thomas simons a senior economist at jefferies llc in new york pointed out that technical factors including sell orders driven by tax considerations and low year end volume could exaggerate the plunge in the stock market the first couple weeks of january will be telling as to whether this selling in december was technically related or actually fundamentally based he was quoted by bloomberg as saying despite a lift in major indices on monday u s stocks ended 2018 with the steepest annual declines since the 2008 financial crisis and many have cautioned the coming of a bear market after almost a decade of bull run source xinhua
a grievous casualty in america s insane ideological warfare is truth although truth has been a victim of mankind s moral and psychological frailties since the dawn of human communication the war on truth has reached endemic intensity in today s technologically advanced world modern communication technology especially the internet facilitates the speedy proliferation of deceitful political propaganda misrepresentations and outright lies the war on truth is fought from many sides the main forces of falsehood include politicians and political organizations commercial interests foreign adversaries and the news media all of them engage in deception concealing or twisting the truth and at times blatantly inventing facts for personal gain or to promote a particular agenda they are all trying to sell us something and too many folks are easily sold what fosters the war on truth is unquestioning belief belief is not the same as knowledge believing that something is true is not the same as knowing that it is knowing requires factual evidence direct experience demonstrated proof through orderly observation measurement and testing wisdom is understanding that beliefs are always subject to new information that the pursuit of truth involves altering beliefs in the face of facts of course this requires an open mind free of petrified positions and that is where american society has stumbled too many people confuse belief with knowledge they are certain that they already have the truth so the effort of pursuing it further is unnecessary the forces of falsehood exploit lazy minds those foreign forces who employed social media to interfere with the american political process must have been delighted to discover that a significant portion of the american population are gullible morons who will swallow almost any utter nonsense crazy conspiracy theories fabricated facts doctored photos and baseless accusations as long as it supports their fixed beliefs too much of the country seems to be living in an alternate dimension a dimension of delusion that exists next to but outside reality in this dimension beliefs are obstinately maintained as truths despite clearly credible evidence to the contrary the most prominent denizen of this dimension of delusion is president donald trump whose mendacity is as constant as it is blatant he is the nation s leading salesman of bunkum and the pied piper of pejorative propaganda leading the intellectually indolent into the dimension of delusion to end the war on truth citizens and institutions must be careful not to participate in waging it major media have the key role to play in this effort some like fox news are clearly more dedicated to a political agenda than to truth while other news organizations are subtler but also guilty having worked in the newspaper industry most of my career including 15 years with the new york times i have no illusions about bias in the mainstream media while ethical conscientious newsrooms are supposed to separate their opinions from straight news reporting the latter often seeps into the former the old five ws and h who what when where why and how are the fundamental questions a news reporter is supposed to answer in the first paragraph of every story but read just about any newspaper and you will find this to be more often the exception than the rule a reader must often wade through four of five paragraphs of anecdotal storytelling before getting to the fundamental facts of the news report the anecdote is typically an appeal to the reader s emotions particularly empathy or outrage that appeal belongs on the opinion pages or maybe the features section not on any straight news page just report the facts the use of adjectives and adverbs to qualify the facts is another tactic to bias readers it is a pervasive practice found in virtually all news media for example the los angeles times had a front page news story about trump remaining in the white house over the holidays in which the reporter described him as marooned and his statements as morose the story was accompanied with one of those stock photos of trump in which he appears to be petulantly pouting this isn t straight news reporting it is slanted news and aids and abets the war on truth just report the facts without hyperbole like walter cronkite did so diligently what can individuals do to end the war on truth well don t succumb to your own ideological prejudices don t spread untruths just because they support your beliefs before posting or sharing content on social media conduct sufficient research to determine its veracity don t be an easy mark for the forces of falsehood be a hard sell that requires prudent skepticism and sufficient sense to detect faulty logic and baseless claims it requires a certain level of intellectual sophistication typically acquired through education and diverse knowledge the sad reality is that the fundamental underlying division that foments the ideological and cultural discord in this country and fuels the war on truth is the division between people who think critically and those who do not stated more directly if not crassly it is the division between smart and stupid don t be stupid seek truth rather than belief randy alcorn is a santa barbara political observer contact him at randyaalcorn gmail com or click

apple issued a rare warning on wednesday that its revenue is about to fall below expectations and pointed to the ongoing trade tensions between the u s and china as one of the major reasons ceo tim cook said in a public letter to investors that the slowing sales would show up in the company s upcoming earnings report cook cited unexpected economic weakness in some emerging markets leading to fewer iphone upgrades than executives expected apple shares dropped about 7 percent after trading was temporarily halted ahead of the announcement cook said in an interview with cnbc that the weakness was especially apparent in china where traffic in retail stores and elsewhere had slowed with the broader chinese economy without naming president donald trump cook said that the administration s trade battles with china had played a role the trade tensions between the united states and china put additional pressure on their economy he told cnbc cook s letter said that apple now expected revenue of 84 billion for the most recent quarter that is down from guidance issued two months ago when the company forecast revenue from 89 billion to 93 billion there are signals that apple s smartphone related revenue is slowing elsewhere the letter said in some developed markets iphone upgrades also were not as strong as we thought they would be that s partly because consumers are getting fewer subsidies from carriers the letter said exclusive after cutting q1 expectations apple ceo tim cook tells cnbc that the shortfall is primarily in greater china as trade tensions put pressure on the chinese economy pic twitter com lm7wyp1vox cnbc now cnbcnow january 2 2019 apple rode the success of the iphone to become one of the world s most valuable publicly traded companies in august it become the first public u s company to be valued at 1 trillion while iphone sales still account for the vast majority of the company s revenue it has begun to focus on other products and its services business which includes the app store in search of growth apple has also signaled its intention to become a bigger part of the entertainment world having signed deals with oprah winfrey steven spielberg and kevin durant to make original content cook said there were things the company could do to boost iphone sales such as cutting the cost of battery replacements while the macroeconomic factors take their toll we re not going to sit around waiting for the macro to change he told cnbc i hope that it does and i m actually optimistic but we re going to focus really deeply on the things we can control any bets on how much the s p will be down tomorrow as this apple guidance gets priced in could be ugly neil irwin neil_irwin january 2 2019 cook s warning about the broader economic situation adds to growing concerns about a possible recession futures for u s stocks were down sharply after apple s announcement
when the market turns we re prepared to be more aggressive he said he added that he had sketched out a downturn list of 150 targets including financial tech cybersecurity and consumer internet companies in case they become cheaper the venture capitalist who manages a us714 million 1 billion fund tried to put some of that money into 12 tech startups last year but failed when they demanded too rich a price in some cases he said his offers to invest were outbid by as much as 40 per cent the only investment he led in 2018 was a usus360 million deal in outsystems a software company in atlanta letteri is one of a growing number of venture capitalists rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated startup scene for the past few years silicon valley tech startups have been awash in a stream of cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return later loading now some of these investors may get their wish for a market decline stocks tumbled late last year led by tech giants such as facebook and apple amid fears of slowing economic growth and a trade war with china and so far this year the stock market has swung wildly whipsawed by confusing signals including apple s disappointing iphone sales in china and american employers adding more jobs than expected last month while it takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out into the startup market many venture investors are already preparing for a downturn some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in in recent years will flee and they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last year we definitely want to take advantage of a market downturn said sandy miller a venture capitalist at ivp who projects that startup valuations will fall 10 to 40 per cent this year he said his silicon valley venture firm has set aside meaningful reserves to do more deals and to put more money into companies it has already invested in though he declined to specify an amount
the biggest risk may be that an external emergency a war a terrorist attack a financial crisis an immense natural disaster will arise by then it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead for the country s sake there is only one acceptable outcome just as there was after americans realised in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the oval office the president must go achieving this outcome won t be easy it will require honourable people who have served in the trump administration to share publicly what they have seen and what they believe at this point anonymous leaks are not sufficient it will require congressional republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man it will require democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help trump remain in office before we get to the how of trump s removal though i want to spend a little more time on the why because even talking about the ouster of an elected president should happen only under extreme circumstances unfortunately the country is so polarised that such talk instead occurs with every president both george w bush and barack obama were subjected to reckless calls for their impeachment from members of congress no less so let s be clear trump s ideology is not an impeachable offence however much you may disagree with trump s tax policy and i disagree vehemently it is not a reason to remove him from office nor are his efforts to cut government health insurance or to deport undocumented immigrants such issues among others are legitimate matters of democratic struggle to be decided by elections legislative debates protests and the other normal tools of democracy these issues are not the treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanours that the founders of the united states intended impeachment to address yet the founders also did not intend for the removal of a president to be impossible they insisted on including an impeachment clause in the constitution because they understood that an incompetent or corrupt person was nonetheless likely to attain high office every so often and they understood how much harm such a person could do the country needed a way to address what alexander hamilton called the abuse or violation of some public trust and james madison called the incapacity negligence or perfidy of a president his offences the negligence and perfidy of trump his high crimes and misdemeanours can be separated into four categories this list is conservative it does not include the possibility that his campaign coordinated strategy with russia which remains uncertain it also does not include his lazy approach to the job like his refusal to read briefing books or the many empty hours on his schedule it instead focuses on demonstrable ways that he has broken the law or violated his constitutional oath trump has used the presidency for personal enrichment regardless of party trump s predecessors took elaborate steps to separate their personal financial interests from their governing responsibilities they released their tax returns so that any potential conflicts would be public they placed their assets in a blind trust to avoid knowing how their policies might affect their own investments trump has instead treated the presidency as a branding opportunity he has continued to own and promote the trump organisation he has spent more than 200 days at one of his properties and billed taxpayers for hundreds of thousands of dollars if this pattern were merely petty corruption without damage to the national interest it might not warrant removal from office but trump s focus on personal profit certainly appears to be affecting policy most worrisome foreign officials and others have realised they can curry favour with the president by spending money at one of his properties saudi arabia has showered the trump organisation with business and trump has stood by the saudis despite their brutal war in yemen and their assassination of a prominent critic this example and many more flout article 1 of the constitution which bans federal office holders from accepting emoluments from any foreign country unless congress approves the arrangement madison when making the case for an impeachment clause spoke of a president who might betray his trust to foreign powers then of course there is russia even before robert mueller the special counsel completes his investigation the known facts are damning enough in at least one way trump lied to the american people during the 2016 campaign about business negotiations between his company and vladimir putin s government as president trump has taken steps in europe and syria that benefit putin to put it succinctly the president of the united states lied to the country about his commercial relationship with a hostile foreign government toward which he has a strangely accommodating policy combine trump s actions with his tolerance for unethical cabinet officials including ones who have made shady stock trades accepted lavish perks or used government to promote their own companies or those of their friends and the trump administration is almost certainly the most corrupt in american history it makes warren g harding s teapot dome scandal look like well a tempest in a teapot trump has violated campaign finance law a watergate grand jury famously described richard nixon as an unindicted co conspirator trump now has his own indictment tag individual 1 federal prosecutors in new york filed papers last month alleging that trump identified as individual 1 directed a criminal plan to evade campaign finance laws it happened during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign when he instructed his lawyer michael cohen to pay a combined us280 000 392 000 in hush money to two women with whom trump evidently had affairs trump and his campaign did not disclose these payments as required by law in the two years since trump has lied publicly about them initially saying he did not know about the payments only to change his story later it s worth acknowledging that most campaign finance violations do not warrant removal from office but these payments were not most campaign finance violations they involved large secret payoffs in the final weeks of a presidential campaign that prosecutors said deceived the voting public the seriousness of the deception is presumably the reason prosecutors filed criminal charges against cohen rather than the more common penalty of civil fines for campaign finance violations what should happen to a president who won office with help from criminal behaviour the founders specifically considered this possibility during their debates at the constitutional convention the most direct answer came from george mason a president who practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance should be subject to impeachment trump has obstructed justice whatever mueller ultimately reveals about the relationship between the trump campaign and russia trump has obstructed justice to keep mueller and others from getting to the truth again and again trump has interfered with the investigation in ways that may violate the law and clearly do violate decades old standards of presidential conduct he pressured james comey then the fbi director to let up on the russia investigation as a political favour when comey refused trump fired him trump also repeatedly pressured jeff sessions the attorney general to halt the investigation and ultimately forced sessions to resign for not doing so trump has also publicly hounded several of the government s top experts on russian organised crime including andrew mccabe and bruce orr and trump has repeatedly lied to the american people he has claimed outrageously that the justice department tells witnesses to lie in exchange for leniency he has rejected with no factual basis the findings of multiple intelligence agencies about russia s role in the 2016 campaign he reportedly helped his son donald trump jr draft a false statement about a 2016 meeting with a russian lawyer obstruction of justice is certainly grounds for the removal of a president it was the subject of the first nixon article of impeachment passed by the house judiciary committee among other things that article accused him of making false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the united states trump has subverted democracy the constitution that trump swore to uphold revolves around checks and balances it depends on the idea that the president is not a monarch he is a citizen to whom like all other citizens the country s laws apply trump rejects this principle he has instead tried to undermine the credibility of any independent source of power or information that does not serve his interests it s much more than just the russia investigation he has tried to delegitimise federal judges based on their ethnicity or on the president who appointed them drawing a rare rebuke from chief justice john roberts trump has criticised the justice department for indicting republican politicians during an election year he has called for comey hillary clinton and other political opponents to be jailed trump has described journalists as the enemy of the people an insult usually levelled by autocrats he has rejected basic factual findings from the cia the congressional budget office research scientists and others he has told bald lies about election fraud individually these sins may not seem to deserve removal from office collectively though they exact a terrible toll on american society they cause people to lose the faith on which a democracy depends faith in elections in the justice system in the basic notion of truth no other president since nixon has engaged in behaviour remotely like trump s to accept it without sanction is ultimately to endorse it unpleasant though it is to remove a president the costs and the risks of a continued trump presidency are worse what now the most relevant precedent for the removal of trump is nixon the only american president to be forced from office because of his conduct and two aspects of nixon s departure tend to get overlooked today one he was never impeached two most republicans both voters and elites stuck by him until almost the very end his approval rating among republicans was still about 50 per cent when realising in the summer of 1974 that he was doomed he resigned the current political dynamics have some similarities whether the house of representatives under democratic control impeaches trump is not the big question the question is whether he loses the support of a meaningful slice of republicans i know that many of trump s critics have given up hoping that he ever will they assume that republican senators will go on occasionally criticising him without confronting him but it is a mistake to give up the stakes are too large and the chances of success are too real consider the following descriptions of trump terribly unfit erratic reckless impetuous unstable a pathological liar dangerous to a democracy a concern to anyone who cares about our nation every one of these descriptions comes from a republican member of congress or of trump s own administration they know they know he is unfit for office they do not need to be convinced of the truth they need to be persuaded to act on it democrats won t persuade them by impeaching trump doing so would probably rally the president s supporters it would shift the focus from trump s behaviour toward a group of democratic leaders whom republicans are never going to like a smarter approach is a series of sober minded hearings to highlight trump s misconduct democrats should focus on easily understandable issues most likely to bother trump s supporters like corruption if this approach works at all or if mueller s findings shift opinion or if a separate problem arises like the economy trump s republican allies will find themselves in a very difficult spot at his current approval rating of about 40 per cent republicans were thumped in the midterms were his rating to fall further a significant number of congressional republicans would be facing long re election odds in 2020 the recent criticism from mitt romney who alternates between critical and sycophantic depending on his own political interests is another sign of trump s weakness finally there is the hope naive though it may seem that some republicans will choose to act on principle there now exists a small club of former trump administration officials who were widely respected before joining the administration and whom trump has sullied to greater or lesser degrees it includes rex tillerson gary cohn hr mcmaster and jim mattis imagine if one of them gave a television interview and told the truth about trump doing so would be a service to their country at a time of national need it would be an illustration of duty throughout his career trump has worked hard to invent his own reality and largely succeeded it has made him very rich and against all odds elected him president but whatever happens in 2019 his false version of reality will not survive history just as nixon s did not which side of that history do today s republicans want to be on
oil prices fell slightly on thursday amid volatile currency and stock markets coupled with concerns that an economic slowdown in 2019 will curb fuel demand just as crude supplies are surging markets were buffeted by a 4 4 percent slump in the u s dollar and after tech giant apple cut its sales forecast for the first time in nearly 12 years the slowdown in china and turmoil in stock and currency markets appears to be making investors nervous including in oil markets this is a continuation of the volatility afflicting commodities and oil with the last 24 hours marked by the release of various weak economic data points for major economies said consultancy jbc energy top exporter saudi arabia is expected to cut february prices for heavier crude grades sold to asia by up to 50 cents a barrel due to weaker fuel oil margins respondents to a reuters survey said on thursday fears of future economic and earnings growth continue to be the main driver in causing market jitters singapore based brokerage phillip futures said oil markets are also under pressure from a surge in supply just as demand growth is expected to slow u s crude production stood at a record 11 7 million barrels per day in late 2018 making america the world s biggest oil producer speaking to reporters on wednesday president donald trump said u s pressure had kept production high among allies in the organization of the petroleum exporting countries people see that gasoline is way down and the reason it s way down is because i called up some of the opec people trump said i made calls i said you better let that oil that gasoline flow and they did trump added others are not sitting idle with russian output reaching a record of more than 11 million bpd in 2018 supply from iraq the second biggest producer in opec is also up with december exports at 3 73 million bpd versus 3 37 million bpd in november
the health of the chinese economy is becoming a big worry for some international firms buffeted by the ongoing trade war between beijing and washington not to mention an already anticipated slowdown in domestic growth engines the world s second largest economy has drawn negative commentary out of sectors ranging from consumer technology to autos on wednesday apple ceo tim cook cut his company s revenue forecast laying some of the blame on falling sales in china and the trade war that has levied high tariffs over the last several months across hundreds of different products and commodities sold between the world s two largest economies stocks in asia traded mostly lower on thursday and u s futures pointed to another volatile session for wall street following cook s comments china sales growth slows as the trade war tariffs continue to take their toll despite an agreement between president donald trump and his chinese counterpart president xi jinping not to apply any new levies during a 90 day negotiation period there are plenty of signs that china s growth is slowing the chinese academy of social sciences a government led think tank recently cut its growth estimate for china s economy from 6 5 percent this year to 6 3 percent while that seems like a small difference it signifies a big drop in consumer spending when spread out over the country s 1 4 billion people we did not foresee the magnitude of the economic deceleration particularly in greater china cook said in a letter to shareholders wednesday although apple has faced significant pressures in china since before the trade war kicked off cook told cnbc it s clear that the economy began to slow there for the second half and what i believe to be the case is the trade tensions between the united states and china put additional pressure on their economy it s a big market intel chief financial officer and interim chief executive officer bob swan said on an earnings call in october that china is a big market for us adding that the company was working with customers and suppliers to adapt to any new tariffs it s going to be a wait and see as we go into 2019 he said hp ceo dion weisler told investors in november that china was a very strategically important market for us we obviously continue to assess the situation and the potential impact on our business and our plans that we may or may not need to make as a result but again we re not chasing ghosts but we re also not sticking our heads in the sand either he said of the trade war the tariffs have already cost u s automakers especially ford whose ceo jim hackett complained earlier this year that the tax penalties on steel and aluminum were costing it 1 billion last year alone that pain has been exacerbated by a slowdown in car sales in china in recent months auto sales there fell 14 percent in november over the same month in 2017 according to the chinese association of automobile manufacturers ford s sales in china fell more than 30 percent during the first 11 months last year compared with the same time frame in 2017 in november ford s china sales fell more than 50 percent over the same month in the prior year this is the first sustained downturn in memory said michael dunne ceo of zozogo a firm that advises automakers on doing business in china we would have to go back to the asian financial crisis in 1998 1999 to see the last time china had flat or down sales for four months or more in a row tesla meanwhile is speeding up construction of a factory outside of shanghai and has cut prices on some of its models in china to try to offset the trade war s impact on sales there the company said it was operating at a 55 to 60 percent cost disadvantage to local manufacturers in the country wells fargo analyst ike boruchow told investors wednesday there are high levels of uncertainty around potential new tariffs in 2019 raising fears that the rhetoric between the two governments will lead to a backlash against american brands that operate in china this has already played out between china and canada chinese consumers were reportedly boycotting the canada goose brand due to the recent tension between the two countries chinese tourists retailers are getting hit particularly hard on china related news even if the impact hasn t quite hit their bottom line tiffany s shares fell 9 6 percent on nov 28 after the

win with the consumer in china lululemon starbucks and other retailers have fared better by partnering with local companies in china china is also the world s fastest growing aviation market and a slowdown would hurt aircraft manufacturers and carriers although it hasn t affected them so far the international air transport association an industry group representing commercial airlines around the globe has said it expects china to overtake the u s as the largest aviation market in the world by 2022 so far the industry mood has been upbeat in september boeing the world s largest commercial aircraft manufacturer raised its estimate for the number of planes china will need through 2037 by 6 percent to nearly 7 700 planes worth some 1 2 trillion luxury products luxury retail and product

weeks of a presidential campaign that prosecutors said deceived the voting public the seriousness of the deception is presumably the reason prosecutors filed criminal charges against cohen rather than the more common penalty of civil fines for campaign finance violations what should happen to a president who won office with help from criminal behaviour the founders specifically considered this possibility during their debates at the constitutional convention the most direct answer came from george mason a president who practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance should be subject to impeachment trump has obstructed justice whatever mueller ultimately reveals about the relationship between the trump campaign and russia trump has obstructed justice to keep mueller and others from getting to the truth again and again trump has interfered with the investigation in ways that may violate the law and clearly do violate decades old standards of presidential conduct he pressured james comey then the fbi director to let up on the russia investigation as a political favour when comey refused trump fired him trump also repeatedly pressured jeff sessions the attorney general to halt the investigation and ultimately forced sessions to resign for not doing so trump has also publicly hounded several of the government s top experts on russian organised crime including andrew mccabe and bruce orr and trump has repeatedly lied to the american people he has claimed outrageously that the justice department tells witnesses to lie in exchange for leniency he has rejected with no factual basis the findings of multiple intelligence agencies about russia s role in the 2016 campaign he reportedly helped his son donald trump jr draft a false statement about a 2016 meeting with a russian lawyer obstruction of justice is certainly grounds for the removal of a president it was the subject of the first nixon article of impeachment passed by the house judiciary committee among other things that article accused him of making false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the united states trump has subverted democracy the constitution that trump swore to uphold revolves around checks and balances it depends on the idea that the president is not a monarch he is a citizen to whom like all other citizens the country s laws apply trump rejects this principle he has instead tried to undermine the credibility of any independent source of power or information that does not serve his interests it s much more than just the russia investigation he has tried to delegitimise federal judges based on their ethnicity or on the president who appointed them drawing a rare rebuke from chief justice john roberts trump has criticised the justice department for indicting republican politicians during an election year he has called for comey hillary clinton and other political opponents to be jailed trump has described journalists as the enemy of the people an insult usually levelled by autocrats he has rejected basic factual findings from the cia the congressional budget office research scientists and others he has told bald lies about election fraud individually these sins may not seem to deserve removal from office collectively though they exact a terrible toll on american society they cause people to lose the faith on which a democracy depends faith in elections in the justice system in the basic notion of truth no other president since nixon has engaged in behaviour remotely like trump s to accept it without sanction is ultimately to endorse it unpleasant though it is to remove a president the costs and the risks of a continued trump presidency are worse what now the most relevant precedent for the removal of trump is nixon the only american president to be forced from office because of his conduct and two aspects of nixon s departure tend to get overlooked today one he was never impeached two most republicans both voters and elites stuck by him until almost the very end his approval rating among republicans was still about 50 per cent when realising in the summer of 1974 that he was doomed he resigned the current political dynamics have some similarities whether the house of representatives under democratic control impeaches trump is not the big question the question is whether he loses the support of a meaningful slice of republicans i know that many of trump s critics have given up hoping that he ever will they assume that republican senators will go on occasionally criticising him without confronting him but it is a mistake to give up the stakes are too large and the chances of success are too real consider the following descriptions of trump terribly unfit erratic reckless impetuous unstable a pathological liar dangerous to a democracy a concern to anyone who cares about our nation every one of these descriptions comes from a republican member of congress or of trump s own administration they know they know he is unfit for office they do not need to be convinced of the truth they need to be persuaded to act on it democrats won t persuade them by impeaching trump doing so would probably rally the president s supporters it would shift the focus from trump s behaviour toward a group of democratic leaders whom republicans are never going to like a smarter approach is a series of sober minded hearings to highlight trump s misconduct democrats should focus on easily understandable issues most likely to bother trump s supporters like corruption if this approach works at all or if mueller s findings shift opinion or if a separate problem arises like the economy trump s republican allies will find themselves in a very difficult spot at his current approval rating of about 40 per cent republicans were thumped in the midterms were his rating to fall further a significant number of congressional republicans would be facing long re election odds in 2020 the recent criticism from mitt romney who alternates between critical and sycophantic depending on his own political interests is another sign of trump s weakness finally there is the hope naive though it may seem that some republicans will choose to act on principle there now exists a small club of former trump administration officials who were widely respected before joining the administration and whom trump has sullied to greater or lesser degrees it includes rex tillerson gary cohn hr mcmaster and jim mattis imagine if one of them gave a television interview and told the truth about trump doing so would be a service to their country at a time of national need it would be an illustration of duty throughout his career trump has worked hard to invent his own reality and largely succeeded it has made him very rich and against all odds elected him president but whatever happens in 2019 his false version of reality will not survive history just as nixon s did not which side of that history do today s republicans want to be on
when the market turns we re prepared to be more aggressive he said he added that he had sketched out a downturn list of 150 targets including financial tech cybersecurity and consumer internet companies in case they become cheaper the venture capitalist who manages a us714 million 1 billion fund tried to put some of that money into 12 tech startups last year but failed when they demanded too rich a price in some cases he said his offers to invest were outbid by as much as 40 per cent the only investment he led in 2018 was a usus360 million deal in outsystems a software company in atlanta letteri is one of a growing number of venture capitalists rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated startup scene for the past few years silicon valley tech startups have been awash in a stream of cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return later loading now some of these investors may get their wish for a market decline stocks tumbled late last year led by tech giants such as facebook and apple amid fears of slowing economic growth and a trade war with china and so far this year the stock market has swung wildly whipsawed by confusing signals including apple s disappointing iphone sales in china and american employers adding more jobs than expected last month while it takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out into the startup market many venture investors are already preparing for a downturn some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in in recent years will flee and they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last year we definitely want to take advantage of a market downturn said sandy miller a venture capitalist at ivp who projects that startup valuations will fall 10 to 40 per cent this year he said his silicon valley venture firm has set aside meaningful reserves to do more deals and to put more money into companies it has already invested in though he declined to specify an amount
arguably the bmw 1m is one of the most exciting m cars to emerge from garching since the early 2000s the super sporty 1m hasn t gained a cult cause of its limited run but mostly because of its story and driving dynamics the legend says that the 1m was never really on the bmw board s radar and it was born out of engineers desire to create a special baby m the legend goes even further saying that the codename for the 1m was pyrat since the m engineers loved this special spiced rum with the same name when looking at it on a spec sheet it seems a bit like a frankenstein car built from a mishmash of bmw parts bin bits so it doesn t seem like it d be any good but it s brilliant yours truly has owned one since 2011 and it s just as exciting today as it was seven years ago fast forward to 2015 and the 1m s successor was introduced under the name m2 while the new baby m was the better car and extremely fun to drive it was never a one to one replacement but rather another great m model with another character in 2018 bmw delivered another version of the m2 this time the m2 competition a car that uses the heart of the m3 m4 and therefore increases its driving capabilities and performance the choice between the two has always been a tough one on one hand you re getting a very limited and raw m car the 1m while on the other hand a more modern automobile with world class performance and driving thrills the m2 competition price wise the two are playing on the same field a used 1m can go above 60 000 mark while a decently equipped m2 competition is in the same range as well just this week bring a trailer posted a 1m listing with a price of 60 000 the car sold fairly quickly the 1m was finished in black sapphire metallic with a black boston leather trim under the hood the 1m had the n54 3 0 liter inline six twinturbo engine paired with the standard 6 speed manual transmission this car has been equipped with the dinan stage 2 ecu upgrade which is advertised to increase output by as much as 56 horsepower and 73 lb ft for a total of 391 horsepower and 443 lb ft of torque the carfax report indicates that the most recent service was performed in february 2017 at 10 943 miles the accident free carfax report shows registrations in connecticut and california in stock form the m2 competition is certainly going to be the faster car of the two it s more powerful making 405 hp and 406 lb ft of torque and it s faster getting to 60 mph in around 4 0 seconds but with the dinan power upgrade of the 1m the performance of the two might be similar for must buyers the choice basically comes down to this if you re going to drive this car everyday go to work in it pick up groceries in it and maybe even do the school run in it the bmw m2 competition is the better car if you re going to keep it as a weekend car and track toy driving it only when you want to properly drive the the bmw 1 series m is the car for you regardless of your choice both cars will put a smile on your face

there are many astounding geological formations in the world that are almost works of art some of the most remarkable natural formations in all of the asia pacific region are to be found in yehliu geological park taiwan which have been created by geological processes over many millennia the landscape is almost unearthly and this park is now increasingly popular with locals as well as foreigners yehliu geological park and its geology the yehliu peninsula is narrow juts out into the pacific and has been likened by locals to a turtle lying in the sea the area is mostly made up of sedimentary rock eroded for millennia by the water and wind which has resulted in yehliu having a variety of outstanding geological sculptures yehliu geopark aaron90311 adobe stock many of the soft sedimentary rocks have developed weathering rings exquisite brown ring patterns on exposed stones that resemble the work of a craftsperson and many outcrops have been weathered in such a way that they resemble honeycombs while the so called ginger boulders have a reddish hue due to weathering strange potholes and unusual rock formations grace the site and the twin caves known as the lover s cave are a popular attraction the park has the feeling of a different time set in a different world and has been liked to areas of the american badlands weird and wonderful sights at yehliu geological park the geological park is famous for its mushroom or hoodoo rock formations in other parts of the world they are typically composed of a hard rock cap that rests on a soft sedimentary pillar shaped into dramatic and wondrous shapes by years of erosion this is not the case in yehliu where a study has shown that they are composed of the same soft rock throughout honeycomb rock formation tanawatpontchour adobe stock these iconic rocks geological wonders without parallel in the asia pacific region stand on flat platforms of bedrock eroded by the wind and the waves while many of the formations do resemble mushrooms many have strikingly original characteristics and the more famous landmarks in the park have been named the queen s head looks like the profile of a woman and many have said it looks like queen elizabeth ii a rock that resembles a sea gull is known locally as the marine bird rock and not far off the coast is a formation that looks like an elephant wallowing in the waves there is also a lion s head a peanut a pearl and the japanese geisha girl legends of the park because of its strange rocks and other worldly landscape the area is the source of many local legends and delightful stories one story tells of a turtle elf that was behaving badly and terrorizing the local people the jade emperor decided to punish him by sending a fairy who badly wounded the turtle elf when local people see smoke or spray on the water they say it is the breath of the wounded turtle elf local people also pray for good luck to a rocky outcrop that looks very much like a dragon s head when passing history of yehliu geological park since the publication of a book of photographs by a famous asian photographer in recent years the geopark has become popular with visitors pearl shaped rock formation cedar adobe stock the taiwanese government granted the area the status of a national park in the 1980s but there are growing concerns that the activities of tourists are impacting negatively on the park as people touching the formations is speeding up the erosion process while the tourists are paying the yehliu geopark entrance fee which is helping to preserve the area they are also damaging the geological formations how to get to yehliu geological park the park is located in a somewhat remote area on the north coast of taiwan approximately 90 minutes from the capital taipei public transport is available and accommodation in the area is plentiful the popular yehliu ocean world is next to the park top image queen s head rock source hin255 adobe stock by ed whelan

the biggest risk may be that an external emergency a war a terrorist attack a financial crisis an immense natural disaster will arise by then it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead for the country s sake there is only one acceptable outcome just as there was after americans realised in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the oval office the president must go achieving this outcome won t be easy it will require honourable people who have served in the trump administration to share publicly what they have seen and what they believe at this point anonymous leaks are not sufficient it will require congressional republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man it will require democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help trump remain in office before we get to the how of trump s removal though i want to spend a little more time on the why because even talking about the ouster of an elected president should happen only under extreme circumstances unfortunately the country is so polarised that such talk instead occurs with every president both george w bush and barack obama were subjected to reckless calls for their impeachment from members of congress no less so let s be clear trump s ideology is not an impeachable offence however much you may disagree with trump s tax policy and i disagree vehemently it is not a reason to remove him from office nor are his efforts to cut government health insurance or to deport undocumented immigrants such issues among others are legitimate matters of democratic struggle to be decided by elections legislative debates protests and the other normal tools of democracy these issues are not the treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanours that the founders of the united states intended impeachment to address yet the founders also did not intend for the removal of a president to be impossible they insisted on including an impeachment clause in the constitution because they understood that an incompetent or corrupt person was nonetheless likely to attain high office every so often and they understood how much harm such a person could do the country needed a way to address what alexander hamilton called the abuse or violation of some public trust and james madison called the incapacity negligence or perfidy of a president his offences the negligence and perfidy of trump his high crimes and misdemeanours can be separated into four categories this list is conservative it does not include the possibility that his campaign coordinated strategy with russia which remains uncertain it also does not include his lazy approach to the job like his refusal to read briefing books or the many empty hours on his schedule it instead focuses on demonstrable ways that he has broken the law or violated his constitutional oath trump has used the presidency for personal enrichment regardless of party trump s predecessors took elaborate steps to separate their personal financial interests from their governing responsibilities they released their tax returns so that any potential conflicts would be public they placed their assets in a blind trust to avoid knowing how their policies might affect their own investments trump has instead treated the presidency as a branding opportunity he has continued to own and promote the trump organisation he has spent more than 200 days at one of his properties and billed taxpayers for hundreds of thousands of dollars if this pattern were merely petty corruption without damage to the national interest it might not warrant removal from office but trump s focus on personal profit certainly appears to be affecting policy most worrisome foreign officials and others have realised they can curry favour with the president by spending money at one of his properties saudi arabia has showered the trump organisation with business and trump has stood by the saudis despite their brutal war in yemen and their assassination of a prominent critic this example and many more flout article 1 of the constitution which bans federal office holders from accepting emoluments from any foreign country unless congress approves the arrangement madison when making the case for an impeachment clause spoke of a president who might betray his trust to foreign powers then of course there is russia even before robert mueller the special counsel completes his investigation the known facts are damning enough in at least one way trump lied to the american people during the 2016 campaign about business negotiations between his company and vladimir putin s government as president trump has taken steps in europe and syria that benefit putin to put it succinctly the president of the united states lied to the country about his commercial relationship with a hostile foreign government toward which he has a strangely accommodating policy combine trump s actions with his tolerance for unethical cabinet officials including ones who have made shady stock trades accepted lavish perks or used government to promote their own companies or those of their friends and the trump administration is almost certainly the most corrupt in american history it makes warren g harding s teapot dome scandal look like well a tempest in a teapot trump has violated campaign finance law a watergate grand jury famously described richard nixon as an unindicted co conspirator trump now has his own indictment tag individual 1 federal prosecutors in new york filed papers last month alleging that trump identified as individual 1 directed a criminal plan to evade campaign finance laws it happened during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign when he instructed his lawyer michael cohen to pay a combined us280 000 392 000 in hush money to two women with whom trump evidently had affairs trump and his campaign did not disclose these payments as required by law in the two years since trump has lied publicly about them initially saying he did not know about the payments only to change his story later it s worth acknowledging that most campaign finance violations do not warrant removal from office but these payments were not most campaign finance violations they involved large secret payoffs in the final weeks of a presidential campaign that prosecutors said deceived the voting public the seriousness of the deception is presumably the reason prosecutors filed criminal charges against cohen rather than the more common penalty of civil fines for campaign finance violations what should happen to a president who won office with help from criminal behaviour the founders specifically considered this possibility during their debates at the constitutional convention the most direct answer came from george mason a president who practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance should be subject to impeachment trump has obstructed justice whatever mueller ultimately reveals about the relationship between the trump campaign and russia trump has obstructed justice to keep mueller and others from getting to the truth again and again trump has interfered with the investigation in ways that may violate the law and clearly do violate decades old standards of presidential conduct he pressured james comey then the fbi director to let up on the russia investigation as a political favour when comey refused trump fired him trump also repeatedly pressured jeff sessions the attorney general to halt the investigation and ultimately forced sessions to resign for not doing so trump has also publicly hounded several of the government s top experts on russian organised crime including andrew mccabe and bruce orr and trump has repeatedly lied to the american people he has claimed outrageously that the justice department tells witnesses to lie in exchange for leniency he has rejected with no factual basis the findings of multiple intelligence agencies about russia s role in the 2016 campaign he reportedly helped his son donald trump jr draft a

dominic lawson i m fat because i m a glutton if i can face up to it why can t doctors royal college of physicians president zandrew goddard above insists that obesity is not a lifestyle choice caused by individual greed well that s bad news to start the new year according to the royal college of physicians i am suffering from a chronic disease it comes as a particular shock because i feel perfectly fine indeed friends staying with us over the weekend commented on how well i was looking and they know me enough not to be insincerely polite but what is my disease according to the professional association of the nation s doctors it is that i am on the official definition obese it is obesity which they have said should be reclassified as a chronic disease rather than as a lifestyle choice admittedly i am only just in this category at 5ft 10in 1 78m and weighing 15st 95kg i have a body mass index of 30 05 and 30 plus is the level defined as obese one category up from overweight so what are the causes of my alleged chronic disease according to the rcp s president professor andrew goddard they are health inequalities genetic influences and social factors greedy the first of these is his way of noting that in britain today obesity is much more prevalent among less well off families but that hardly describes my background so does that mean my narrowly defined obesity fails to qualify as a disease as for genetic influences i m not sure what the prof is trying to say true there are examples of obesity in the male line of my family my paternal great grandfather gustav died on the operating table because he was too fat there i ve used the unmentionable word for the surgeons to operate on successfully and when he was chancellor of the exchequer my father nigel was mercilessly caricatured for his corpulence but after leaving full time politics he decided to lose weight and did so to remarkable effect even explaining how in the nigel lawson diet book nigella lawson whose career is a homage to the joy of eating well the point is neither he nor i would have thought obesity was some sort of genetic affliction like cystic fibrosis or sickle cell anaemia those suffering from such genuine chronic diseases have no control over their conditions which do not result from any choices they exercise yet professor goddard insists that obesity is not a lifestyle choice caused by individual greed well it absolutely is in my case and i guarantee millions of others i am greedy gluttonous in fact i adore consuming good food and plan my week as much around the meals i propose to enjoy as around my work indeed i staunchly if self servingly defend the journalistic requirement for these two elements to converge contacts will talk more freely over a bottle of wine and a generous lunch but while this may mark me down as a food obsessive i share this with my sister nigella whose career is a homage to the joy of eating well it s absurd to suggest this means we have as a family some disease of genetic origin a much needed corrective to this notion is to be published in the uk this week conquering fat logic the english translation of a book by a german behavioural therapist with a background in nutritional science nadja hermann she recounts how her family had been through generations not just obese but morbidly so she herself weighed 23st 8lb 150kg at the age of 30 but she has since lost 13 stone hermann writes genes create a basic situation but they don t oblige anyone to be fat several studies have shown that the carriers of so called obesity genes have no differences in their metabolic rates to say that some children have a genetic propensity towards obesity means only that they have an inherently larger appetite than naturally slim children who feel hungry less often hermann also points out that those people who say they have restricted their eating to 1 200 calories a day but still can t lose weight are deluding themselves a study carried out in 1992 investigated people described as diet resistant these people claimed not to be able to lose weight despite restricting their calorie intake to fewer than 1 200 kcal a day but it turned out that in their nutritional journals they underestimated their average calorie intake by 47 per cent and overestimated their physical activity by 51 per cent the hard truth is that anyone who believes they don t actually eat that much then still inexplicably puts on weight doesn t have a problem with their metabolism but with their perception of their own eating habits willpower there is no doubt that it requires a great deal of willpower to stick to a diet especially when it involves giving up favourite foods but if we tell everyone who is vastly overweight that their extreme obesity is a disease it can only increase their sense of hopelessness and their refusing to admit that overeating is a choice rather than ineluctable fate yet professor goddard insists in promoting the idea that obesity is a disease rather than a choice it is important that we remove the stigma associated with obesity in fact it is the absence of any stigma that makes extreme and morbid obesity more prevalent nadja hermann writes that no one pointed out how overweight she was when she was at her scales smashing heaviest but when she began losing lots of weight people were much more likely to question her behaviour nadja hermann a german behavioural therapist with a background in nutritional science has lost 13 stone in weight when i was sick and almost bedridden at 150kg no one expressed concern or commented on my weight and then when i lost 40kg people started to get worried about my health why is it so socially acceptable to criticise someone for losing weight i suspect this is more of a female issue when a fat woman loses weight it is resented by other women in her circle who liked very much being thinner than their morbidly obese friend and her weight loss will be even more resented by those of her fat acquaintances who are intimidated by a display of resolve that they feel unable or unwilling to emulate it is important to distinguish between obesity which apparently is my chronic disease and morbid obesity if i were to fall into this latter bmi category my weight would need to spiral to at least 20st or more than 127kg that would truly be unhealthy and almost certainly shorten my life as the term morbid indicates but despite the near hysteria in political circles about the obesity crisis official figures suggest that barely 3 per cent of the adult population is morbidly obese and it is not their great fatness that is a disease but conditions which might be a result of it such as kidney failure and type 2 diabetes robust for those many millions who are merely overweight there is no medical issue whatsoever still less should they be described as suffering from a chronic disease if anything they are the lucky ones in 2011 the respected u s publication nutrition journal following a survey of 350 000 randomly selected americans concluded that overweight people live longer on average and those who are actually obese in old age tend to live longer than those of their contemporaries who are thin these obese elderly were also said the researchers from california university more likely to survive certain dangerous medical conditions such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes the lead researcher for the survey dr linda bacon concluded it is overwhelmingly apparent that fat has been highly exaggerated as a risk for disease or decreased longevity i found this most reassuring obviously it also made sense to me when we are seriously ill we tend to lose great amounts of weight that happened to me some years ago when i recently saw a photo of myself at the time i was appalled by how scrawny i looked yet that was probably the only time since my 20s in which my bmi index was anywhere near the level categorised as normal now on the borderline between overweight and obese i am in robust good health and frankly i resent being told by the president of the royal college of physicians that i am suffering from a chronic disease physician heal thyself i m fat as a fiddle

chemotherapy has side effects such as nausea and vomiting and onset of stomatitis but peripheral neuropathy is also a serious side effect peripheral neuropathy is known to be markedly expressed in major drugs of cancer chemotherapy such as plant alkaloid drugs and platinum based drugs 2 folfox therapy including oxaliplatin is a combination of a chemotherapy for advanced and recurrent cancer and a typical anticancer drug for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy as a treatment for colorectal cancer which is difficult to heal surgically almost all patients 85 95 of oxaliplatin prescribed patients develop peripheral nerve disorder and the disorder brings about the following symptoms 2 acute symptoms abnormal sensations such as hands feet and lip peripheral parts strangulation of pharyngeal larynx accompanied with dyspnea and dysphagia chronic symptoms numbness in the periphery of the limbs decreased sensation decreased tendon reflexes sensory ataxia when such side effects occur it is considered that some symptom improvement is seen in 80 of patients due to discontinuation of medicine and completely recovered in 6 to 8 months in 40 of cases 2 however discontinuation of the drug results in discontinuation of cancer treatment or change in treatment regimen which is an important medical issue there is currently no approved drug to prevent or treat cipn 1 mfolfox6

against the nerve damage that can occur in conjunction with chemotherapy treatment the results from a completed phase iib trial pliant where patients with metastatic colorectal cancer were treated with the chemotherapy combination folfox and pledox indicates that the patients who received pledox had a lower risk than the placebo group to suffer from nerve damage during the chemotherapy the presence of the investigator reported sensory nerve damage the primary endpoint was after treatment 38 lower in the group of patients treated with pledox compared with the placebo group p 0 16 this was not statistically significant but a difference of this magnitude is considered to be clinically relevant after completion of chemotherapy the patient reported incidence of moderate and severe neuropathy was 77 lower in patients treated with pledox compared to the placebo group exploratory analysis p 0 014 this is considered valuable for the success of the forthcoming polar studies where

when the market turns we re prepared to be more aggressive he said he added that he had sketched out a downturn list of 150 targets including financial tech cybersecurity and consumer internet companies in case they become cheaper the venture capitalist who manages a us714 million 1 billion fund tried to put some of that money into 12 tech startups last year but failed when they demanded too rich a price in some cases he said his offers to invest were outbid by as much as 40 per cent the only investment he led in 2018 was a usus360 million deal in outsystems a software company in atlanta letteri is one of a growing number of venture capitalists rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated startup scene for the past few years silicon valley tech startups have been awash in a stream of cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return later loading now some of these investors may get their wish for a market decline stocks tumbled late last year led by tech giants such as facebook and apple amid fears of slowing economic growth and a trade war with china and so far this year the stock market has swung wildly whipsawed by confusing signals including apple s disappointing iphone sales in china and american employers adding more jobs than expected last month while it takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out into the startup market many venture investors are already preparing for a downturn some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in in recent years will flee and they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last year we definitely want to take advantage of a market downturn said sandy miller a venture capitalist at ivp who projects that startup valuations will fall 10 to 40 per cent this year he said his silicon valley venture firm has set aside meaningful reserves to do more deals and to put more money into companies it has already invested in though he declined to specify an amount
the biggest risk may be that an external emergency a war a terrorist attack a financial crisis an immense natural disaster will arise by then it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead for the country s sake there is only one acceptable outcome just as there was after americans realised in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the oval office the president must go achieving this outcome won t be easy it will require honourable people who have served in the trump administration to share publicly what they have seen and what they believe at this point anonymous leaks are not sufficient it will require congressional republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man it will require democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help trump remain in office before we get to the how of trump s removal though i want to spend a little more time on the why because even talking about the ouster of an elected president should happen only under extreme circumstances unfortunately the country is so polarised that such talk instead occurs with every president both george w bush and barack obama were subjected to reckless calls for their impeachment from members of congress no less so let s be clear trump s ideology is not an impeachable offence however much you may disagree with trump s tax policy and i disagree vehemently it is not a reason to remove him from office nor are his efforts to cut government health insurance or to deport undocumented immigrants such issues among others are legitimate matters of democratic struggle to be decided by elections legislative debates protests and the other normal tools of democracy these issues are not the treason bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanours that the founders of the united states intended impeachment to address yet the founders also did not intend for the removal of a president to be impossible they insisted on including an impeachment clause in the constitution because they understood that an incompetent or corrupt person was nonetheless likely to attain high office every so often and they understood how much harm such a person could do the country needed a way to address what alexander hamilton called the abuse or violation of some public trust and james madison called the incapacity negligence or perfidy of a president his offences the negligence and perfidy of trump his high crimes and misdemeanours can be separated into four categories this list is conservative it does not include the possibility that his campaign coordinated strategy with russia which remains uncertain it also does not include his lazy approach to the job like his refusal to read briefing books or the many empty hours on his schedule it instead focuses on demonstrable ways that he has broken the law or violated his constitutional oath trump has used the presidency for personal enrichment regardless of party trump s predecessors took elaborate steps to separate their personal financial interests from their governing responsibilities they released their tax returns so that any potential conflicts would be public they placed their assets in a blind trust to avoid knowing how their policies might affect their own investments trump has instead treated the presidency as a branding opportunity he has continued to own and promote the trump organisation he has spent more than 200 days at one of his properties and billed taxpayers for hundreds of thousands of dollars if this pattern were merely petty corruption without damage to the national interest it might not warrant removal from office but trump s focus on personal profit certainly appears to be affecting policy most worrisome foreign officials and others have realised they can curry favour with the president by spending money at one of his properties saudi arabia has showered the trump organisation with business and trump has stood by the saudis despite their brutal war in yemen and their assassination of a prominent critic this example and many more flout article 1 of the constitution which bans federal office holders from accepting emoluments from any foreign country unless congress approves the arrangement madison when making the case for an impeachment clause spoke of a president who might betray his trust to foreign powers then of course there is russia even before robert mueller the special counsel completes his investigation the known facts are damning enough in at least one way trump lied to the american people during the 2016 campaign about business negotiations between his company and vladimir putin s government as president trump has taken steps in europe and syria that benefit putin to put it succinctly the president of the united states lied to the country about his commercial relationship with a hostile foreign government toward which he has a strangely accommodating policy combine trump s actions with his tolerance for unethical cabinet officials including ones who have made shady stock trades accepted lavish perks or used government to promote their own companies or those of their friends and the trump administration is almost certainly the most corrupt in american history it makes warren g harding s teapot dome scandal look like well a tempest in a teapot trump has violated campaign finance law a watergate grand jury famously described richard nixon as an unindicted co conspirator trump now has his own indictment tag individual 1 federal prosecutors in new york filed papers last month alleging that trump identified as individual 1 directed a criminal plan to evade campaign finance laws it happened during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign when he instructed his lawyer michael cohen to pay a combined us280 000 392 000 in hush money to two women with whom trump evidently had affairs trump and his campaign did not disclose these payments as required by law in the two years since trump has lied publicly about them initially saying he did not know about the payments only to change his story later it s worth acknowledging that most campaign finance violations do not warrant removal from office but these payments were not most campaign finance violations they involved large secret payoffs in the final weeks of a presidential campaign that prosecutors said deceived the voting public the seriousness of the deception is presumably the reason prosecutors filed criminal charges against cohen rather than the more common penalty of civil fines for campaign finance violations what should happen to a president who won office with help from criminal behaviour the founders specifically considered this possibility during their debates at the constitutional convention the most direct answer came from george mason a president who practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance should be subject to impeachment trump has obstructed justice whatever mueller ultimately reveals about the relationship between the trump campaign and russia trump has obstructed justice to keep mueller and others from getting to the truth again and again trump has interfered with the investigation in ways that may violate the law and clearly do violate decades old standards of presidential conduct he pressured james comey then the fbi director to let up on the russia investigation as a political favour when comey refused trump fired him trump also repeatedly pressured jeff sessions the attorney general to halt the investigation and ultimately forced sessions to resign for not doing so trump has also publicly hounded several of the government s top experts on russian organised crime including andrew mccabe and bruce orr and trump has repeatedly lied to the american people he has claimed outrageously that the justice department tells witnesses to lie in exchange for leniency he has rejected with no factual basis the findings of multiple intelligence agencies about russia s role in the 2016 campaign he reportedly helped his son donald trump jr draft a false statement about a 2016 meeting with a russian lawyer obstruction of justice is certainly grounds for the removal of a president it was the subject of the first nixon article of impeachment passed by the house judiciary committee among other things that article accused him of making false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the united states trump has subverted democracy the constitution that trump swore to uphold revolves around checks and balances it depends on the idea that the president is not a monarch he is a citizen to whom like all other citizens the country s laws apply trump rejects this principle he has instead tried to undermine the credibility of any independent source of power or information that does not serve his interests it s much more than just the russia investigation he has tried to delegitimise federal judges based on their ethnicity or on the president who appointed them drawing a rare rebuke from chief justice john roberts trump has criticised the justice department for indicting republican politicians during an election year he has called for comey hillary clinton and other political opponents to be jailed trump has described journalists as the enemy of the people an insult usually levelled by autocrats he has rejected basic factual findings from the cia the congressional budget office research scientists and others he has told bald lies about election fraud individually these sins may not seem to deserve removal from office collectively though they exact a terrible toll on american society they cause people to lose the faith on which a democracy depends faith in elections in the justice system in the basic notion of truth no other president since nixon has engaged in behaviour remotely like trump s to accept it without sanction is ultimately to endorse it unpleasant though it is to remove a president the costs and the risks of a continued trump presidency are worse what now the most relevant precedent for the removal of trump is nixon the only american president to be forced from office because of his conduct and two aspects of nixon s departure tend to get overlooked today one he was never impeached two most republicans both voters and elites stuck by him until almost the very end his approval rating among republicans was still about 50 per cent when realising in the summer of 1974 that he was doomed he resigned the current political dynamics have some similarities whether the house of representatives under democratic control impeaches trump is not the big question the question is whether he loses the support of a meaningful slice of republicans i know that many of trump s critics have given up hoping that he ever will they assume that republican senators will go on occasionally criticising him without confronting him but it is a mistake to give up the stakes are too large and the chances of success are too real consider the following descriptions of trump terribly unfit erratic reckless impetuous unstable a pathological liar dangerous to a democracy a concern to anyone who cares about our nation every one of these descriptions comes from a republican member of congress or of trump s own administration they know they know he is unfit for office they do not need to be convinced of the truth they need to be persuaded to act on it democrats won t persuade them by impeaching trump doing so would probably rally the president s supporters it would shift the focus from trump s behaviour toward a group of democratic leaders whom republicans are never going to like a smarter approach is a series of sober minded hearings to highlight trump s misconduct democrats should focus on easily understandable issues most likely to bother trump s supporters like corruption if this approach works at all or if mueller s findings shift opinion or if a separate problem arises like the economy trump s republican allies will find themselves in a very difficult spot at his current approval rating of about 40 per cent republicans were thumped in the midterms were his rating to fall further a significant number of congressional republicans would be facing long re election odds in 2020 the recent criticism from mitt romney who alternates between critical and sycophantic depending on his own political interests is another sign of trump s weakness finally there is the hope naive though it may seem that some republicans will choose to act on principle there now exists a small club of former trump administration officials who were widely respected before joining the administration and whom trump has sullied to greater or lesser degrees it includes rex tillerson gary cohn hr mcmaster and jim mattis imagine if one of them gave a television interview and told the truth about trump doing so would be a service to their country at a time of national need it would be an illustration of duty throughout his career trump has worked hard to invent his own reality and largely succeeded it has made him very rich and against all odds elected him president but whatever happens in 2019 his false version of reality will not survive history just as nixon s did not which side of that history do today s republicans want to be on

chinese president xi jinping issued his latest threat to taiwan during what the bbc artfully calls a speech marking 40 years since the start of improving ties between the communist ruled mainland and the republic of china roc on taiwan xi exhorted taiwanese to accept that they must and will be unified with the mainland sheesh if forty years of improving ties culminate in threats to wipe out your negotiating partner s political existence i d shudder to think how forty years of deteriorating ties across the taiwan strait would have turned out but xi s remarks do warrant taking stock of taiwan s defense afresh to measure the adequacy of taiwan s defense first survey its overall strategic posture and then the state of its land air and sea power if the roc armed forces are sufficient to discharge the tasks entrusted to them by the political leadership in taipei then the island is in sound shape to uphold its independence if taipei has assigned the military more to do than it can reasonably do then trouble looms missions must be cut or capabilities expanded until ends and means are in sync first strategy few and by few i mean no nations boast the diplomatic economic and military resources and political artistry to get everything they want that being the case they survey the surroundings and devise a strategy for a world of many goals and scarce resources at its most fundamental strategy is the art and science of setting and enforcing priorities among things or purposes the nation values and apportioning resources to attain the priorities it cherishes most you can t have it all the republic of china an island state under the shadow of a continental giant bent on absorbing it by means peaceful or violent must be more ruthless with itself than most when setting and enforcing priorities self discipline hasn t always been the taiwanese way for example strategists on the island have a habit of placing inordinate importance on defending outlying possessions islands hard aboard the china coast and in the south china sea it strains credulity to think the roc armed forces could defend the main island of formosa while also holding offshore islands deep within waters and skies dominated by china s people s liberation army pla the taiwanese military would scatter air and sea assets all over the map in an attempt to do so at a time when they are heavily outnumbered by increasingly capable pla counterparts for political reasons taipei probably cannot publicly write off the islands few leaders get away with forfeiting sovereign territory but president tsai ing wen and her lieutenants should tacitly demote them on the roc s list of priorities successfully defend formosa and preserve your national life then you can worry about recovering lost peripheral territories the commitment to national integrity would remain but taipei would have accepted it may have to fulfill that commitment in phases rather than all at once this is not a palatable way of doing things but it is reality when trying to survive amid moral danger so to estimate whether taiwanese strategy comports with reality gauge whether taipei is taking a gimlet eyed approach to fixing priorities or is trying to do everything everywhere with a slender inventory of diplomatic economic and military resources small states under duress must decide what they want most apply themselves single mindedly to obtain it and downgrade or triage the rest second military power the roc armed forces are undergoing a cultural revolution and are moving in the right direction if not at the pace friends of taiwan might like the cultural revolution is this during the cold war the taiwanese navy and air force planned to rule the seas and skies adjoining taiwanese territory roc ships and warplanes were fewer in number than those deployed by the lumbering pla navy and air force but they were more technologically sophisticated than their chinese nemeses and roc seamanship and airmanship were better to boot superior quality both material and human offset inferior quantity the culture of command of the sea and sky was imprinted on taiwan s military culture over the course of many decades of strategic competition with the mainland that the roc military worked closely with the u s military a force steeped in command of the common did little to disabuse roc warriors of their ingrained assumptions about how to wage combat the notion that a few doughty roc ships and planes would take to the sea and air and beat back the pla has been under strain since the 1970s when the united states withdrew formal diplomatic recognition from the republic of china no longer could taipei count on that allied support when the chips were down the strain intensified during the 1990s when the pla set out to reinvent itself as a modern high tech force as a force more like the roc and u s militaries in other words chinese shipbuilding aviation technology and weapons design have made steady inroads for the past twenty years cutting into taiwan s edge in quality while calling into question the conceit that roc quality will beat pla quantity in short the pla has narrowed if not abolished the taiwanese military s technological advantage while also remaining far superior in brute numbers the islanders may still hold an edge in tactical skill and élan but at some point mainland forces will prevail by weight of numbers amplified by gee whiz technology what does this have to do with culture and a cultural revolution think about what military folk and their institutions are as scientist richard dawkins teaches human beings are susceptible to memes we think of memes as jokes or snark that go viral online attracting massive readership or viewership and that is one example of it but a meme is something more basic dawkins sometimes refers to a meme as a mind virus it is an idea or image that spreads to person to person by a kind of mental contagion capturing the fancy of those exposed to it dawkins takes an upbeat view of how memes work contending that they emerge from a kind of evolutionary process ideas are tried out and the fittest survive becoming memes a new idea may eventually emerge natural selection resumes and either the new idea becomes the meme or the old one outlasts it and remains in force but now take a group of individuals susceptible to memes put them in a bureaucratic organization and put some of them in authority over the organization what happens if a mental virus about how the institution should conduct its affairs goes viral among the leadership well a bureaucracy is a sort of machine that mass produces routine tasks it runs on standard rules regulations and procedures if a meme captures its leaders minds they re apt to reshape those rules regulations and procedures in keeping with it in effect they incorporate the viral idea into the programming that governs how the machine functions once encoded in the bureaucratic workings a meme is hard to dislodge the leadership does what leaders do and punishes those who flout bureaucratic routine while rewarding those who comply and keep the machinery running smoothly the process of natural selection among ideas slows down or grinds to a halt leaving the machine set in its ways it resists trying to reinvent itself as the surroundings change around it as they will in strategic affairs something dramatic if not traumatic may have to happen to jolt the institution out of its meme driven way of transacting business in the case of martial institutions a catastrophic defeat has a way of clearing out ideas that have outlived their usefulness sufficiently hardheaded leadership might do so as well some of the memes impelling roc military routine are the ones listed here command the sea command the sky make quality overpower quantity these were fitting for their times but times have changed roc officialdom seems to understand this but no shock to the system has discredited the old memes that being the case the machine tends to adapt by increments for example the taiwanese navy has begun acquiring small stealthy patrol craft more suitable for denying the pla navy access to the waters adjoining formosa than for fighting a major fleet battle for maritime command it has armed them with indigenous anti ship missiles able to give chinese invaders a bad day wonderful but the navy is only procuring a dozen such craft hardly a swarm capable of descending on and defeating a pla invasion force meanwhile the taiwanese navy also maintains a legacy force of destroyers frigates and amphibious warships best suited to fighting major surface engagements and projecting power onto foreign shores the roc battle fleet is visibly and increasingly out of step with the tactical and operational setting in east asia it also consumes resources that could go to the sea denial fleet in short no shock to the roc navy s way of naval warfare and collective psyche has compelled the force to embrace the new normal of pla predominance as well as ships planes and armaments best fitted to compete in a sea denial world the meme is giving way but at a glacial bureaucratic pace
when it comes to the federal reserve often called the fed president trump is not a fan despite appointing the current chair of the federal reserve jerome powell the president has consistently expressed his displeasure in the fed continuing to raise interest rates but recent the critiques went a bit further with reports of the president thinking about firing powell while the legality of such an action can be debated it cannot be overstated how disastrous that action would be to the u s financial markets and main street moreover the president s attacks on the fed may have consequences regardless of whether a firing occurs there are the certain and obvious consequences of a firing for the financial markets money managers would not look kindly on a fed whose policy was being controlled so obliquely and asset prices would assuredly decline perhaps more worrisome is that asset prices would be unlikely to materially recover for a while and it is this prolonged period of asset price depression not that it would happen for certain that should raise concern there are two primary reasons asset prices would stay lower for longer the first is a lack of confidence in the independence of the federal reserve the firing or demotion of the chair powell would directly call into question whether the fed was independent central bank independence is critical for policymaking and markets trusting that policymaking regardless of who was appointed to take powell s place it would take years to undo the damage done to the credibility of the federal reserve s monetary policy the second reason asset prices would remain under pressure is the loose policy path that would be taken ostensibly the firing of powell would be due to the decision to raise interest rates and the task of anyone nominated in his place would be to undo the perceived damage to the economy oddly markets would welcome a pause in rate increases and are likely to get one in the first half of 2019 but would fret if cuts came from a new fed chair or as a response to turmoil following powell s dismissal the signal would be not be perceived as related to the u s economic outlook or the dual mandate and more about the election cycle sometimes what is bad for wall street is not bad for main street but when it comes to the theoretical firing of powell there would be few if any places to hide main street would be buffeted by uncertainty surrounding the economy and the resulting tighter and stricter standards for lending by banks small businesses would likely find it particularly difficult to borrow the manufacturing sector is particularly capital intensive and could be hit directly by tighter lending complicating the manufacturing push from the administration other potential side effects of a fed firing include impacts on start ups that rely heavily on investors and financial markets for capital to expand and finance operations with an unpredictable and chaotic fed policy investors may begin to pull back their incremental investments this would create a headwind to employment and further exacerbate the economic turmoil the turmoil out of the fed would leave few untouched and there are already a number of consequences to the pressure being exerted on the fed from the white house even these will take time to heal the most consequential is that a pause in raising interest rates which the data and the growth outlook warrant could be unduly cited as evidence of giving in to political pressure even with a pause being the most logical path forward for the fed the perception of the action could do more harm than good and that is the most frustrating part of the current executive branch rhetoric there is a decent chance that the proper fed policy cannot be made due to the need to establish and reiterate independence would pausing interest rate increases due to weakness in the data do more good than the harm of appearing to be partisan it is a difficult question to answer and a question the fed has rarely grappled with in the modern era in the end the rhetoric from president trump may have already caused the fed to alter policy in the exact way he wishes to avoid the fed s independence matters not simply for wall street but also for main street the fed s desire to reiterate its independence could cause it to raise rates further than it otherwise would have that could and will do some real damage to the u s economy but not as much as firing powell and calling into question the legitimacy of the federal reserve samuel e rines is the chief economist at avalon advisors in houston texas image reuters

by mike head wikileaks founder julian assange whose courageous publication of leaked documents exposed the crimes and mass surveillance of the us and its allies is facing a new threat to expel him from ecuador s london embassy he was granted political asylum there in 2012 to protect him from being extradited to the us to face possible life imprisonment or even execution on trumped up espionage or conspiracy charges having already cut off assange s internet access and communication with the outside world last march in an effort to coerce him into leaving the embassy ecuadorian president lenín moreno has set in motion a pseudo legal inquisition to provide a cover for his government to repudiate its asylum obligations facing mounting demands from washington moreno s government has unveiled a special examination of assange s asylum and citizenship a process clearly designed to repudiate both the issue of citizenship is significant because ecuadorian law forbids extradition of citizens on january 3 former ecuadorian president rafael correa whose government granted assange asylum tweeted an image of a letter he received from ecuador s state comptroller general on december 19 notifying him of an investigation by the dirección nacional de auditoria specifically the general objective of the audit is to determine whether the procedures for granting asylum and naturalization to julian assange were carried out in accordance with national and international law it will cover the period between january 1 2012 and september 20 2018 correa now living in belgium was asked to supply information for the inquiry but no timeline was mentioned nor any date for the end result there is no doubt however that the timing is directly connected to the escalating economic financial and political pressure on ecuador above all emanating from the us military intelligence apparatus and political establishment wikileaks tweeted correa s news the same day pointing to the link between the special examination and the moreno government s mooted resort to an imf bailout because of its deepening debts which have been fueled by falling global oil prices and the dictates of the financial markets wikileaks reported ecuador has initiated a formal special examination of julian assange s asylum and nationality nationals cannot be extradited as it seeks a 10 billion imf bailout for which the us government demanded handing over assange and dropping environmental claims against chevron all the evidence points to the handing over to the us of assange effectively the world s number 1 political prisoner being a condition set by washington and the financial elite for the survival of moreno and his government the relentless and vindictive operation against assange is driven by the ruling capitalist class s determination to silence dissent as it faces the re emergence of working class struggles around the world wikileaks reported ecuador has initiated a formal special examination of julian assange s asylum and nationality nationals cannot be extradited as it seeks a 10 billion imf bailout for which the us government demanded handing over assange and dropping environmental claims against chevron squeezed by lower oil prices and punitive interest rates on its international loans moreno has admitted considering an imf bailout which would also require savage cost cutting and further attacks on working class conditions absolutely nothing is off the table he told reporters last month when asked about a potential imf agreement any such loan could trigger widespread unrest jaime carrera director of the watchdog fiscal policy observatory recently told the los angeles times that the imf was sure to set onerous conditions including likely demands that moreno cut at least 10 percent of the 450 000 strong central government workforce and end all or most of 4 billion in annual fuel subsidies for consumers those reductions will bring a lot of people out into the streets to protest carrera said confronted by this prospect moreno has been desperately seeking financing from investment banks and other countries including china he visited beijing last month to discuss re negotiating repayments on chinese loans said to total 6 5 billion like other latin american countries ecuador has been placed in a financial and political vice by the us and the international financial institutions s p global ratings has imposed junk bond status on ecuador with the country s b rating one notch below argentina s b grade these ratings mean usurious rates of interest more than 10 percent on ecuador s sovereign bonds in recent months the us media has highlighted the chinese debt as part of its propaganda offensive against beijing accusing it of debt diplomacy to financially trap poor countries but ecuador s debts also feature us finance houses and conglomerates the government owned petroamazonas oil firm which produces 80 percent of the country s oil owes 3 billion in debts to contractors including texas based oil field services firm schlumberger an imf team visited ecuador last year from june 20 to july 4 and later issued a statement insisting that while moreno had moved to embrace the requirements of the financial markets since taking office in april 2017 much harsher measures were needed among them were higher oil prices temporary tax measures cuts in capital spending and a public sector hiring freeze it was no coincidence that us vice president mike pence arrived in quito at the same time to discuss tightening ecuador s economic and military ties with washington as well as assange s fate at a press conference in the government palace ecuador s economy and finance minister richard martinez said he had spoken with pence who also met moreno about securing us support to permit multilateral organisations to generate sources of financing with favourable conditions for ecuador while pence and president donald trump have been centrally involved in ratcheting up the intense pressure on ecuador the democrats have been the most vehement repeatedly demanding that the trump administration force ecuador to hand over assange now that the democrats hold a majority in the us house of representatives this agitation is certain to escalate it forms a pivotal aspect of the drive by the democrats working closely with the military intelligence agencies to push the white house into a confrontation with russia as well as china democratic aligned corporate media outlets have made lurid and absurd allegations that wikileaks was part of a nefarious conspiracy with russian president vladimir putin to assist trump s 2016 presidential campaign this is feeding into the witch hunting investigation by special counsel robert mueller formerly a long time fbi director into alleged russian interference in the 2016 election at the centre of these accusations are leaked emails proving that the democratic national committee sought to undermine the so called democratic socialist bernie sanders and ensure that hillary clinton became the democratic party s presidential candidate they also included the texts of speeches clinton gave to corporate audiences pledging support to wall street and boasting of her role in organising the barbaric us led war on libya in 2011 significantly the new threat to assange follows the collapse of the latest smear campaign december s much headlined claim by the guardian that trump s former campaign manager paul manafort held secret talks with assange inside the ecuadorian embassy in london five weeks on as the intercept s glenn greenwald reported on january 3 the guardian s editor in chief kath viner and the chief author of the claim luke harding have refused repeated requests to respond to the exposure of the obvious falsifications and contradictions in the report the claims have been categorically refuted by manafort wikileaks and former ecuadorian embassy staff the world socialist web site and the socialist equality parties internationally are conducting a campaign in the working class and among youth to defend assange and wikileaks this is an absolutely essential issue in the fight to defend free speech against the intensifying repression and censorship of capitalist governments and corporate giants such as google and facebook aimed at silencing and isolating anti war and anti capitalist dissent as part of that struggle the sep in australia where assange remains a citizen will organise and seek the broadest support for political demonstrations in sydney on march 3 and melbourne on march 10 the rallies will demand that the australian government end its collaboration with the us led persecution of assange and immediately intervene using all its diplomatic and legal powers to insist that the british government allow the wikileaks publisher to leave the ecuadorian embassy and unconditionally return to australia if he chooses to do so with a guarantee against extradition to the us
by arab news by frank kane if as many predict the world is in for an economic recession in 2019 we will probably be able to pinpoint its beginning with unusual precision at 6 p m eastern standard time on jan 2 apple the iphone and computer manufacturer shocked wall street with a warning that revenues would be down for the current year it was the first time in 16 years that apple had forecast a fall in revenues apple shares crashed 10 percent on opening the following day prompting a similar fall in us equity indices that reverberated around the world over the next 24 hours the malaise that had afflicted global stock markets in the final quarter of 2018 seems destined to continue into 2019 the mini crash showed what an icon apple has become in the global economy forget hollywood mcdonalds and starbucks the real symbol of american soft power in the 21st century is the manufacturer of the iphone and other computer devices that everybody it seems must own except they do not want to own them as much as they did before especially in china the main factor behind the revenue decline was falling sales of new iphones in china which has been both a major market and manufacturing center for the company tim cook apple chief executive blamed the fall on slowing economic growth in china for iphones mac computers and ipads which was a neat way of passing the blame to the anonymous world of macro factors beyond his control there was a suggestion too that sales in china had been affected by the simmering trade war with the us but no real hard evidence to back that up so far tariffs imposed by president donald trump have largely affected commodity materials such as steel and aluminum coming into the us while the chinese retaliation has been against a symbolic variety of items such as soya beans and some beverages deemed to be quintessentially american it is probably true that chinese consumer appetite for a product such as apple would be marginally affected by anti american sentiment but on the other hand the cachet of the iphone is so powerful that you would expect chinese shoppers to mostly resist the patriotic urgings of their leaders much as soviet consumers did with yankee products such as levis jeans in the communist era tech analysts however thought there were other reasons for the fall in demand for iphone and macs in china apple used to charging a premium for their american designed product was simply pricing itself out of the market raising prices has been a standard feature of the apple marketing strategy for years as customers were keen to pay what it took to get their hands on the newest device this culminated in the first 1 000 phone the iphone x which was regarded as a quantum leap in technological standards and worth the extra cash but nobody can really see why the xs is worth an extra premium and the whole strategy behind the xr a more affordable version of the x seems flawed when apple has been criticized for asking people to pay more and get less it is very confusing to introduce another version that actually promises less in the uae the price differential between apple and other products is alarming it can be as much as 2 000 dirhams 540 in comparison with similar mobile models from asian manufacturers even within the apple range there can be as much as 1 000 dirhams difference on an iphone x bought from an authorized apple dealer one of the big stores in the mega malls and the same device certified and guaranteed bought from an independent retailer this suggests that apple has fallen victim to the failings of others in american big data such as facebook of arrogantly assuming consumer demand for its products is forever constant regardless of geopolitical factors or pricing considerations so there you have apple at the beginning of 2019 a vital component of the american business and financial scene but beset by problems in its marketing strategy exacerbated by other issues largely brought about by trump s actions it could be a metaphor for the global economy

is likely to continue in 2019 agence france presse toru yamanaka j apan outmuscled china to dominate mergers and acquisitions in asia last year and with companies in possession of more than 890 billion in cash the spending spree is likely to continue in 2019 japanese companies announced more than 1 000 offshore acquisitions totaling a record 191 billion last year led by takeda pharmaceutical co s blockbuster takeover of shire plc according to data compiled by bloomberg the last time japan overtook china by that measure was in 2012 faced with a shrinking population and stagnant economy japanese businesses have been increasingly looking overseas as trade war tensions depress stock prices and bolster the value of the safe haven yen combine that with the massive war chest that japanese firms from softbank group corp to toshiba corp have amassed and bankers are preparing for a prosperous year japanese companies are poised to have the biggest year ever in terms of the number of offshore deals koichiro doi jpmorgan chase co s japan m a head said in an interview the u s will be the most sought after destination partly because it s the largest market that s growing according to doi who said 2018 was the busiest year he s had in his two decade long career the number of purchases is bound to increase from industrial consumer and technology firms but japan inc is unlikely to spend as much in aggregate or pull off a deal the size of takeda s this year doi said takeda s purchase of shire scheduled for completion this week was the world s largest takeover announced last year this year an even bigger deal may be in the offing with bristol myers squibb s recent agreement to acquire celgene corp japanese businesses have long been looking to expand overseas through acquisitions but their track record in terms of m a prowess hasn t been too flattering in the 80s as soaring stock prices fueled hubris japan inc snapped up everything from the iconic rockefeller center in manhattan to california s pebble beach golf course and vincent van gogh s sunflowers painting sony corp and panasonic corp bought hollywood studios many of those investments ended up being sold at a fraction of their cost after the country s asset bubble burst then there were the acquisitive years at the turn of the century when buyers including phone operator ntt docomo inc toshiba and nomura holdings inc splashed out on overseas trophies such as at t inc s wireless unit the result was billions of dollars in writedowns and a gun shy approach to foreign deals there are signs that japan has learned from its mistakes as japanese acquirers are striking harder bargains last year they typically paid about 23 percent more than market value the lowest premium since 2013 according to data compiled by bloomberg also there s only so much cash companies can hoard before coming under fire from investors japanese corporations are getting pressure from shareholders to spend money more efficiently said akifusa takada head of the m a practice at the baker mckenzie law firm in tokyo not many japanese companies are very willing to distribute cash to shareholders as dividends they see these fund as resources to expand business overseas companies sitting on excess cash are now more likely to become a target for activist investors so there s an incentive for boards to spend surplus funds on takeovers said zuhair khan an analyst at jefferies japan ltd among last year s targets was toshiba corp which was urged by hedge fund king street capital management to buy back 10 billion of stock at 892 billion cash and cash equivalents at non financial companies listed on the nikkei 225 stock average have surged from 690 billion in three years bloomberg data show there are plenty of sellers to choose from once mighty general electric co continues to sell assets while chinese conglomerates such as hna group co and anbang insurance group co are unwinding their empires after the government began cracking down on capital outflows by targeting the country s most prominent acquirers healthcare remains a hot sector even after the takeda shire deal bristol myers bid for celgene may fuel more consolidation in the sector according to analysts then there are falling share prices which may fall further yet concerns about global growth this year have taken hold as china s economy slows and the u s china trade war drags on indexes from asia to europe have slumped while u s stocks in 2018 had their worst year since the financial crisis that s good news for japanese companies looking for acquisitions according to jefferies khan it could be a very good year for overseas m a said khan to the extent there s a pullback in valuation multiples it ll make overseas m a much

giddy expectations remain underwater ceos worry that investment capital will dry up in 2019 making it harder to discover and develop new medicines the newly democratic house and the trump

days are over said leora schiff principal at altius strategy consulting a biopharma consulting firm in somerville everything was the sky s the limit it seemed like things would keep going up and up which we know isn t the case how it all plays out remains to be seen of course but the market turmoil will certainly color almost every discussion at the 37th annual j p morgan conference the event draws thousands of name tag wearing executives analysts and investors to the westin st francis hotel in san francisco s union square over the years jpm as many call it has marked the unofficial start of the year for the drug making industry ceos make half hour pitches to investors and analysts in crowded conference rooms and deliver spiels to journalists in hotel rooms executives also negotiate business deals in the hallways and network over expensive food and drinks at upscale restaurants there are plenty of communication firms helping the executives polish their messages one san francisco company w2o group will have 40 staffers at the event many of them situated at the cartwright hotel said lauren barbiero an associate director of the firm advertisement several drug company executives in massachusetts which consistently ranks at or the near the top of states with the most biotech jobs say the science undergirding drug development remains as strong as ever despite the plunging stock prices fundamentally there are a lot of great companies and a lot of great products being developed said peter hecht the chief executive of cambridge based ironwood pharmaceuticals which makes treatments for gastrointestinal diseases and gout and there continues to be a huge unmet need for better therapeutics to help patients ironwood plans to split into two publicly traded firms in the first half of the year one of which will focus on rare diseases hecht will leave ironwood to run that company among the massachusetts executives expected to talk about significant progress in drug development at the westin is jeffrey leiden the ceo of boston based vertex pharmaceuticals vertex has introduced three drugs since 2012 that for the first time treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis in roughly half of the 30 000 patients with the rare genetic disease which attacks the lungs and other organs the annual price tags of the drugs range from 272 000 to 311 000 and have drawn sharp criticism one of two new experimental medicines from vertex for the disease is likely to be approved in about a year based on encouraging late stage clinical results that would help the company reach a longstanding goal of making cystic fibrosis treatable for 90 percent of patients advertisement john maraganore the chief executive of alnylam pharmaceuticals also plans to trumpet his company s progress in august the cambridge biotech won food and drug administration approval for a medicine onpattro to treat a rare disease called hereditary transthyretin mediated amyloidosis or hattr it was the first ever approval of a drug based on a nobel prize winning technique known as rna interference which silences disease causing genes onpattro whose list price is about 450 000 had an underwhelming first quarter of sales but executives in november encouraged investors to withhold judgment there also have been major setbacks in the industry an fda advisory panel in november skewered an opioid based depression drug that alkermes had developed setting it up for almost certain rejection by the agency later this month but alkermes which is headquartered in ireland but has its r d operations in waltham got good news a few weeks later the company said that patients who were treated with another experimental drug that it had developed reported significantly less weight gain compared to those who took the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic currently in use if the mood at the conference is likely to be more apprehensive this year some other things have not changed as

quarter to quarter very strong financial results q4 highlights include exceptional progress in completing our 2018 capital program and excellent net revenues notwithstanding a mild roller coaster ride in oil prices oil price oil price peaked at usd 86 bbl brent in early october only to drop by 40 before the year end this was followed by a new year rebound and a currently stabilized price of about usd 62 bbl because of efficient operations and the quality of its reserves at usd 60 bbl maha receives a strong usd 41 57 bbl yearly average netback maha continues to be bullish on an oil price above usd 60 bbl brent for the foreseeable future which of course compares favorably to the usd 50 bbl price in may 2017 when maha s 300m sek bond was placed tie field processing i am grateful to our production operations team that has successfully increased the tie field processing capacity to 5000 bopd by the 31st december 2018 target date under budget though some ongoing work remains such as installing a permanent 4 bay loading facility and two remaining oil storage tanks this work will be completed shortly therefore opposite to before the tie facility can now process more oil and gas than the tie field wells can currently produce and deliver attic well tie field gte 3 recompletion and offtake expected oil production from drilling the now spudded attic well together with production from the two currently tie producing wells gte 3 and gte 4 should fill this excess processing capacity as the attic well is being drilled up dip of the free flowing gte 4 well maha has good reason to expect excellent results once the attic well is on production further operations at gte 3 will finish the work started last june by recompleting the comingled well to a dual producer for additional production at that point if all goes well tie field will be able to deliver more oil than it can currently sell to that end maha s commercial team in brazil and canada has been busy securing additional offtake arrangements over and above the current 4100 bopd and is confident there will be a home for up to 5000 bopd of tie field production in the very near future 7ttg workover tartaruga the 7ttg workover was completed quickly after the drilling rig was moved from the 107 d location and the 3 1 2 stuck tubing was fished out of the hole a new and dedicated jet pump has now been installed that is currently cleaning stimulation fluids from the formation prior to the workover 7ttg produced about 190 bopd from the p6 zone using a surface jet pump that was shared with its sister well 107d two new zones p4 and the newly stimulated p1 have now been opened for production in addition to the existing p6 zone the results from this operation are eagerly awaited once the above clean up is complete the 7ttg will be returned to production 107d well testing tartaruga for those of you that have followed our news over the last 6 months you know the 107d well was an exercise in perseverance endurance and self belief for our drilling team despite multiple stuck pipe incidents caused by an unstable formation above the reservoir a 500 m horizontal hole was drilled through the productive p1 zone proving a the continued lateral extent of the p1 formation and b the successful applicability of horizontal drilling at tartaruga we are currently mobilizing special slim hole perforating equipment to perforate the 3 1 2 liner before we can production test this well tartaruga field processing and operations at the tartaruga field the correct sizing of processing equipment is dependent on liquid and gas throughput maha knows it will initially be constrained by the ability to process gas produced in association with oil at the field to that end maha is working with a brazilian contractor that will convert the associated gas to electricity required environmental licenses to proceed with the installation of gas to wire equipment were obtained during the quarter as soon as maha ascertains the expected production levels for the 107d and 7ttg wells above it will design and upgrade the tartaruga plant to handle the expected increases in production from the current production capability of 500 bbl d lak field update at the lak field weather and staffing related issues have prevented maha from bringing the newly drilled horizontals on production the crew at lak are currently working to commence production and injection before the end of the first quarter of 2019 with a goal of proving up the technology can create cashflow positive operations at lak which could then in turn lead to a full field development reserves industry standard reserve definitions and procedures that chapman petroleum engineering ltd apply required a periodic economic and technical evaluation of the lak technology implementation as reported this resulted in lak s probable reserves being downgraded by 4 7 million barrels this year the company s decision to accelerate the development plan at tartaruga field resulted in 3 1 million barrels of reserves being migrated from 3p possible reserves to 2p probable reserves for an overall companywide reduction in 2p reserves of about 5 as the new drilling results from the 2018 capital program were not available this year other expected increases in proven reserves were not recorded in 2018 but should appear in 2019 total production volumes for 2018 were 647 607 boe s about 5 of maha s proven reserves i continue to be grateful for all the support and encouraging e mails we receive from our extended family of maha

written by alan rappeport and jim tankersley president donald trump is cheerleading his way past the economic warning signs that have rattled financial markets and unnerved economists insisting that the united states has an advantage in a crucial first round of trade negotiations beginning monday in beijing advertisement it helps his case that the labor department published a jobs report for december that soared past expectations china s not doing very well now trump said in a news conference at the white house hours after the report came out friday it puts us in a very strong position we are doing very well trump is correct about china s economy which by several measures appears to be hobbled by u s tariffs on 250 billion worth of chinese imports but the president s confidence about the domestic economy largely ignores what others see as looming threats including damage from a protracted federal government shutdown the waning effects of trump s 1 5 trillion tax cut and contagion from china s pain to u s companies farmers and consumers friday s data notwithstanding advertisement chinese officials appear set to offer a mix of concessions including reducing some tariffs on u s goods as they try to defuse trade tensions before a march 2 deadline when tariffs on 200 billion worth of imports will increase to 25 percent from 10 percent a u s delegation of midlevel trade officials will begin two days of talks with their counterparts monday in beijing led by jeffrey gerrish deputy u s trade representative and david malpass the treasury department s undersecretary for international affairs if the talks are constructive a senior level delegation of chinese officials is expected to travel to washington within a few weeks to meet with robert lighthizer trump s top trade negotiator and steven mnuchin the treasury secretary advertisement top administration officials are confident they are in a strong enough position to win significant changes including an end to china s practice of forcing u s companies to hand over intellectual property and an agreement to buy more agricultural and energy products from the united states while such concessions are possible china trade experts say they are not likely to happen easily or quickly given the structural and legal changes they would require that could ultimately set the stage for a protracted fight that goes beyond march 2 and hurts consumer spending corporate profits and economic growth in america the balance of leverage appeared to have shifted in favor of the u s with signs that china s economy was slowing down but the stock market rout and concerns about a u s growth slowdown have restored a more even balance between the two sides said eswar prasad a trade expert at cornell university still it will be tough sledding for the u s and china to reach a deal that is acceptable to both sides advertisement he added the best that can be hoped for is a cessation of further trade hostilities with the trade sanctions already implemented by both sides likely to remain in place mike pillsbury a china expert at the hudson institute who advises the trump administration warned that the negotiations would not be easy he predicted that the chinese would most likely try to make an offer that divides white house officials satisfying the more moderate advisers like mnuchin and larry kudlow director of the national economic council while frustrating lighthizer and peter navarro another senior adviser if they are true to past history of negotiations they will make a credible but minimal offer pillsbury said of chinese leaders advertisement u s companies like apple and fedex have already attributed lowered revenue estimates to the trade war with china and many large u s companies like caterpillar general motors and boeing view china s market as critical to future growth kevin hassett chairman of the white house council of economic advisers acknowledged as much thursday when he told cnn that there are a heck of a lot of u s companies that have a lot of sales in china that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with china in an interview friday hassett buoyed by employers adding 312 000 jobs to payrolls in december tried to moderate those comments saying that china s slowdown is a problem for europe not the united states because european countries export more to china than america does he said that only 1 7 percent of u s corporate profits came from sales in china advertisement yet several economic warning signs are flashing yellow a closely watched measure of manufacturing fell in december and economic forecasters predict that last year s boost to consumer spending aided by trump s signature tax cuts will fade this year higher interest rates have also helped cool the housing market nationwide the potential for economic headwinds including market concerns over a softening chinese economy prompted jerome powell the federal reserve chairman to say friday that the fed would be patient with policy decisions like interest rate increases the government shutdown is also expected to exact some economic pain with about 800 000 federal workers furloughed with no pay and economically essential services such as air travel which depend on government workers being crimped standard poor s the credit rating firm estimated last month that shutting down a fourth of the government could shave 1 2 billion off gross domestic product each week the government is closed trump has suggested that he is willing to potentially let the government remain shuttered for more than a year advertisement farmers who have been relying on an agriculture department program to mitigate the effect of the trade war through a special 12 billion subsidy fund are now being left in the lurch according to a usda spokesman farmers who have already certified their 2018 production will receive payments under the market facilitation program despite the lapse in federal funding but farmers who have not done so must wait to certify until farm service agency offices reopen when funding is restored tax refunds will also not be issued during the shutdown and taxpayers trying to determine their bill for 2018 will not be able to ask questions of the irs i understand that the irs furloughed nearly 70 000 irs employees 87 5 percent of the workforce ceased needed taxpayer services and stopped issuing tax refunds during the government shutdown rep richard neal d mass the chairman of the house ways and means committee wrote in a letter to mnuchin on friday these actions are causing undue hardship to american taxpayers and the irs civil servants advertisement analysts also view the gridlock between the white house and democrats who now control the house of representatives as a bad omen for other challenges that the government will face this year such as lifting the government s borrowing limit the ongoing shutdown suggests that the current arrangement of political forces following november s midterm elections that resulted in a divided congress limits policy consistency said charles seville a senior director at fitch another credit rating firm u s businesses are already beginning to struggle with the effects of one of trump s first moves as president his withdrawal from the trans pacific partnership a multination trade agreement that includes several asian countries that agreement is finally taking effect without the united states and the other 11 remaining countries are beginning to see the benefits of lower tariffs advertisement this is putting u s businesses such as the beef industry at a competitive disadvantage to other countries like australia and canada when trying to sell beef in japan beef exports to japan currently face a 38 5 percent tariff while tariffs for other countries that remained in the agreement have fallen to 27 5 percent and will continue to decline in the coming years we re going to start to see more incentives to buy from our competitors said kent bacus director of international trade and market access at the national cattlemen s beef association we can t afford to delay the talks we need them to move as quickly as possible investors would love to see a quick resolution to the trade tensions as well stocks have gyrated as the trade war has escalated and the s p 500 is down more than 8 percent from a year ago its largest annual drop since the 2008 financial crisis it is down more than 13 percent since the end of october advertisement further drops could increase pressure on trump who famously bragged that trade wars are easy to win but who views the stock market as a barometer of his economic success to settle for a quicker deal than he wants still trump showed no sign of pressure sunday i think good things are going to happen on a trade deal trump told reporters before boarding marine one on his way to camp david where staff officials will discuss the shutdown china and immigration he also celebrated the december jobs numbers and mocked wall street analysts for being surprised by them it didn t shock me trump said i know what s going on

wilmington n c while the nation s capital is stuck in a standstill and the partial government shutdown rolls forward with no clear end in sight the situation for many federal employees across the country is getting more real by the day matthew craviotto an air traffic control specialist based at wilmington s international airport had only been in his home for a few months when hurricane florence struck the region in september the storm unleashed record rain and submerged much of his house in all he estimates he suffered roughly 70 000 in damage he relied on shelter from friends for several months and drained much of his savings it s situations like this that get exacerbated if a regular paycheck doesn t arrive due to a lapse in government funding and the inability of congress and the white house to come to an agreement over funding for a border wall i need to get paid to support my son to pay my bills to finish my house craviotto said worried about regular expenses like gas and daycare for his 5 year old it s been a struggle not knowing where the money s going to come from even before the shutdown that was my rainy day fund and it rained he added craviotto is part of roughly 80 percent of the federal workforce based outside of the washington d c employees like him are considered essential still going to work every day during the shutdown but unsure when their next paycheck could arrive an estimated 800 000 federal workers don t know when they ll see their next paycheck around 420 000 of those are still on the job and around 380 000 are furloughed craviotto said he wonders how long it s going to be how much to budget how much food i m going to stock up leaders in the nation s capital he said need to think about the people that are actually working for the money and who actually rely on this money to support their families and the bills that they re working for one of his colleagues fellow air traffic control specialist bill kirby the local representative for the national air traffic controllers association is the sole provider for his young family that also include his wife and their baby daughter ella it s frustrating he said the ball keeps on spinning stuff doesn t stop you ve still gotta keep on paying your bills pay off christmas gifts and toys and stuff and do everything else you gotta do not knowing when you re going to get paid next is a little worrisome both craviotto and kirby don t consider themselves political people or aligned with any political party they don t place a specific blame on either side but just want a resolution from government leaders soon they are elected members that get paid to do a job just like how i m getting paid to do a job kirby said i understand there s politics and ideas and that kind of thing but at the same time we ve got to get things accomplished several hours north up the coast of north carolina the shutdown is also impacting the lives many of the workers at the major coast guard base in elizabeth city willard jenkins a lead mechanic voted for and continues to support president donald trump but he urged the president to strike a deal with democrats and loosen current funding demands for a wall for the sake of families like his he and his wife jamie a data analyst for the coast guard were both furloughed on dec 26 the couple said they have a home mortgage car payments and their daughter s student loans to pay off they also cancelled a trip to ohio over christmas to visit willard s father we don t want to send letters to the creditors that we can t pay our bills jamie jenkins said we want them to do their jobs so we can do ours unlike the essential federal employees who are guaranteed to receive backpay when the government is funded again the jenkins couple will rely on action from congress to provide backpay to furloughed workers like them the couple indicated they planned to begin filling out paperwork to apply for unemployment benefits if this did not impact my household directly i d tell him to stand tall because something needs to be done willard jenkins said of the president and a barrier at the border but because it does and it impacts my wife and me if this continues we wouldn t have a paycheck i hope there is some kind of agreement some kind of settlement because it s directly impacting me but i definitely understand where donald trump is coming from peoples lives are at stake he added offering a personal message for the president and leaders in congress get rid of politics think of the people who voted you in you have a lot of people across the country that put you in office so think of them before you think of yourself

in an ominous sign california pacific airlines has suspended all service from its hub in southern california for a month or more late last year long awaited airline start up california pacific airlines finally got off the ground after nearly a decade of planning the airline s founders planned to carve out a niche in the san diego region by operating flights at mcclellan palomar airport in the northern suburbs by contrast local market leader southwest airlines luv 0 75 and every other major airline serves the city through san diego international airport check out the latest southwest airlines earnings call transcript however california pacific got off to an extremely rough start with widespread flight delays and cancellations now it has suspended all service at its carlsbad california base until at least february that doesn t bode well for the carrier s short or long term survival a series of unfortunate events california pacific airlines began flying from mcclellan palomar airport in early november its operations were extremely unreliable from day one indeed a maintenance problem delayed its first departure by nearly half a day that was just the beginning of the new airline s struggles in addition to its west coast service california pacific airlines also operates federally subsidized essential air service eas flights from two cities in south dakota to denver this is a legacy of california pacific s founders having purchased an existing airline to avoid the lengthy process for receiving a new faa certification one of the company s four jets was damaged at the airport in pierre south dakota in late october it took more than a month to repair it while that jet was out of service california pacific experienced maintenance problems with some of its other aircraft at one point in early december only one of its four aircraft was operational not surprisingly the situation wreaked havoc on its schedule between the middle of november and late december the airline canceled more than 25 of its eas flights in south dakota jeopardizing its lucrative eas contract delays and cancellations were also widespread on routes from california pacific s carlsbad hub meanwhile management has had its eye on an even bigger problem a growing shortage of pilots that is affecting small regional airlines across the country california pacific tries to regroup the pilot shortage caused california pacific s latest setback in late december it canceled all flights from its carlsbad hub until further notice and began issuing refunds to customers who had already booked tickets the airline says it s working to train more pilots and hopes to resume service in california in february it has even ordered three additional airplanes so that it can add more routes from its carlsbad hub in the future but for the time being the carrier is focusing its resources on operating its eas flights between denver and south dakota reliably a bad start could doom california pacific airlines the bad news is that california pacific s bumpy start could doom it the carrier s business plan is based on appealing to business travelers and leisure travelers from northern san diego county by offering greater convenience than rivals such as southwest airlines that operate at san diego international airport however the inconvenience of spending an hour in the car on the way to the airport is far more manageable than the inconvenience of being stranded because your flight is canceled that s an ordeal that lots of california pacific airlines customers experienced in november and december southwest airlines offers affordable reliable frequent and relatively comfortable service for san diego based air travelers california pacific s only real competitive advantage relative to southwest is the convenience factor for most people that s not a big enough advantage to justify the risk of booking with an airline that has a terrible track record for reliability many struggling airline start ups suspend flights with plans to resume service at some later date far fewer manage to get back off the ground with 20 20 hindsight california pacific airlines clearly should have waited until it had enough spare airplanes and plenty of pilots before starting service in southern california now it may take a miracle for the carrier to survive
millions of americans could face going without the benefit that allows them to purchase food if the government shutdown continues into february the supplemental nutrition assistance program known as snap or food stamps costs an average of around 4 8 billion per month according to the u s department of agriculture but because of the government shutdown the program has only 3 billion in emergency reserves for february more than 19 million households in the united states receive food stamps accounting for nearly 39 million people each household receives on average 245 28 per month but because of the shutdown usda has no money to pay for the program in the ensuing months the agency also had to furlough approximately 95 percent of food and nutrition services the office that oversees the snap program the white house and the usda did not respond to requests for comment about their plans to address the shortfall but experts say there is cause for concern for the millions potentially impacted if the 1 8 billion shortfall for february benefits were spread evenly across the 19 million households that receive snap benefits each would see a cut of about 90 per month for their overall grocery budget according to dottie rosenbaum a senior fellow at the center for budget and policy priorities cbpp if the political standoff that began dec 22 continued into march these households would receive no money to buy food even if the president and congress resolve the shutdown by february depending on the decisions the administration makes in the coming one to two weeks households could experience a substantial delay in receiving their full snap allotment for february because of the operational challenges that states and ebt contractors face rosenbaum said in an email robert powell is another american who might have a reason to worry although he doesn t use the benefits himself powell owns a grocery store called the town country market in atoka oklahoma a small town of about 3 000 people where the store has been a fixture since 1967 a fair amount of his customers use food stamps powell said later adding that these lost benefits could have a negative impact on his customers as well as his business there s going to be rioting in the streets when they cut the stamps off powell said get your timber ready businesses are a secondary victim if the shutdown causes the program to run out of cash the money spent by snap beneficiaries is typically split between small business owners like powell and major retailers like walmart tens of billions of dollars could be on the line for hundreds of thousands of businesses across the u s in fiscal year 2017 snap participants redeemed 63 billion in snap benefits for food purchases at about 260 000 retailers 80 percent of which were considered small businesses according to an april 2018 cbpp report the lost benefits would spread out to affect all retailers it would also impact supermarkets and big box stores where more than 80 percent of that 63 billion is spent the report found gary philbin enterprise president of dollar tree noted in an earnings conference call last year that the company s stock prices had been impacted by the more than 500 000 people removed from snap in 2016 considering the millions of people who would lose their consumer power without the benefits they depend on to buy food the shutdown could have a major impact on retailers especially those that serve low income populations if the government does not find a way to make up for the 1 8 billion loss in february that s a 1 8 billion loss across the whole country stacy dean the vice president for food assistance policy at cbpp explained but it will have a disproportionate impact on groceries and small businesses that serve poor communities where shoppers are more reliant on snap benefits and those communities often include some of the most vulnerable individuals as well such as veterans cbpp concluded in a separate report from november 2018 that the snap program is used in nearly 1 4 million households where veterans live thousands of veterans would be affected in every state of the country if these benefits were cut in an interview with nbc news rep karen bass d calif called the shutdown a distraction from issues that congress should be focused on and she noted that the ongoing divide between president trump and democrats could impact those who depend on food stamps if the shutdown continues then you will literally have millions of people that will not be able to afford food bass said and i think this is just absolutely unconscionable i think it s another example him the congresswoman added referring to the president either he literally doesn t understand or doesn t care

pr inside com 2019 01 07 03 01 02 maha energy ab publ biblioteksgatan 1 se 111 46 stockholm www mahaenergy ca press release stockholm january 7 2019 maha energy ab publ maha or the company announces company operational update on 107d horizontal sidetrack and tie field drilling program the company is pleased to provide the following update from its operations in brazil tartaruga 107d further to the company s november 22 2018 press release drilling of the 107d horizontal sidetrack was completed on december 18 2018 and reached a total depth of 3661 m the total length drilled in the penedo 1 sandstone was 504 m and encountered a total of 409 m of sandstone of which a total of 328 m contained very good to excellent oil and gas shows this confirms the company s expectation that by horizontally drilling the penedo sands a much wider productive area can be accessed than the previous wells which should result in higher production rates preparations were then made to run a 4 1 2 slotted liner to complete the well but deteriorating hole conditions made the running of the 4 1 2 liner to 3661 m impossible instead a smaller 3 1 2 liner has been worked to a depth of 3267 m at which point it could go no further a gross interval of 394 m of the horizontally drilled section of the well will be left barefoot open hole completion1 of which 218 m encountered very good to excellent oil and gas shows the 110 m lined section encountered 94 m of sand which were described to have excellent oil and gas shows preparations are now underway to selectively perforate the lined section of the horizontal and then complete the well using a dedicated 2 7 8 jet pump because of the reduction in liner size a non standard perforating string will have to be mobilized which will require some specialty equipment and additional planning as such the rig will now be moved to the adjacent 7ttg well where it will complete the fishing job add perforations and stimulate the penedo 1 sandstone before returning to perforate and complete the 3 1 2 liner on the 107d well 7ttg the 7ttg well has produced some 327 000 barrels of oil from the penedo 6 sandstone and the planned workover for 7ttg involves adding perforations in the penedo 1 sandstone and recompleting the well with its own jet pump this work was originally planned for june july 2018 but a stuck 3 1 2 tubing prevented the work to be completed last summer due to the workover rig limitations the rig currently on site is a much larger rig and is expected to recover the stuck 3 1 2 tubing quickly once the drilling rig is on the 7ttg well it is expected to take 14 days to fish recomplete and stimulate the well after which the well will be placed on production the rig move is planned to take 10 days tie field due to the continued delays at tartaruga the company contracted a second drilling rig to commence operations at the tie field this drilling rig is currently finishing up drilling operations at a nearby location and is expected to be rigged up at the tie field in approximately 2 weeks the attic well will drill and complete the producing agua grande and sergi formations at a crestal position of the producing tie field an additional objective of the attic well is to penetrate the previously undrilled boipeba formation the boipeba target is a three way dip closed fault bounded structure that has not been explored at the tie field previously the attic well is expected to take 30 60 days to drill test and complete the ceo jonas lindvall commented we are very pleased with the drilling results of the 107d horizontal hole so far we proved up the continuous nature of the sand which allows for this type of drainage technology to be applied on future wells we are also excited about the very good to excellent oil and gas shows documented throughout the drilled sandstone the hole conditions were very tough and future horizontals will be designed differently whereby the hole section leading up the horizontal hole will be cased off before drilling the horizontal 2018 capital plan the completion of the 107d sidetrack and the workover at 7ttg took longer and were more difficult than anticipated while the final costs are being evaluated it is expected the two tartaruga projects are approximately 25 over budget combined at the tie field the drilling of the attic well the proposed water supply well and the last work on gte3 will occur in 2019 fortunately much of the other work at the tie field and lak field in the 2018 capital plan that has been completed was well under budget as at the end of november 2018 the overall cost over run for the adjusted 2018 budget is 6 the company remains optimistic once all the numbers are in the overall cost of the adjusted 2018 capital program will be within 10 of original budgeted amounts notwithstanding the above delays and difficulties 1 whilst an open hole completion is the preferred method of completing wells in most cases in this case there is a slightly heightened risk of future hole collapse which could possibly restrict production given the circumstances it is deemed as an acceptable risk the adviser fnca sweden ab is
