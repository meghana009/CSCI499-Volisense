america s central bank has pressed ahead with its biggest interest rate hike since 1994 as it battles red hot inflation the federal reserve bumped up its base rate by 0 75 percentage points last night to the range of 1 5 per cent to 1 75 per cent warning that the cost of living crisis is still ravaging the economy inflation in the us hit 8 6 per cent last month the highest in 40 years resolve the federal reserve s chairman jerome powell pictured warned the cost of living crisis is still ravaging the us economy and while officials were worried that hiking interest rates too fast could throw the covid recovery into reverse the fed now seems to be more concerned about the squeeze which higher prices are applying to households and businesses the fed s rate setting open market committee said overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter job gains have been robust in recent months and the unemployment rate has remained low inflation remains elevated reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic higher energy prices and broader price pressures the 0 75 percentage point rate hike is a momentous move for the fed the central bank usually prefers to move the dial by a more gradual 0 25 percentage points the rare bumper hike is a sign of just how worried policymakers are becoming about rising prices adding to the drama the fed also dramatically raised its forecasts for future interest rates projecting its key rate could hit 3 8 per cent by 2024 richard carter of investment firm quilter cheviot said the federal reserve has decided now is the time to up its aggressiveness in the battle against inflation choosing to raise interest rates by 0 75 percentage points looks justified given the unrelenting inflation pressures being seen in the us at the moment there is no doubt that the fed got themselves behind the curve on inflation and are now having to make up for lost time and we expect to see several more rate hikes before the year is out inflation has been stickier and more persistent than was expected so it is unlikely now that this problem will simply just dissipate quickly over the second half of the year ecb short on details the european central bank ecb underwhelmed investors after calling an emergency meeting yesterday policy makers met amid turmoil in bond markets prompted by inflation fears which was pushing up governments borrowing costs the move prompted speculation that the central bank would announce a policy to stave off a debt crisis in the eurozone which could hit indebted countries such as italy hard it said it would accelerate completion of a tool to ensure the economies did not fragment into their separate regions hetal mehta of legal general said the ecb statement was short on details he noted that there was no sign of the oil price slipping significantly and said it could even rise further when china switches back on following various lockdowns the fed s aggressive hike will pile pressure on the bank of england which is due to announce its latest interest rate decision today rates in the uk are currently at 1pc and traders are divided over whether the bank will opt for a 0 25 or 0 5 percentage point rise britain s central bank is walking a finer line than its us counterpart inflation is also at a 40 year high but cracks are already beginning to show in the economy activity contracted for the second month in a row in april and there were signs that the jobs market was beginning to weaken this means the bank has less confidence that it can hike interest rates fiercely though this could tame inflation it will also put a dampener on growth but rising rates in the us are pushing up the value of the dollar at the expense of sterling as investors flock to a currency which is yielding higher returns the pound has slipped 10 per cent against the dollar so far this year though it climbed by 1 33 per cent yesterday as traders placed tentative bets that the bank of england might react to the fed with its own larger rate hike a fall in sterling makes inflation in the uk even worse as british importers find their pounds don t stretch as far when buying goods like oil and food in foreign currencies laith khalaf head of investment analysis at aj bell said the global economy might be slowing but central banks across the developed world are facing an existential question of credibility if they fail to act in the face of such rampant inflation they undermine their very raison d être but by hiking rates aggressively they put pressure on economic activity he added that there would be further thrills and spills in markets as investors digest the end of the era of cheap money

in a multi million dollar oil deal signed in 2015 the daily mail attempted to contact lawyers thought to be representing gumrukcu but they could not be reached for comment despite multiple emails and calls to their offices as well as messages on social media enochian is backed by major investment funds including blackrock and the vanguard group both of which are popular with uk investors the

as a us marshal handcuffed davis and then shot him multiple times in the head and torso court documents filed by prosecutors say that gumrukcu has a background as a magician gumrukcu had worked in turkey as a magician under the stage name dr no before he arrived in the us according to a report published last month by investment research outfit hindenburg which is betting against enochian s share price hindenburg previously hit the headlines in may when it became involved in a spat with tesla boss elon musk after predicting twitter s share price could crash by 50 per cent if he walked away from his takeover attempt gumrukcu previously appeared in turkish media claiming to be able to bend spoons according to the hindenburg report he was endorsed in a now deleted post by fellow spoonbender uri geller his penchant for promoting seemingly superhuman abilities extended into other areas of his life he previously claimed to have a more than photographic memory as well as the

rights and company technology according to securities and exchange commission sec filings in the four years since gumrukcu and his firms have been paid an estimated 16million 20million by enochian

lifestyle including trips to las vegas and the oscars ceremony he has been pictured with actress mirren and at a hollywood film premiere alongside supermodel klum gumrukcu was even snapped at a party hosted by elton john s aids foundation at this year s oscars attended by top celebrities including lady gaga his personal stake in enochian around 17 per cent of the company is worth around 27million

if you ve never tried korean food before mikey reisenberg would like to meet you those are my favorite people honestly the harrisonburg based chef said i love to find someone who is a little reserved about trying something adventurous and then having the opportunity to blow their minds he s been blowing minds around harrisonburg since 2013 when he opened a food truck to offer korean inspired dishes like steamed buns quick pickled kimchi and bulgogi six years later he opened a brick and mortar space in downtown harrisonburg both go by the same name mashita which is korean for delicious reisenberg s interest in korean food began as a pathway to learn more about his biological roots born in seoul he was adopted as an infant brought to the united states and raised in the shenandoah valley his food memories from childhood are of pickled eggs and potato salad as well as snapping green beans in the summer heat my family was very focused on maintaining a dinner time for the family he said the day centered on gathering at the same time at the same dinner table to share what happened in your day and connect with each other despite that warm and secure family footing reisenberg sometimes felt pulled in another direction i always struggled with my korean identity and not really knowing that part of myself he said so a lot of my exploration of food has been an exploration of my own cultural identity but his first foray into cooking wasn t korean at all i was working in a bunch of restaurants just trying to gain as much knowledge as possible about all cultures he said noodles fascinated me the most so i worked in some italian restaurants just hoping to learn more about making them from scratch he later worked for the joshua wilton house with mentors who encouraged his interest in all kinds of cooking they were the ones who introduced me to more asian focused cooking styles he said and to some of the french influences in cooking and fine dining reisenberg began to experiment with traditional korean foods using some of the approaches he had learned by preparing italian and french meals that multifaceted approach is part of mashita s success today we always say that our food is korean inspired he said although we try and replicate some of the major components and characteristics of korean food we also try and take a chef minded approach to changing those flavors or changing the overall effect reisenberg also added some of what he learned in his own mother s kitchen which provided the basis for one of his favorite korean inspired dishes it s called kimchi jjigae he said a very traditional korean stew when i first started making it it reminded me so much of the cabbage soup my parents made when i was growing up so now the way we prepare it in the restaurant uses the foundation of my mother s cabbage soup recipe and it means so much to me it reminds me of home reisenberg s interest in the food customs of his birthplace has led him to learn more about its history and culture when building out the space for his restaurant he made sure to include the obok a traditional korean design in which blessings like health and wealth are represented by stylized images of bats this is something i didn t know about at all until i started cooking korean food he said it led me to exploring korean words expressions and the traditions and cultures that produced the food reisenberg said he has enjoyed finding the common threads shared by the land of his birth and the one he calls home including a tradition of preserving seasonal vegetables through pickling or fermentation while traditional kimchi is fermented that process requires time and storage space that didn t mesh well with a food truck business model it was way easier for us to market a quick pickled kimchi that is reminiscent of spicy southern style pickles he said we still to this day have a ton of people that will only eat our kimchi and will never eat a traditional fermented version of kimchi because they think ours is the best by continuing to experiment with fresh ingredients and multiple influences reisenberg hopes to keep successfully honoring both nations that shaped him the thing i struggled with most as a kid was the expectation that i should be like something he said but i just wasn t sure what that was exploring my american and korean cultures and finding things i love about both is how i became who i am recipe of kimchi jjigae 4 onions 2 heads green cabbage kimchi liquid or 8 cups napa cabbage kimchi 5lbs ground beef 3 quarts savory stock chicken pork or beef 28oz crushed tomatoes 2 3 cups gochujang paste or to taste 1 bulb crushed garlic scallions for garnish tofu to finish bowls pork belly to finish bowls thinly sliced rice cakes optional halve the onions and cut into half moons about 1 8th of an inch thick cut green cabbage or napa kimchi into 1 x1 squares crush and mince garlic bulb to prepare your mise en place to begin start by browning

4 sections once julienned drop cut scallions into ice water to shock them into staying bright green and allowing them to curl into a beautiful garnish drain the scallions well before using slice tofu

over medium high heat with a tablespoon of vegetable oil cooking the tofu and pork belly until lightly golden shingle or domino the tofu and pork belly in an alternating pattern set on top of the

higher rates make mortgages and the housing market one of the first places to feel the impact of the latest rate hike chuck zodda it can get significantly more expensive to try to actually buy that place with rates where they are right now reporter the point to cool demand by raising rates the feds make it more expensive to take out loans hoping it translates to less borrowing and spending higher mortgage rates mean the same house today will cost 30 more per month than last year if you re putting 20 down on a 30 year mortgage it s typically going to raise your borrowing costs by 10 for every 1 that rates are higher reporter new car loans also expected to climb and if you can try to pay off that credit card debt the average balance in the u s 5010 your annual percentage rate will jump from 17 and a quarter to 18 meaning 283 dollars in extra interest the downside of this approach is that it s a pretty broad brush and so that slowing of the economy can in some cases produce a recession and then can lead to some job loss i do not think the u s is currently in a recession the reason is there s too many areas of the economy that are performing too well reporter right now the job market is strong and consumers are still spending experts say it may take time to bring inflation under control it s going to take 12 to 18 months for it to subside if it does reporter what does this mean for savings account and cd rates we re liv advertisement how the federal reserve s rate hikes affect your finances share copy link copy video above fed unleashes another hefty rate hikehigher mortgage rates have sent home sales tumbling credit card rates have grown more burdensome and so have auto loans savers are finally receiving yields that are actually visible while crypto assets are reeling the federal reserve s move wednesday to further tighten credit raised its benchmark interest rate by a sizable 0 75 percentage point for a second straight time the fed s latest hike its fourth since march will further magnify borrowing costs for homes cars and credit cards though many borrowers may not feel the impact immediately the central bank is aggressively raising borrowing costs to try to slow spending cool the economy and defeat the worst outbreak of inflation in two generations the fed s actions have ended for now an era of ultra low rates that arose from the 2008 2009 great recession to help rescue the economy and then re emerged during the brutal pandemic recession when the fed slashed its benchmark rate back to near zero chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in slowing demand for homes cars and other goods and services reduced spending could then help bring inflation most recently measured at a four decade high of 9 1 back to the fed s 2 target video above recession fears spark anxietyyet the risks are high a series of higher rates could tip the u s economy into recession that would mean higher unemployment rising layoffs and further downward pressure on stock prices how will it all affect your finances here are some of the most common questions being asked about the impact of the rate hike i m considering buying a house what s happening with mortgage rates higher interest rates have torpedoed the housing market rates on home loans have nearly doubled from a year ago to 5 5 though they ve leveled off in recent weeks even as the fed has signaled that more credit tightening is likely that s because mortgage rates don t necessarily move in tandem with the fed s increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these factors include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys investors expect a recession to hit the u s economy later this year or early next year this would force the fed to eventually cut its benchmark rate in response the expectation that the fed will have to reverse some of its hikes next year has helped reduce the 10 year yield from 3 5 in mid june to roughly 2 8 will it be easier to find a house sales of existing homes have dropped for five straight months while new home sales plunged in june if you re financially able to go ahead with a home purchase you re likely to have more choices than you did a few months ago in many cities the options are few but the number of available houses nationwide has started to rise after falling to rock bottom levels at the end of last year there are now 1 26 million homes for sale according to the national association of realtors up 2 4 from a year ago i need a new car should i buy one now the fed s rate hikes typically make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers which can sometimes lower borrowing costs wednesday s rate hike won t likely affect new vehicle sales much because those buyers are mainly affluent customers who won t be squeezed by a relatively small uptick in monthly payments said jonathan smoke chief economist for cox automotive by contrast he said used car buyers with weaker credit who pay higher loan rates could be hurt video above florida woman surprised to see inflation fee on restaurant bill many used vehicle buyers are already acutely feeling the impacts of higher prices for energy food and rent smoke said used vehicle prices have begun to fall he noted and vehicle availability is beginning to return to normal levels the full amount of a fed rate hike doesn t always pass through to auto loans according to bankrate com new 60 month loans for new vehicles have risen about a percentage point this year to an average of 4 86 bankrate com says while a 48 month used vehicle rate rose just under 1 point to 5 38 what will happen to my credit card for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does the fed s rate increases have already sent credit card borrowing rates above 20 for the first time in at least four years according to lendingtree which has tracked the data since 2018 how will this affect my savings you can now earn more on bonds cds and other fixed income investments and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to boost their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts are often an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits how have the rate hikes influenced crypto like many highly valued technology stocks cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have sunk in value since the fed began raising rates bitcoin has plunged from a peak at about 68 000 to 21 000 higher rates mean that safe assets like bonds and treasuries become more attractive to investors because their yields are now higher that in turn makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive all that said bitcoin is suffering from its own problems that are separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed the shaken confidence of crypto investors is not being helped by the fact that the safest place you can park money now bonds seems like a safer move will my

by koh gui qing new york reuters global stocks rallied and government bond yields and the dollar retreated from multi year highs on wednesday as investors cheered the federal reserve s decision to raise interest rates by three fourths of a percentage point the biggest increase since 1994 investors seemed relieved that the u s central bank had met the market s expectations that it will act aggressively to tame surging inflation and appeared for now to be comfortable with the fed s projection that the economy is likely to slow in the next two years minutes after the rate hike that was widely predicted by the market stocks had initially pared gains as investors worried about the prospect of tighter monetary policy tipping the economy into a recession but by late afternoon in new york investors had cast aside growth concerns and instead took the view that the economy was better off in the long run if the fed succeeded in reining in prices now the ended the session by jumping 1 the leapt 1 46 and the climbed 2 5 the buoyancy was reflected in global equities msci s gauge of stocks across the globe also zoomed up 1 10 after hitting its lowest in about 1 1 2 years earlier this week today s move by the fed to progress faster to neutral will be applauded in the long run by the economy business decision makers and ultimately by markets said rick rieder the chief investment officer of global fixed income and the head of the global allocation investment team at blackrock nyse the market s relief that the fed had delivered what it expected extended to treasuries the yield on benchmark 10 year treasuries pulled back to 3 291 down from an 11 year peak of 3 498 struck on tuesday the yield on two year treasuries also slipped to 3 2096 well under tuesday s high 3 456 a level last seen in 2007 at a news conference following the rate rise fed chair jerome powell said that either a 50 or 75 basis point rate increase at its next policy meeting in july seemed most likely and that the economy is strong enough to handle tighter policy whether or not we can escape this without a recession is coming into question said ellen hazen chief market strategist at f l putnam investment management in massachusetts the runway for them to have a soft landing just got shorter and narrower meaning that they are anticipating higher inflation they are anticipating higher unemployment they are anticipating lower gdp gross domestic product hazen said ecb surprise worries about rising borrowing costs and global inflation have hammered financial markets all year world stocks are down over 20 bond markets have been routed and fears that drastic fed action could tip the world into a recession means the fed s moves later will be crucial for traders but global stocks and bonds had rallied on wednesday before the fed meeting buoyed by a surprise announcement from the european central bank ecb that it will work to avoid a debt crisis due to rising borrowing costs by supporting high debt member states and devising a new tool to manage the risks though some investors thought the ecb s proposed measures were not bold enough european shares jumped and government bond yields in countries such as italy spain and portugal which will benefit from the ecb s plans pulled back italy s 10 year bond yield which stands to benefit the most from the ecb s plans was last down at 3 91 above its session low of 3 799 spanish and portuguese 10 year yields also came off their day s lows but were still sharply down on the day given many u s borrowing rates are linked to yields financial conditions have already tightened markedly there even before the fed hikes ecb chief christine lagarde tried to talk down expectations on wednesday about how much the european central bank should do to avert a debt crisis arguing that the ecb s job is to tame inflation not help budgets we cannot surrender to fiscal dominance lagarde said at a forum in london neither can we surrender to finance dominance we have to deliver on our mandate with wednesday s fed rate rise already priced in by the market the took a breather after charging to a 20 year high of 105 79 earlier in the day by

in a place where we can actually put us in a place where the american people feel can actually we can take on inflation stated white house press secretary karine jean pierre in a train wreck interview on monday s cnn don lemon tonight welcomed by lemon jean pierre struggled to defend president biden in his work for the country placing blame for the economy on other outside factors and even explicitly stating that the country needs to be in a good historic economic place which is where we are right now lemon probing further questions about the economy asked if president biden was was being realistic about just how much this is impacting americans and their pocketbooks stating that biden has inflation as his top priority for the economy jean pierre made it clear where these high prices are stemming from praising the american rescue plan passed by biden and pushing unemployment statistics she reminded lemon we got to remember we re thinking about gas prices and food this is coming from putin s war against ukraine it is all putin s fault and biden is helping the economy surprisingly lemon actually called her out by noting we have rising inflation and gas prices before the war they also say that last year s stimulus package which you mentioned contributed to inflation he added fumbling for words to convince lemon about the president s win for gun legislation the press secretary stated the following so the president has has done everything that he he can from from from the white house to take to call to call on congress to act so this is one step forward right we haven t seen anything like this a bipartisanship agreement on gun reform in decades in a generation even convincing right lemon faced heat on both tuesday and wednesday morning for suggesting that the president may not be fit to lead asking jean pierre about his mental and physical stamina to even run again in 2024 a valid question one that jean pierre answered that is i ve that is not a question we should be even asking just look at the work that he does look how he s delivering for the american public touching on a recent new york times article with the headline should biden run in 2024 democratic whispers of no start to rise press secretary jean pierre quickly discredited the work stating that the article is hearsay it s salacious but what about from the words of congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez ocasio cortez i believe that the president has been doing a very good job so far and you know should he run again i think that i you know it s it s we ll take a look at it rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny we ll cross that bridge when we get to it but i think if the president has a vision and that s something certainly we re all willing to entertain and examine when the time comes referencing that interview between aoc with cnn host dana bash to ease lemon and the public watching jean pierre grasped at straws noting the congresswoman did say the president is doing a good job so that s good right this segment is sponsored by wendy s and whole foods market their contact information is linked click expand to read the full transcript cnn don lemon tonight 06 13 2022 10 40 40 p m eastern don lemon a bad day for wall street with stocks plunging into bear market territory the dow sliding 876 points on concerns the federal reserve may raise interest rates by as much as three quarters of a percentage point to address raging inflation something the fed hasn t done since 1994 the rough day for stocks follows more bad news for the economy the national average price for gas hitting an all time high of 5 a gallon and the latest inflation data show showing that energy and food prices soaring over the past year energy up by more than 34 percent food by more than 10 percent despite all of this the white house claiming that american consumers are quote well positioned to face these economic challenges and reiterating that president biden s plan plans to run for election in 2024 so joining me now to talk about all of this is the white house press secretary karine jean pierre karine thank you that was a big buildup not really great news because when it comes to the economy good evening to you crosstalk white house press secretary karine jean pierre it was a build up but thank you for having me lemon good evening to you the economy absolutely the economy clearly in a rough spot is the president being realistic about just how much this is impacting americans and their pocketbooks jean pierre well the president understands how much this is impacting americans and their pocketbooks this is a president that understands what happens around the kitchen table he grew up in scranton pennsylvania when prices go up just a little bit it really hurts families and he understands the anxiety that people are currently feeling look he has made this his top economic priority as we re talking about inflation as we re talking about the economy like we have to remember where this country was more than a year ago when he walked into office the economy was not in a great place schools were closed businesses were closed we didn t have a comprehensive covid covid strategy and what he ended up doing was meet that moment pass the american rescue plan only democrats passed that plan he signed it it was his plan and now we re seeing an economy that s bouncing back eight million jobs 8 7 million jobs created unemployment is low so that is why we believe we re in a good position to take on inflation but yes we understand that folks are feeling this and we got to remember we got to remember we re thinking about gas prices and food this is coming from putin s war against ukraine the moment that putin amassed forces on the border of ukraine we saw from then until now we have seen a 2 increase per gallon on gas lemon ok jean pierre and so this is a big part of it too because we have to understand don where this comes from as well lemon ok i understand that jean pierre yes lemon but listen before putin you know the war started i remember i remember when the first bombs dropped i was on the air with matthew chance reporting live and although crosstalk jean pierre i remember i saw you lemon the economists do cite the war in ukraine and supply chain issues we did have that before the war supply chain issues they also say that last year s stimulus package which you mentioned contributed to inflation karine does the biden administration bear some responsibility for this jean pierre so first of all the american rescue plan met the moment and it has put us in a place where we can actually put us in a place where the american people feel can actually we can take on inflation what i mean by that is we ve seen growth right with as i mentioned more than eight million jobs and now we re transitioning into a steady stable growth the president actually wrote an op ed to discuss that himself lay out his plan on how we re going to bring down inflation and so that s really important in order to take this on we ve got to be in a good historic economic place which is where we are right now lemon i want to bring in i want to talk about this bipartisan agreement on gun control karine it includes an enhanced review process for buyers under 21 and resources for states to enact red flag laws but it s also missing a lot of what the administration wanted including an assault weapon ban and raising the age to purchase assault weapons to 21 does president biden still see this as a win jean pierre so here s the thing you know president biden understands and he knows like this doesn t have everything that he even called for but when he went down to uvalde recently to meet with the parents to meet with the community to meet with the vic the families of the victims and some of the victims as well they said please do something so the president has has done everything that he he can from from from the white house to take to call to call on congress to act so this is one step forward right we haven t seen anything like this a bipartisanship agreement on gun reform in decades in a generation even and so the fact that we have seen those two sides come together they negotiated they re legislating right now that is a step forward and that s what negotiation looks like the president s going to continue to fight and to call on the other items that he has put forward as what he believes the banning of assault weapons you know national red flag laws and all of these things that he believes that will make our country safer lemon but jean pierre and here s the thing don what this is about is about saving lives so he wants congress to write the text get that passed and get it to his desk as soon as possible lemon we ve got a lot more to talk about including 2024 that s next lemon president biden and democrats facing a lot of challenges in the run up to this year s mid term elections and it is raising questions about how the party and the white house should look ahead to the 2024 presidential election more with my interview from the white house press secretary karine jean pierre we re just coming up on the midterms but as you know presidents only get to serve so long before they have to start campaigning again and running again and president biden i don t know if i m sure you ve read there was a new york times article talking about the whispers are growing louder inside the democratic party facing doubt that some that in the democratic party about his plans to run a second term i want you to listen this is what congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez told cnn when asked if she would support biden in 2024 here it is rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny we ll cross that bridge when we get to it but i think if the president has a vison and that s something certainly we re all willing to entertain and examine when the time comes bash that s not a yes ocasio cortez i believe that the president has been doing a very good job so far and you know should he run again i think that i you know it s it s we ll take a look at it lemon okay so as i understand you you assured or you reiterated that the president does plan to run in 2024 right to run again jean pierre so first of all the congresswoman did say the president is doing a good job so that s good right lemon yes jean pierre so i just want to really highlight that because many people agree with that look crosstalk lemon but he is going to run in 2024 jean pierre there s a there s a well let me just say there is a you know there is two there is something called the hatch act that i have to be very mindful of what i can say is the president has repeatedly said that he plans he plans to run in 2024 and i m going to have to leave it there lemon ok ok but then but are you concerned is the administration worried that there are democrats who are not openly endorsing the president come 2024 even though you can t say for sure if crosstalk jean pierre i really can t get i can t into that all i can say is what the president intends to do what the president plans to do and look at the end of the day don our focus is to deliver for the american people that s the work that we ve been doing with the economy that s the work that we ve been doing with covid when he walked in again let s not forget when he walked in as looking at covid there was no there was no comprehensive plan to get people vaccinated now more than 200 million people are getting vaccinated the one thing i do want to say is as we are working on plans to lower inflation deal with gas prices you know you have the other side you have republicans and what they re doing is they re putting out a plan rick scott senator rick scott put out a plan on how he wants to raise taxes on people making less than 100 000 and so crosstalk lemon listen karine i understand that jean pierre sunset medicare medicare and social security things that are so important crosstalk lemon i understand those are important policy issues jean pierre to communities across the country lemon those are you re right those are important policy issues and that and those should be discussed and they re discussed in every presidential election and they re discussed all the time but the concern is jean pierre yes lemon the president during interviews where he doesn t seem to answer questions directly or at times succinctly there is his approval ratings according to the latest gallup poll 40 percent of americans approve of biden s job as president jean pierre don lemon so how do you how does he and you because you are the spokesperson for the white house plan to assure voters that he is still the best candidate to beat trump is he is he at his best right now jean pierre well i think the thing that americans love about president biden is he s a straight shooter he is a straight shooter and he says it the way he sees it and he calls it out and that is the thing that makes him genuine and authentic and real and people really really connect with this president i see it myself when we go into we re going to philly pennsylvania i ll see it then we just came back from new mexico we were in l a in l a california i travel with him all across the country and i see how people feel about this president and how much they appreciate what he has done and i think that matters as far as the polls our focus again is delivering for the american people we re making inflation our number one economic policy there s other issues that the president has to deal with and that is what he s going to focus on and that s how he s going to continue crosstalk lemon and there s no concern within the administration about the president s polling jean pierre that s not what we re talking about here we re focused we are genuinely focused on how we can get the work done on behalf of the american people lemon does the president has the stamina physically and mentally do you think to continue on even after 2024 jean pierre don you re asking me this question my gosh he s the president of the united states you know he i can t even keep up with him we just got back from new mexico we just got back from california that is i ve that is not a question that we should be even asking just look at the work that he does look how he s delivering for the american public look that was that article that we re talking about is hearsay it s salacious that s not what we care about we care about how are we going to deliver for the american people how are we going to make their lives better that s what the president talks about that is his focus and that s what we re going to continue to focus on lemon karine jean pierre thank you i really appreciate you coming on please come back jean pierre all right don thanks for having me lemon thank you jean pierre i m happy to come back any time lemon thank you very much jean pierre all right bye bye
policymakers economists and journalists often talk about the business cycle using the good and evil language of a fairy tale booms are attributed to wise and enlightened policies while recessions are blamed on policy errors or the need to cleanse previous excess but the economy is not a morality play expansions are not a reward for virtuous and wise actions and recessions are not a punishment for bad behaviour and mistakes wrenching cycles in production employment prices and wages can be traced as far back in history as the data will allow economic performance to be reconstructed the trade cycle of booms and busts goes back at least as far as the early nineteenth century in britain and north america only the paucity of data on output and employment limits tracing it back into early modern and medieval europe cyclical volatility seems to reflect fundamental forces rather than blameworthy behaviour by central banks finance ministries markets businesses and households there is no sign policymakers can stabilise the cycle if they have enough information and insight about the workings of the economy long expansions in the 1990s the early 2000s and the 2010s resulted in premature pronouncements about the end of the business cycle only to be followed by recessions in 2001 2008 and 2020 spare capacity in the case of the oil market spare production capacity inventories and prices in both crude oil and refined products are closely correlated with the business cycle prolonged business cycle expansions result in the progressive erosion of spare crude production and refinery capacity as well as stocks and eventually put strong upward pressure on crude prices and refining margins recessions restore a higher margin of capacity and inventories in both crude and refining and result in downward pressure on prices and margins at present the global economy is rapidly running out of spare capacity to produce more crude and turn it into refined fuels especially diesel the rapid rebound in oil consumption in the aftermath of the pandemic has been compounded by russia s invasion of ukraine and the u s and european sanctions that have been imposed in response the result is an accelerating increase in crude prices and refining margins which mirrors the end of earlier booms in 2008 and 2001 in the united states the biden administration has been reduced to pleading impotently for an increase in oil production and trying to magic up more refining capacity in the short term but based on past experience the only resolution is a sharp slowdown in the business cycle to restore higher levels of spare capacity and reverse some of the run up in prices and margins the problem of consumption outstripping production capacity is not limited to oil the same tensions are evident in a host of other markets for commodities including gas electricity and coal as well as food manufactured items and services creating a broad based inflation problem central banks in the united states and around the world have started to raise interest rates sharply to reduce inflation by forcing slower growth in consumption and investment at this point a business cycle slowdown has become inevitable because the only alternative is worsening shortages and accelerating inflation the only question is whether it will be a gentle one in which case it will be called a soft patch and the current cycle will be said to continue or a more severe one in which case it will be termed a recession and the cycle will start all over again one way or another the rate of economic growth must slow to bring the oil market back into balance source reuters editing by edmund blair
washington ap the federal reserve intensified its fight against high inflation on wednesday raising its key interest rate by three quarters of a point the largest bump since 1994 and signaling more rate hikes ahead as it tries to cool off the u s economy without causing a recession the unusually large rate hike came after data released friday showed u s inflation rose last month to a four decade high of 8 6 the fed s benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans will now be pegged to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 and fed policymakers forecast a doubling of that range by year s end asked why the fed was announcing a more aggressive rate hike than the half point increase he had earlier signaled fed chair jay powell replied that the latest data had shown inflation to be hotter than anticipated and that the public s expectation of rising inflation had strengthened we thought strong action was warranted at this meeting he said and we delivered that powell said that another three quarter point hike is possible at the fed s next meeting in late july if inflation pressures remain high although he said such increases would not be common the fed s decision to impose a rate hike as large as it did wednesday was an acknowledgment that it s struggling to curb the pace and persistence of inflation which is being fueled by a strong labor market pandemic related supply disruptions and soaring energy prices that have been aggravated by russia s invasion of ukraine powell said he believes the economy is strong enough to endure higher rates without tipping into a recession a prospect that many economists are increasingly worried about some analysts said they welcomed the fed s more aggressive posture the more the fed does now the less they will have to later said thomas garretson senior portfolio strategist at rcb wealth management inflation has shot to the top of voter concerns in the months before congress midterm elections souring the public s view of the economy weakening president joe biden s approval ratings and raising the likelihood of democratic losses in november biden has sought to show he recognizes the pain that inflation is causing american households but has struggled to find policy actions that might make a real difference the president has stressed his belief that the power to curb inflation rests mainly with the fed yet the fed s rate hikes are blunt tools for trying to lower inflation while also sustaining growth shortages of oil gasoline and food are escalating prices the fed isn t ideally suited to address many of the roots of inflation which involve russia s invasion of ukraine still clogged global supply chains labor shortages and surging demand for services from airline tickets to restaurant meals at his news conference powell struck a defensive note when asked whether the fed was now prepared to accept a recession as the price of curbing inflation and bringing it close to the fed 2 target level we re not trying to induce a recession now he said let s be clear about that we re trying to achieve 2 inflation borrowing costs have already risen sharply across much of the u s economy in response to the fed s moves with the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate topping 6 its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis up from just 3 at the start of the year the yield on the 2 year treasury note a benchmark for corporate borrowing has jumped to 3 3 its highest level since 2007 even if a recession can be avoided economists say it s almost inevitable that the fed will have to inflict some pain most likely in the form of higher unemployment as the price of defeating chronically high inflation in their updated forecasts wednesday the fed s policymakers indicated that after this year s rate increases they foresee two more rate hikes by the end of 2023 at which point they expect inflation to finally fall below 3 close to their target level but they expect inflation to still be 5 2 at the end of this year much higher than they d estimated in march over the next two years the officials are forecasting a much weaker economy than was envisioned in march they expect the unemployment rate to reach 3 7 by year s end and 3 9 by the end of 2023 those are only slight increases from the current 3 6 jobless rate but they mark the first time since it began raising rates that the fed has acknowledged that its actions will weaken the economy the central bank has also sharply lowered its projections for economic growth to 1 7 this year and next that s below its outlook in march but better than some economists expectation for a recession next year investments around the world from bonds to bitcoin have tumbled on fears surrounding inflation and the prospect that the fed s aggressive drive to control it will cause a recession even if the fed manages the delicate trick of curbing inflation without causing a downturn higher rates will nevertheless inflict pressure on stocks the s p 500 has already sunk more than 20 this year meeting the definition of a bear market on wednesday the s p 500 rose 1 5 the two year treasury yield fell to 3 26 from 3 45 late tuesday with the biggest move happening after powell said not to expect 0 75 percentage point rate hikes to be common other central banks are also acting swiftly to try to quell inflation even with their nations at greater risk of recession than the u s the european central bank is expected to raise rates by a quarter point in july its first increase in 11 years it could announce a larger hike in september if record high levels of inflation persist on wednesday the ecb vowed to create a market backstop that could buffer member countries against financial turmoil of the kind that erupted during a debt crisis more than a decade ago the bank of england has raised rates four times since december to a 13 year high despite predictions that economic growth will be unchanged in the second quarter the boe will hold an interest rate meeting on thursday last week the world bank warned of the threat of stagflation slow growth accompanied by high inflation around the world all contents copyright

straight news anchor with a penchant to lean leftward that ingratiated him with the anti fox crowd and liberal media elites smith revealed in a press release that he recently asked that he be allow to leave fox news and begin a new chapter and fter requesting that i stay they graciously obliged with the release emailed out during the final commercial break smith announced to viewers at 3 57 p m eastern that he had a personal moment to share about leaving a profession in which athering and reporting the news has been my life s work following 33 years the past 23 right here since the day we launched fox news channel in 1996 after expressing gratitude for the opportunities afforded this guy from small town mississippi shep thanked his colleagues as being the most talented dedicated and focused professionals i ve ever known who sacrifice endlessly and tirelessly to get the news exactly right and i am so proud of them and i am honored to have anchored their work each day then came the heart of the matter which was his immediate departure that he had a non compete agreement at least in the near future before making any other moves a word about journalism which will surely be trumpeted by the anti fox cabal and a goodbye click expand so recently i asked the company to allow me to leave fox news after requesting that i stay they obliged under our agreement i won t be reporting elsewhere at least in the near future but i will be able to see more of gio and lucia and our friends and family and then we ll see what comes along this is my last newscast here thank you for watching today and over the decades as i traveled to many of your communities and anchored this program studio b and fox report plus endless marathon hours of breaking news it s been an honor and my pleasure even in our currently polarized nation it s my hope that the facts will win the day that the truth will always matter that journalism and journalist will thrive i m shepard smith fox news new york the task of following the sudden departure fell to your world and host neil cavuto who was shocked at the announcement click expand whoa i m neil cavuto and like you i m a little stunned and a little heartbroken i don t know what to say shepard smith as i said just a few days ago on this very network a decent human being a heart as big as texas i didn t say texas at the time maybe just all of manhattan wow i don t know a better newsman you probably cannot find again a bigger more emotionally connected to humankind you cannot find so shepherd i don t know what the heck you are planning to do or where you will go but i just know you ll be great at doing it and you you deserve the best that life has to offer so i m sorry if i m a little shell shocked here but i m going to miss my buddy alright onto the news at hand as shepard would say because breaking news does change everything and we ve got a lot of it going on right now cavuto tried to dive into news regarding a preliminary trade agreement between china and the united states in tossing to a similarly emotional john roberts cavuto said i apologize of being a little shell shocked on this other development here but take it away sir i ve just been trying to compile my thoughts too neil i walked out here to do the hit and suddenly got hit by a subway train holy mackerel let s try to get to the news at hand as i digest the other news that we just heard oh my god it s completely shocking roberts replied after roberts cavuto reverted back to shep before moving on with the rest of the show because i can t ignore the elephant in the room and the elephant who s leaving the room which has left him bummed and a little shell shocked later cavuto ended the show with some brief but poignant thoughts on his friend just a final few words if i may in the last 30 seconds we have about my friend and colleague of some 23 years shepard smith leaving this network he defined this network in the early days as reporter second to none and a journalist who always tried to get the story right and hold truth to power and of course there s always the back and forth between those conservatives do get upset liberals who want to know more and we we politicize everything so i can only talk from the human being perspective a damn good one we ll miss you shep back to the press release the fnc press release said that going forward and starting on monday a series of rotating anchors will host the 3pm et time slot until a new dayside news program is announced the release also hailed smith as not only an

get the inside scoop on today s biggest stories in markets tech and business delivered daily read preview in 2021 as companies struggled to find talent amid the great resignation recruiters were arguably the most sought after professionals on the job market millions of workers left their jobs for better pay or benefits and companies needed the help of recruiters to entice top talent to join but as investors and ceos have soured on the economy and tech companies are facing a historic downturn companies are cutting costs via mass layoffs and recruiters often find themselves among the first to get the ax this story is available exclusively to business insider subscribers become an insider and start reading now insider spoke with 10 recruiters who were recently laid off from carvana peloton klarna and sendoso they described layoffs coming abruptly after a period of intense growth often only months after executives boasted about how well their business was doing many requested anonymity to avoid professional repercussions but their identities are known to insider a roaring year of growth slams to a halt while markets and investors briefly pulled back at the start of the pandemic in 2020 2021 was a year of explosive growth cb insights a research firm said global venture capital funding jumped from 294 billion in 2020 to a record high of 621 billion in 2021 advertisement companies sought to capitalize on the new funding by rapidly increasing their head counts which meant the demand for recruiters to bring in more talent rose sharply recruiters aren t cheap while a recruiter s salary varies according to industry and location in tech they can range from about 60 000 for an entry level position to well over 200 000 for experienced technical recruiters insider s analysis of salary data on levels fyi found in a sign of how in demand recruiters were some companies even turned to acquiring recruiting firms wholesale in march 2021 robinhood acquired binc a san francisco recruiting firm for an undisclosed sum bringing the firm s 80 plus recruiters on board and doubling the size of its recruiting operations in august patreon bought clear talent a tech recruiting firm with 40 employees instantly quadrupling the size of its recruiting staff but growth came to an abrupt halt this spring as the war in ukraine put pressure on the global economy rampant inflation squeezed margins the stock market became more volatile and it became more difficult and expensive for companies to borrow advertisement a wave of layoffs is now sweeping the us with crunchbase news which has been tracking layoffs in tech estimating that 19 000 workers have lost their jobs in companywide layoffs so far in 2022 when you ramp too fast at some point you re going to hit that brick wall five recruiters who were laid off from carvana on may 10 said they felt the writing had been on the wall for weeks carvana boasted about becoming the fastest growing e commerce company in history in 2021 but by april 2022 company leaders told regional recruiters to stop making new hires former employees said ceo ernie garcia told employees in a town hall that the company was worried about downward economic trends and that people might not continue to buy cars amid sky high inflation just a few weeks later carvana told 2 500 of its 21 000 employees that they were being laid off the regional recruiting team was hit hard advertisement companies view talent acquisition as a non moneymaker said sandra delgado a former carvana recruiter we fill positions so those positions make money in other departments delgado added that she was part of companywide layoffs twice before joining carvana she said talent acquisition or ta teams were among the first to go in each of her experiences what is ta doing if we re not hiring anyone you know she said another former carvana recruiter who had also been part of companywide layoffs at a previous job said they d seen a similar pattern in the past advertisement when you ramp too fast at some point you re going to hit that brick wall the laid off carvana recruiter said and then you re going to look and see where you can ax a little bit of money for others the focus on recruiters in layoffs has been shortsighted eventually the company is going to need to hire again another recruiter who d been laid off from carvana said it s really hard to build a recruiting team of talented people quickly from scratch saying goodbye to any team member is not a decision we take lightly a carvana spokesperson said and we aim to be transparent thoughtful and supportive throughout this process including providing meaningful assistance resources and support to impacted team members advertisement don t worry about it and keep hiring laid off recruiters at sendoso a corporate gifting startup said they were told to stop making new hires weeks before companywide layoffs were announced on june 6 it was an abrupt shift from five months earlier when they d been told that the company wanted to bring on between 300 and 500 new employees in the first half of 2022 one former recruiter said sendoso raised a 100 million series c funding round led by softbank vision fund in september and announced in april that it was building a 40 million headquarters in phoenix but by may the company s recruiters had gone from having a full plate of positions to hire for to spending their days working almost exclusively on side projects such as improving hiring processes advertisement there were days in that month leading up that i was doing all of my work from my phone a former sendoso recruiter said i didn t even need to open my laptop related stories like carvana s sendoso s executives blamed the layoffs on a difficult economic climate about 100 people from its 700 person workforce were affected at klarna which announced on may 23 that it would cut about 10 of its staff one laid off recruiter said the swedish buy now pay later startup s approach to hiring was different from other companies they d worked at the company was flush raising 650 million in september 2020 1 billion in march 2021 and 639 million in june 2021 the recruiter who joined in early 2021 said the usual haggling over hiring budgets and the back and forth to receive approval to make a hire seemed nonexistent despite repeatedly asking for more clarity about budgets and other financial information the recruiter said they were told to focus on hiring more talent as quickly as possible advertisement basically what you re essentially being told is don t worry about it and keep hiring they said the recruiter said the rapid growth was ultimately worrying that always concerned me because i knew at some point we couldn t just keep scaling the same way and teams probably were getting a bit bloated they said a spokesperson for klarna declined to comment advertisement a technical recruiter laid off by peloton in february said the job market for recruiters was on fire when they joined the startup in 2021 their orientation cohort included about 30 to 40 other recruiters they said while working at peloton the recruiter said they were inundated with messages from external recruiters i couldn t tell you how many outreaches i had in 2021 the former peloton recruiter said what really struck me was recruiting managers calling me directly sending voicemails and text messages i don t even know how they obtained my information i really sat back and thought wow this is indicative of how hot and fast the market is right now they said advertisement but the peloton recruiter started to see warning signs at the company and in the industry as a whole in early 2022 after a year of unmitigated growth the startup had suddenly stopped hiring and inbound requests from external recruiters were also slowing the recruiter took the lull as an opportunity to start taking strategic calls in january about potential new jobs at other companies when pelton laid them off in february they were able to land a recruiting role at another high profile tech startup a few weeks later no one s asking me for a head of recruiting right now michael case the ceo of the executive search firm neptune people said that less than a year ago almost every candidate who worked in recruiting or human resources whom his firm was helping place had multiple job offers these days there s not much interest no one s asking me for a head of recruiting right now he said advertisement as soon as things get a bit of a sniff of a recession or downturn or bad news hiring freezes happen and the very first thing that gets cut is recruiting he said case said that for tech companies and startups recruiting teams are often the canary in the coal mine for what may happen to other parts of the company the former peloton recruiter said that after years of experience they d become accustomed to the ups and downs of the job either you re the hero filling roles and adding tremendous value to the organization or you re the cost center and you re seen as expendable they said advertisement case said the downturn might push some recruiters to leave the industry and pursue other roles but those who were able to remain in the field would benefit once the next boom came around in 12 to 18 months there s going to be a huge rebound and a huge demand for recruiters again so those who stick it out are probably going to be in a good spot he said we always land on our feet for many recruiters the mood shift has been striking i would open linkedin at the start of the year even just a month or two ago and i would see i m hiring massive hiring massive growth said a recruiter who was laid off by sendoso now literally i open linkedin and all i see are layoffs advertisement the klarna recruiter said that while looking for their next gig they plan to keep a sharper eye out for red flags they may have been willing to overlook in the past despite what happened at klarna people will reach out with the exact same kind of tone like hey we re hyper scaling with superfast growth they said those words don t exactly resonate well with me because you know on the recruitment side it just means you re gonna be really overworked and then at some point it s gonna come crashing down some laid off recruiters worry the competition for new jobs could be stiff as layoffs have targeted many people with the same background all at once recruiters all share a similar dna the former peloton recruiter said we re very entrepreneurial very resourceful advertisement but they added that the other recruiters affected by the peloton layoffs had almost all made similar quick recoveries recruiters are kind of like cats they said we always land on our feet
the federal reserve raised interest rates by the highest margin in nearly three decades wednesday that comes as the stock market tumbles in bear territory example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video greensboro n c americans are spending 346 more a month compared to last year because of inflation according to moody s analytics it s leading to some really tough choices we re going to dig in 2 a new plan to lower those prices the federal reserve just announced they will raise interest rates in the biggest increase since 1994 we ll explain why that could make a difference but first let s explain why prices are so high right now economy 101 to understand why prices are going up let s head back to economy 101 supply and demand when there is more demand than supply businesses can raise prices for the past two years we ve all heard about supply chain issues the pandemic limited supplies going out at the same time when people came out of the shutdown they were ready to spend many americans saved money when they weren t traveling and going out plus we had all those stimulus checks and historically low interest rates making it cheaper to get a home or car loan too many people wanted to spend all that extra cash and businesses ran out of supply so businesses raised prices now the federal reserve wants to hit the breaks on all that consumer demand to help bring prices back down the fed increased interest rates by three quarters of a point the largest jump in almost 30 years inflation and interest rates inflation persists everywhere each month there s another report showing prices at some of the highest levels in four decades the most recent data showed consumers paying 8 6 more than they were last year the federal reserve has raised interest rates twice already it increased rates by 0 25 in march and 0 5 in may so why does the fed want to do it again inflation remains really high and data showed people started to slow their spending high inflation has forced americans to really separate wants from needs retail sales fell 0 3 in april furniture and home furnishing stores saw sales drop almost a full point according to the u s commerce department we all know how crazy the housing market is since rates went up sales dropped 8 5 in march then 16 5 in april it s slow but there s evidence showing the interest rate hikes have done their job and slowed spending federal reserve chair jerome powell said wednesday he expects other rate increases to come in the future if prices don t follow the results could be bad could actually tip us into a recession if they go too far too fast cbs news business analyst jill schlesinger said it s still too early to know the long term consequences of the rate increases powell said the fed is committed to getting prices back down working to get the supply chain back driving down demand is part of the solution we all need the supply chain to recover president joe biden believes we re seeing some relief there too delivery times are actually quicker than they were before the pandemic and today there are actually about 40 fewer containers clogging the dock for long periods of time than there were last november this may was the strongest month in the port of los angeles history biden said the president said the infrastructure law passed in congress in the fall of 2021 also helped rebuild supply chains the act allocates about 175 billion to roads bridges and railroads that helps truckers and cargo trains transport goods quicker which allows supply to keep moving across the country bear market right now stocks are in a bear market that means the market fell at least 20 from a recent high the s p 500 dropped 21 3 from january following the fed s interest rate increase the stock market rallied it s unclear if the strong showing will be short lived or is a sign of sustained improvement to come what you should do the economy is in a tough spot right now the good news is you can set yourself up for success if you act now here s four things to do to make the interest rate increase work for you call your credit card provider and ask for a lower more often than not they ll work with you see if you can transfer your balance to a credit card with a 0 introductory entrance rate make sure you pay off all your bills before the special rate ends get your credit card back up loans will get more expensive as the fed raises rates to fight inflation if you have a high score you have better odds of getting a lower rate make on time payments every month shop around for high interest savings accounts this will be a great time for you to accrue interest on your savings with rates high the bear market might have you feeling uneasy about your portfolio experts said you don t need to panic and pull all your money out of the market it can actually be a great time to invest george nesseti a financial advisor said you can maximize your 401 k by increasing your contributions that allows you to buy low in more stocks it s all about now now in this environment losing less nesseti said when the market does come back you re

many beginner stock investors start within their registered accounts and can be held for decades thanks to their consistently strong return potential most beginner investors in canada start by investing in their registered accounts both the rrsp and tfsa offer a great way to shelter your investment from the clutches of the cra the tfsa especially offers more flexibility and is ideal for starting a beginner portfolio especially if you only have limited capital to work with and can t split your savings into both registered accounts regardless of whether you place them in your tfsa or rrsp three companies should be on your radar if you are looking for investments you can hold for decades a telecom giant out of the three telecom giants in canada telus tsx t nyse tu has the most consistent growth stream which coupled with its juicy 4 4 yield makes the return potential quite significant it s also one of the most promising 5g stocks in canada and even though its current reach and infrastructure are a far cry from rogers the leader in this domain the company has committed a significant amount of resources to grow its 5g presence in canada the stock has returned roughly 107 to its investors in the last decade through price appreciation alone and as an aristocrat it has been growing its payouts for 18 years as a long term investment not only is the company capable of helping your capital stay well ahead of inflation but any passive income stream you start with this company will also remain beyond inflation s reach an industrial giant another good long term investment you can hold in your registered accounts is waste connections tsx wcn nyse wcn it s one of the largest publicly traded solid waste management companies in the world with an impressive presence in canada and the united states and thanks to its extensive service portfolio a decent portion of which caters to businesses the company has a lot of growth opportunities it s a powerful growth stock that returned roughly 84 to its investors in the last five years and if it keeps growing at this pace you might be able to double your capital in the next seven to eight years however its longevity as an investment comes from more than just its growth potential or its status as a dividend aristocrat but the safety of its business model it s an essential service expected to remain relevant for decades to come an infrastructure company brookfield infrastructure tsx bip un nyse bip represents the infrastructure wing of brookfield asset management one of the largest asset management companies in canada the company has a portfolio of high quality assets like utilities and transport and more time relevant assets like operations the geographic diversification of its portfolio also adds to the stability the stock is a safe bet and will likely remain one for several decades to come but safety is not the only thing it offers it s a healthy grower that has been consistently on the rise since 2009 and has grown over 600 since then that s over 46 growth a year annualized and the consistency of its growth is another reason to hold this winner long term foolish takeaway the three companies are ideal beginner stocks but that doesn t mean they are not useful in the portfolios of seasoned investors they offer a decent mix of growth and stability making them ideal for the simplest and more complex investment portfolios
municipals took a backseat as the federal open market committee announced its decision to implement a three quarter point rate hike while u s treasuries rallied into late afternoon following the news equities rallied the move prompted partly by hotter than expected inflation data friday is the largest rate hike since 1994 investors appear encouraged that the fomc is willing to take forceful action to try and get inflation under control wilmington trust chief economist luke tilley said by front loading rate hikes he said the fomc will have more optionality as the year unfolds and will be able to accelerate hikes if inflation persists but if any cracks appear in the economic recovery they ll have the option to slow down while still having rates below their estimate of neutral triple a muni

data munis were mostly steady throughout the day as broader markets reacted to the fomc decision markets would have been more surprised by a move that wasn t at least 75 basis points said tom kozlik head of municipal research and analytics at hilltopsecurities in a tuesday report he said it s possible that the fed raises a total of 275 basis points by the december meeting despite the three quarter rate hike he said tax exempt and taxable municipal yields relative value indicators and credit spreads are all still very attractive compared to historical pricing and some other fixed income options beyond this there is opportunity in the municipal bond market according to jim conn portfolio manager of municipal bonds for franklin templeton fixed income while volatility is at heightened levels for both rates and quality opportunities are plentiful relative to alternative fixed income markets conn said tuesday we are finding attractive offerings within sectors that traditionally have larger spreads like multifamily housing healthcare charter schools and airports some investors are willing to look past the volatility and anticipated tightening by the fed to participate in the municipal market albeit with some stipulations according to conn the fear associated with heightened market volatility often leads investors to shorten their time horizon he said however overall on a risk adjusted basis the after tax values of municipal bonds are historically attractive conn noted it s difficult to predict when investors will return to net buyers he added if they need an incentive they can turn to the attractive muni ust ratios which have returned to historic levels according to conn this appeals to municipal investors because yields have reached an attractive level on both an absolute and relative basis he noted fundamentally credit spreads provide excessive coverage over historical default rates conn noted additionally current municipal bond yields provide investors with historically elevated returns compared to u s treasury offerings and the long run rate of inflation at the same time the municipal market benefits from its traditionally low default rate not to mention its recent recovery following the pandemic as states fiscal health is strong municipal credit strength is systematically undervalued conn said the historical default experience for investment grade municipal bonds is significantly lower than comparably rated bonds outside of the muni universe as the second half of the year approaches conn has a positive outlook in the municipal market despite some challenges credit strength low supply and taxation all support a constructive outlook for the municipal bond market conn said although demand has weighed down the market year to date conn said franklin s view is that municipal bond prices provide attractive opportunities when investors change their sentiment is difficult to predict he said adding that they will be met with fewer

be appropriate federal reserve bank of kansas city president esther george dissented favoring a 50 basis point increase the fed are now scrambling to get interest rates above neutral as soon as practically possible hiking at an increasing pace at each successive meeting said brian coulton fitch ratings chief economist he pointed to the fed s expectation of a significant rise in unemployment by 2024 and omission in the statement of expected continued labor market strength there s no attempt to sugar the pill anymore or talk about a soft landing it s just all about inflation which is surprising again on the upside with a near 1 increase in their end year pce inflation forecast since march he said in his post meeting press conference federal reserve board chair jerome powell noted the hike was unusually large and something he doesn t expect to become common but inflation has continued to surprise to the upside since the last fed meeting we expected to see inflation flattening out or declining by this point he said we thought strong action was appropriate at this meeting looking forward powell said next meeting could result in a 50 bps or 75 bps rate increase depending on how the data come in that statement was perceived to be more dovish than the market expectation for a 0 75 increase at the next meeting said jay hatfield chief investment officer at infrastructure capital management stock and bonds prices spiked with the s p now up over 80 points and 10 year bonds up almost a full point the fed nailed it said ron temple head of u s equities at lazard asset management recognizing that hiking more now means less later the fed demonstrated its resolve to tame inflation without undermining its employment mandate fed rate increases combined with quantitative tightening takes the u s into uncharted territory with significant risks to growth he said the hike today sent exactly the right message to markets the challenge now before the fed is retaking the narrative that they are on top of rising inflation which will persist along with market volatility until the data indicates peak inflation has been reached said phil rasori chief operating officer at mct r j gallo senior portfolio manager at federated hermes said the dot plot suggests the fed will go to restrictive on policy with year end 2022 and 2023 target rates at 3 4 to 3 8 respectively and it projects gdp will be below 2 0 in each of those years with unemployment rising in 2023 and again 2024 bringing down inflation without hindering employment may be an elusive objective he said it looks like a soft landing but i think the fed is tacitly acknowledging that a recession may be result as for the markets gallo said yields are falling today and we may have seen the worst of the bond sell off for the near term more stable or mildly declining u s treasury yields should be supportive for muni markets to stabilize as well a recession is all but certain said christian hoffmann portfolio manager at thornburg investment management so whether or not we re sliding into recession isn t the question we should be asking but rather how much will it hurt instead of a soft landing next year expect a mild recession said wells fargo securities chief economist jay bryson indications that inflation is becoming more entrenched in the u s economy has caused the federal reserve to become even more hawkish he said we now judge that recession next year is more likely than not the fed will sacrifice growth to bring down inflation said tom garretson senior portfolio strategist at rbc wealth management we believe the fed will shift back to a half point pace at the july meeting and through the fall with a 25 bp rate hike in december achieving their new 3 25 3 50 target range by the end of the year though we expect that rate cuts will be on the table as early as next year as the significant tightening of financial conditions already seen this year could weigh on economic activity next year to a greater extent than is widely appreciated in his press conference powell explicitly said the fomc is not in complete control of inflation and growth citing the challenges coming from russia s war on ukraine and china s covid fighting measures as disruptions that are likely to buffet the recovery tilley noted and inflation will be the determining factor going forward he said we do expect inflation to decelerate but the timing may be pushed out on the calendar the more it gets pushed out the more aggressive the fed needs to be raising the risk that a softish landing

so why did equity markets and bond markets rally on the fed s move and projections of even higher rates to come one view is that the real shock of the jumbo rate rise came a few days ago when well informed suggestions of a supersize increase spread around the market like wildfire so wall street s bounce was less a rally and more of the market correcting slightly on the fact after being sold down too hard on the rumour the alternative view is that powell gave the market what it wanted and declared war on inflation rate jumps front loaded not only did he raise on a scale he ruled out just weeks ago but powell also openly admitted the fed has front loaded rate jumps and effectively promising to keep increasing until inflation starts to turn downwards advertisement we want to see progress inflation can t go down until it flattens out he said if we don t see progress that could cause us to react soon enough we will be seeing some progress all in all powell s tone was broadly consistent with the wishes of big investors such as hedge fund legend bill ackman who want the fed to raise rates faster so markets can take their medicine now then get relief when the fed starts to cut but like politicians around the world who cry out for central banks to do something to fight the inflation their constituents are facing investors should be careful of what they wish for earnings hit is still to come if markets suddenly want to believe in powell s credibility then surely it s important to take notice of arguably the most important thing he said at his press conference on wednesday night there is no sign of a broader slowdown in the economy that i can see now this was curious enough on its own given powell s press conference came just a few hours after fresh retail sales data in the us came in well below expectations suggesting inflation is very much biting data showing credit card debt soaring and us mortgage applications plummeting has also worried market observers recently advertisement but let s take powell at his word while he intended to make the point that the us economy is resilient enough to cope with the higher rates implicit in this is an admission that the rate increases and monetary tightening the fed has done to this point haven t really had much impact on the us economy for investors this is a really important point the economic slowdown that the fed knows it now has to induce hasn t actually started for equity investors this means the hit to earnings that would typically accompany such a slowdown hasn t started either investors have seen prices go down but so far earnings forecasts in the united states and australia have not been revised down powell is saying that process needs to start the federal reserve is going to hike interest rates until policymakers break inflation but the risk is that they also break the economy says ryan sweet head of monetary policy research at moody s analytics growth is slowing and the effect of the tightening in financial market conditions and removal of monetary policy have yet to hit the economy the ackman idea is that the fed gets its raising cycle done quickly then orchestrates a classic fed put to rescue investors by then cutting rates is certainly attractive but what remains unclear is just how high rates will need to go to tame inflation and how much demand the fed will need to take out of the economy advertisement powell still believes a soft landing is possible and it was notable that wednesday night s rate increase came with heroically optimistic projections that unemployment would barely dip but as countless observers have said in recent weeks from former rba governor ian macfarlane to wall street legend stanley druckenmiller it would be historically unusual for inflation to come down if interest rates don t reach a level above inflation at some point the fed s projections suggest a terminal rate of about 3 75 per cent at present is that really enough the best advice for investors that chanticleer saw after the fed s big move came from mike loewengart head of portfolio management at morgan stanley in the us keep in mind that as we go through a changing monetary policy landscape we ll likely continue to see volatility as the market digests the new norm sticking to your investment strategy during waves of volatility is a solid course of action aka don t panic

blocking his plans to get prices under control vega stated the obvious that his is a top issue for voters and they re really blaming him for this and that that means that this is a top priority for this white house but look publicly and privately president biden is really feeling the pressure on this and she s frankly growing increasingly frustrated she added that the griping stems from the fact that the white house and officials here say they ve done what s in their control to try to combat some of these high prices but voters have unfortunately decided to still blame them of course she also had to frame it in terms of a pitfall for democrats while fretting about the steady drumbeat from republicans whom biden insists are to blame for our country s economic pain click expand they are well aware that this could very easily threaten his agenda and frankly threaten his party s chances in the midterms come november there has been a steady drumbeat we ve been talking about this for months from republicans who have been really looking to cast this as biden s price hike so what you re seeing is what you just heard from president biden that shift in the narrative he is really looking to cast blame on republicans right now who he says are blocking his agenda on capitol hill he says if they can bring down things like lowering prescription drugs that would offset some of these other costs he s also going after oil companies more and more he said recently exxon for example is making more money than god he s certainly been blaming putin and the war in ukraine for the high rise of energy costs but look george you know this the truth is the white house can do little directly to bring down inflation cbs mornings also puffed biden in their opening soaring inflation and fears of recession americans brace for the largest interest rate hike in decades as the president touts his economic agenda chief white house correspondent nancy cordes joined vega in making biden a bystander tony you know when it comes to inflation there are a few tools that the white house has at its disposal but the federal reserve has a jackhammer and it s poised to use that today in philadelphia tuesday president biden acknowledged the toll high prices are taking forcing families to spend nearly 350 00 more per month than they did last year to buy the same goods cordes added the only sense of balance came when she conceded that even though he white house is urging congress to pass funding bills that would ease the burden by lowering the cost of childcare and prescription drugs republicans argue pandemic era stimulus is already contributing to inflation and they don t want to spend more after cordes cbs had transportation correspondent errol barnett explain away gas prices as largely out of anyone s control in washington click expand nate burleson from inflation to the gas station gas prices depend on factors far from america s borders so what really goes into the price you re paying at the pump errol barnett explains man i pay 175 00 to fill up this car man that was half a tank a little more than 64 00 for half a tank barnett we all know that feeling of pain at the pump man and you don t even know why barnett but what you may not know is what exactly determines the price of fuel barnett what makes up the bulk of the prices we see posted aaa northeast senior public manager robert sinclair jr oh without a doubt it s crude oil and crude oil is a globally priced commodity barnett robert sinclair is the spokesperson for aaa he says there are four main contributors to the price of gas taxes distribution and marketing and refining all playing a key role but roughly two thirds of what you pay is based on the price of crude oil which itself is up 70 percent from last year american oil companies lead the world in oil production but we still consume far more than we make saudi arabia is second in production and russia a very close third barnett now you may remember some states instituted gas tax holidays which suspend the tax for a short amount of time president biden said he is considering that on the federal level but energy experts say they re just not enough to offset this increasing price in oil michelle and if there s any hurricane that disrupts production in the gulf experts say you can expect prices to kick even higher over on nbc s today correspondent tom costello also had down the white house talking points costello president biden under pressure and in an election year taking aim at republicans biden problem is republicans in congress are doing everything they can to stop my plans to bring down costs on ordinary families moments later costello trumpeted biden s targeting of oil companies for allegedly being one of the two reasons why gas prices has surged to record levels with the other being vladimir putin these shameless acts of doing the white house s bidding was made possible thanks to advertisers such as dawn on

washington ap the federal reserve intensified its fight against high inflation on wednesday raising its key interest rate by three quarters of a point the largest bump since 1994 and signaling more rate hikes ahead as it tries to cool off the u s economy without causing a recession the unusually large rate hike came after data released friday showed u s inflation rose last month to a four decade high of 8 6 the fed s benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans will now be pegged to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 and fed policymakers forecast a doubling of that range by year s end asked why the fed was announcing a more aggressive rate hike than the half point increase he had earlier signaled fed chair jay powell replied that the latest data had shown inflation to be hotter than anticipated and that the public s expectation of rising inflation had strengthened we thought strong action was warranted at this meeting he said and we delivered that powell said that another three quarter point hike is possible at the fed s next meeting in late july if inflation pressures remain high although he said such increases would not be common the fed s decision to impose a rate hike as large as it did wednesday was an acknowledgment that it s struggling to curb the pace and persistence of inflation which is being fueled by a strong labor market pandemic related supply disruptions and soaring energy prices that have been aggravated by russia s invasion of ukraine powell said he believes the economy is strong enough to endure higher rates without tipping into a recession a prospect that many economists are increasingly worried about some analysts said they welcomed the fed s more aggressive posture the more the fed does now the less they will have to later said thomas garretson senior portfolio strategist at rcb wealth management inflation has shot to the top of voter concerns in the months before congress midterm elections souring the public s view of the economy weakening president joe biden s approval ratings and raising the likelihood of democratic losses in november biden has sought to show he recognizes the pain that inflation is causing american households but has struggled to find policy actions that might make a real difference the president has stressed his belief that the power to curb inflation rests mainly with the fed yet the fed s rate hikes are blunt tools for trying to lower inflation while also sustaining growth shortages of oil gasoline and food are escalating prices the fed isn t ideally suited to address many of the roots of inflation which involve russia s invasion of ukraine still clogged global supply chains labor shortages and surging demand for services from airline tickets to restaurant meals at his news conference powell struck a defensive note when asked whether the fed was now prepared to accept a recession as the price of curbing inflation and bringing it close to the fed 2 target level we re not trying to induce a recession now he said let s be clear about that we re trying to achieve 2 inflation borrowing costs have already risen sharply across much of the u s economy in response to the fed s moves with the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate topping 6 its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis up from just 3 at the start of the year the yield on the 2 year treasury note a benchmark for corporate borrowing has jumped to 3 3 its highest level since 2007 even if a recession can be avoided economists say it s almost inevitable that the fed will have to inflict some pain most likely in the form of higher unemployment as the price of defeating chronically high inflation in their updated forecasts wednesday the fed s policymakers indicated that after this year s rate increases they foresee two more rate hikes by the end of 2023 at which point they expect inflation to finally fall below 3 close to their target level but they expect inflation to still be 5 2 at the end of this year much higher than they d estimated in march over the next two years the officials are forecasting a much weaker economy than was envisioned in march they expect the unemployment rate to reach 3 7 by year s end and 3 9 by the end of 2023 those are only slight increases from the current 3 6 jobless rate but they mark the first time since it began raising rates that the fed has acknowledged that its actions will weaken the economy the central bank has also sharply lowered its projections for economic growth to 1 7 this year and next that s below its outlook in march but better than some economists expectation for a recession next year investments around the world from bonds to bitcoin have tumbled on fears surrounding inflation and the prospect that the fed s aggressive drive to control it will cause a recession even if the fed manages the delicate trick of curbing inflation without causing a downturn higher rates will nevertheless inflict pressure on stocks the s p 500 has already sunk more than 20 this year meeting the definition of a bear market on wednesday the s p 500 rose 1 5 the two year treasury yield fell to 3 26 from 3 45 late tuesday with the biggest move happening after powell said not to expect 0 75 percentage point rate hikes to be common other central banks are also acting swiftly to try to quell inflation even with their nations at greater risk of recession than the u s the european central bank is expected to raise rates by a quarter point in july its first increase in 11 years it could announce a larger hike in september if record high levels of inflation persist on wednesday the ecb vowed to create a market backstop that could buffer member countries against financial turmoil of the kind that erupted during a debt crisis more than a decade ago the bank of england has raised rates four times since december to a 13 year high despite predictions that economic growth will be unchanged in the second quarter

bloomberg federal reserve chair jerome powell took a step toward assuming the mantle of inflation slayer paul volcker all but acknowledging that reining in run away price pressures may result in a recession declaring that it s essential to bring inflation down powell engineered the central bank s biggest interest rate increase since 1994 on wednesday and held out the distinct possibility of another jumbo three quarter percentage point increase in july he openly endorsed for the first time raising rates well into restrictive territory with the aim of cooling off the labor market and pushing joblessness up a strategy that in the past has often resulted in an economic downturn this is a volcker esque fed said diane swonk chief economist at grant thornton llp that means the fed is willing to take a rise in unemployment and a recession to avert a repeat of mistakes of the 1970s supply shocks won t correct themselves so the fed must reduce demand to meet a supply constrained world the shift in stance carries perils not only for the economy but for financial markets and president joe biden stocks have tumbled in recent months as the fed has tightened credit to get on top of inflationary pressures that have proved more persistent and widespread than it expected while the markets took wednesday s rate increase in stride they remain fragile biden has seen his popularity plunge as inflation has soared a recession and the higher unemployment that would bring would rob the president of one of his few talking points in touting the benefits of his policies for the economy powell is likely to be grilled by lawmakers next week on why the fed misjudged the severity of inflation and why it now believes there will be costs to eradicating it when he presents the central bank s semi annual review of monetary policy to congress ex fed chair volcker is lionized within the fed for breaking the back of double digit inflation 40 years ago what s not always mentioned is that he had to put the economy through the wringer to do that unemployment soared above 10 on his watch and that his policies provoked a populist backlash from home builders and others who were particularly hard hit by the credit squeeze unlike volcker powell said the fed was not out to drive the economy into recession but he effectively admitted that a downturn was possible though he argued that it wouldn t be the fed s fault our objective really is to bring inflation down to 2 while the labor market remains strong powell told reporters i think that what s becoming more clear is that many factors that we don t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that s possible or not in particular russia s invasion of ukraine and the potentially extended impact that could have on energy and food prices an increasing number of economists are projecting a downturn next year as the fed struggles to get on top of inflation that s running at its highest level in four decades nearly 70 of academic economists polled by the financial times and the university of chicago foresee a contraction in gross domestic product next year according to survey released june 13 fed policy makers projections released after the meeting show the economy continuing to grow this year and next though at a subpar pace but they also foresee unemployment rising something that usually only happens during a recession joblessness is forecast to rise to 4 1 at the end of 2024 from 3 6 now according to the median forecast while maintaining that a 4 1 jobless rate would still be historically low powell made clear that the fed s no 1 goal was not tending to the labor market but getting inflation under wraps i will begin with one overarching message the fed chair said at the start of his press conference we re strongly committed to bringing inflation back down and we re moving expeditiously to do so to that end policy makers are projecting a steep rise in interest rates in coming months they now see the federal funds rate they control rising to 3 4 by the end of this year and 3 8 at the end of 2023 that s well above the 2 5 rate they reckon is neutral for the economy neither spurring nor restricting growth and compares with the current fund s rate target of 1 5 to 1 75 but even that won t be enough to bring inflation fully back to the fed s 2 goal it s projected to end 2024 at 2 2 compared with 6 3 now powell in particular stressed the importance of keeping inflation expectations in check and said that was one reason the fed abruptly decided to raise rates by three quarters of a percentage point wednesday instead of the half point increase it had been telegraphing for weeks it was an un anchoring of inflation expectations that bedeviled volcker and forced him into delivering such harsh monetary medicine to bring price gains under control at one point pushing interest rates as high as 20 consumers workers and businesses back then were convinced that inflation was headed ever higher and so acted in ways that helped bring that about powell said that s why policy makers can t ignore run ups in oil and food prices even though they are outside its control they affect how americans view the outlook for inflation powell is determined not to repeat the mistakes of arthur burns who led the central bank during the wage price spiral of the 1970s and preceded volcker as fed chair anna wong chief u s economist for bloomberg economics said in a note officials now appear to acknowledge that inflation is a real problem and they are increasingly recognizing and accepting the costs that will come with tighter monetary policy 2022 bloomberg l p

percent of us workers were in unions in 2021 including just 6 1 percent in the private sector and 4 2 percent of workers 24 years old and younger in a very real sense the unions owe their existence to the sponsorship they receive from a section of big business and the capitalist state the aim of his government biden told the afl cio officials is to encourage unions and make it easier for workers to organize his infrastructure program and support for union partnerships would strengthen the unions he declared i m not just saying that to be pro union i m saying it because i m pro american biden alluded to the dangers of rising working class militancy and the need for the unions to suppress the class struggle you know if investment bankers in america they re not all bad guys if they went on strike not a whole hell of a lot would happen if the ibew international brotherhood of electrical workers went on strike everything shuts down he continued i don t think you appreciate how critically important you are i m not trying to be nice to you it s just a fact indeed the american federation of teachers aft the united auto workers uaw united food and commercial workers ufcw united steelworkers usw and other afl cio unions have been instrumental in forcing workers into infected schools factories and other workplaces throughout the pandemic this has cost the lives of thousands if not tens of thousands of union members who contracted covid 19 in schools factories transit and trucking hubs and other workplaces biden boasted we brought down covid deaths by 90 percent we opened schools and businesses that were shuttered it all created the greatest job recovery in american history he had no fear of being contradicted by these union executives who are insulated from the disastrous results of their actions in fact biden has overseen more deaths 595 000 in his time in office than trump 441 000 new variants of the deadly virus are raging through workplaces and neighborhoods despite the white house s best effort to declare the pandemic over and conceal the real number of infections and deaths as for the supposed economic nirvana for workers the 40 year high inflation rate is chewing up workers paychecks and making living expenses impossible at the same time biden s federal reserve chairman raised interest rates by three quarters of a point wednesday and is using the threat of mass unemployment to beat back workers demands for raises that keep up with inflation the president repeated his statement that skyrocketing living expenses for workers were due to putin s price hikes but the inflation ripping through the economy is the direct product of the trillions of dollars both capitalist parties handed to the financial markets since the 2008 crash the economic crisis has been exacerbated by the us led sanctions against russia and the massive armament of ukraine biden made it clear he needed the continued support of the unions to escalate the confrontation with russia folks look what putin s war has done is not only tried to wipe out the culture of the ukrainians decimate people and commit innumerable war crimes he s also prevented the grain thousands of tons of grain that are locked up in those silos ready to be exported but they can t get out through the black sea because they ll get blown out of the water he hinted at plans by us and nato to move grain by rail from black sea ports to european and world markets this and previously floated plans to break the russian blockade with us and nato warships will only escalate the conflict with nuclear armed russia in a call with the ukrainian president wednesday biden pledged another 1 billion in weaponry biden knows he will get nothing but support for his warmongering from the afl cio which has backed every imperialist war and us backed military coup since its founding in 1955 this included collaborating with ukrainian nationalists and neo nazis in the 2014 coup in ukraine which ousted the pro russian president and transformed the country into a military stalking horse for us imperialism the very first session of the convention included comments delivered by yale professor timothy snyder the foremost academic propagandist for the us nato proxy war against russia speaking from austria snyder claimed that the defense of democracy from ukraine to the us depended on the actions of the unions which he claimed were now at the center of history the unions he went on to say were the best examples of civil society because they were organizations which stood between the government and the people the unions moreover gave people practice in representing themselves and using and defending their right to vote these comments were made to union officials who routinely trample over the democratic will of their members including stuffing ballot boxes to push through pro company contracts as for the claim that the unions stand between the government and the people this is no less a lie the afl cio is a wholly owned subsidiary of the american capitalist state it has long been the recipient of grants from the u s state department s national endowment for democracy to subvert unions around the world and protect the interests of us imperialism the biden administration is proposing new subsidies and political structures to draw the unions even closer into the domestic and foreign operations of the us government in his 1940 work the trade unions in the epoch of imperialist decay leon trotsky the founder of the fourth international pointed to the global tendency of unions to integrate themselves into capitalist governments monopoly capitalism is less and less willing to reconcile itself to the independence of trade unions it demands of the reformist bureaucracy and the labor aristocracy who pick the crumbs from its banquet table that they become transformed into its political police before the eyes of the working class if that is not achieved the labor bureaucracy is driven away and replaced by the fascists trotsky was writing this during the early stages of this process the degeneration of the unions into direct tools of the state was completed by the late 1980s and early 1990s when in the face of the globalization of capitalist production the afl cio and nationally based unions and labor parties around the world abandoned any resistance to the worldwide capitalist offensive against the working class the leaders of the afl cio abandoned any talk of class conflict as an antiquated notion and embraced corporatism the doctrine of unrestrained class collaboration assembled at the afl cio convention were a collection of smug and self satisfied bureaucrats most of whom earn six figure salaries and are far more concerned about the level of the stock market than they are about the price of gasoline and food there were not a few millionaires in the crowd including american federation of teachers president randi weingarten annual income of nearly 500 000 who in her own remarks did not even mention the covid 19 pandemic that has killed and sickened thousands of educators as the unions kept the schools open the american ruling class is on shaky ground if it looks to these corrupt and discredited organizations to hold back the tide of class struggle which is being driven by the historic crisis of american and world capitalism in the coming weeks and months hundreds of thousands of west coast dockworkers health care workers teachers steelworkers truck drivers supermarket telecom and other workers face contract struggles workers are determined to reverse decades of union backed concessions and break the de facto 2 4 percent annual wage limit the unions have imposed on behalf of big business and the government the explosive development of the class struggle in the us takes place in the context of an international movement of workers including to name just a few an impending strike by tens of thousands of rail and other workers in the uk strikes by airline workers throughout europe the mass protests against austerity and rising cost of living in sri lanka and strikes by health care workers in turkey germany france new zealand and many other countries biden s promotion of the unions arises out of fear that the rank and file organizations set up by many sections of workers to prevent their struggles from being suppressed and isolated will develop into a national and international network this is precisely what is necessary the international committee of the fourth international initiated the formation of the international workers alliance of rank and file committees iwa rfc last year to unify all the different struggles of workers across sectors and countries the building and expansion of the iwa rfc is required to defeat all efforts by the trade unions to sabotage the struggles of the working class american workers like their class brothers and sisters around the world are emerging as a powerful force they are increasingly turning to the world socialist web site and the socialist equality parties across the world to build new organizations of struggle and the revolutionary leadership necessary to abolish the capitalist profit system

many gun shops across simcoe county report a boom in business since federal legislation was tabled last month to limit sales in the past 10 days wesley winkle president of eldwood epps sporting goods in severn says they sold 1 500 handguns which he says would traditionally take the store roughly 10 months to move that much inventory these people have hundreds of dollars invested in memberships and range equipment so they want to continue their sport so they are all looking to add that one item left winkle says on may 30 the trudeau government announced bill c 21 which would freeze the sale purchase or transfer of handguns across canada the news prompted firearm customers to stock up with so many gun clubs in the area we have literally thousands of handgun owners that shoot at the local gun clubs all these owners are looking to add to their collections says winkle they ve been told if they get them before the law comes into force they are allowed to keep them and use them he added it is a similar situation at the wolf s den in utopia where co owner gary banting says honest people are buying before it s too late it s increased dramatically we pretty well sold out in the first two days and then we reordered again and probably sold another 50 to 75 from reordering banting is trying to balance keeping inventory low in case of a freeze and meet the increasing demand we re a bit light right now quite a bit light but by the same token i don t want to order too much in case something happens and the axe comes down and we can t sell them he explains i don t want to get stuck with them either smoke and mirrors both gun store owners believe that the tabled legislation will do little to address the issue and targets the wrong people it s one of those things where we abide by all the laws we register all our items we are all vetted by the rcmp we do all the paperwork required to legally operate in this business and then when there s an unfortunate incident in the world where people do things they shouldn t do my clientele and my staff pay the price winkle says the opinion is shared by barrie innisfil mp john brassard who says the governing liberals should instead be targeting gangs illegal importation and illegal use this is not going to do anything to solve the problems of guns and gangs and criminal violent acts using a gun in the commission of a crime in our major cities says brassard who also serves as the opposition house leader this is just in my view it s smoke and mirrors and the government is just throwing up a red herring going after law abiding firearms owners who already live within some of the strictest gun regulations and laws in the world brassard says that mp s are expected to start debating the legislation in the coming days he says support should instead be targeted towards the borders so using the resources of government whether it s supporting the cbsa or supporting police agencies supporting controls at our borders to make sure that guns aren t being imported from the united states to be used in the commission of a crime by illegal gangs and criminals says brassard that s the measures that need to be taken that s where the resources of government need to be many advocates for gun safety have applauded the proposed legislation canadian doctors for protection from guns an advocacy group posted a response when it was announced saying in part that it is another important step in protecting public health and well being the legislation has not been voted on meaning there s no firm date for the ban but winkle fears there could be job losses throughout the industry when it does so we re concerned we re going to lose probably about 10 000 jobs across canada and that s really unfortunate says winkle these people have families to feed and gas bills to pay just like the rest of us
washington record low mortgages are long gone credit card rates will likely rise so will the cost of an auto loan savers may finally see a noticeable return the unusually large three quarter point hike in its benchmark short term rate that the federal reserve announced wednesday won t by itself have a huge effect on most americans finances but combined with earlier rate hikes and additional large increases to come economists and investors foresee the fastest pace of rate increases since 1989 the result is increasingly higher borrowing costs as the fed fights the most painfully high inflation in four decades and ends a decades long era of historically low rates chair jerome powell hopes that by making borrowing more expensive the fed will succeed in cooling demand for homes cars and other goods and services and slow inflation yet the risks are high with inflation likely to stay elevated the fed may have to drive borrowing costs even higher than it now expects a series of higher rates could tip the u s economy into recession that would mean higher unemployment rising layoffs and continued pressure on stock prices how will it affect your finances these are some of the most common questions being asked about the impacts of the rate hike advertisement i m considering buying a house will mortgage rates keep going up rates on home loans have soared in the past few months mostly in anticipation of the fed s moves and will probably keep rising mortgage rates don t necessarily move up in tandem with the fed s rate increases sometimes they even move in the opposite direction long term mortgages tend to track the yield on the 10 year treasury note which in turn is influenced by a variety of factors these include investors expectations for future inflation and global demand for u s treasurys related fed attacks inflation with its largest interest rate hike since 1994 for now though faster inflation and strong u s economic growth are sending the 10 year treasury rate up sharply as a consequence the national average for a 30 year fixed mortgage has jumped from 3 at the start of the year to well above 5 now in part the jump in mortgage rates reflects expectations that the fed will keep raising its key rate but its forthcoming hikes aren t likely fully priced in yet if the fed jacks up its key rate even higher as expected the 10 year treasury yield will go much higher too and mortgages will become more expensive will it still be tough to find a house advertisement if you re looking to buy a home and are frustrated by the lack of available houses which has triggered bidding wars and eye watering prices that may get a little easier soon economists say that higher mortgage rates will discourage some would be purchasers and average home prices which have been soaring at about a 20 annual rate could at least rise at a slower pace sales of existing homes have fallen for six straight months new home sales have also slumped those trends are modestly boosting the supply of available properties i need a new car should i buy one now fed rate hikes can make auto loans more expensive but other factors also affect these rates including competition among car makers that can sometimes lower borrowing costs rates for buyers with lower credit ratings are most likely to rise as a result of the fed s hikes because used vehicle prices on average are rising monthly payments will rise too advertisement what will happen to my credit card for users of credit cards home equity lines of credit and other variable interest debt rates would rise by roughly the same amount as the fed hike usually within one or two billing cycles that s because those rates are based in part on banks prime rate which moves in tandem with the fed those who don t qualify for low rate credit cards might be stuck paying higher interest on their balances the rates on their cards would rise as the prime rate does the fed s rate increases have already sent credit card borrowing rates above 20 for the first time in at least four years according to lendingtree which has tracked the data since 2018 how will this affect my savings you may earn a bit more though not likely by very much and it depends on where your savings if you have any are parked advertisement savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to increase their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers this is particularly true for large banks now they ve been flooded with savings as a result of government financial aid and reduced spending by many wealthier americans during the pandemic they won t need to raise savings rates to attract more deposits or cd buyers but online banks and others with high yield savings accounts could be an exception these accounts are known for aggressively competing for depositors the only catch is that they typically require significant deposits how will the hike influence crypto cryptocurrencies like bitcoin could become a little less attractive to many investors while bitcoin prices were mostly unchanged after the fed s announcement crypto prices had declined in the days leading up to the central bank s move they dropped by a third in seven days advertisement higher interest rates mean that safe assets like bonds and treasuries become more attractive to investors because their yields are now higher that in turn makes risky assets like technology stocks and cryptocurrencies less attractive all that said bitcoin is suffering from its own problems that are separate from economic policy two major crypto firms have failed in the span of a month the shaken confidence of crypto investors is not being helped by the fact the safest place you can park money now bonds seems like a safer move will my student loan payment go up right now payments on federal student loans are paused until august 31 as part of an emergency measure put into place during the pandemic inflation means loan holders have less disposable income to make payments but a slowed economy that reduces inflation could bring some relief by fall the government may choose to extend the emergency measure by deferring payments at the end of summer depending on the state of the economy president joe biden is also considering some form of loan forgiveness for those taking out new private student loans prepare to pay more rates vary by lender but are expected to increase associated press journalists ken sweet adriana morga and cora lewis contributed to this report related headlines fed attacks inflation with its largest interest rate hike since 1994 send

washington bloomberg reuters the united states federal reserve on wednesday june 15 raised interest rates by 75 basis points the biggest increase since 1994 and chairman jerome powell signalled another big move next month intensifying a fight to contain rampant inflation slammed by critics for not anticipating the fastest price gains in four decades and then for being too slow to respond mr powell and colleagues on wednesday intensified their effort to cool prices by lifting the target range for the federal funds rate to 1 5 per cent to 1 75 per cent he said another 75 basis point hike or a 50 basis point move was likely at the next meeting of policymakers the fed forecast that interest rates would rise even further this year to 3 4 per cent by december and 3 8 per cent by the end of 2023 this was a big upgrade from the 1 9 per cent and 2 8 per cent that officials pencilled in for their march projections clearly today s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one and i do not expect moves of this size to be common mr powell told a post meeting press conference his remarks that were cheered in financial markets as he took the risk of a string of super sized increases off the table stocks climbed halting a five day rout that took 10 per cent off the s p 500 while treasury yields tumbled and the dollar pushed lower economists at barclays said they expected the fed would raise rates by only a half point next month the fed s hawkish commitment to controlling inflation has already touched off a broad tightening of credit conditions being felt in us housing and stock markets and is likely to slow demand throughout the economy the fed s intent we don t seek to put people out of work mr powell said adding that the central bank was not trying to induce a recession yet the fed chief s remarks were among his most sobering yet about the challenge he and his fellow policymakers face in lowering inflation from its current 40 year high to a level closer to its 2 per cent target without a sharp slowdown in economic growth or a steep rise in unemployment our objective really is to bring inflation down to 2 per cent while the labour market remains strong what is becoming more clear is that many factors that we don t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that is possible or not mr powell said citing the war in ukraine and global supply concerns there is a path for us to get there it is not getting easier it is getting more challenging he told reporters noting that the rate hikes announced last month and in march so far had not only failed to slow inflation but also allowed it to continue accelerating to a level that recent data indicated had begun to influence public attitudes in a way that could make the fed s job even harder eye catching inflation late last week a survey from the university of michigan showed consumer inflation expectations pushing higher respondents anticipated inflation rising 5 4 per cent in the year ahead the highest since 1981 longer term price expectations also picked up the preliminary june readings were quite eye catching and we noticed that mr powell noted one of the factors in our deciding to move ahead with 75 basis points today was what we saw in inflation expectations he said this was in addition to the hotter than expected rise in the consumer price index for may released on friday

us fed announces biggest interest rate hike since 1994 in this file photo taken on july 31 2019 us federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks during a press conference after a federal open market committee meeting in washington dc us central bankers opened their hotly anticipated policy meeting on september 17 2019 with investors expecting the federal reserve to cut interest rates for the second time this year wall street was cautious early tuesday with stocks in a holding pattern ahead of the announcement and financial markets jittery amid the announcement the new york federal reserve bank is intervening to try to keep the policy rate in line fed chairman jerome powell in recent weeks has sent strong signals that a rate cut is coming vowing that policymakers stand ready to act as appropriate amid significant risks to the economy notably president donald trump s trade wars manila philippines the us federal reserve announced the most aggressive interest rate increase in nearly 30 years on wednesday and said it is prepared to do so again next month in an all out battle to drive down surging inflation the super sized 0 75 percentage point hike came with the fed under intense pressure to curb soaring gas and food prices that have left millions of americans struggling to make ends meet and sent president joe biden s approval ratings plunging fed chair jerome powell said it was essential to lower inflation and policymakers have both the tools we need and the resolve it will take to restore price stability on behalf of american families he stressed that the goal is to achieve that without derailing the us economy but acknowledged there is always a risk of going too far the fed s policy setting federal open market committee raised the benchmark borrowing rate to a range of 1 5 1 75 up from zero at the start of the year it was the first 75 basis point increase since november 1994 powell told reporters the move was an unusually large one but he does not expect moves of this size to be common however from the perspective of today either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting he said it is essential that we bring inflation down if we are to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions that benefit all biden has endorsed the fed s effort and is hoping for success as his democrats face the possibility of losing control of congress in key midterm elections in november he has blamed opposition republicans for blocking bills meant to help lower costs and ease supply constraints white house economic adviser brian deese told fox news the most constructive steps that congress and the executive branch can take to help support what the fed is trying to do are to lower the cost that families face directly and to lower the federal deficit brace yourself wall street loved the aggressive posture closing sharply higher following powell s comments but kansas city federal reserve bank president esther george a noted inflation hawk dissented from the committee vote preferring a smaller half point increase until recently the central bank seemed set to approve a 0 5 percentage point increase but economists say the rapid surge in inflation put the fed behind the curve meaning it needed to react strongly to prove its resolve to combat scorching price increases committee members now see the federal funds rate ending the year at 3 4 up from the 1 9 projection in march according to the median quarterly forecast they also expect growth slowing to 1 7 in 2022 from the previous 2 8 forecast however powell stressed that we are not trying to induce a recession now but diane swonk of grant thornton a long time fed watcher said it is not clear the economy will be as resilient as the fed expects she called the central bank s outlook fanciful and compared the current situation to the early 1980s when then fed chief paul volcker drove interest rates up to 20 to choke off inflation tumbling the economy into recession brace yourself for what comes next this is a volcker esque fed that means the fed is willing to take a rise in unemployment and a recession to avert a repeat of mistakes of the 1970s she said on twitter growing up in detroit i remember that period well it was ugly with deep scars caught off guard us central bankers began raising interest rates off zero in march as buoyant demand from american consumers for homes cars and other goods clashed with transportation and supply chain snarls in parts of the world where covid 19 remained and remains a challenge that fueled inflation which got dramatically worse after russia invaded ukraine in late february and western nations imposed steep sanctions on moscow sending food and fuel prices up at a blistering rate us gasoline prices have topped 5 00 a gallon for the first time ever and are setting new records daily economists thought march was the peak for consumer price hikes but the rate spiked again in may jumping 8 6 in the latest 12 months the fed was caught off guard with the speed of the price increases and while policymakers usually prefer to clearly telegraph any policy shift to financial markets the latest data changed the calculus
new york reuters the federal reserve on wednesday raised its target interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point on wednesday to stem a disruptive surge in inflation and projected a slowing economy and rising unemployment in the months to come the action raised the short term federal funds rate to a range of 1 50 to 1 75 and fed officials at the median projected the rate increasing to 3 4 by the end of this year and to 3 8 in 2023 a substantial shift from projections in march that saw the rate rising to 1 9 this year story fed statement market reaction stocks u s stocks rose sharply in wake of the fed hike bonds u s treasury yields rose after the fed statement forex the gained after fed decision comments sam stovall chief investment strategist cfra research new york the fed made its policy change and the markets actually took that information and pretty much sold off on it but once the fed chairman said that there could be a similar 75 basis point increase at the next meeting that s when the market rose it is sort of a vote of confidence that the fed is finally awake to the inflation problem and is willing to take a more aggressive stance markets tend to flip flop a lot after the fed makes an announcement and many times make a sharp move downward followed by a sharp move upward but what i believe is that we are likely to be going through a near term relief rally sparked by an increasingly aggressive monetary policy with the fed raising rates by 75 basis points and basically saying they could do the same thing at the next meeting in an attempt to corral surging inflation jason ware chief investment officer for albion financial group salt lake city utah they are doing what they can in a fast moving economy things are moving quickly the fed knows they are behind the curve and they are attempting to drive down inflation and the tools at disposal are blunt instruments they reiterated they are willing to do whatever it takes to bring inflation down we have to give powell a little slack given how difficult things are as far as the economy and our view on recession the risk in 2022 its quite low but certainly in 2023 and into 2024 the risk of recession has risen over the last 3 plus months due to the threat of a fed policy mistake the most interesting data point today is the dissent from esther george she s not gun shy about raising rates and here she is saying 50 bps is enough for now she s looking at this notion that we were behind the curve on inflation we should have been dealing with this a year ago and now we are hiking aggressively into a slowdown mauricio agudelo head fixed income homestead funds arlington virginia they are full speed ahead at this point when you look at oil prices and gasoline futures they need to tackle headline inflation they are still playing catch up at this point if you look at the dot plot from december the federal funds rate was going to be just under 1 for the end of 22 now we have revised those expectations upward to a terminal rate of 3 4 by the end of this year when i look at market pricing of future expectations for the december meeting the implied rate is right around 3 7 the door is still open to do more especially at the july meeting and perhaps at the september meeting look how fast we adjusted expectations from 50 basis points to 75 basis points in a matter of days i think at this point all options are at the table ellen hazen chief market strategist f l putnam investment management wellesley massachusetts people are parsing through the statement parsing through the summary of economic projections sep and taking a look but in general not too surprising the bigger takeaway from the sep for me is the runway for them to have a soft landing just got shorter and narrower meaning that they are anticipating higher inflation they are anticipating higher unemployment they are anticipating lower gdp and the atlanta gdpnow forecast has gone to zero so whether or not we can escape this without a recession is coming into question everyone knew it but now the fed is admitting it most of the incremental data points have been negative even this morning the retail sales numbers were soft so just in the last four business days you ve had a number of negative economic numbers stephen massocca senior vice president wedbush securities san francisco i don t view it as surprising if you ve been paying attention the fed did the right thing they cited early on that they were going to be more aggressive at this meeting when you look at the market s reaction nobody was really surprised i think it s too much too quick too fast too far a lot of this inflation in my view is being driven by energy prices and at some point oil stops going up peter yi director northern trust asset management chicago the market had fully priced in that 75 but because of how aggressively the market recalibrated their expectations over the last three trading days the market was essentially giving them a green light the fed may be thinking they needed to be opportunistic and saw this a window or to establish better credibility to address inflation and i think that comes at the cost of their forward guidance credibility and if i had to guess esther george probably dissented as it s going to be difficult to give forward guidance and it s going to be interesting to see how powell is going to address that forward guidance as that s something they ve have been hanging their hat on brad mcmillan chief investment officer for commonwealth financial network waltham massachusetts the fed is trying to respond to legitimate concerns about inflation what they did today was the least they could ve done to maintain any kind of credibility it doesn t solve the fed is behind the curve argument it just brings them one step closer to catching up with the curve at this point the fed is trying to catch up without upsetting markets too much when we get into the press conference we ll get more color as to what s going on michael rosen chief investment officer at angeles investment advisors santa monica to some degree we re seeing a bit buy the rumour sell the news we started this morning with big rallies in stocks and bonds and that with the 75 bps move priced in when the announcement comes in we re bouncing around a little the fed is in a very difficult position that frankly they put themselves in by mishandling monetary policy and allowing inflation to rise as much as it has there s just simply no sign that inflation is turning and this is happening at a time when some of the economic data is weaking retail sales data this morning for example the so called soft landing is looking more and more tenuous i hope powell is probed on the balance between the dual mandate of keeping low inflation and high employment that s a balance that seems to be getting harder and harder to accomplish we have been holding short duration in our portfolio for both stocks and bonds and for fixed income we ve made it even shorter we ve shifted from a growth to value bias in equities and we re holding a lot more cash than we were earlier i think holding shorter duration and more cash is the way to go right now kathy lien managing director bk asset management new york the fed took a pretty aggressive move and hiked by 75 basis points we re seeing quite a bit of volatility in fx which is not a surprise considering that there tends to be a lot of two way action before powell speaks but what you can see is that the lack of a positive reaction in the dollar we had a knee jerk rally and then now we re pulling back is a reflection of the market s heightened concerns about recession thats the greatest risk of the big move the fed made today and in an environment on a day when retail sales missed in a very big way i think there s going to be a lot of recession talk and i think powell is probably going to lay the groundwork for further tightening and between what we re seeing in terms of the yield increase already along with the trajectory of further rises and data already softening there is going to be a much more significant focus on the shift from inflation to recession simon harvey head of fx analysis monex europe london today s decision comes on the back of a hot u s inflation report for may which prompted increased speculation on monday that the fed would abandon its previous signaling of back to back 50 bps hikes in favor of a more aggressive move whether or not the fed chose to prime markets by leaking information to the wall street journal or not is largely irrelevant at this point because the market went all in on the prospect of a larger rate hike by standing by its original forward guidance the fed would have had to effectively loosen financial conditions when hiking by 50 bps at a time when inflation pressures were mounting with the announcement largely baked into money market pricing for both the latest decision and the adjustment in the dot plot the reaction in financial markets was limited the emphasis now completely shifts to chair powell s commentary in the press conference as markets try to gauge the fed s sensitivity to incoming inflation prints following their latest u turn and what the fomc s appetite is for aggressively taking rates above neutral this year jake dollarhide chief executive officer longbow asset management tulsa oklahoma the market doesn t know what it wants it wants higher interest rates to stave off inflation but it also realizes higher interest rates make the cost of doing business more expensive so it s really a crap show it s not fun right now i wouldn t be surprised if they go with 75 basis points again july and then they kind of sit back and wait christopher c grisanti chief equity strategist mai capital management cleveland ohio this is going to be a buy on the rumor sell on the news kind of day the market was strong today but now that the results have come out and it s up 75 basis points which had become the consensus people are looking forward seeing more difficult markets ahead and they re selling off this morning s rally we think the fed funds rate will approach 3 5 by year end so another 200 basis points of hikes from here still not the end of the world it s far below the average fed funds rate of the last 40 years but what i d also point out is while it doesn t necessarily have to end in recession it s harder and harder to think that even the 350 basis points will stop the inflation that we re seeing now brian jacobsen senior investment strategist allspring global investments menomonee falls wisconsin the fed is willing to let the unemployment rate rise and risk a recession as collateral damage to get inflation back down this isn t a volker moment for powell given the magnitude of the hike but he is like a mini me version of volcker with this move
the federal reserve escalated its battle against inflation wednesday announcing the largest interest rate hike in 28 years as the central bank struggles to regain control over soaring consumer prices the fed raised its benchmark interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point the biggest hike since 1994 that follows a quarter point increase in march and a half point jump in may until a few days ago most forecasters were expecting another half point increase in rates this week in line with the fed s earlier guidance but policymakers opted for a more aggressive move after a report last friday showed inflation was stronger than expected in may consumer prices were up 8 6 from a year ago the increase reflects not only rising costs for gasoline and groceries but also for rent and airfares and a wide range of services the bottom line is it seems like inflation is becoming more entrenched said jay bryson chief economist at wells fargo and for many people i think that was the game changer stefani reynolds afp via getty images afp via getty images a shopper walks through a grocery store in washington d c on june 14 consumer prices are surging at their fastest annual pace in over 40 years fears of a recession grow by sharply raising interest rates the fed hopes to tamp down consumer demand which has overwhelmed supply driving prices up higher rates will make it more expensive to carry a credit card balance get a car loan or buy a house higher borrowing costs also weigh on economic growth stock markets have dropped in recent weeks over fears the fed s rate actions could even tip the economy into a recession fed officials on wednesday projected the economy will grow just 1 7 this year down from the 2 8 growth rate they were predicting three months ago growth is likely to slow further in 2023 narrowing the chance of a so called soft landing in which inflation falls without a recession i think best case scenario you re looking at a landing that may be quite bumpy bryson said you re looking at a period of relatively slow growth next year fed policymakers raised their forecast for unemployment next year from 3 5 to 3 9 spencer platt getty images getty images traders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange in new york city on tuesday stocks have slumped as the fed continues to raise interest rates aggressively to fight red hot inflation more rate hikes are coming rising prices have begun taking a toll on retail sales which fell 0 3 in may spending on furniture appliances and electronics declined last month while americans spent more on gasoline and groceries additional rate hikes are expected in the coming months on average fed policymakers said they expect interest rates to climb to around 3 4 by the end of this year up from 1 9 they were projecting in march mortgage rates have risen sharply in anticipation of that putting homes out of reach for some would be buyers the average rate on a 30 year fixed home loan is near 6 according to bankrate double what it was a year ago we re going to see some of the highest mortgage rates that we have seen in many many years said mark hamrick a senior economic analyst at bankrate along with the high home prices that have been seen all across the country this housing affordability question is only going to move from the yellow to the red zone sales of existing homes declined in february march and april the most recent period for which data are available esther george the president of the federal reserve bank of kansas city was the lone dissenter in today s vote she preferred a smaller rate hike of a half percent copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

new york reuters afp us stocks rallied and the us dollar retreated from multi year highs on wednesday june 15 after federal reserve chair jerome powell promised that the biggest rate hike since 1994 will not be the rule stocks waffled in the aftermath of the fed s announcement but later extended gains after mr powell said he did not expect wednesday s 75 basis point rate increase to become a common occurrence and that he did not see signs of a broader slowdown in the economy investors seemed relieved that the united states central bank had met the market s expectations that it will act aggressively to tame surging inflation and appeared for now to be comfortable with the fed s projection that the economy is likely to slow in the next two years however stocks also rallied after the fed raised interest rates in may only to weaken substantially in subsequent sessions the market is getting comfortable with the idea that the fed is now starting to take the inflation situation very seriously said mr tom cahill of ventura wealth management who nonetheless expressed scepticism that the fed could achieve a soft landing minutes after the rate hike that was widely predicted by the market stocks had initially pared gains as investors worried about the prospect of tighter monetary policy tipping the economy into a recession but by late afternoon in new york investors had cast aside growth concerns and instead took the view that the economy was better off in the long run if the fed succeeded in reining in prices now the dow jones industrial average ended the session by jumping 1 per cent while the tech heavy nasdaq composite climbed 2 5 per cent the broad based s p 500 which entered a bear market earlier this week following the latest inflation data jumped 1 5 per cent the buoyancy was reflected in global equities msci s gauge of stocks across the globe also zoomed up 1 1 per cent after hitting its lowest in about 1½ years earlier this week today s move by the fed to progress faster to neutral will be applauded in the long run by the economy business decision makers and ultimately by markets said mr rick rieder the chief investment officer of global fixed income and head of the global allocation investment team at blackrock the market s relief that the fed had delivered what it expected extended to treasuries the yield on benchmark 10 year treasuries pulled back to 3 291 per cent down from an 11 year peak of 3 498 per cent struck on tuesday the yield on two year treasuries also slipped to 3 2096 per cent well under tuesday s high of 3 456 per cent a level last seen in 2007
countries haggle through the night to salvage wto deals wto chief ngozi okonjo iweala has staked her leadership on breathing new life into the sclerotic organisation geneva ministers were frantically haggling through the night into thursday at the world trade organization in a bid to salvage deals on food security fishing and combating covid 19 the global trade body s 164 members added on an extra fifth day of talks to try to break the deadlock gripping the wto headquarters in geneva but despite relaxing their original wednesday deadline countries were trading concessions through the early morning hours to cobble together a wide ranging set of results countries have hit a brick wall trying to secure each separate deal on its own merits so are now making tit for tat offers in an attempt to keep them all afloat they re looking at a broad package what can be achieved trade offs in different areas a geneva trade official told reporters it s basically what can i get here in exchange for this the official said we re into the real bargaining part of the meeting this is where all the action is happening and hopefully where some deals are going to be struck juice and sandwiches us trade representative katherine tai was seen heading in and out of the late night talks while a giant tray of sandwiches was brought in to keep the deal makers going it s going to go all night everything people look tired the geneva based trade official told afp adding they re negotiating which is good news he said the talks had run out of juice but only fruit juice rather than energy the wto is hoping to prove it still has a role to play in tackling big global challenges wto chief ngozi okonjo iweala who took over in march 2021 has hinged her leadership on breathing new life into the sclerotic organisation progress is being made but it needs a little more work and more time the director general said it requires that we work and work nights whatever it takes the last wto ministerial conference in december 2017 in buenos aires was widely considered a flop closing without a major agreement and okonjo iweala wants no repeat the global trade body only takes decisions by consensus among all 164 members making deals all the harder to conclude okonjo iweala was hoping to pull off a coup by securing a long sought deal on curbing harmful fishing subsidies india in the firing line negotiations towards banning subsidies that encourage overfishing and threaten the sustainability of the planet s fish stocks have been going on at the wto for more than two decades diplomats say a deal is closer now than ever before but india threw a spanner in the works late tuesday insisting it would not sign up without a 25 year exemption far longer than many are comfortable with some emerging from the negotiating rooms are blaming indian intransigence on not just fisheries but across the board citing their destructive tactics one diplomatic source close to the negotiations said the question is are they really going to pull the whole edifice down or whether they re willing to go along with the views of the vast majority of members on fishing the source added now is the time civil society wants this fishing communities want it and our fish need it wto reform agriculture and e commerce deals are also on the table saving wto not lives there are things that are going in the right direction and others that unfortunately are not progressing very much france s foreign trade minister franck riester told reporters before the all night talks with health issues looking among the most promising one pandemic related text seeks to tackle supply constraints faced by certain countries in getting hold of covid fighting tools ministers are also discussing the possibility of imposing a temporary waiver on covid 19 vaccine patents but some countries that host major pharmaceutical companies like britain and switzerland are finding some of the draft wording problematic ngos believe the text does not go nearly far enough civil society activists staged a die in protest in the wto s atrium accusing the eu britain switzerland and the united states of scuppering a meaningful covid intellectual property waiver the proposal on the table is intended to save the reputation of the wto but it will not save a human life from the pandemic demonstration organiser deborah james told afp swiss economy minister guy parmelin insisted he remained against a wide ranging waiver adding patents have not slowed access to vaccines quite the opposite
by oxford miss the discovery that mississippi s actual population is significantly higher than 2020 u s census numbers indicate could affect future federal funding and possibly other factors according to university of mississippi population studies experts mississippi was among six states in which the census bureau reported found significant undercounting as part of its post enumeration survey a follow up examination the bureau conducted for the 2020 census and released recently the other states undercounted by the 2020 census are arkansas florida illinois tennessee and texas amounting to a total estimated undercount in the south of 1 85 mississippi experienced the third highest undercount rate of 4 1 arkansas was undercounted by 5 04 and tennessee by 4 78 census data released in late 2021 showed a dip in the state s population by roughly 6 000 people over the last decade but with an official population count of 2 95 million a statewide miscount of 4 would mean mississippi s tally was off by about 118 000 people we will absolutely miss out on dollars said anne cafer director of the um center for population studies more than 20 million a year for the next 10 years and that will be felt most acutely by the state s most vulnerable residents the newest estimates from the bureau s survey indicates that children aged 0 4 were undercounted more than any other age groups while those aged 18 24 were overcounted the most followed by significant overcounts in the retirement age population along with the under 5 population international immigrants minority identifying black african american american indian hispanic latino and asian pacific islander non english speaking households rural populations and people living in poverty are expected to be undercounted at the highest rate the cause of the undercount remains unclear the report does not detail any potential causes of the undercount nor does it include information on possible overcounts or undercounts at a municipal or county level census data can impact state and local projects such as redistricting grant applications and economic development programs a variety of state and local projects rely upon census data including redistricting efforts grant applications and economic development efforts the center is responsible for outreach related to the census cafer said this new report doesn t change that we will continue to monitor reports coming from the census bureau and help local governments navigate a new data landscape we are also reaching out to complementary offices in the state to understand how we provide a robust suite of support reaching out to our networks of state data center sdc folks to see how they are troubleshooting this as always we will work to be proactive to our constituents needs one of these efforts involves mapping out internal and external migration to understand population loss and gain on a micro level for better local decision making the undercounts may bring ramifications down the road for redistricting said matt hancock a research and development staffer in demography at the center but he could not speculate concerning what these changes may actually be i would guess that there will be a revived conversation around redistricting hancock said for instance it is expected that texas and florida may have missed out an additional congressional seat due to their miscount while redistricting concerns may come up all congressional redistricting was completed using the previously reported 2020 counts and updates to those counts will not affect any apportionment or redistricting the mississippi automated resource information system housed at the institutions of higher learning in jackson is helping to assemble a complete and clean statewide database of the local address for the 2030 census to avoid future undercounts although maris has no power to use the data it gathers and interprets to remedy undercounts or change policies it can help the census bureau ensure that future counts are more accurate said jim steil maris director mississippi s population is typically considered undercounted because the state is largely rural and has a considerable number of people who want to be left alone and do not respond he said the impact of the 2020 undercount on the state s federal funding until the next census will be massive funding is what we lose while still having the full population to serve steil said by not collecting data from all 87 000 plus new corrected addresses the 118 000 residents mississippi loses over 4 6 million per year in potential federal formula funding based solely on census population that potential lost funding is repetitive for total loss of over 236 million to the state over the next 10 years many other factors aligned to lower the mississippi population count in 2020 steil said separate census efforts follow during the data collection period to ensure everyone participates by phone mail or during door to door surveys he said unfortunately the actual census is a snapshot of who lives in a location on april 1 2020 during peak covid lockdown while it is somewhat consoling that the census bureau admits to the miscount it is unfortunate that the bureau was not able to take advantage of all the updated addresses and faced so many challenges for the initial 2020 count steil said steil is an advocate for collaborating between the censuses having real time proof of our number of households should prevent any missing of households in the future he said
the john sullivan independence hall on the old post road josh labella hearst connecticut media fairfield a proposed apartment building downtown has several obstacles to its approval the application made by developer 15 unquowa road llc requests permission to build a 63 unit multi family development at the address for which it is named the development would be known as center commons christopher smith the developer s attorney said the application aligns with fairfield s affordable housing plan citing aspects of the plan s goals such as providing diverse housing stock for a wide variety of people promoting walkability and transit oriented development as well as helping retain existing businesses and attract new ones advertisement article continues below this ad members of the town plan and zoning commission focused on the development s impact on sewers drainage and groundwater as well as the text amendment during a public hearing on tuesday the meeting was adjourned after a long unfinished presentation and questioning from the commission and will be continued june 28 jim wendt fairfield s planning director said the developer is requesting a zoning text amendment and site plan approval from the commission he said the property is a through lot between unquowa and sanford street adding it is adjacent to the community theater town plan and zoning commission chair thomas noonan said there is concern that the text amendment which would make it possible to build the housing in that zone could lead to more multi family residential development thereby taking away commercial space and causing other issues we have more density potentially more impact on the sewers same with drainage and parking he said with the idea that these regulations are opening the door for those possibilities but at the same time having these future applications be 8 30g unto themselves i would think it s still proper of us to look at the impact of these regulations on the entire zone if that were adopted advertisement article continues below this ad wendt noted a proposal was withdrawn last year for that site wendt said the proposal calls for a bigger building than the prior application did with plans for 51 2 stories there will also be parking underneath the building and around it he said the height of the building would be taller than zoning regulations allow but the application was filed under 8 30g so the developer would be exempt from that rule state statute 8 30g allows developers to bypass municipal laws and regulations as long as a certain percentage of the project is affordable housing of the 63 units in this development 19 would be restricted as affordable smith said the new application removed the planned commercial area on the first floor because it is not exactly clear in 8 30g if there can be a commercial component he said the developer would be happy to include the commercial space if the commission said it would approve it advertisement article continues below this ad according to town documents the 20 610 square foot property would be the site of a 66 140 square foot apartment building that would offer 16 studio four one bedroom and 43 two bedroom units jason edwards the developer s engineer said the building has been designed to be water tight and the runoff system in place would reduce runoff by more than a third larry edwards another engineer for the developer said the sewer design has been upgraded to allow nearly double the usage over the prior plan members of the tpz noted the developer has conditional approval from the water pollution control authority which was originally granted approval for the prior smaller application the conditions required the developer to increase the size of the sewer pipe do an additional flow analysis and get approval from the connecticut department of transportation and utility company advertisement article continues below this ad it s not in line with what we re normally seeing noonan said it s a conditional approval that based on what you re telling me seems likely to happen smith said the standard of approval for the tpz should be based on if there is a reasonable probability that the wpca will approve the plans and recommended consulting the town attorney larry edwards said the increase in pipe size would keep the sewers usage at approximately 40 percent noting the wpca uses 80 percent as an unspoken threshold commissioners showed interest in making their approval conditional to wpca approval which is also conditional joshua labella hearstmediact com

it is not going to be easy fed chair jerome powell warns there will be more economic damage before inflation comes down from a 41 year high 8 inflation as republicans blame biden s spending for forcing the biggest hike in interest rates since 1994 federal reserve raised the interest rate to 75 per cent in an attempt to rein in record high levels of inflation officials agreed to their biggest hike since 1994 at their two day meeting that wrapped wednesday it s not going to be easy and it may well depend of course on events that are not under our control but our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome and that s what we re going to do powell said on may 5 speaking at a press conference after the central bank s two day policy meeting that ended wednesday powell reinstated that bringing down the inflation which currently sits at 8 6 percent was a high priority the move will increase its benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans to between 1 5 and 1 75 it will drive up loan rates for homes cars credit cards a it will be more expensive to borrow money we re strongly committed to bringing inflation down and we re moving expeditiously to do so powell said biden disregarded criticism on tuesday before the federation of labor and congress of industrial organization convention in philadelphia he cited job growth low unemployment and a strong labor market i don t want to hear any more of these lies about reckless spending he said we re changing people s lives federal chair jerome powell has warned the american economy will see even more damage before inflation comes down from a 41 year high of 8 per cent which republicans have blamed on biden s spending the federal reserve on wednesday raised interest rates by 0 75 per cent their biggest increase since 1994 in an attempt to rein in inflation powell had warned last month that more hikes are likely in the near future it s not going to be easy and it may well depend of course on events that are not under our control but our job is to use our tools to try to achieve that outcome and that s what we re going to do powell said on may 5 speaking at a press conference after the central bank s two day policy meeting that ended wednesday powell reinstated that bringing down the inflation which currently sits at 8 6 percent was a high priority but americans must now brace for a double whammy of higher repayments and ongoing rises in the cost of living as the fed s planned remedy for inflation begins to kick in we re strongly committed to bringing inflation back down and we re moving expeditiously to do so powell said inflation has obviously surprised to the upside over the past year and further surprises could be in store we therefore will need to be nimble in responding to incoming data he said we think that the public generally sees us as as very likely to be successful in getting inflation down to 2 percent and that s critical he noted it will take some time to get inflation back down but we will do that the high inflation rate has resulted in increased prices of food gas and housing areas that affect most americans republicans have hammered democrats politically on the high prices of good and services for americans and many democrats are worried they will take a battering at the polls in this november s midterm election the gop has largely blamed biden s spending policies including his 1 9 trillion american rescue plan and the 1 2 trillion infrastructure investment and jobs act for the stark inflation rise whether it s not taking inflation seriously letting gas reach more than 5 a gallon or not having baby formula shelves stocked americans are feeling the weight of president biden s disastrous decisions rep dan bishop r n c said in a statement to dailymail com the stressors of the biden economy keep piling on with no end in sight today s announced interest rate hike will only add to it biden disregarded criticism on tuesday before the federation of labor and congress of industrial organization convention in philadelphia he cited job growth low unemployment and a strong labor market i don t want to hear any more of these lies about reckless spending he said we re changing people s lives the federal reserve on wednesday raised interest rates by 75 percent in their biggest increase since 1994 in an attempt to

jerome powell said at a press conference after the central bank s two day policy meeting that ended wednesday biden disregarded criticism about his spending on tuesday before the federation of labor and congress of industrial organization convention in philadelphia i don t want to hear any more of these lies about reckless spending he said we re changing people s lives the move will increase its benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans to between 1 5 percent and 1 75 percent the result will drive up loan rates for homes cars credit cards and other items making it much more expensive to borrow money the measure by the central bank to raise interest rates by 75 will increase its benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans to between 1 5 percent and 1 75 percent the result will drive up loan rates for homes cars credit cards and other items making it much more expensive to borrow money he said the central bank wants to see inflation get down to 2 percent from a record 8 percent with rising prices among the top concerns for american voters heading into midterms that are predicted to end in heavy losses for the democrats powell had suggested last week that a higher than expected hike in interest rates was coming the stock market rallied after the official announcement the s p 500 was 1 9 percent higher thee dow jones gained 397 points and the nasdaq composite was 2 7 percent higher it is essential that we bring inflation down if we were to have a sustained period of strong labor market conditions he said he warned more hikes could be coming and that inflation could get worse before it gets better and more interest rate increases could follow powell said that he anticipates that ongoing increases in that rate will be appropriate he said that would not likely be as high as wednesday s 75 per cent increase he predicted the next increase would be 50 per cent powell had suggested last week that a higher than expected hike in interest rates was coming the stock market rallied after the official announcement the s p 500 was 1 9 percent higher thee dow jones gained 397 points and the nasdaq composite was 2 7 percent higher affects of latest interest rate hike will this make it more expensive to buy a home one of the sectors the fed has been watching closely is the interest rate sensitive housing market where prices have risen 38 percent since the start of the pandemic the surge has been driven by low borrowing costs put in place by the fed to cushion the economy from the covid 19 pandemic meeting an upswell in demand and a shortage of properties for sale mortgage rates have already risen sharply since the fed began signaling late last year it would likely tighten policy with the average contract rate on a 30 year fixed rate mortgage reaching 5 65 percent last week the highest level since late 2008 the mortgage bankers association reported earlier on wednesday mortgage rates are definitely going to go up over the next few weeks said matthew pointon senior property economist at capital economics with daily mortgage data showing the average 30 year fixed rate now around 6 28 percent and possibly going above 6 5 percent over the next few weeks worse is set to come pointon says with mortgage rates probably not peaking until the middle of next year if mortgages hit 7 percent it means that for the average person trying to purchase a 400 000 home with a down payment of 10 000 they would be stuck with a 2 913 mortgage payment after the rate hike a significant jump from the 2 730 before the increase will my credit card costs go up if you ve got outstanding loans without fixed interest rates the answer is a simple yes though the fed doesn t control what banks or car dealers charge for such loans credit card rates and auto loans typically rise when the fed s policy rate does household debt has been rising rapidly with consumer credit up more than 8 percent in the first quarter to 1 5 trillion a recent fed survey showed the hike will also play a major role in people s ability to pay off debt as the average interest rate on credit cards jumped to more than 19 percent the average american has about 6 000 in credit card debt according to experian consumer credit with the new interest rates consumers would have to pay 349 a month to pay off the debt in 24 months a slight increase from 346 before the hike what about my auto loans and student and personal loans the interest needed to pay back on auto loans will see a modest increase as the average new car costs about 25 000 a new rate increase to 11 05 percent means that in the five years to pay off the car consumers will have paid an additional 6 120 84 for the interest it s a notable rise from the 5 673 95 from the previous rate although the interest will go up auto dealers tend to be more sensitive to the competition and through five year financing the monthly payment interest will likely go up by on 7 for most americans student loan payments will also see a boost as prior to the interest rate hike an average loan of 28 400 would become 37 494 in ten years with the new interest rate at 6 55 percent a graduate would have to pay a total of 38 784 in 10 years even personal loan repayments will see a similar increase a personal loan has an average 20 06 percent interest rate according to nerd wallet so to pay off a 10 000 loan in five years consumers would have to spend 15 916 37 after the hike a borrower would need 16 167 95 to pay off that loan in five years how will my savings account be affected savings certificates of deposit and money market accounts don t typically track the fed s changes instead banks tend to capitalize on a higher rate environment to try to thicken their profits they do so by imposing higher rates on borrowers without necessarily offering any juicer rates to savers but while interest on loans continue soaring savings accounts are expected to rise from an average 0 07 percent to 0 08 percent this means that a 5 000 savings account with a monthly deposit of 200 will yield 7 404 88 within a year will this bring down the cost of living in short no that s one of the difficulties the fed is facing by raising rates it can cool demand in the economy by making borrowing costs more expensive nudging consumers and businesses to curb spending but it can t do anything about supply shocks advertisement clearly today s 75 basis point increase is an unusually large one and i do not expect moves of this size to be common from the perspective of today either a 50 basis point or a 75 basis point increase seems most likely at our next meeting we will however make our decisions meeting by meeting he noted the fed s policy setting federal open market committee said it remains strongly committed to returning inflation to its 2 percent objective and expects to continue to raise the key rate committee members now see the federal funds rate ending the year at 3 4 percent up from the 1 9 percent projection in march the hikes also show how the central bank is struggling to combat inflation until this week economists had expected the fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by only half a point but to show its seriousness in combating inflation even at the price of the economy officials also predicted that the unemployment rate will increase to 3 7 per cent this year and to 4 1 per cent by 2024 we don t seek to put people out of work powell said of course we never think too many people are working and fewer people need to have jobs but we also think that you really cannot have the kind of labor market we want without price stability and we have to we have to go back and establish price stability white house press secretary karine jean pierre was asked on wednesday if the administration believes higher employment is an acceptable trade off for lower inflation she didn t directly answer simply saying we brought unemployment rate down below 4 4 percent she also noted the federal reserve would deal with inflation under their purview they have the best monetary policies to do that and so we want to give that independence there the central bank operates independently of the white house the president appoints the board members who serve fixed year terms at his press conference powell blamed russian president vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine for the increased prices of food and gas an argument made by president joe biden and his administration and powell said the covid pandemic in china will still causing supply chain issues the surge in prices of crude oil and other commodities that resulted from russia s invasion of ukraine is boosting prices for gasoline and food and is creating additional upward pressure on inflation he said and covid related lockdowns in china are likely to exacerbate supply chain disruptions he also sounded a positive note saying inflation in the united states was not as a bad as in other parts of the world if you look around the world at where inflation levels are it s absolutely extraordinary it s not just here in fact we re sort of in the middle of the pack although i think we have a different kind of inflation then other people have and partly because our economy is stronger and more highly recovered he said the high costs of goods and services have sparked fears the country may be headed into a post pandemic recession when covid struck the fed took several immediate measures to ease economic burdens including slashing interest rates now inflation and the economy have spiked to the top of voters concerns headed into the november election that will decide what party controls congress the interest rate hikes already have led to increased borrowing costs with the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate topping 6 percent powell warned housing prices could go up in the short term prices may keep going up for a while even in a world where rates are up so it s a complicated situation we watch it very carefully he said he suggested waiting to buy a new home if you re a homebuyer somebody or a young person looking to buy a home you need a bit of a reset we need to get back to a place where supply and demand are back together and we re inflation is down low again and mortgages or mortgage rates are low again he noted the fed raised rates by a half percentage point last month the first such increase since 2000 to a range between 0 75 percent and 1 percent ahead of wednesday s announcement u s stocks and bonds were up on the presumption the fed would raise the interest rate it was a promising sign after the s p 500 closed in a bear market on monday down 3 9 percent the s p closed down more than 20 percent from its january high for the first time since 2020 the dow jones industrial average fell 2 8 percent or about 875 points while the tech heavy nasdaq composite declined 4 7 percent white house press secretary karine jean pierre said on monday that the white house was watching the stock market closely we re watching closely we know families are concerned about inflation in the stock market that is something that the president is really aware of she said biden s average approval rating on gas prices is about 30 on inflation it s also about 30 percent we know that higher prices are having a real effect on people s lives jean pierre said we get that and we are incredibly focused on doing everything that we can to make sure that the economy is working we are coming out of the strongest job market in american history and that matters and that a lot of that is thanks to the american rescue plan which only democrats voted for that republicans did not and it led to this this economic growth this historic economic boom that we re seeing she denied the boom also led to the historic records of inflation the white house has been defensive of president joe biden s economic record as voters give him low marks for his handling of inflation biden on tuesday slammed donald trump for his job losses as he defended his own stewardship of the economy during record high inflation a bear market and fears of a recession do you remember when our economy was like what it looked like before we took office 3 000 americans are dying every day from covid 20 million americans had lost their jobs on the last guy biden said during a speech in philadelphia before the afl cio in fact so many americans lost their jobs that my predecessor became just a second president in history to leave office was fewer jobs in america and when he took office he added trump left office as the covid pandemic caused a nationwide shutdown biden is dealing with a post pandemic opening of high inflation a declining stock market and fears of a recession besides attacking his predecessor he did not mention trump by name in his speech biden argued he was doing all he could to bring down the prices of gas and food and he framed the economic debate as a political choice ahead of the november midterm election america still has a choice to make a choice between a government by the few for the few or a government for all of us democracy for all of us an economy where all of us have a fair shot he said he once again blamed russian president vladimir putin s invasion of the ukraine for the spike in prices i m doing everything in my power to blunt putin s gas price hike just since he invaded ukraine has gone up 1 74 gallon because of nothing else but that he said so i have a plan to bring down the cost of gas and food it s gonna take time president joe biden prices of everything from gas to travel to hotels have gone up by double digits since january 2021 the labor department s report on friday showed that the consumer price index jumped 1 percent in may from the prior month for a 12 month increase of 8 6 percent the annual increase driven by soaring food and energy prices was hotter than economists had expected and topped the recent

u s federal reserve chair jerome powell speaks during a news conference on interest rates the economy and monetary policy actions at the federal reserve building in washington dc june 15 afp yonhap the federal reserve intensified its fight against high inflation on wednesday raising its key interest rate by three quarters of a point the largest bump since 1994 and signaling more rate hikes ahead as it tries to cool off the u s economy without causing a recession the unusually large rate hike came after data released friday showed u s inflation rose to a four decade high of 8 6 percent last month a surprise jump that made financial markets uneasy about how the fed would respond the fed s benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans will now be pegged to a range of 1 5 percent to 1 75 percent and fed policymakers forecast a doubling of that range by year s end we thought strong action was warranted at this meeting and we delivered that fed chair jay powell said at a press conference in which he stressed the central bank s commitment to do what it takes to bring inflation back down to the fed s target rate of 2 percent even if that resulted in a slightly higher unemployment rate powell said it was imperative to go bigger than the half point increase the fed had earlier signaled because inflation was running hotter than anticipated causing particular hardship on low income americans and solidifying the public s view that stubbornly high inflation won t be easily resolved powell said that another three quarter point hike is possible at the fed s next meeting in late july if inflation pressures remain high although he said such increases would not be common he said the economy is strong enough to endure higher rates without tipping into recession a prospect that many economists are increasingly worried about some financial analysts suggested powell struck the right balance to reassure markets which rallied on wednesday he hit it hard that we want to get inflation down but also hit hard that we want a soft landing said robert tipp chief investment strategist at pgim fixed income still the fed s action wednesday was an acknowledgment that it s struggling to curb the pace and persistence of inflation which is being fueled by a strong labor market pandemic related supply disruptions and soaring energy prices that have been aggravated by russia s invasion of ukraine some analysts said they welcomed the fed s more aggressive posture the more the fed does now the less they will have to later said thomas garretson

to be a far bumpier ride to get inflation down than what they had anticipated previously luzzetti said inflation has shot to the top of voter concerns in the months before congress midterm elections souring the public s view of the economy weakening president joe biden s approval ratings and raising the likelihood of democratic losses in november biden has sought to show he recognizes the pain that inflation is causing american households but has struggled to find policy actions that might make a real difference the president has stressed his belief that the power to curb inflation rests mainly with the fed yet the fed s rate hikes are blunt tools for trying to lower inflation while also sustaining growth shortages of oil gasoline and food are contributing to higher prices powell said several times during the news conference that such factors are out of the fed s control and may force it to push rates even higher to ultimately bring down inflation borrowing costs have already risen sharply across much of the u s economy in response to the fed s moves with the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate topping 5 percent its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis up from just 3 percent at the start of the year even if a recession can be avoided economists say it s almost inevitable that the fed will have to inflict some pain most likely in the form of higher unemployment as the price of defeating chronically high inflation powell struck a defensive note when asked whether the fed was now prepared to accept a recession as the price of curbing inflation and bringing it close to the 2 percent target level we re not trying to induce a recession now he said let s be clear about that we re trying to achieve 2 percent inflation in their updated forecasts wednesday the fed s policymakers indicated that after this year s rate increases they foresee two more rate hikes by the end of 2023 at which point they expect inflation to finally fall below 3 percent close to their target level but they expect inflation to still be 5 2 percent at the end of this year much higher than they d estimated in march over the next two years the officials are forecasting a much weaker economy than was envisioned in march they expect the unemployment rate to reach 3 7 percent by year s end and 3 9 percent by the end of 2023 those are only slight increases from the current 3 6 percent jobless rate but they mark the first time since it began raising rates that the fed has acknowledged that its actions will weaken the economy the central bank has also sharply lowered its projections for economic growth to 1 7 percent this year and next that s below its outlook in march but better than some economists expectation for a recession next year federal

and then we think about the planet so our impact on the planet as a business sustainably looking at our scope 1 scope 2 scope 3 emissions travel data centres that we have to do as a business so you know we just put it all into a lens of long term thinking and sustainability when will you get to net zero we have a plan to get there by 2040 energy wise we ve moved to 100 per cent renewable energy all around the world we did that five years early on pure emissions we don t cheat we have a lot of challenges we include all our scope 3 emissions so all transport travelling back and forth to san francisco our data centres we can easily say we got rid of all our data centres two years ago so we have no scope 2 emissions well hang on a second we just moved all our stuff to aws we didn t change the problem we just made it their problem so we include scope 3 it s still our problem advertisement what do you make of the current energy crisis and what should policymakers do right now we don t have enough renewables in the grid coal and gas is very expensive because of international issues a few domestic issues and floods then you have all of the market conditions and the operational conditions and everything else that triggers it but those are the two triggers what can we do about it well i think you have to break it into short medium and long term we often look for some short term fix like what are we gonna do with power prices tomorrow and you re like hang on a second like let s remember we got into this because of 10 plus years of inaction and now you want to solve it tomorrow that s like i had cake for 30 years and then i suddenly wanted to be fit tomorrow it s probably not going to happen right so in the short term look definitely something has to be done around i think exported gas that s probably the easiest source of income for the country lots of ways to do that we have theoretical tax on that we don t enforce it very well advertisement the gas that is going overseas that 600 whatever it is and was economically built at 100 or less that s one case that could generate significant income quite quickly then you ask where do you put the relief households and businesses that are struggling cannon brookes says taxes on exported gas are not well enforced krystle wright if you re talking about the national energy market that s a different issue the australian energy market operator aemo and others are trying really hard to manage what is the variable energy system we should be thankful that we have a variable energy system we build the best energy market in the world the nem is a demand and supply very well regulated very well managed competitive energy system that certainly has flaws right guess what stock markets introduced a lot of rules over the past 30 years to stop various things going on that are nefarious but we still want to have a free market with prices that trade up and down and we have energy prices that trade up and down advertisement if you scroll down to what can we do at a small level look electrifying houses electrifying businesses are still the short to medium term solution how do you think about the trade off with coal and gas we don t have a shortage of coal we have coal breaking down because it s old it s very expensive energy and it breaks so we have to move faster onto renewables and transmission that s not a particularly complicated equation as to what we need it s just a question of how quickly can we roll it out and how ambitiously do we go after that problem do we need more gas extraction no absolute bulls that is not going to solve the energy prices for 20 years or more if ever take it off the table it makes no sense for solving the problem more renewables yes it will bring the price of energy in the grid down on an average basis look at the act the only territory which is not going backwards because they re committed to 100 per cent renewables if you re currently living in canberra you re laughing at everyone else s power bills advertisement do we need more gas generation no we ve proved that we need 600 million in government subsidies to fund kurri kurri because it s a non viable project it s still a non viable project getting less viable every month by the way so we don t need any new gas generation aemo will tell you that we have enough gas to get 85 per cent renewables in the grid today we just need to get the renewables into the grid we re continuing to do that it s good to see offshore wind in victoria credit to what they re doing down there that s fantastic to have those targets the renewable energy zones in nsw require transmission they re trying to solve the chicken and egg problem doing a really good job if you look ahead five to 10 years it s a really optimistic picture for where we could get to in our grid and that will bring your prices down another solution would be a capacity mechanism thoughts on that particularly if it includes gas it is somewhat complicated we somewhat have a capacity mechanism in the price at the moment the problem people complain about is when the price is high people make a lot of money well kind of most gas generators in the country i think run like 1 per cent to 2 per cent of the year so for 98 per cent of the year they re sitting around being polished maintained making sure it s running turning on and off it s an expensive task because when you need it it better turn on advertisement does the nem need some sort of framework for capacity i think it s an interesting conversation i think it needs to be explored quite deeply it would be good if it was balanced correctly to not maintain existing expensive resources so it s always this question of should it not include coal and should it include batteries or pumped hydro whatever yes maybe the snowy hydro project we should remember that we have this big white elephant project called snowy 2 0 i got in trouble from one of you guys at the afr three years ago when i said it s going to cost 10 billion plus someone said no it s going to cost 3 billion still thinking i m working on good odds there it s going to cost an awful lot of money and it s unfortunately shut down the market for storage because it s such a big project it s an overhang twenty years from now we ll work it all out in the next five years it s unfortunately depressing what should be a vibrant storage market so you have to think about the capacity market in that sense too because you ve got a giant source of capacity coming online it s very expensive unfortunately it s going to take a lot longer what s my incentive to build a small storage battery am i just arbitraging am i just doing frequency control that s a market that s getting quickly mopped up so it s pretty hard to make money out of that advertisement it s very hard to see how those projects become viable with that overhang but certainly the idea of a capacity market is a really good one as long as it promotes in the long term the cheapest energy prices we should have the cheapest energy prices in the world it s highly competitive for australia to do so will that mechanism get us there faster is the question we should be asking on a long term average let s talk about agl there s been a dramatic overthrow of the demerger strategy there s now no one really in charge you re now the biggest shareholder in the biggest carbon emitter in the country to paraphrase colin powell s advice to george bush on iraq you break it you own it where to from here i don t think i ve ever been referred to as george bush look it was an entirely necessary and logical thing that we did we had very long odds when we started there was quite some surprise through the process but we i would say maintained high honesty ethics throughout the whole thing clarity of vision and that doesn t change today the demerger was a very very bad idea for shareholders was an incredibly bad idea for customers an incredibly bad idea for the staff and it made less and less logical sense with every month that went past don t forget this is an idea that started two and a bit years ago there was no renewable energy zones in nsw there was no large scale wind in victoria the economics of what was going on just changed rapidly and unfortunately these long corporate processes take time advertisement the leaderless nature of the company that s not particularly useful often in american capital markets no board gets to sit around five years lose 70 per cent of value and no one loses their job that doesn t happen and it should happen far more if you want to get paid a couple of hundred grand drink some coffee at the top of the building every couple of months this is not the job for you so all we did is precipitate i think a capitalist outcome to say hang on a second you ve destroyed seven out of 10 of shareholder value time to let someone else have a go at hopefully growing shareholder value not destroying it that s exactly what we re intending to do we need to rebuild the board with a much more ambitious forward thinking progressive board for shareholders and for the environment and for the workers forgot about the s again an incredibly important part of the equation we need a paris aligned plan for the business which is entirely possible that will i think have much more realistic dates for the transition for that business it will also enable many more resources to come in and will also unlock capital for the business and unlock a lot of very talented smart people who work there towards attacking this problem so can we get it done absolutely so they are the upsides but what about the negative consequences governance at the company is now in trouble hang on it had incredibly poor governance and we re going to fix that advertisement will you be on the board we re going to fix it incredibly you re putting your hand up look it s a company led process we re certainly putting in a lot of high quality candidates we had a huge number of people reach out some in this room we have to fix it right and it has to be a more ambitious board i ve told everybody i ve talked to this is not your standard asx board job if you want to get paid a couple of hundred grand drink some coffee at the top of the building every couple of months this is not the job for you this will be the hardest but most fulfilling board appointment you will do in your life and probably the most meaningful advertisement this is the largest decarbonisation project in the world people struggle to remember how big this company is forty million tonnes a year is more than entire countries like sweden ireland new zealand this is the dirtiest company per billion dollars of market cap per megawatt of energy generated almost on the planet it s horribly shameful and we re going to fix it and if you re a director who wants to be a part of that awesome yes it is a big emitter but it has an awful lot of customers who are relying on that supply what are you saying to them about the uncertainty that is now in the air around this company i don t think there is uncertainty in the air for customers it s a regulated energy market and we re not going to suddenly stop providing power to people are we going to make their power cheaper yes is that our job yes advertisement it s a very simple business proposition if your job is providing energy the cheaper you provide it the more customers you can get having a large customer base in energy should allow you to create the cheapest energy possible and we should intend to do that for customers small single households all the way up to large and there are some very large customers by the way that have been very clear with the company that they want 100 per cent renewable energy when their contracts come up in 2028 2029 what s the plan we had to serve it to them none so you re gonna lose your largest customer so can we provide cheaper energy to the customers yes will we be cheaper than we would otherwise have been in a demerged state three four or five years from now one hundred per cent guaranteed agl s liddell coal power plant in nsw so from a customer point of view it should be very good from the point of view of employees and the workers at the company incredibly important you know how many calls the company had made to a single union leader about the demerger zero absolutely zero i called all of them they were like oh wow someone wants to talk to us this is amazing like what do you know about the demerger nothing no one will talk to us that s f ed you know how many of those union leaders thought those things were running in 2040 none not one i haven t spoken to a single person in the hunter or latrobe who believes these things are running in 2040 what they want is a plan we have a decade to give them a plan and we owe them honesty and empathy to say we need your help to get to here it s simple stuff they just want someone to talk to them and be clear what does it mean for them what should they be planning for in their lives advertisement so when does this company get out of coal a paris aligned plan would say 2035 is probably the outer date that unlocks cheaper capital and much more capital to make that transition the concreteness of a plan allows supply to come into the market we saw that with liddell when you have a clear closure date and you know what s going to happen a lot of other products become affordable become economic somewhere in the 2030 to 2035 range is the likely date aemo models profitability of these resources as part of the energy price we re out of brown coal by 2030 and out of black coal by 2032 in the grid that s what aemo s model is they are one of the best in the world however their models have historically been on the conservative side so one would assume we re probably a year or two ahead of that aemo model that s a logical sort of market down view of when these resources are not profitable when they re economically tonnes of money at that point what is the secret sauce to making this work there s no doubt technology plays a huge role here the future gen tailer wants to have sources of generation that it can either firm or tap or an equity interest in and it wants to earn ability to control those sources of generation and control is a really important point here and it wants to own a large customer base to hedge and balance them against the best customer base involves some very large customers some very small customers advertisement and you need a lot of technology to co ordinate those resources and that s where technology comes in to say that we consider households to be generators and consumers is probably not future thinking it s past thinking agl would go up and say we ve built 2 8 gigawatts of renewables in 20 years and i would say but you ve built zero in the last five years both of those statements are true by the way second 2 8 gigawatts in 20 years is not something to be celebrated by the biggest retailer or generator in the country australian households put 3 1 gigawatts of solar on their roof in 2021 in a pandemic in tricky circumstances 3 1 gigawatts on australian household roofs is more than what agl did in 20 years so in terms of the ability to make this change yes we can make it a lot faster those household generators are sources of demand management they re sources of generation they re gonna go up a lot when they put electric vehicles in there are huge opportunities in this business that s exactly why we re there in first place advertisement audience question on the energy mix and baseload what are your thoughts on gas nuclear and batteries i don t know why the afr supports nuclear i really don t it makes no sense it s nothing to do with politics it s just a super expensive source of energy that australia i will take a bet with anyone will never build it makes no sense it will not help us with this problem it takes decades to build and we have no capability and guess what everyone building it elsewhere in the world their costs are blowing out massively it s a super expensive source of energy a lot of make great science experiments when you actually try to build them at scale they become engineering projects and become super expensive and the cost of energy generated just doesn t make any sense so please can we just put that to bed or move on we should be aiming for 500 percent 800 per cent renewables that is the cheapest path for household industrial energy and we ll also create the largest export industry we ve ever had in this country

fomc hikes 75 basis points to a 1 75 upper target fed funds expected to be 3 4 at year end up from 1 9 retail sales drop 0 3 in may missing the 0 2 forecast atlanta fed q2 gdp estimate falls from 0 9 to 0 there is no sign i can see of a broader slowdown in the economy we are not trying to induce a recession federal reserve chair jerome powell federal reserve chair jerome powell put a brave face on the bank s largest rate increase in 28 years the third in as many meetings it does appear the us economy is strong and well positioned to withstand higher interest rates markets took the unexpected acceleration in rate hikes in stride but the us economy is showing signs of inflation fatigue despite the fed s positive assertion fed funds rate fxstreet today s 75 basis point hike to 1 75 was prompted by an 8 6 reading in may s annual consumer price index cpi that unexpected acceleration above the march high of 8 5 led the fed to take the unusual step of changing its rate outlook during its two week media blackout before the federal open market committee meeting fomc an anonymous and assumed fed source informed the wall street journal whose article on monday alerted markets that the rate prescription had changed from 0 5 the fed also issued its updated economic and rate projections the second of four each year the year end estimate for the fed funds rate rose to 3 4 from 1 9 in march implying a doubling from its current level economic growth in 2022 dropped to 1 7 from 2 8 pce inflation rose to 5 2 from 4 3 and core to 4 3 from 4 1 inflation is still expected to decline in 2023 to 2 6 for headline and 2 7 for core barely changed from the march projections there were no changes to the balance sheet reduction program that began this month with a 47 5 billion roll off of maturing securities markets after some initial uncertainty markets responded to the fed s rate increase with relief that it was not a more drastic 100 basis points equities rebounded from initial losses to post substantial gains the dow added 1 0 303 70 points to 30 668 53 and the s p 500 rose 1 46 54 51 points to 3 789 99 the nasdaq jumped 2 50 270 81 points after a long string of losses to 11 099 16 treasury yields retreated with the 10 year losing 8 4 points to 3 311 and the 2 year dropping 6 2 points to 3 217 the dollar also lost ground after early gains falling small amounts in all major pairs on the reversing credit yields inflation consumers and the fed the fed has consistently underestimated inflation chair powell and other officials insisted for most of last year that price increases were transitory as cpi climbed from 1 4 in january to 5 4 in june and 7 0 in december the april drop to 8 3 was taken as a sign that prices had begun to decline the reverse to 8 6 in may was clearly a shock to the policymakers consumers were probably not surprised it seems that 16 months of rising inflation may be all the family budget can tolerate retail sales dipped 0 3 in may instead of rising 0 2 the control group category that mimics the consumption component of gdp was flat well below its 0 5 forecast consumer discontent was reflected in the june michigan consumer sentiment index released last friday which skidded to 50 2 its lowest reading in the more than 50 year series history michigan consumer sentiment fxstreet in response to a number of recent economic statistics including the sales numbers the atlanta fed gdpnow second quarter estimate dropped from 0 9 to 0 first quarter gdp was 1 5 conclusion the federal reserve is facing an economic situation that has forced it to make the most unpalatable choice there is for a central banker growth or inflation inflation is devastating for consumers and especially painful when necessities food energy and shelter are rising even faster than overall prices families first turn to savings but that cannot last and soon households begin to cut back on spending once that begins and may s drop was ominous though hardly conclusive the odds of a recession rise sharply the fed has promised to thwart inflation running at its highest pace in four decades even though rate increases work through slowing economic growth and job creation policy makers could not give inflation a pass to preserve jobs even if they wanted to because price increases force consumers to curtail spending eventually reducing economic growth whether the fed raises rates or not having let inflation escape its control fed governors have no leeway for action either they risk a recession now with rate increases or inflation will deliver one in a few months anyway mr powell managed to reassure markets which are his main audience but his words will do little to buoy spirits across the country americans will make their own decisions unless there is a swift and dramatic improvement in inflation the window for a soft landing has probably already closed
washington ap the federal reserve intensified its fight against high inflation on wednesday raising its key interest rate by three quarters of a point the largest bump since 1994 and signaling more rate hikes ahead as it tries to cool off the u s economy without causing a recession the unusually large rate hike came after data released friday showed u s inflation rose last month to a four decade high of 8 6 the fed s benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans will now be pegged to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 and fed policymakers forecast a doubling of that range by year s end asked why the fed was announcing a more aggressive rate hike than the half point increase he had earlier signaled fed chair jay powell replied that the latest data had shown inflation to be hotter than anticipated and that the public s expectation of rising inflation had strengthened we thought strong action was warranted at this meeting he said and we delivered that powell said that another three quarter point hike is possible at the fed s next meeting in late july if inflation pressures remain high although he said such increases would not be common the fed s decision to impose a rate hike as large as it did wednesday was an acknowledgment that it s struggling to curb the pace and persistence of inflation which is being fueled by a strong labor market pandemic related supply disruptions and soaring energy prices that have been aggravated by russia s invasion of ukraine powell said he believes the economy is strong enough to endure higher rates without tipping into a recession a prospect that many economists are increasingly worried about some analysts said they welcomed the fed s more aggressive posture the more the fed does now the less they will have to later said thomas garretson senior portfolio strategist at rcb wealth management inflation has shot to the top of voter concerns in the months before congress midterm elections souring the public s view of the economy weakening president joe biden s approval ratings and raising the likelihood of democratic losses in november biden has sought to show he recognizes the pain that inflation is causing american households but has struggled to find policy actions that might make a real difference the president has stressed his belief that the power to curb inflation rests mainly with the fed yet the fed s rate hikes are blunt tools for trying to lower inflation while also sustaining growth shortages of oil gasoline and food are escalating prices the fed isn t ideally suited to address many of the roots of inflation which involve russia s invasion of ukraine still clogged global supply chains labor shortages and surging demand for services from airline tickets to restaurant meals at his news conference powell struck a defensive note when asked whether the fed was now prepared to accept a recession as the price of curbing inflation and bringing it close to the fed 2 target level we re not trying to induce a recession now he said let s be clear about that we re trying to achieve 2 inflation borrowing costs have already risen sharply across much of the u s economy in response to the fed s moves with the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate topping 6 its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis up from just 3 at the start of the year the yield on the 2 year treasury note a benchmark for corporate borrowing has jumped to 3 3 its highest level since 2007 even if a recession can be avoided economists say it s almost inevitable that the fed will have to inflict some pain most likely in the form of higher unemployment as the price of defeating chronically high inflation in their updated forecasts wednesday the fed s policymakers indicated that after this year s rate increases they foresee two more rate hikes by the end of 2023 at which point they expect inflation to finally fall below 3 close to their target level but they expect inflation to still be 5 2 at the end of this year much higher than they d estimated in march over the next two years the officials are forecasting a much weaker economy than was envisioned in march they expect the unemployment rate to reach 3 7 by year s end and 3 9 by the end of 2023 those are only slight increases from the current 3 6 jobless rate but they mark the first time since it began raising rates that the fed has acknowledged that its actions will weaken the economy the central bank has also sharply lowered its projections for economic growth to 1 7 this year and next that s below its outlook in march but better than some economists expectation for a recession next year investments around the world from bonds to bitcoin have tumbled on fears surrounding inflation and the prospect that the fed s aggressive drive to control it will cause a recession even if the fed manages the delicate trick of curbing inflation without causing a downturn higher rates will nevertheless inflict pressure on stocks the s p 500 has already sunk more than 20 this year meeting the definition of a bear market on wednesday the s p 500 rose 1 5 the two year treasury yield fell to 3 26 from 3 45 late tuesday with the biggest move happening after powell said not to expect 0 75 percentage point rate hikes to be common other central banks are also acting swiftly to try to quell inflation even with their nations at greater risk of recession than the u s the european central bank is expected to raise rates by a quarter point in july its first increase in 11 years it could announce a larger hike in september if record high levels of inflation persist on wednesday the ecb vowed to create a market backstop that could buffer member countries against financial turmoil of the kind that erupted during a debt crisis more than a decade ago the bank of england has raised rates four times since december to a 13 year high despite predictions that economic growth will be unchanged in the second quarter

the international rescue committee calls for global action to make this world refugee day a turning point in the campaign for dignity for the world s displaced people as new data reveals that 89 3 million people were forced to flee their homes last year taking the global toll to over 100 million inclusive of ukraine the numbers reflect the almost 90 million people displaced by ongoing conflict and disaster in countries such as afghanistan syria yemen somalia ethiopia and venezuela not included are the more than 7 million internally displaced people within ukraine and the more than 6 million refugees who have left ukraine since the conflict began in early 2022 in total a record number of over 100 million people globally have been uprooted from their homes an increase of 20 compared to the 82 4 million displaced at the end of 2020 overall the number of displaced persons has more than doubled in the last ten years alone david miliband president and ceo at the international rescue committee said 100 million people displaced including 14 million ukrainians forced to flee their homes is historic but will be the prelude to higher and higher numbers without urgent action this is not simply because it is the greatest displacement figure the world has seen since world war ii nearly equal to the populations of the united kingdom and canada combined nor even because of the unprecedented rate with which the world has reached this appalling mark this year s world refugee day is historic because it dramatizes the scale of global failure this is system failure in action failure of nations of diplomacy and of the legal regime this year s world refugee day must not simply be a day for reflection it must be a day for action to fight impunity and to shore up support for refugees and their hosts wherever they are and whomever they are catastrophic displacement figures are now an annual norm rather than abating violence and the worst impacts of climate change are testing the resilience of millions in crisis zones worldwide 41 million people are on the brink of famine compounded by the war in ukraine 274 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance a 63 increase in just two years this year the international rescue committee is calling on the global community to increase refugee resettlement opportunities at the highest possible levels the united states has set and must continue to set robust refugee admissions goals to the tune of 125 000 not inclusive of over 70 000 afghan allies that have been resettled in the united states since august of 2021 but they must also double down on fixes to resettlement infrastructure so that achieving these goals is actually possible the rest of the world must follow suit by committing to resettling an additional 200 000 refugees collectively boosting resettlement slots to 400 000 globally the irc is also calling on the international community to meaningfully invest in the crisis zones that drive the most global humanitarian need to have a chance at reducing the scale of human suffering donors must redirect official development assistance oda to target contexts hit hardest by system failure committing 50 of oda to fragile and conflict affected states ukraine afghanistan growing hunger rapidly escalate refugee crisis the impact of the war in ukraine has been felt worldwide only exacerbating record humanitarian suffering in east africa at least 25 million people face hunger as global wheat stocks dry up and climate change continues unabated in afghanistan 24 4 million people over 50 percent of the population face dire humanitarian need economic collapse and deteriorating basic services have meant afghanistan is now home to the highest number of food insecure people in the world this is the fourth decade of crisis in afghanistan and its six million displaced persons represent the most protracted displacement population in the world miliband continued ukraine s suffering must not become a new global norm instead the scale of humanitarian support should become the standard that can be expected for victims in other crises for the record number of displaced persons globally the populations that the irc and the wider humanitarian sector serves we need a total system upgrade inherent to this is a concerted and meaningful surge both in the humanitarian aid dedicated to the world s worst crisis zones and in global resettlement commitments the worst outcome would be standing by and allowing this grim milestone to be eclipsed next year as the world s most vulnerable pay the price of our inaction with their lives
st james jamaica tourism minister edmund bartlett on wednesday declared that there is no room in jamaica s tourism industry for partisan politics he was responding to monday s call from local corruption watchdog group national integrity action nia for fair play during the recruitment of 10 000 workers for the global cruise ship industry read nia calls for equity fairness in the recruitment of cruise line workers tourism doesn t have politics that way our politics is about how to bring more visitors to jamaica and how to earn more dollars for the country that s the politics of tourism bartlett said during a ceremony at the sangster international airport to mark the one millionth stopover visitor to the country for 2022 he had recently announced a recruitment drive aimed at identifying jamaicans to fill some of the 90 000 cruise ship jobs available worldwide the process he said would see input from members of parliament mps for the southern parishes from which workers will be drawn mps involvement bartlett stressed on wednesday should not be interpreted as partisan as these representatives are drawn from both the ruling jamaica labour party jlp and the opposition people s national party pnp the mps they are elected by the people there are pnp mps and jlp mps they are all the mps from st thomas to the northern part of st elizabeth i just want to make that point he said i just want everybody to appreciate when we decided we wanted to encourage recruitment only from the southern side of jamaica as a result we engaged the members of parliament to help in identifying the people and locations where that recruitment can take place he added the nia had made it clear that it had no issue with mps playing a role in the selection process saying their involvement was understandable it did suggest however that bartlett add more seats to the table during any discussion on the issue it is understandable that you have asked all mps on the south coast the non tourism belt to assist in recommending persons additionally however i would urge that you invite the parish ministers fraternal and the parish associations of jps on the south coast to also recommend persons to the cruise operator recruiters such an invitation and engagement would introduce a non political non governmental civil society component to a recruitment process which regrettably in jamaica has been too often monopolised by politics said monday s release from the nia s principal director trevor munroe bartlett did not respond to that suggestion during his remarks on wednesday he did however attempt to clarify the role the tourism ministry will play in the recruitment drive we re not recruiting any workers we don t recruit what we re doing is facilitating access to recruitment in a manner that will protect the stability of the industry because if we allow indiscriminate recruitment all over it will damage the existing stock of workers that is already diminished as a result of the pandemic the tourism minister said jamaica like other countries around the world is experiencing a shortage of tourism workers local stakeholders have repeatedly complained of challenges finding skilled employees who can do jobs that range from plumbing to front of house some workers laid off during the novel coronavirus pandemic found jobs in other industries while others started their own businesses or took jobs abroad bartlett has made it clear that every effort will be made to avoid further disruptions to the labour pool during the ongoing push to identify workers for the cruise ship industry he repeated the point on wednesday we don t want people to be taken out from treasure beach and from whitehouse and from sav negril and lucea and montego bay and falmouth and st ann and so forth all the way to portland bartlett said
fed attacks inflation with its largest rate hike since 1994 the federal reserve on wednesday intensified its drive to tame high inflation by raising its key interest rate by three quarters of a point its largest hike in nearly three decades and signaling more large rate increases to come that would raise the risk of another recession the move the fed announced after its latest policy meeting will increase its benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 the central bank is ramping up its drive to tighten credit and slow growth with inflation having reached a four decade high of 8 6 spreading to more areas of the economy and showing no sign of slowing americans are also starting to expect high inflation to last longer than they had before this sentiment could embed an inflationary psychology in the economy that would make it harder to bring inflation back to the fed s 2 target the fed s three quarter point rate increase exceeds the half point hike that chair jerome powell had previously suggested was likely to be announced this week the fed s decision to impose a rate hike as large as it did wednesday was an acknowledgment that it s struggling to curb the pace and persistence of inflation which has been worsened by russia s war against ukraine and its effects on energy prices borrowing costs have already risen sharply across much of the u s economy in response to the fed s moves with the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate topping 6 its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis up from just 3 at the start of the year the yield on the 2 year treasury note a benchmark for corporate borrowing has jumped to 3 3 its highest level since 2007 even if a recession can be avoided economists say it s almost inevitable that the fed will have to inflict some pain most likely in the form of higher unemployment as the price of defeating chronically high inflation inflation has shot to the top of voter concerns in the months before congress midterm elections souring the public s view of the economy weakening president joe biden s approval ratings and raising the likelihood of democratic losses in november biden has sought to show he recognizes the pain that inflation is causing american households but has struggled to find policy actions that might make a real difference the president has stressed his belief that the power to curb inflation rests mainly with the fed yet the fed s rate hikes are blunt tools for trying to lower inflation while also sustaining growth shortages of oil gasoline and food are propelling inflation the fed isn t ideally suited to address many of the roots of inflation which involve russia s invasion of ukraine still clogged global supply chains labor shortages and surging demand for services from airline tickets to restaurant meals expectations for larger fed hikes have sent a range of interest rates to their highest points in years the yield on the 2 year treasury note a benchmark for corporate bonds has reached 3 3 its highest level since 2007 the 10 year treasury yield which directly affects mortgage rates has hit 3 4 up nearly a half point since last week and the highest level since 2011 investments around the world from bonds to bitcoin have tumbled in recent months on fears surrounding high inflation and the prospect that the fed s aggressive drive to control it will cause a recession even if the fed manages the delicate trick of curbing inflation without causing a recession higher rates will nevertheless inflict pressure on stock prices the s p 500 has already sunk more than 20 this year meeting the definition of a bear market other central banks around the world are also acting swiftly to try to quell surging inflation even with their nations at greater risk of recession than the u s the european central bank is expected to raise rates by a quarter point in july its first increase in 11 years it could announce a larger hike in september if record high levels of inflation persist on wednesday the ecb vowed to create a market backstop that could buffer member countries against financial turmoil of the kind that erupted during a debt crisis more than a decade ago the bank of england has raised rates four times since december to a 13 year high despite predictions that economic growth will be unchanged in the second quarter the boe will hold an interest rate meeting on thursday the 19 european union countries that use the euro currency endured record inflation of 8 1 last month the united kingdom notched a 40 year high of 9 in april though debt service costs remain contained for now rising borrowing costs for indebted governments threatened the eurozone with a breakup in the early part of the last decade last week the world bank warned of the threat of stagflation slow growth accompanied by high inflation around the world a key reason why a recession is now likelier is that economists increasingly believe that for the fed to slow inflation to its 2 target it will need to sharply reduce consumer spending wage gains and economic growth ultimately the unemployment rate will almost certainly have to rise something the fed hasn t yet forecast but could in updated economic projections it will issue wednesday
the federal reserve escalated its battle against inflation wednesday announcing the largest interest rate hike in 28 years as the central bank struggles to regain control over soaring consumer prices the fed raised its benchmark interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point the biggest hike since 1994 that follows a quarter point increase in march and a half point jump in may until a few days ago most forecasters were expecting another half point increase in rates this week in line with the fed s earlier guidance but policymakers opted for a more aggressive move after a report last friday showed inflation was stronger than expected in may consumer prices were up 8 6 from a year ago the increase reflects not only rising costs for gasoline and groceries but also for rent and airfares and a wide range of services the bottom line is it seems like inflation is becoming more entrenched said jay bryson chief economist at wells fargo and for many people i think that was the game changer stefani reynolds afp via getty images afp via getty images a shopper walks through a grocery store in washington d c on june 14 consumer prices are surging at their fastest annual pace in over 40 years fears of a recession grow by sharply raising interest rates the fed hopes to tamp down consumer demand which has overwhelmed supply driving prices up higher rates will make it more expensive to carry a credit card balance get a car loan or buy a house higher borrowing costs also weigh on economic growth stock markets have dropped in recent weeks over fears the fed s rate actions could even tip the economy into a recession fed officials on wednesday projected the economy will grow just 1 7 this year down from the 2 8 growth rate they were predicting three months ago growth is likely to slow further in 2023 narrowing the chance of a so called soft landing in which inflation falls without a recession i think best case scenario you re looking at a landing that may be quite bumpy bryson said you re looking at a period of relatively slow growth next year fed policymakers raised their forecast for unemployment next year from 3 5 to 3 9 spencer platt getty images getty images traders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange in new york city on tuesday stocks have slumped as the fed continues to raise interest rates aggressively to fight red hot inflation more rate hikes are coming rising prices have begun taking a toll on retail sales which fell 0 3 in may spending on furniture appliances and electronics declined last month while americans spent more on gasoline and groceries additional rate hikes are expected in the coming months on average fed policymakers said they expect interest rates to climb to around 3 4 by the end of this year up from 1 9 they were projecting in march mortgage rates have risen sharply in anticipation of that putting homes out of reach for some would be buyers the average rate on a 30 year fixed home loan is near 6 according to bankrate double what it was a year ago we re going to see some of the highest mortgage rates that we have seen in many many years said mark hamrick a senior economic analyst at bankrate along with the high home prices that have been seen all across the country this housing affordability question is only going to move from the yellow to the red zone sales of existing homes declined in february march and april the most recent period for which data are available esther george the president of the federal reserve bank of kansas city was the lone dissenter in today s vote she preferred a smaller rate hike of a half percent copyright 2022 npr to see more visit

bloomberg it s too soon to call an end to america s worst bond market collapse in at least half a century on wednesday treasuries rebounded from a steep three day drop after federal reserve chair jerome powell sought to soften the blow of the bank s largest rate hike since 1994 by saying he didn t expect moves of that size to become the norm going forward but other signs suggest the market is yet to face its biggest challenge powell said it s too soon to declare victory over inflation that s surged to a four decade high or even see much evidence of an economic slowdown that would to contain it and policy makers boosted expectations for where the fed s benchmark rate will end next year to a median of 3 8 from 2 8 previously five predicted it would exceed 4 such a path would almost certainly increase what are already treasuries worst losses since at least the early 1970s with a broad index down more than 11 and spur another leg higher in rates two and 10 year treasury yields now around 3 2 and 3 3 respectively have tended to peak in line with the fed s benchmark making investors eye 4 as the next milestone to test it s very clear the fed will do whatever it takes to forcefully reduce inflation and the terminal rate is going to be closer to 4 and maybe even go higher said peter yi director of short duration fixed income and head of credit research at northern trust asset management the fed is on a path to higher rates and even as powell tried to downplay another 75 basis points hike next month he said rates are still extremely low the rally late wednesday offered a respite from the swift increase in treasury yields that has weighed heavily on the broader financial markets two year yields which are highly sensitive to monetary policy changes dropped as much as 24 basis points with similarly large moves seen out to 10 year securities the s p 500 index gained 1 5 snapping a five day losing streak yet the market has been extremely volatile and many investors say 10 year yields are likely to push up to levels not seen since 2010 while powell said the bank is absolutely determined to keep inflation expectations anchored to 2 a bond market proxy for the anticipated five year inflation rate edged up as much as 9 basis points wednesday to 3 03 a 4 yield on the 10 year note is not out of bounds said charles curry managing director and senior portfolio manager of us fixed income at xponance inc which oversees about 15 billion assets there s going to be starts and stops in yields along the way as the fed gets to that terminal value which in our mind is high 3 s and possible 4 given inflation the era of rock bottom yields that s now abruptly ending was fueled by years of stimulus from central banks in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis a period when policy makers faced little pressure because inflation remained relatively tame but the dynamics are reversing starkly worldwide with consumer prices surging and central banks unwinding the massive bond portfolios they amassed by injecting cash into the financial system through so called quantitative easing or qe the last major holdout the bank of japan is being challenged by traders to raise its cap on bond yields any shift from the boj which also meets this week could add further headwinds to the us treasury market given that it has benefited from an influx of foreign buyers as yields were below zero overseas but japanese investors have been selling foreign bonds for much of this year a trend that may accelerate if the boj allows yields to push higher george goncalves head of us macro strategy at mufg said an increase in the boj s yield cap from 0 25 to 0 5 would likely spur a us 10 year yield spike of 50 basis points though he said any such move could provide a buying opportunity where treasury yields will peak however is ultimately dependent on the direction of the economy and whether the fed is able to bring inflation down while yields have marched higher this year the gap between short and long term rates has narrowed or inverted periodically indicating expectations that rate hikes will slow growth or bring on a recession as soon as next year you could see at a point that rates go much higher before the fed arrests this inflation until the inversion of the curve as they ultimately cause a recession said xponance s curry 2022 bloomberg l p
i do not expect moves of this size to be common said jerome powell chairman of the federal reserve on june 15th the central bank had just raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points 0 75 percentage points to 1 5 1 75 it was the third increase in as many meetings and the biggest jump in short term rates since 1994 the move was both expected and surprising mr powell had warmed up markets weeks ago to the prospect of a 50 basis point increase at this monetary policy meeting but in the days leading up to it investors had quickly and fully priced in a larger rise with more to come listen to this story enjoy more audio and podcasts on ios or android your browser does not support the element mr powell s comment about uncommonly large increases was enough to spark a partial reversal of the sharp rise in bond yields over the preceding days and a relief rally in share prices but however much he tried to sugar coat the message rates are going up by a lot more and the chances of a hard landing for the economy have surely increased as a consequence recession is now more widely expected if not yet by the fed and the rapid changes in the market mood show just how much the fed and other rich world central banks have lost control of events the fed s interest rate decision came at the end of an extraordinary few days in financial markets in which bond yields shot up at a violent rate share prices plunged and riskier assets notably bitcoin but also italian government bonds were trashed the story begins not in washington or new york but in sydney where on june 7th the reserve bank of australia raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points citing growing worries about inflation it continued in amsterdam where in the following days the european central bank ecb held its monetary policy meeting in a break from its usual setting in frankfurt christine lagarde the central bank s boss confirmed that a 25 basis point rate increase would be on the cards in july but she went much further the ecb she said expects to raise interest rates perhaps by 50 basis points in september and anticipates sustained increases thereafter the catalyst for this more hawkish stance was a sharp upward revision in the central bank s forecasts for inflation this set the stage for a dramatic shift in bond markets which events elsewhere added impetus to the yield on ten year german government bonds known as bunds rose quickly to above 1 75 over the following days the yield on riskier sorts of euro zone government bonds notably italian btp s rose by even more the spread excess yield on btp s over bunds widened sharply taking italy s ten year yield above 4 indeed spreads had risen so swiftly that the ecb s rate setting council held an emergency meeting on june 15th to address the matter see next story but it was news from america that really moved markets figures released on friday june 10th showed that annual consumer price inflation rose to 8 6 in may the highest rate since 1981 underlying price core pressures were unexpectedly strong to make matters worse a survey by the university of michigan showed that consumers expectations of medium term inflation had risen markedly taken together the reports suggested that inflation would be much harder to bring down treasury yields rose sharply as the bond market began to price in more and faster interest rate increases by the fed the biggest moves were at the short end of the yield curve which is most sensitive to shifts in monetary policy yields on two year treasuries rose by 57 basis points

the strength is particularly marked against the yen which has fallen to a new 24 year low while the fed is tightening policy to bring down inflation japan s central bank is furiously buying bonds in order to raise it the recent volatility particularly in the bond market has been quite extreme what might explain this as bad as the inflation backdrop had seemed before last week investors had consoled themselves with the idea that the worst of it was now in the past the bank of america s global fund manager survey suggests that in recent weeks investors had increased their allocation to bonds perhaps judging that bond prices had stopped falling bond prices move inversely to yields if so the poor inflation figures caught them out a market that leans heavily in one direction often

once a reliable buyer of treasuries is winding down its purchases when investors want to sell there are too few willing to take the other side of the trade the violent market moves in the days leading

washington the federal reserve on wednesday june 15 approved its largest interest rate increase in more than a quarter of a century to stem a surge in inflation that us central bank officials acknowledged may be eroding public trust in their power and being driven by events seen increasingly out of their hands the widely expected move raised the target federal funds rate by three quarters of a percentage point to a range of between 1 5 per cent and 1 75 per cent still comparatively low by historic standards but the fed s hawkish commitment to controlling inflation has already touched off a broad tightening of credit conditions being felt in us housing and stock markets and likely to slow demand throughout the economy the fed s intent officials also envision steady rate increases through the rest of this year perhaps including additional 75 basis point hikes with a federal funds rate at 3 4 per cent at year s end that would be the highest level since january 2008 and enough fed projections show to slow the economy markedly in coming months and lead to a rise in unemployment we don t seek to put people out of work fed chair jerome powell said at a news conference after the end of the fed s latest two day policy meeting adding that the central bank was not trying to induce a recession yet the fed chief s remarks were among his most sobering yet about the challenge he and his fellow policymakers face in lowering inflation from its current 40 year high to a level closer to its 2per cent target without a sharp slowdown in economic growth or a steep rise in unemployment our objective really is to bring inflation down to 2per cent while the labor market remains strong what s becoming more clear is that many factors that we don t control are going to play a very significant role in deciding whether that s possible or not powell said citing the war in ukraine and global supply concerns there is a path for us to get there it is not getting easier it is getting more challenging he told reporters noting that the rate hikes announced last month and in march so far had not only failed to slow inflation but allowed it to continue accelerating to a level that recent data indicates have begun to influence public attitudes in a way that could make the fed s job even harder eye catching a survey released on friday showed consumer inflation expectations jumped sharply in june a result powell called quite eye catching and enough to tilt policymakers towards a larger 75 basis point hike in hopes of making faster progress on the inflation front and retaining public trust that price increases will slow this is something we need to take seriously powell said of the change in consumer inflation expectations we re absolutely determined to keep them anchored the faster pace of rate hikes outlined by officials on wednesday more closely aligns monetary policy with the rapid shift that took place this week in financial market views of what it will take to bring price pressures under control bond yields fell after the release of fed projections on wednesday that showed economic growth slowing to a below trend rate of 1 7 per cent and policymakers expecting to cut interest rates in 2024 stocks on wall street ended the day higher interest rate futures markets also reflected about an 85 per cent probability that the fed will raise rates by 75 basis points at its next policy meeting in july for september s meeting however the greater probability at more than 50 per cent was for a 50 basis point increase powell departing from the firmer guidance he has previously given about future rate increases made no promises on wednesday given an unexpected jump in a monthly inflation report on friday and the jump as well in expectations 75 basis points seemed like the right thing to do at this meeting and that s what we did he said but he said rate hikes of that size were not likely to be common and that when fed policymakers gather in july an increase of either half a percentage point or three quarters of a point would be most likely not a volcker moment the tightening of monetary policy was accompanied by a downgrade to the fed s economic outlook with the economy now seen slowing to a below trend 1 7 per cent rate of growth this year unemployment rising to 3 7 per cent by the end of this year and continuing to rise to 4 1 per cent through 2024 while no fed policymaker projected an outright recession the range of economic growth forecasts edged toward zero in 2023 with an index of fed opinion showing officials almost unanimous in thinking risks were for growth to be slower and inflation and unemployment higher than expected analysts many of them critical of fed projections in march that saw inflation easing with modest rate hikes and no increase in the unemployment rate said the new outlook was more realistic the fed is willing to let the unemployment rate rise and risk a recession as collateral damage to get inflation back down this isn t a volcker moment for powell given the magnitude of the hike but he is like a mini me version of volcker with this move said brian jacobsen senior investment strategist at allspring global investments referring to former fed chair paul volcker whose battle with inflation in the early 1980s involved sharp and unexpected rate increases of as much as four percentage points at a time even with the more aggressive interest rate measures taken on wednesday policymakers nevertheless see inflation as measured by the personal consumption expenditures price index at 5 2 per cent through this year and slowing only gradually to 2 2 per cent in 2024 inflation has become the most pressing economic issue for the fed and begun to shape the political landscape as well with household sentiment worsening amid rising food and gasoline prices kansas city fed president esther george was the only policymaker to dissent in wednesday s decision preferring a half percentage point rate hike

supplying kiev with what it wants would require washington to surrender a vast part of its arsenal a new weaponry wish list claimed to be sufficient to throw russia out of ukraine was unveiled on monday by mikhail podolyak a top adviser to president volodymyr zelensky the new call has effectively pushed ukraine s demand for western made weapons to the limit with even the us at risk of running out multiple media outlets have suggested the demand includes 1 000 nato standard 155mm howitzers 300 multiple launch rocket systems 500 tanks 2 000 armored vehicles and 1 000 drones it is unclear what types of drones and armored vehicles kiev needs to repel the ongoing russian offensive that began in late february fulfilling the demands would effectively require the us the top supplier of weapons to ukrainian troops over the course of the conflict to disarm its own military multiple western media outlets pointed out the number of mlrs systems requested for instance amounts to roughly half of washington s remaining stock of such weapons the guardian reported citing figures from the international institute for strategic studies iiss the us army has some 363 himars wheeled rocket artillery pieces and 225 m270 mlrs tracked launchers while the us marines have a further 47 the demand for 155mm artillery would effectively empty the us of active stock altogether as it would require the pentagon to surrender nearly all of its m777 howitzers according to the article however the newspaper failed to mention that the us has other older towed artillery systems in reserve which could potentially be supplied to kiev the only demand that appears to be relatively easy to satisfy is the requirement for tanks as the us army alone is estimated to have a fleet of around 6 000 abrams units in storage and on active duty the guardian noted the financial times took a different approach interpreting podolyak s wish list as a complete ukrainian wartime demand that has been partially fulfilled by previous deliveries from western countries rather than a completely new list the newspaper also counted pledged hardware citing figures from the ukrainian government and oryx website which it described as a respected open source intelligence outfit even taking this approach podolyak s wish list could only be covered partially with some 270 tanks delivered or pledged during the conflict the newspaper also counted some 250 155mm howitzers on the list apparently including both towed and self propelled pieces the multiple launch rocket systems figure looks the most hopeless with only around 50 pieces apparently older soviet era launchers supplied by several european nations included on the list the us and the uk as well as multiple other western nations have actively supplied the ukrainian authorities with assorted weapons both before and since the start of the ongoing conflict moscow has repeatedly warned the west against pumping up ukraine with weapons arguing it will only prolong the conflict without changing its outcome russia attacked its neighboring state in late february following ukraine s failure to implement the terms of the minsk agreements first signed in 2014 and moscow s eventual recognition of the donbass republics of donetsk and lugansk the german and french brokered protocol was designed to give the breakaway regions special status within the ukrainian state the kremlin has since demanded that ukraine officially declare itself a neutral country that will never join the us led nato military bloc kiev insists the russian offensive was completely unprovoked and has denied claims it was planning to retake the two republics by force rt com

washington ap the federal reserve intensified its fight against high inflation on wednesday raising its key interest rate by three quarters of a point the largest bump since 1994 and signaling more rate hikes ahead as it tries to cool off the u s economy without causing a recession the unusually large rate hike came after data released friday showed u s inflation rose last month to a four decade high of 8 6 a surprise jump that made financial markets uneasy about how the fed would respond the fed s benchmark short term rate which affects many consumer and business loans will now be pegged to a range of 1 5 to 1 75 and fed policymakers forecast a doubling of that range by year s end we thought strong action was warranted at this meeting and we delivered that fed chair jerome powell said at a news conference in which he stressed the central bank s commitment to do what it takes to bring inflation down to the fed s target rate of 2 getting to that point he said might result in a slightly higher unemployment rate as economic growth slows powell said it was imperative to go bigger than the half point increase the fed had earlier signaled because inflation was running hotter than anticipated causing particular hardship on low income americans another concern is that the public is increasingly expecting higher inflation in the future which can become a self fulfilling prophecy by accelerating spending among consumers seeking to avoid rising prices for certain goods the central bank revised its policy statement to acknowledge that its efforts to quell inflation won t be painless removing previous language that had said fed officials expect the labor market to remain strong it s going to be a far bumpier ride to get inflation down than what they had anticipated previously said matthew luzzetti chief u s economist at deutsche bank fed officials forecast unemployment ticking up this year and next reaching 4 1 in 2024 a level that some economists said would risk a recession yet powell largely stuck to his previous reassurances that with unemployment near a five decade low wages rising and consumers finances mostly solid the economy can withstand higher interest rates and avoid a recession we re not trying to induce a recession now he said let s be clear about that we re trying to achieve 2 inflation powell said that another three quarter point hike is possible at the fed s next meeting in late july if inflation pressures remain high although he said such increases would not be common some financial analysts suggested powell struck the right balance to reassure markets which rallied on wednesday he hit it hard that we want to get inflation down but also hit hard that we want a soft landing said robert tipp chief investment strategist at pgim fixed income still the fed s action on wednesday was an acknowledgment that it s struggling to curb the pace and persistence of inflation which is being fueled by a strong consumer spending pandemic related supply disruptions and soaring energy prices that have been aggravated by russia s invasion of ukraine inflation has shot to the top of voter concerns in the months before congress midterm elections souring the public s view of the economy weakening president joe biden s approval ratings and raising the likelihood of democratic losses in november biden has sought to show he recognizes the pain that inflation is causing american households but has struggled to find policy actions that might make a real difference the president has stressed his belief that the power to curb inflation rests mainly with the fed yet the fed s rate hikes are blunt tools for trying to lower inflation while also sustaining growth shortages of oil gasoline and food are contributing to higher prices powell said several times during the news conference that such factors are out of the fed s control and may force it to push rates even higher to ultimately bring down inflation borrowing costs have already risen sharply across much of the u s economy in response to the fed s moves with the average 30 year fixed mortgage rate topping 5 its highest level since before the 2008 financial crisis up from just 3 at the start of the year in their updated forecasts wednesday the fed s policymakers indicated that after this year s rate increases they foresee two more rate hikes by the end of 2023 at which point they expect inflation to finally fall below 3 close to their target level but they expect inflation to still be 5 2 at the end of this year much higher than they d estimated in march over the next two years the officials are forecasting a much weaker economy than was envisioned in march they forecast growth will be 1 7 this year and next that s below their outlook in march but better than some economists expectation for a recession next year even if the fed manages the delicate trick of curbing inflation without causing a downturn higher rates will nevertheless inflict pressure on stocks the s p 500 has already sunk more than 20 this year meeting the definition of a bear market on wednesday the s p 500 rose 1 5 the two year treasury yield fell to 3 23 from 3 45 late tuesday with the biggest move happening after powell said not to expect three quarter percentage point rate hikes to be common other central banks are also acting to try to quell inflation even with their nations at greater risk of recession than the u s the european central bank is expected to raise rates by a quarter point in july its first increase in 11 years it could announce a larger hike in september if record high levels of inflation persist on wednesday the ecb vowed to create a market backstop that could buffer member countries against financial turmoil of the kind that erupted during a debt crisis more than a decade ago the bank of england has raised rates four times since december to a 13 year high despite predictions that economic growth will be unchanged in the second quarter the boe will hold an interest rate meeting on thursday federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks during a news conference following an open market committee meeting

on wednesday morning abc cbs and nbc chose to do something it s only occasionally done in mentioning president biden during their coverage of the porous economy but as one would expect they absolved him of blame and instead commiserated with the frustrated president as he s the heat from voters while pointing fingers at republicans and tout his economic agenda good morning america co host and former clinton official george stephanopoulos clearly got the memo in a tease the impact on home price jobs the stock market and the battle against soaring prices as president biden feels the heat who he s pointing fingers at for slowing down his plans co host tj holmes added moments later that the economy s been on biden s mind as he feel pressure and he is getting increasingly frustrated with republicans stephanopoulos came back around in teeing up chief white house correspondent cecilia vega inflation putting political pressure on president biden he s blaming republicans in congress for blocking his plans to get prices under control vega stated the obvious that his is a top issue for voters and they re really blaming him for this and that that means that this is a top priority for this white house but look publicly and privately president biden is really feeling the pressure on this and she s frankly growing increasingly frustrated she added that the griping stems from the fact that the white house and officials here say they ve done what s in their control to try to combat some of these high prices but voters have unfortunately decided to still blame them of course she also had to frame it in terms of a pitfall for democrats while fretting about the steady drumbeat from republicans whom biden insists are to blame for our country s economic pain click expand they are well aware that this could very easily threaten his agenda and frankly threaten his party s chances in the midterms come november there has been a steady drumbeat we ve been talking about this for months from republicans who have been really looking to cast this as biden s price hike so what you re seeing is what you just heard from president biden that shift in the narrative he is really looking to cast blame on republicans right now who he says are blocking his agenda on capitol hill he says if they can bring down things like lowering prescription drugs that would offset some of these other costs he s also going after oil companies more and more he said recently exxon for example is making more money than god he s certainly been blaming putin and the war in ukraine for the high rise of
