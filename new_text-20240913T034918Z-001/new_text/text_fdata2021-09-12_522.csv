members of congress and staff stand for a moment of silence for the 9 11 victims and families on sept 11 2020 at the capitol in washington on monday sept 13 2021 members of congress will mark the 20th anniversary of the attacks demetrius freeman the washington post washington on monday the bipartisan leaders of congress are scheduled to gather with colleagues at noon for a ceremony marking the terrorist attacks of sept 11 2001 it will be reminiscent of the gathering on the night of the attacks when members of congress many holding small american flags stood on the capitol steps and spontaneously sang god bless america but so much has changed twenty years ago members of congress were joined in a determined and resilient expression of national unity at an unprecedented moment in the nation s history a day that brought deaths and heroism but also shock fear and confusion monday s ceremony will no doubt be somber in its remembrance of what was lost that day but it will come not as expression of a united america but simply as a momentary cessation in political wars that rage and have deepened in the years since those attacks in a video message to americans released friday president joe biden spoke of how 9 11 had united the country and said it was represented america at its best he called such unity our greatest strength while noting it is all too rare the unity that followed the attacks didn t last long americans reverted more quickly than some analysts expected to older patterns of partisanship with time new divisions over new issues have emerged which now make the prospect of a united nation ever more distant the question is often asked as america has plunged deeper into division and discord is there anything that could spark a change anything big enough to become a catalyst for greater national unity but if 9 11 doesn t fit that model then what does and look what happened in the aftermath of that trauma for a time the shock effect of the attacks did bring the country together then president george w bush s approval ratings spiked to 90 in a rally round the flag reaction that was typical when the country is faced with external threats or crises one notable expression of the unity at the time came from al gore the former vice president who had lost the bitter 2000 election to bush after a disputed recount in florida and a controversial supreme court decision speaking at a democratic party dinner in iowa less than a month after the attacks gore called bush my commander in chief adding we are united behind our president george w bush behind the effort to seek justice not revenge to make sure this will never ever happen again and to make sure we have the strongest unity in america that we have ever had the democratic audience rose applauding and cheering trust in government rose in those days after the attacks shortly after 9 11 trust in government jumped to 64 up from 30 before the attacks according to public opinion strategies a republican polling firm that was closely tracking public attitudes to the attacks by the summer of 2002 pos found that trust had fallen back to 39 percent five years after the attacks then sen john mccain r ariz now deceased was quoted as saying that america was more divided and more partisan than i ve ever seen us today after many contentious elections political warfare over economic cultural and social issues and an attack on the capitol last jan 6 many americans would say things have gotten worse president george w bush addressed the nation on sept 11 2001 after returning to the white house frank johnston the washington post as he prepared the u s response to the attacks by al qaida in the fall of 2001 bush made clear the united states would go it alone if necessary assembling what was called a coalition of the willing he put other nations on notice saying the united states would be holding them accountable in the campaign against the terrorists you re either with us or against us in the fight he said bush described the world in manichaean terms a world of good versus evil today s politics at home is often practiced that way that phrase with us or against us could stand as a black and white expression of the way in which many americans approach the political battles all in with the team red or blue or not in at all if you win i lose no middle ground lack of imagination had helped to allow 9 11 to happen no one in the upper reaches of government seemed to have envisioned foreign terrorists hijacking airplanes turning them into massive jet fuel filled weapons and crashing them into buildings though there had been warnings if the response in the years that followed was often chaotic or ill advised if things seemed to get worse rather than better the public demeanor of leaders remained one of total confidence that was true of one president after another about afghanistan as a secret history of the war has since shown eventually as events told a story that contradicted official assurances the certitude of the leaders gave way to disillusionment and cynicism on the part of citizens it happened during vietnam and happened again with afghanistan and iraq so much went wrong in the days after the attacks politicians noted america s vulnerability two oceans were no longer protection against foreign attack and vowed to make perpetrators pay it was a time of extravagant predictions chuck hagel then a republican senator from nebraska and later defense secretary in the obama administration said we are forever changed more americans say now that change was for the worse than for the better according to a recent washington post abc news poll six months after the attacks two in three americans said the country had changed for the better the mission in afghanistan morphed from hunting terrorists subduing the taliban and bringing osama bin laden to justice to one of nation building and a 20 year commitment of u s forces that ended last month amid controversy over biden s handling of the exit and a public conclusion that the war was not worth fighting on the night of 9 11 george tenet then the cia director said to bush and other senior officials as they contemplated how to respond it was time to tell the taliban we re finished with them today the taliban once again control afghanistan afghanistan was never enough the bush administration quickly shifted its focus to a wider war on terrorism even in the days after afghanistan iraq was always in the conversation in his 2002 state of the union address bush described iraq iran and north korea and an axis of evil he suggested that what he had launched in afghanistan would expand in scope and lengthen in time our war on terror has well begun he said but it is only begun the next year the united states invaded iraq among those who opposed that invasion was gore though he had supported bush s father s war against iraq in 1991 unlike biden whose positions were the opposite the invasion was based on what turned out to be a lie that there was credible intelligence evidence that iraqi president saddam hussein had a stock of weapons of mass destruction after saddam was ousted u s officials tried to remake iraq in a misguided and bungled effort to bring western style democracy and institutions to that country enemy combatants captured in the war on terror were subjected to torture during harsh interrogation in secret black sites later exposed elsewhere in the world critics like mccain called those techniques illegal and a stain on america a senate committee later concluded that torture had produced no useful intelligence there was the scandal at abu ghraib prison in iraq where photos of the mistreatment of iraqi prisoners by u s soldiers drew worldwide condemnation that further soured the public confidence was undermined in other ways at home a hasty effort to create the department of homeland security ended up cobbling together a host of organizations that produced a dysfunctional agency whose role and mission remain a point of contention only a year ago jeh johnson who served as dhs secretary in the obama administration said that the agency s headquarters bureaucracy is still a work in progress there were successes during the obama administration bin laden was killed at a compound in pakistan over these many years there were no major attacks from foreign terrorists against the homeland no small achievement presidents from bush to obama to donald trump went after terrorist groups and individuals in one country after another with special operations forces and drone attacks meanwhile on the political front the war on terror which had first united the country turned into a political wedge bush and the republicans used the issue in both the 2002 midterm election and the 2004 presidential election to help his and the gop s cause in 2002 republicans labeled then sen max cleland d ga who had lost limbs in vietnam as weak in his defense of the homeland cleland lost his reelection bid in 2004 even though opposition to the iraq war was rising bush campaigned heavily on the theme that he would keep the country safe to bring home the point republicans staged their national convention in new york near the anniversary of 9 11 with democrats on the defensive in a military infused political climate the party scrambled to prove that their leaders had military bona fides david axelrod who was obama s chief political strategist pointed to the 2004 democratic convention that nominated then sen john f kerry a decorated vietnam veteran and said we essentially transformed our convention into a vfw meeting that would not have happened if not for 9 11 then the politics of it all shifted by the time of the 2008 election bush was highly unpopular and the democratic candidate who had opposed the iraq war barack obama prevailed over other candidates who had supported the resolution authorizing bush to launch the war namely hillary clinton and joe biden the gop nominee mccain a vietnam prisoner of war and true war hero was the strongest advocate for sending more troops into iraq in 2007 he lost the 2008 presidential election as vice president biden argued against a similar troop surge in afghanistan pro and anti trump activists scuffle outside of the department of justice in washington on july 27 2021 after a news conference over the treatment of people detained during the jan 6 riot amanda andrade rhoades for the washington post if 9 11 could not sustain unity for long there were other events that tested whether america could break out of its divisions the financial crash of 2008 2009 is one an event that crushed many families and that cried out for a united response but obama whose election was hailed as a sign of racial progress was able to produce not unity but more division a tea party revolt gop obstruction in congress and worse a rise in racial resentment among some white voters and outright racism among others as he was responding to the 9 11 attacks bush had sought to tamp down anger and rising hate crimes aimed at muslim americans saying this was not a war against islam donald trump as a candidate and as president did the opposite calling for banning the entry of all muslims into the country an announcement that coincided with the anniversary of the attack on pearl harbor trump s campaign and presidency further exacerbated the existing racial tensions and divisions trump spread conspiracy theories about muslims in new jersey cheering the fall of the twin towers of the world trade center on 9 11 and about where obama was born he continues to spread other conspiracy theories today they too have infected politics the coronavirus pandemic when it hit u s shores in early 2020 amounted to the biggest threat to america since 9 11 a deadly virus in a globalized world that demanded a unity of purpose in response instead it too has become a political conflict over the wearing of masks and the administration of lifesaving vaccines the 20th anniversary of the events that led to the invasion of afghanistan finds the united states no longer in that conflict overseas but in a costly debate at home over how to wage a war against a virus the ceremonies commemorating 9 11 are wholly appropriate designed to mark the loss of innocent lives and the selfless heroism of firefighters and police and other first responders who threw themselves into efforts to recuse anyone who could be rescued and to recover those who could not and those on flight 93 who gave their lives to save others they remind all americans of what is best about the country but it should also be noted that as the nation and elected officials in washington hold these events there is talk about reinstalling fencing around the capitol in preparation for a rally next weekend in washington in support of those arrested and jailed after the jan 6 attack on the capitol this time it is not international terrorism that poses the greatest threat to the homeland it is domestic terrorism from white supremacists and others twenty years on from 9 11 that is the state of the country

by jerry schwartz associated press rudolph giuliani was a hero before he was a punchline lisa beamer was a wife and mother before she became a symbol of sept 11 and though her celebrity passed her widowhood cannot in the aftermath of the planes falling from the sky america and the world were introduced to an array of personalities some we had known well but came to see in different ways others were thrown into public consciousness by unhappy happenstance some like osama bin laden and mullah mohammad omar are dead but others have gone on to lead lives that are postscripts to sept 11 2001 here are a few of the boldface names of that tumultuous time what they were then and what has happened to them since rudolph giuliani then mayor of new york city he was a hero of the moment empathetic determined a focus of the nation s grief and a constant presence at ground zero the number of casualties will be more than any of us can bear ultimately he said on sept 11 oprah winfrey pronounced him america s mayor time magazine declared him person of the year since after suggesting that his expiring term be extended due to the 9 11 emergency an idea that was roundly dismissed giuliani went into private life but not all that private he launched a profitable security firm and ran abortively for the republican nomination for president in 2008 his adventures as a supporter of and agent for president donald trump are well documented and resulted in the suspension of his law license in his home state bernard kerik then new york city s police commissioner bald and stocky he never left giuliani s side in the days after sept 11 and followed the mayor after he left office joining the giuliani security firm since president george w bush appointed kerik as iraq s interim minister of the interior in 2003 during the iraq war and nominated him to head the u s department of homeland security in 2004 he withdrew from consideration when it was revealed that he had employed an undocumented worker as a nanny and housekeeper there followed a series of legal troubles including convictions for ethics violations and tax fraud he was pardoned by president donald trump in 2020 george w bush then the 43rd president of the united states bush was informed of the 9 11 attacks while reading the pet goat to second graders in sarasota florida he spoke to the nation that night and visited ground zero three days later grabbing a bullhorn to declare i can hear you the rest of the world hears you and the people and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon his support in the polls reached 85 percent since the war on terrorism begat the wars in iraq and afghanistan and bush s demand that the taliban hand over the terrorists or share in their fate he had long retired to oil painting in texas when navy seals killed bin laden and when president joe biden pulled u s forces from afghanistan in august he said he was watching developments there with deep sadness richard cheney then while the secret service played hide the president with bush on sept 11 he was shuttled to military bases in louisiana and nebraska for fear of terrorist attacks his vice president hunkered down in a secure undisclosed location a bunker inside the white house where he helped direct the government s actions cheney became a fierce advocate of an unbridled response to the attacks using any means at our disposal he pushed for the 2003 war in iraq the interrogation technique known as waterboarding was a proper way to get information from terrorists he said not torture as its critics have long insisted since after five heart attacks and a 2012 heart transplant cheney has lived to see his daughter liz win his old congressional seat in wyoming and become gop persona non grata because of her criticism of donald trump colin powell then a former head of the joint chiefs of staff powell was confirmed unanimously as secretary of state in 2001 he would go on to make a persuasive case before the united nations for military action against iraq claiming that saddam hussein was building weapons of mass destruction the war was waged saddam was toppled and killed iraq was destabilized no such weapons were found since powell has consistently defended his support of the iraq war but the lifelong republican had little use for trump endorsing hillary clinton in 2016 and speaking in support of biden at the 2020 democratic convention he left the republican party after the jan 6 assault on the capitol condoleezza rice then national security adviser to bush in the summer of 2001 she met with cia director george tenet at his request to discuss the threat of al qaida attacks on american targets the cia reported that there will be significant terrorist attacks against the united states in the coming weeks or months rice would later say that the information was old since rice succeeded powell as secretary of state and has since returned to stanford university as provost then as a faculty member in 2012 she also became one of the first two women allowed to join the augusta national golf club john ashcroft then attorney general during bush s first term in the wake of 9 11 he was the administration s prime advocate of the usa patriot act which gave the government broad powers to investigate and prosecute those suspected of terrorism but in 2004 while lying in an intensive care unit with gallstone pancreatitis he refused the administration s entreaties to overrule a justice department finding that the bush domestic intelligence program was illegal since after leaving office in 2005 ashcroft became a lobbyist and consultant his appearances as a gospel singer and songwriter his tune let the eagle soar was performed at the second bush inauguration have tailed off john yoo then as deputy assistant attorney general in the justice department s office of legal counsel yoo provided much of the legal underpinning for the war on terrorism he argued that enemy combatants captured in afghanistan need not be given prisoner of war status that the president could authorize warrantless wiretaps of u s citizens on american soil that the use of enhanced interrogation techniques like waterboarding was within the power of the president during wartime since yoo is a professor at the university of california berkeley school of law he remains a strong supporter of presidential prerogatives in 2020 his book defender in chief donald trump s fight for presidential power argued that trump s vision of the presidency was in line with that of washington jefferson madison and hamilton khalid sheikh mohammed then leading propagandist of al qaida labeled the principal architect of the 9 11 attacks by the 9 11 commission he was captured in 2003 by the cia and pakistan s secret police then spirited to cia prisons in poland and afghanistan and finally to guantanamo under duress some called it torture he confessed to involvement in nearly every major al qaida operation including the 1993 bombing of the world trade center the killing of journalist daniel pearl the 2001 attacks and others since his trial date has been postponed again and again he remains at guantanamo indefinitely hamid karzai then interim leader and then elected president of afghanistan in the wake of sept 11 he managed the delicate balancing act of remaining on friendly terms with the united states and the west while unifying his country s many factions at least for a time more than once he called the taliban brothers and the later years of his presidency were marked by friction with the united states since karzai has survived numerous assassination attempts but when his second term expired in 2014 the passage of power to his successor ashraf ghani was peaceful ghani would lead the country for almost seven years until he fled in the face of the taliban s triumphant return howard lutnick then the chairman of the stock trading company cantor fitzgerald would have been in the company s offices at the top of one world trade center but he took his son kyle to the first day of kindergarten a total of 658 of the company s employees two thirds of its new york city workforce including lutnick s brother gary perished within three days lutnick had established the cantor fitzgerald relief fund for his company s victims since the fund has disbursed more than a quarter of a billion dollars including money for other victims of terrorism and disasters twenty years later lutnick remains the company s chairman lisa beamer then after 9 11 lisa beamer became the face of the day s mourners and a reminder of the day s heroism her husband todd a former college baseball and basketball player is believed to have led other passengers in an attack on the hijackers of united airlines flight 93 that brought the plane down before it could crash in washington his exhortation of let s roll became a rallying cry his widow made 200 public appearances in the six months after the attacks since lisa beamer co wrote a book let s roll ordinary people extraordinary courage and established a foundation in her husband s memory donations dwindled and beamer receded from public view the couple had three children and all attended wheaton college where their parents met all are athletes like their dad dave 3 years old when his father died was a football quarterback drew who was 1 played soccer as has morgan born four months after the attacks morgan was her father s middle name
whatever happened to the uk equity income fund once a stalwart of most investors isa and pension portfolios because of its attractive offering of income and capital return the uk equity income fund is currently about as unpopular as a fox on a chicken farm just look at the facts the uk equity income investment sector has clocked up 14 consecutive months of outflows as investors have looked for better value elsewhere in total investors have pulled almost 5billion out of these funds over this period 18billion since 2016 but by leaving they have missed out on a bull run the uk equity income sector generated an average return of 27 in the 14 month period laura suter head of personal finance at wealth platform aj bell points out that the uk equity income sector generated an average return of 27 per cent in the 14 month period this compares to the 18 per cent gain registered by the ftse 100 the index comprising the largest companies listed on the london stock exchange jason hollands managing director at wealth platform tilney describes the equity income fund sell off as quite shocking adding that the funds were historically a cornerstone of private portfolios he adds i don t think investors should give up on uk income funds far from it he says pointing out that over the long run most of the gains in uk equities tend to be down to dividends ian lance co manager of income focused investment trust temple bar says that investors who have sold out of the sector could regret it many could come to rue their decision to give up on the equity income sector at exactly the wrong time he warns whether you believe it is time to get back into the equity income sector depends on your view of the health of uk plc and its ability to restore a healthy stream of dividends yet many experts believe that investors could benefit from picking up a uk equity income fund or two at the current price protect your dividends from the new tax rate the government s decision to add 1 25 percentage points on to the dividend tax rate has implications for many investors who are seeking income through dividends while everyone is allowed to receive 2 000 of dividends a year tax free after that the dividend tax rate is 7 5 per cent for basic rate taxpayers and 32 5 per cent for higher rate taxpayers this will rise to 8 75 per cent and 33 75 per cent respectively in april next year it means basic rate taxpayers will pay 263 in tax on 5 000 of dividend income up from 225 while higher rate taxpayers will pay 1 013 up from 875 this means that those who receive dividends through income friendly funds should be locking as much of their investment away into tax free wrappers as possible dividends paid when investments are held in either pensions or isas are free from dividend tax and do not count towards the 2 000 annual allowance currently everyone can pay 40 000 into a pension per tax year and 20 000 into an isa a bed and isa strategy where you sell investments and then buy them back in a tax wrapper can help you mitigate dividend taxes while married couples should ensure they use both partners isa and pension allowances to protect dividend payments from the taxman the rise and fall of equity income uk equity income funds would seem to offer the holy grail in the current low interest rate environment regular income from shares that should rise in value over time so what has gone wrong to prompt huge investor outflows dzmitry lipski of investment platform interactive investor suggests that part of the recent sell off is due to the uk s dividend drought where companies cut their payouts to shareholders due to covid 19 this was very much a pandemic theme he says but there were other issues at play as well the high profile failure of neil woodford s giant equity income fund which is yet to be wound up has massively diminished confidence in the sector then there was brexit uncertainty which depressed uk shares and a trend towards growth stocks during the pandemic as tech company valuations took off at the expense of duller dividend paying stalwarts many experts believe the sector s unfavourable reputation is unfair and the funds undervalued you might expect there would be greater investor demand for this sector which provides investors with an annual income in the region of 3 6 per cent yield says annabel brodie smith communications director of trade body the association of investment companies darius mcdermott managing director at fund expert chelsea financial also confesses he doesn t entirely understand the equity income fund exodus i m not sure why investors seem to be shunning this sector he says it could be because the uk stock market is just so unloved at the moment and people are perhaps diversifying more these days into global or regional equity income funds he adds it s still an obvious investment choice as far as i am concerned the uk is the most mature dividend market in the world and has one of the highest dividend

new york americans solemnly marked the 20th anniversary of 9 11 on saturday remembering the dead invoking the heroes and taking stock of the aftermath of the deadliest terror attack on u s soil less than two weeks after the fraught end of the war in afghanistan the ceremony at ground zero in new york began exactly two decades after the attack started with the first of four hijacked planes crashing into one of the world trade center s twin towers it felt like an evil specter had descended on our world but it was also a time when many people acted above and beyond the ordinary said mike low whose daughter sara low was a flight attendant on that plane her family has known unbearable sorrow and disbelief in the years since the father told a crowd that included president joe biden and former presidents barack obama and bill clinton but as we carry these 20 years forward i find sustenance in a continuing appreciation for all of those who rose to be more than ordinary people low said the anniversary unfolded under the pall of a pandemic and in the shadow of the u s withdrawal from afghanistan which is now ruled by the same militants who gave safe haven to the 9 11 plotters it s hard because you hoped that this would just be a different time and a different world but sometimes history starts to repeat itself and not in the best of ways thea trinidad who lost her father in the attacks said before reading victims names at the ceremony bruce springsteen and broadway actor kelli o hara sang at the commemoration but by tradition no politicians spoke there in a video released friday night biden addressed the continuing pain of loss but also spotlighted what he called the central lesson of sept 11 that at our most vulnerable unity is our greatest strength biden was also scheduled to pay respects at the two other sites where the 9 11 conspirators crashed the jets the pentagon and a field near shanksville pennsylvania together the attacks killed nearly 3 000 people calvin wilson came to the pennsylvania memorial to reflect on his brother in law leroy homer the first officer of the plane that crashed in pennsylvania after passengers and crew fought to regain control hijackers are believed to have been targeting the u s capitol or the white house wilson said he believes a polarized country has missed the message of the passengers and crew members heroism we don t focus on the damage we don t focus on the hate we don t focus on retaliation we don t focus on revenge wilson said we focus on the good that all of our loved ones have done former president george w bush the nation s leader on 9 11 and current vice president kamala harris were to speak at the pennsylvania memorial the only other post 9 11 u s president donald trump planned to be in new york in addition to providing commentary at a boxing match in florida in the evening other observances from a wreath laying in portland maine to a fire engine parade in guam were planned across a country now full of 9 11 plaques statues and commemorative gardens in the aftermath of the attacks security was redefined with changes to airport checkpoints police practices and the government s surveillance powers for years afterward virtually any sizeable explosion crash or act of violence seemed to raise a dire question is it terrorism some ideological violence and plots did follow though federal officials and the public have lately become increasingly concerned with threats from domestic extremists after years of focusing on international terror groups in the wake of 9 11 new york faced questions early on about whether it could ever recover from the blow to its financial hub and restore a feeling of safety among the crowds and skyscrapers new yorkers ultimately rebuilt a more populous and prosperous city but had to reckon with the tactics of an empowered post 9 11 police department and a widened gap between haves and have nots a war on terror led to invasions of iraq and afghanistan where the longest u s war ended last month with a hasty massive airlift punctuated by a suicide bombing that killed 169 afghans and 13 american service members and was attributed to a branch of the islamic state extremist group the u s is now concerned that al qaida the terror network behind 9 11 may regroup in afghanistan where the flag of the taliban militant group once again flew over the presidential palace on saturday melissa pullis lost her husband edward on 9 11 his namesake edward jr is serving on the uss ronald reagan where he released a wreath bearing the words never forget into the water saturday i really don t care about the taliban said melissa pullis who attended the ceremony with her other son andrew i m just happy all the troops are out of afghanistan we can t lose any more military we don t even know why we re fighting and 20 years went down the drain two decades after helping to triage and treat injured colleagues at the pentagon on sept 11 retired army col malcolm bruce westcott is saddened and frustrated by the continued threat of terrorism i always felt that my generation my military cohort would take care of it we wouldn t pass it on to anybody else said westcott of greensboro georgia and we passed it on sept 11 propelled a surge of shared grief and common purpose but it soon gave way muslim americans endured suspicion surveillance and hate crimes the quest to understand the catastrophic toll of the terror attacks prompted changes in building design and emergency communications but it also spurred conspiracy theories that seeded a culture of skepticism schisms and resentments grew over immigration the balance between tolerance and vigilance the meaning of patriotism the proper way to honor the dead and the scope of a promise to never forget trinidad was 10 when she overheard her dad michael saying goodbye to her mother by phone from the burning trade center she remembers the pain but also the fellowship of the days that followed when all of new york felt like it was family now when i feel like the world is so divided i just wish that we can go back to that said trinidad of orlando florida i feel like it would have been such a different world if we had just been able to hang on to that feeling
media reports this week that two of the federal reserve s 12 regional bank presidents were active traders has some of the central bank s most vocal critics questioning the rules that allowed them to engage in the transactions in the first place dallas fed president robert kaplan and boston fed president eric rosengren made frequent or substantial trades in 2020 the wall street journal and bloomberg reported earlier this week the trades occurred during a year in which the central bank took major actions to shore up the economy and swooning financial markets after they were broadsided by the coronavirus pandemic while the trades were permitted under the fed system s ethics guidelines their disclosure prompted some observers and a top lawmaker to flag possible conflicts of interest forget about the individual trades said benjamin dulchin director of the fed up campaign at the center for popular democracy a group that advocates for the fed to focus more on the needs of american workers the issue is that a president of a fed bank one of the handful of people who set our country s monetary policy so clearly has his personal interests aligned with the success of our biggest corporations on thursday kaplan and rosengren said in separate statements that their trades complied with the fed s ethics rules they also said they would change their investment practices to address even the appearance of any conflict of interest and sell all individual stock holdings by sept 30 moving the proceeds into cash or passively invested index funds both kaplan and rosengren said they would not trade on those accounts as long as they are serving as fed presidents the changes came after they both faced criticism for transactions made last year dealings that were first reported by the wall street journal this week each has since made his annual financial disclosures public the documents showed that kaplan for instance bought and sold at least 18 million in individual stocks in 2020 mostly tech stocks like apple inc and amazon com inc and energy stocks such as marathon petroleum corp all of those transactions were reviewed by the dallas fed general counsel said dallas fed spokesman james hoard rosengren who has publicly shared concerns about potential over valuation risks in the commercial real estate sector held stakes in four real estate investment trusts and made other investment trades as highlighted by a bloomberg report regrettably the appearance of such permissible personal investment decisions has generated some questions so i have made the decision to divest these assets to underscore my commitment to fed ethics guidelines rosengren said in a statement on thursday the federal reserve bank of boston s president and ceo eric s rosengren speaks in new york on april 17 2013 keith bedford reuters calls for greater oversight fed officials are subject to specific restrictions such as not trading during the blackout period around each fed meeting when policy sensitive information is distributed not holding stocks in banks or mutual funds concentrated in the financial sector and not reselling securities within 30 days of purchase but the code of conduct has broader language as well an employee should avoid any situation that might give rise to an actual conflict of interest or even the appearance of a conflict of interest the code states those with access to market moving information should avoid engaging in any financial transaction the timing of which could create the appearance of acting on inside information concerning federal reserve deliberations and actions the financial disclosures did not look strikingly different from prior years but 2020 was a signature year for the fed in which by its own account it crossed red lines to ensure financial markets continued to function in a rapid fire response to the then unfolding pandemic fed policymakers in march 2020 slashed interest rates to near zero and rolled out programs meant to keep the markets for treasury bonds mortgage backed securities and corporate bonds working smoothly the fed s fast action was praised for helping to stave off a larger financial market collapse an achievement fed officials say helped to minimize the hit to the economy but some criticized the fed s moves for helping to boost asset prices while not doing enough to support small businesses and households on main street some fed watchers say it may be time for the rules to be reviewed this is more evidence that the oversight of the federal reserve regional bank presidents is broken said aaron klein a senior fellow at the brookings institution i don t know if this is a failure to enforce the rules or a failure of the rules sen elizabeth warren d mass long one of washington s most vocal critics of the central bank s approach to financial regulation said fed officials should not be allowed to trade i ve said it before and will say it again members of congress and senior government officials should not be allowed to trade or own stocks warren posted on twitter on friday period by jonnelle marte howard schneider and ann saphir

in december a group of managers responsible for overseeing thousands of its temporary staff members discovered the company had been underpaying some of those workers for years the gap in so called bench mark rates between what google paid full time employees and temporary workers doing similar work had widened significantly according to internal company emails and documents reviewed by the this was especially problematic in countries with so called pay parity laws requiring the company to pay temporary workers the same wages as full time employees in similar positions but googleâ s lapse had gone undetected outside the company the managers worried that fixing the shortfall by suddenly lifting hourly rates 20 30 would call attention to the problem and invite negative publicity to a company already criticized for creating a two tier workforce of generously compensated full time employees and less expensive temps and contractors who are easy to hire and fire so google landed on a fix that would not call as much attention to the problem it decided to apply the correct rates for only new hires starting in 2021 but held off on more expensive wholesale changes according to company emails reviewed by the alan barry a google compliance manager in ireland wrote in an email to colleagues that adjusting the rates for all of its temps was the correct move from a â compliance perspective â however doing so might increase the likelihood that google s current temporary staff members could â connect the dotsâ about the reason behind the pay bump and place the staffing agencies who supply and pay the workers in â a difficult position legally and ethically â â the cost is significant and it would give rise to a flurry of noise frustration â barry wrote â iâ m also not keen to invite the charge that weâ ve allowed this situation to persist for so long that the correction required is significant â googleâ s decision to not immediately correct the pay rates for all current temps was flagged in june in a whistleblower complaint to the google may owe more than 100 million in back salaries over nine years of noncompliance in 16 countries with pay parity laws according to the complaint the figure does not include possible fines or legal costs the complaint accuses google of securities violations because it failed to disclose the risk to investors it is not clear if the is currently investigating google the sec did not respond to a request for comment in addition to the complaint the times separately reviewed dozens of documents and internal emails about googleâ s management of its temporary workers offering an unusual glimpse into how the company is grappling with growing pressure to treat temps more like permanent employees google said this week that it had started to make some changes to temp pay rates the company said that while bench mark rates had not changed for some years actual pay for temporary workers had increased numerous times and that most temps were paid more than the pay ranges â itâ s clear that this process has not been handled consistent with the high standards to which we hold ourselves as a company â spyro karetsos the companyâ s chief compliance officer said in a statement â weâ re going to figure out what went wrong here why it happened and weâ re going to make it right â the total number of temps and contractors working at google exceeds 150 000 while googleâ s parent company has 144 000 full time employees according to people who are familiar with the figures but are not permitted to disclose them publicly google has said temporary workers account for roughly 3 of its nonpermanent staff the vast majority are outsourced workers the company has said temps fill short term roles to stand in for employees on leave or when a sudden business need arises for a maximum term of two years in some cases google employees said temporary roles extend year after year there is no federal law requiring u s companies to pay temps and permanent employees the same salaries for similar work but other countries are passing laws to push for more equal treatment more than 30 have some form of pay parity laws for temps begin optional trim in countries with equal pay laws recognized by the company google normally takes extra precautions to make sure open temporary jobs are paid on a par with the appropriate full time positions in those countries google pays a 15 annual bonus to temps which is the same as the lowest bonus rate for its permanent employees it usually does not pay bonuses to temps in countries without equal pay requirements but last year in a company email a google manager said it appeared that 16 additional countries including brazil canada australia and mexico had some form of equal treatment laws for temps that the company had not properly recognized and had not taken any extra steps to be compliant with the local laws end optional trim as more countries introduce new regulations google is being forced to take action in 2019 the netherlands passed a law that requires googleâ s staffing agencies to provide temps with the same benefits as the companyâ s permanent employees such as sick pay maternity and other paid leaves health care and stock grants this change affected at least seven google temp workers in the country begin optional trim â this is a situation we ought to avoid â barry wrote in an email to colleagues he recommended that google fire all seven workers before the law went into effect in 2020 ultimately google said it decided to hire six of the temp workers to full time positions for the remainder of their contracts the other worker was let go but with three monthsâ pay according to the company in recent years google has sought ways to cut back its use of temporary workers in 2018 google started project an initiative that included a review of whether jobs were being categorized correctly as part of â labor model reset â in one internal 2021 email a google executive said the company had reduced the number of temps by 2 700 since 2018 most of those positions were outsourced the email said while 750 temps were converted to full time employees the project also sought to establish pay parity for temps with permanent employees doing similar jobs in the united states by 2019 in a preliminary 2019 study to weigh the financial impact of taking this step in the united states where google employs more than half of its temp workers the company estimated that it would cost up to 52 million to bring pay for 4 000 plus temporary workers up to the minimum pay of a newly hired permanent employee internal communications viewed by the times indicate that three years into the project google has struggled to make progress on equal pay for temps in january 2020 google apparently realized that it had been using out of date pay scales in a company email reviewed by the times a google manager said it had not reviewed european rates in eight years and three years in asia this year a company presentation laid out the discrepancies for specific jobs google found that the comparison hourly wage for a temporary midlevel administrative assistant in britain was 16 51 pounds about 22 86 based on what it paid full time employees in that role in the past but an updated 2021 rate should be 40 higher at 23 08 pounds google uses pontoon a unit of the staffing agency adecco group to handle the hiring of temps and it pays a premium to staffing agencies to find and be the employer of record for the workers the company documents said mary beth waddill a spokeswoman for pontoon said it did not disclose information about client contracts â pontoon does not set pay rates and in countries with pay parity laws we play a role in ensuring that contingent workers are paid in adherence with the law â she said when a google manager wants to hire a temp pontoon provides â bill rate cardsâ with minimum and maximum wages based on what google said it pays full time employees in a similar role according to company documents those wages include a markup for the agencies and pontoon end optional trim even though google managers are allowed to pay above the maximum wage the outdated pay ranges provide a framework for setting pay according to a source familiar with the framework one google manager expressed concern in an email that the company classified the temporary roles in ways that artificially lowered its pay scale by comparing them to many unrelated and lower paying jobs for example based on a spreadsheet of european pay rates reviewed by the times massage therapists and lawyers fall under the same job family of â hr adminâ and they share the same basic pay rates â although managers have discretion to pay different rates in another email a manager said they were told to compare pay for the temp role not with the permanent job closest in terms of responsibilities and requirements but instead use the â lowest common denominatorâ or the junior most role within a job category as google worked to assess how to correct the rates for temps according to emails viewed by the times managers continued to weigh openly what it could do without negative attention

california lawmakers finished their work for the 2021 legislative session friday night just four days before voting concludes in a statewide recall election targeting democratic gov gavin newsom whatever the outcome of the recall election newsom will likely still have the final say on the hundreds of bills the legislature put on his desk in the past two weeks even if newsom were to lose the election by the time his successor took office the deadline for signing or vetoing legislation will have passed bills that have passed must be reviewed by the governor before becoming law unless otherwise noted here s a look at what passed and what failed in the california legislature this year housing get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters two bills passed that would make it easier to build small apartment buildings in areas where only single family homes are allowed the goal is to address a housing shortage in the nation s most populous state a group of 241 cities have urged newsom to veto one bill because it would bypass local zoning laws with some exceptions two other high profile housing bills didn t make it the bills would have made it easier to turn abandoned shopping malls into apartment buildings both bills passed the senate but did not get a vote in the assembly drugs a bill passed that could make california the first state to pay peoplestruggling with drug addiction to stay sober the treatment known as contingency management pays people as little as 2 for every negative drug test over the course of a few weeks the federal government has been doing it for years with military veterans and research shows it is one of the most effective treatment for drugs like methamphetamine and cocaine but bills that would have legalized some psychedelic drugs and given opioid users a place toinject drugs while supervised failed to pass this year sen scott wiener the author of both bills said he will try again next year public safety lawmakers approved a bill that would end the careers of bad cops by preventing them from getting hired at other law enforcement agencies the bill would create a mandatory new license for law enforcement officers a new disciplinary board could permanently revoke someone s license with a two thirds vote the legislature also approved barring police from arresting anyone for loitering with the intent to engage in prostitution following a debate over whether the move would help or harm sex trafficking victims but sen scott wiener then used a procedural move to withhold his bill from the governor s consideration until next year saying supporters need more time to make their case about why it s a good idea jaywalking would be decriminalized under another bill that passed eliminating a crime that democratic lawmakers said is arbitrarily enforced against people of color california would set statewide standards for law enforcement s use of rubber bullets and chemical irritants during protests under another of the many criminal justice bills considered by lawmakers but a bill that would have overhauled california s cash bail systemfailed to pass this year the bill s demise comes one year after voters blocked a law that would have ended cash bail in favor of risk assessments health care low income people who are 50 and older and living in the country illegally can now get their health care bills paid for by taxpayers lawmakers also made it easier for older people eligible for medicaid by eliminating an asset requirement that disqualified many people 65 and over newsom signed both proposals into law as part of the state budget california public schools and colleges would have to stock their restrooms with free menstrual products under another bill that passed but a proposal that sought to make health care less expensive for everyone in california failed to pas this year newsom had wanted to create a new office of health care affordability which would have the power to regulate health care prices education lawmakers passed a bill that would make ethnic studies a requirement to graduate high school in california newsom vetoed a similar bill last year because he thought the model curriculum was insufficiently balanced reparations california became the third state to approve reparations of about 25 000 a person for those who were sterilized against their will the program targets people sterilized under the state s eugenics laws that sought to weed out undesirable traits by sterilizing people with mental

michel martin host and finally today we remember that most people experienced the 9 11 attacks through television especially tv news npr tv critic eric deggans says in the 20 years since it s also shaped television eric deggans byline among the enduring images from 9 11 is the tv coverage itself four days of continuous commercial free reports on broadcast and cable channels soundbite of archived recording aaron brown at about 8 45 eastern time a plane crashed into the foremost of those towers the world trade center deggans then tv gave us action oriented heroes who could channel the anger and frustration of a traumatized nation like kiefer sutherland s hard charging government agent jack bauer on the fox series 24 but when asked about the changes he thinks 9 11 brought to tv cnbc anchor shepard smith who covered the attacks when he worked at fox news also notes something small the ticker a stream of news headlines moving across the screen which cable news channels began using during 9 11 coverage shepard smith well we had an information overload the likes of which we d never really experienced getting more info to the screen is the main thing i feel like 9 11 helped us learn to process it all soundbite of archived recording charlie gibson so this looks like it is some sort of a concerted effort to attack the world trade center that is underway deggans in many ways coverage of the disaster was tv news s finest hour uniting the nation aaron brown who anchored cnn s reporting that day from a rooftop said 9 11 highlighted how cable news channels thrive by focusing on the one story viewers care most about brown the lesson of 9 11 in many many many way is that you need one great story and you d feel like a schmuck if you then said let me give you five minutes on the weather soundbite of tv show late show with david letterman david letterman welcome to the late show this is our first show on the air since new york and washington were attacked deggans david letterman was the first late night host to bring his show back leading a new episode just six days after the attacks a consummate broadcaster letterman channeled the emotions of the moment and his audience so powerfully he established a new tv tradition that endures soundbite of tv show late show with david letterman letterman we ve lost 5 000 fellow new yorkers and you can feel it you can feel it you can see it it s terribly sad terribly terribly sad deggans the way today s late night hosts returned so soon after pandemic lockdowns shut them out of their studios last year recalled the example letterman set 20 years ago when it comes to scripted tv shows there are two programs that highlight 9 11 s influence over the years showtime s homeland and fox s 24 executive producer howard gordon worked on both of them beginning with 24 which debuted on fox just a few months after 9 11 gordon says by the show s second season bauer s willingness to do anything to stop the show s villains spoke to an america angry at terrorists and incompetent or corrupt government officials soundbite of tv show 24 kiefer sutherland as jack bauer you are going to tell me now how to find the rest of the nerve gas peter weller as christopher henderson oh go ahead and do it jack get it done shoot me deggans later gordon would help develop homeland a show that commented more directly on terrorism and war homeland initially focused on an american former prisoner of war and his connection to a female cia agent who suspects he s been brainwashed by al qaida both shows while popular with viewers faced criticism that their american centric focus created storylines and depictions that demonize muslims and make torture look effective leading some to accuse gordon of being an islamophobe which he denies howard gordon did we recognize the full extent of some of the implications no and that s kind of i think that s kind of what i have to say at this moment i am people ask me how am i and my stock answer is i m humbled and i m doing a lot more listening deggans one legendary tv personality says speaking out against war in iraq helped end his tv career phil donahue everybody else was beating the war drums and i wanted to get on the air and say why are you doing this deggans phil donahue long a household name thanks to his classic daytime talk show began hosting a talk show for msnbc in 2002 showcasing his skepticism of the iraq war back then msnbc had different ownership and executives it also hadn t developed its current lineup of liberal pundits by 2003 msnbc canceled donahue s show he remains convinced his insistence on challenging the drive to war did him in donahue the jingoism has really created a roadblock to truth telling the reporting of bad news is more important than the good news but for a long time it was very hard to make that point in a country that as my grandmother would have said is full of itself deggans perhaps one of the most crucial lessons for tv and media from 9 11 is the importance of resisting the jingoism and groupthink inspired by such disasters i m eric deggans soundbite of deadly avenger s skit 2 transcript provided by

economists across the political spectrum have long advocated an increase in infrastructure investment in the united states now congress is debating infrastructure spending packages that would secure the current economic recovery and boost potential growth over the next decade despite deep partisan divisions on most other issues the senate recently passed the 1tn infrastructure investment and jobs act iija by a large majority the bill now must pass the house of representatives where speaker nancy pelosi has secured an agreement for a vote by the end of september approval looks likely but is by no means certain given complete lack of support from house republicans and ongoing divisions among house democrats the iija focuses on traditional physical infrastructure where much of the need is for long overdue maintenance committing about 550bn for investment in items like roads and bridges water infrastructure and broadband the bill also contains climate related investments in clean energy transmission and electric vehicle infrastructure including electrification of school and transit buses these investments would be paid for through a combination of unspent emergency relief funds corporate user fees strengthened tax enforcement and revenues from stronger economic growth the congressional budget office warns that the iija could increase the fiscal deficit by 256bn over the next decade but additional borrowing to finance infrastructure is warranted given that the real cost of federal borrowing is currently in the 2 range while the projected return on investment in physical infrastructure is around 7 the iija moreover is only a down payment on the investments in physical and human capital needed to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth congress must pass an even bigger and bolder plan that focuses on human development economic mobility and climate resilience to that end the senate with only democratic support recently passed a 3 5tn budget resolution for the next ten years that includes such investments and the house has now incorporated the plan into its budget framework again passage of the plan is by no means certain major details need to be decided and tough negotiations on financing and non infrastructure items including immigration lie ahead the us economy rests on fragile foundations while the rebound from the covid 19 recession has been surprisingly rapid and robust the us federal reserve may soon start to taper its monthly bond purchases and the earlier fiscal emergency and stimulus spending packages will soon run their course the spread of the delta variant owing to vaccine hesitancy has already curtailed demand in pandemic sensitive sectors like travel tourism and hospitality worse the recovery has yet to reach many workers hit hardest by the dual recession especially non college educated people lower wage women and people of colour in vulnerable sectors moreover labour force participation remains low largely because school closures have forced many parents predominantly women to leave the workforce to care for their children politically motivated claims that expanded unemployment benefits have fostered low labour force participation will disappear as those benefits expire this month indeed the experience of states that decided to cut enhanced benefits earlier has already refuted the argument that those provisions were undermining work incentives the recovery has been kind to shareholders homeowners and the wealthy stock markets are hitting record highs and home prices are up by 25 from a year ago the number of billionaires continues to grow with their overall wealth increasing by 62 since 2020 overall inequality has continued to increase while economic mobility has declined leaving a growing number of americans further behind the 3 5tn budget plan proposes major investments in social infrastructure to change this trajectory these include 726bn for preschool services childcare for working families tuition free community college increased funding for historically black universities and colleges and expansions of pell grants and primary healthcare there is also more than 300bn earmarked for public housing the housing trust fund housing affordability and equity and community land trusts to foster sustainable equitable growth the plan includes nearly 200bn for clean energy development and 135bn to address forest fires droughts and other climate driven challenges as evidence of the adverse effects of climate change mounts denialism and resistance to mitigation and adaptation policies have waned both in the us and around the world recent polls show that over two thirds of americans now want the government to do more to address climate change as more communities experience its adverse effects voters are increasingly joining major investors in demanding action the 3 5tn plan would be funded through a combination of new tax revenues strengthened tax enforcement healthcare savings and revenues from long term growth the main revenue generators are an increase in the corporate tax rate to the 28 range a global minimum corporate tax in the 20 range and higher tax rates on personal income and capital gains for wealthy americans those with taxable incomes over 400 000 recent polls indicate that there is robust voter support across party lines for tax increases on both corporations and high income earners a recent report by moody s analytics concludes that over the next decade the 3 5tn budget along with the iija would accelerate the economy s recovery to full employment increase employment by 20mn and boost long term growth the benefits of which would mostly accrue to lower and middle income families moreover even if these plans increase the deficit more than anticipated this is still an especially propitious time for the federal government to borrow to increase investments in infrastructure given the anticipated returns and extraordinarily low interest rates infrastructure investment is a twofer in the short run it stimulates demand through strong fiscal multiplier effects and it strengthens the supply foundations of economic growth and competitiveness over time the infrastructure plans being debated this month would generate these macroeconomic benefits in ways that would also foster greater equity and climate resilience congress holds the keys to a future of inclusive and sustainable growth for america now it needs to muster the courage to use them project syndicate laura tyson former chair of the us president s council of economic advisers is professor of the graduate school at the haas school of business and chair of the blum center board of trustees at the university of california berkeley lenny mendonca senior

listen to this article listen to this article top illustration by tim forkes has it been 20 years september 11 2001 the world changed for those of us in the united states maybe it did for our european and canadian allies mexico too but most definitely for u s citizens for too long we assumed the two great oceans insulated us from the ills of the world even as our government stirred up shit elsewhere europe and asia had terrorist attacks but let s be honest we had domestic terrorists for over a century from the ku klux klan to timothy mcveigh blowing up the alfred p murrah federal building in oklahoma city ok let s not forget all the violence and terror associated with the anarchists and labor troubles in the early part of the 20th century then the violent fringe of the 1960 anti war movement that blew up buildings and threatened violent actions so the united states was never without terrorism we just labeled it something else disgruntled white folks or something for us terrorism meant people of middle eastern descent speaking arabic and demanding freedom for palestinians or something else we had nothing to do with thank you explosions in london paris italy spain all over europe al qaeda tried to knock down the world trade center in 1993 february 26 to be exact a truck bomb below the north tower that seemed like a one off event but u s intelligence was tracking the terrorist organization as it attacked western targets around the world news organization weren t really reporting on the intelligence gathering concerning al qaeda until the terrorists bombed the two embassies in africa nairobi kenya and dar es salaam tanzania august 7 1998 then the attack of october 12 2000 on the uss cole in aden yemen even after those bombings in and around africa the u s populace didn t get fully engaged with the idea that a bunch of terrorists had declared war on the u s we were angry to be sure but these attacks happened over there not here on our shores we were wrapped up with the gop obsession with getting bill clinton gosh bill lied about getting a blow job in the oval office hallway from someone other than his wife under oath many of us on the left were pissed at bill for giving those right wing nut bars like lindsey graham bob barr and asa hutchinson what they needed to have their own collective ejaculation with an impeachment they were so gleeful to put on a show on all the tv channels there it was the blue dress with the cum stains it was so exciting it was a joke on the america people paid for by the american people for the pleasures of the gop and their most fervent and fevered base they wanted to show the american people bill clinton would lie about getting sexual favors from a much younger woman and as far as they were concerned to hell with the young woman involved her name is still 22 plus years later sullied by the whole affair so no we were not engaged with al qaeda s war on america before september 11 2001 members of our government were like richard a clarke who on that fateful day was the national coordinator for security infrastructure protection and counter terrorism for the national security council during the clinton administration clarke had direct access to the president to deliver his national security reports in the bush 43 administration clarke had layers of aides like national security advisor condoleezza rice between him and the president and rice we found out didn t consider a bunch of muslim terrorists to be a major issue she was more interested in continuing the cold war policies and rewarding the military industrial complex with big contracts for defense equipment the u s didn t need rice later told the 9 11 commission she had no idea terrorists would use planes as missiles she had publicly said no one had any idea terrorists would use planes as missiles and in fact analysts from the intelligence agencies plus richard clarke had predicted just that not to mention author tom clancy had written a trilogy of novels with the planes as missiles playing a central role to begin his testimony before the 9 11 commission clarke apologized to the families of those killed by the attacks as well as the u s as a whole if condoleezza rice had no idea people would use commercial airliners as missiles she wasn t paying attention her failure of imagination was a major reason the attacks of 9 11 were successful for al qaeda you can read her testimony before the 9 11 commission here also there s no evidence secretary rice to suggest the members of al qaeda hated freedom but it wasn t all on the bush 43 administration and condoleezza rice according to former director of the cia george tenet he was trying to get approval from both the clinton and bush 43 administrations to launch attacks inside afghanistan before 9 11 to take out taliban and al qaeda targets including usama bin laden the question of whether it is legal or not to assassinate adversaries came up during the 9 11 commission as a road block to pulling the trigger before 9 11 the united states doesn t use assassination as a form of foreign policy or at least it didn t before 9 11 now we use unmanned drones to take out targets around the world assassination by drones has become a very comfortable way to conduct foreign policy thank you president barack obama obama getting the nobel prize for peace was a joke in his book at the center of the storm tenet covers his ass pretty well claiming he took his concerns to condoleezza rice in july 2001 about attacks from al qaeda being imminent and as he told scott pelley of 60 minutes essentially the briefing says there are gonna be multiple spectacular attacks against the united states we believe these attacks are imminent mass casualties are a likelihood tenet also said he told rice we need to consider immediate action inside afghanistan now we need to move to the offensive and she pushed it off to a third tier official to consider tenet thought the rules around assassination as a tool of national security and foreign policy were going to change as a result of the attacks of 9 11 and so they did in the 20 years since al qaeda attacked the world trade center the pentagon and the failed attempt that crashed in pennsylvania we have engaged in two major wars the first of which america s longest war came to an end august 30 of this year and included the assassination of usama bin laden by seal team 6 on may 2 2011 in abbottabad pakistan just a few clicks over the border of afghanistan well it s an eight hour drive from kabul afghanistan and just a couple hours by helicopter from bagram air base what have we to show for these 20 years of continuous war on terror in afghanistan and iraq in yemen and libya and who knows where else in africa and asia trillions of dollars spent essentially given to the military industrial complex for the very latest in war fighting equipment night vision gear for everyone serving on the ground in a war zone updated versions of the a 10 warthog ground support aircraft which was scheduled to be taken out of service 20 years ago the f 22 raptor f 35 joint strike fighter and there s another very expensive aircraft the air force or navy needs or maybe it s the marine corps because the it s long past time to retire the harrier and we re building all those abrams tanks we will never use and armored personnel carriers humvees and hundreds of other pieces of equipment that just keeps the military industrial complex rolling along who were the big winners from the past 20 years it wasn t the families of the thousands of americans killed in the wars for the past 20 years or the tens of thousands wounded carrying around scars we sometimes can see and often times not whomever that person was before they joined the army marine corps navy air force coast guard or national guard that person no longer exists especially if they witnessed and took part in the brutality of war you will never understand him or her who that person is today because you didn t serve for the 99 of america that has no clue what it means to be of military service to this nation what happens to the people that do serve will forever remain a mystery please stop saying thank you for your service how about showing your support by pressuring your representatives to fully fund the department of veterans affairs medical and social services but this is about 20 years post 9 11 what do we have nothing really no new infrastructure in america no high speed rail crumbling bridges roadways and airports fifty five years ago los angeles international airport lax was a marvel of modern air travel now it s a laughing stock compared to modern airports in other nations same with jfk in new york and o hare in chicago airports in the united states are a joke mainly because we have given trillions of dollars to the people that make money off wars people that skim aid to enrich themselves in countries we are supposed to be helping like afghanistan corruption is big business here at home and abroad we can ask where all that money went all day long but it doesn t matter what matters is that money wasn t used to make life better for the people of this nation here at home we did nothing to address the wealth gap nothing to address poor health outcomes that are a result of our for profit health care industry we did nothing to address the opioid epidemic we did manage to exploit everyone s fear of being attacked again by foreign terrorists the irony being we have been under attack by domestic terrorists culminating with the attack on our nation s capital january 6 2021 it s probably been since 1865 that our nation was this divided there are actually idiots proclaiming they will start another civil war over mask and vaccine mandates over a fucking vaccine there s that dip shit governor of south dakota talking about freedom like her state and a few others are the only ones to have freedom everyone in the united states has the same freedoms you self absorbed divisive little twit over 200 sovereign nations in the world and over 180 of them have freedoms south dakota isn t the only place in the world that has freedoms i live in southern california and i have never felt freer in my life and i m fully vaccinated and wear a mask i voted no on the recall no to kooks like larry elder who wants to be the next krisi noem or maybe the next ron desantis r fl or that idiot in texas greg abbott everywhere you look in real time or on the internet everyone is telling us to never forget remember the 3 000 brave women men and children that died on september 11 2001 as a result of the terrorist attacks and we should we should also remember the thousands of men and women that went to work on the pile at ground zero inhaling powdered glass cement asbestos and who knows what other toxic materials developing lung and other diseases and eventually dying we should remember and honor them as well and be thankful that congress finally did the right thing to make their compensation permanent to honor those people we are remembering today we should make america a better place one that is more inclusive for immigrants and refugees that likes and allows muslims christian jews buddhists sikhs hindus shinto and atheists to exist and flourish in this nation without fear discrimination or persecution christians are not persecuted in this nation by the way they just happen to be some of the biggest whiners who like to claim persecution because we won t run the nation like a theocracy based on their brand of christian fundamentalism personally i m not even trying to be united and healing i m with howard stern i m done with the 25 who are ruining this country with their bullshit anti vax and mask protests you had the cure for covid 19 and you refused to take it now thousands of the unvaccinated are showing up in hospitals to die while people with heart conditions kidney ailments and other health problems are turned away i say turn away anyone that refused to get vaccinated they chose their bed so let them lie in it do i sound bitter i am forty years after newt gingrich started dividing the nation people like me are tired of trying to be accommodating and understanding i don t want any part of the compromise grind the gop into the dirt no one no one has ever been held accountable for not stopping the attacks on 9 11 nor has anyone been held accountable for lying to get us into a war with iraq there was never weapons of mass destruction the bush 43 administration just flat out lied about it and no one has been held to account yes i will never forget 9 11 but i will also remember the patriot act the authorization for use of military forces that started the two wars iraq and afghanistan and the patriot act was the biggest assault on our civil liberties in history preserving life and liberty please most of all let s stop being afraid fearful of them whoever they are remember the tsa and all the security just to get on commercial aircraft remember the extra layer of bureaucracy in the intelligence gathering community called the department of homeland security remember enhanced interrogation torture as it is known in the real world remember gitmo guantanamo bay where our government theorized they could skirt around all of our civil liberties and the restrictions of the geneva conventions we became one of those countries the kind that spits on freedoms the kind of nation that tries to ignore its history as it pertains to the subjugation and exploitation of indigenous people and africans brought to these shores as slaves plus all their descendants we don t want white children learning about how certain white people put bounties on the heads of all indigenous people as well as runaway slaves there s a lot to remember on the 20th anniversary of 9 11 so let s start with the ones that lost their lives as a result of that terrorist attack let s remember and honor the loved ones of those who died as a result of these attacks let s honor and remember all the men and women who went to fight in the wars that were started as a result of the attacks especially the thousands who gave their last full measure of devotion let s honor them by making our nation just a little better than it was on september 10 2001

biotech is risky but we re no woodford insists boss of scottish mortgage trust as some of his picks have become worthless co manager tom slater admits that some of his picks have become worthless one of the firm s healthcare stock zymergen lost 80 of its value last month but slater said these only made up a small part of the 20 4bn investment trust one of the trust s holdings is clover health where chelsea clinton is a director one of the uk s most influential stock pickers has warned that some of his bets on biotech stocks will turn sour but said it is the price to pay for the chance of making top returns tom slater co manager of scottish mortgage one of britain s most popular investment trusts admitted biotech is risky pointing out that some of his picks have become worthless however he said these only made up a small part of the 20 4billion investment trust and that failed investments are a risk worth taking for potential winners he told the mail on sunday we try to be very upfront that the price of getting the big winners is the ones we inevitably get wrong we ve generally tried to go for companies we think are a very big opportunity and accepted upfront that not all of those win led by outgoing fund manager james anderson scottish mortgage is one of the most successful investment trusts in britain shares in the trust have rocketed over the past decade rising 899 4 per cent the trust launched in 1909 and managed by the fund group baillie gifford has been boosted by technology stocks over the past few years with its top investments including us electric car firm tesla and online retailer amazon recently scottish mortgage has been investing more in biotech and pharmaceuticals where a handful of its stocks have seen values plunge or be wiped out some advisers are raising questions over its future performance and have drawn parallels with some of the stocks held by fund manager neil woodford whose 3 5billion fund collapsed in 2019 slater used his holding in denali therapeutics whose share price has recently fallen to explain the difference between his picks and those of woodford he said that compared with some of the firms backed by woodford denali is a much larger company with a much larger balance sheet that is not dependent on a single drug candidate slater added we re not investing in start ups we re investing in companies that have genuinely gone through several financing rounds and the other distinction is the global footprint of what we can look for one of the trust s holdings is american medical company clover health where chelsea clinton the daughter of former us president bill clinton is a director clover faced criticism earlier this year after short seller hindenburg research said it had not disclosed it was under investigation by the us department of justice the us securities and exchange commission also scrutinised the firm after the short selling attack the shares dropped from 22 16 in june to 9 however that company represents just 0 1 per cent of the trust s investments another scottish mortgage healthcare stock zymergen lost 80 per cent of its value last month after warning it no longer expects to generate product revenue this year and intarcia therapeutics a us firm that has been unable to secure approval from the authorities for its diabetes treatment had its value written down to zero slater said intarcia is an example where there was a really big opportunity that they were going after they didn t get the approval from the fda during the phase three trials and eventually they couldn t fund further investment however he said any losses will have been far outstripped by some of his top picks such as illumina whose shares soared from 70 cents in may 2011 when the trust bought the stock to 461 the losses on the ones that didn t work are a rounding error compared with that return he added
whatever happened to the uk equity income fund once a stalwart of most investors isa and pension portfolios because of its attractive offering of income and capital return the uk equity income fund is currently about as unpopular as a fox on a chicken farm just look at the facts the uk equity income investment sector has clocked up 14 consecutive months of outflows as investors have looked for better value elsewhere in total investors have pulled almost 5billion out of these funds over this period 18billion since 2016 but by leaving they have missed out on a bull run the uk equity income sector generated an average return of 27 in the 14 month period laura suter head of personal finance at wealth platform aj bell points out that the uk equity income sector generated an average return of 27 per cent in the 14 month period this compares to the 18 per cent gain registered by the ftse 100 the index comprising the largest companies listed on the london stock exchange jason hollands managing director at wealth platform tilney describes the equity income fund sell off as quite shocking adding that the funds were historically a cornerstone of private portfolios he adds i don t think investors should give up on uk income funds far from it he says pointing out that over the long run most of the gains in uk equities tend to be down to dividends ian lance co manager of income focused investment trust temple bar says that investors who have sold out of the sector could regret it many could come to rue their decision to give up on the equity income sector at exactly the wrong time he warns whether you believe it is time to get back into the equity income sector depends on your view of the health of uk plc and its ability to restore a healthy stream of dividends yet many experts believe that investors could benefit from picking up a uk equity income fund or two at the current price protect your dividends from the new tax rate the government s decision to add 1 25 percentage points on to the dividend tax rate has implications for many investors who are seeking income through dividends while everyone is allowed to receive 2 000 of dividends a year tax free after that the dividend tax rate is 7 5 per cent for basic rate taxpayers and 32 5 per cent for higher rate taxpayers this will rise to 8 75 per cent and 33 75 per cent respectively in april next year it means basic rate taxpayers will pay 263 in tax on 5 000 of dividend income up from 225 while higher rate taxpayers will pay 1 013 up from 875 this means that those who receive dividends through income friendly funds should be locking as much of their investment away into tax free wrappers as possible dividends paid when investments are held in either pensions or isas are free from dividend tax and do not count towards the 2 000 annual allowance currently everyone can pay 40 000 into a pension per tax year and 20 000 into an isa a bed and isa strategy where you sell investments and then buy them back in a tax wrapper can help you mitigate dividend taxes while married couples should ensure they use both partners isa and pension allowances to protect dividend payments from the taxman the rise and fall of equity income uk equity income funds would seem to offer the holy grail in the current low interest rate environment regular income from shares that should rise in value over time so what has gone wrong to prompt huge investor outflows dzmitry lipski of investment platform interactive investor suggests that part of the recent sell off is due to the uk s dividend drought where companies cut their payouts to shareholders due to covid 19 this was very much a pandemic theme he says but there were other issues at play as well the high profile failure of neil woodford s giant equity income fund which is yet to be wound up has massively diminished confidence in the sector then there was brexit uncertainty which depressed uk shares and a trend towards growth stocks during the pandemic as tech company valuations took off at the expense of duller dividend paying stalwarts many experts believe the sector s unfavourable reputation is unfair and the funds undervalued you might expect there would be greater investor demand for this sector which provides investors with an annual income in the region of 3 6 per cent yield says annabel brodie smith communications director of trade body the association of investment companies darius mcdermott managing director at fund expert chelsea financial also confesses he doesn t entirely understand the equity income fund exodus i m not sure why investors seem to be shunning this sector he says it could be because the uk stock market is just so unloved at the moment and people are perhaps diversifying more these days into global or regional equity income funds he adds it s still an obvious investment choice as far as i am concerned the uk is the most mature dividend market in the world and has one of the highest dividend levels even after the pandemic as fund scrutineers we still believe in the sector why dividends are now set to rebound the dividend drought in the uk now seems to have ended simon gergel who runs income investment trust merchants says that income in the investment universe was savagely hit in 2020 with sharper and deeper cuts in dividends than we have seen in any crisis previously but he says the worst is over that hit is being matched by an equally sharp recovery with 2021 dividends expected to be not too far from their 2019 peak across the market the uk stock market is now offering investors an income equivalent to three per cent job curtis who runs investment trust city of london says this is significantly more than rock bottom bank deposit rates or government bond yields curtis is now bullish on the prospects for dividend paying uk stocks believing that the stock market will continue to rebound with takeover bids from private equity firms and overseas companies indicating that there is value to be had wide variety of funds and performance once you ve decided on the investment virtues of a uk equity income fund there s a bewildering number of funds more than 80 to choose from the range of performance in the sector is wide the top performer over three years a multi cap income fund from gresham house has returned 38 6 per cent and yields 3 4 per cent while at the bottom of the table funds such as ubs equity income have generated losses interactive s lipski recommends royal london uk equity income which will be run by current deputy richard marwood when lead fund manager martin cholwill retires later this year the fund s largest sector holdings are in industrials financials and consumer discretionary stocks it yields more than three per cent and has generated three year returns in excess of 14 per cent he also recommends diverse income trust which can invest in uk companies of any size but has a bias towards medium sized and small companies the trust currently yields 3 1 per cent and its shares have advanced in price by 30 4 per cent over the past three years chelsea s mcdermott recommends threadneedle uk equity income and jupiter income he says the threadneedle fund managed by richard colwell has a pragmatic approach targeting both capital growth and income rather than prioritising the latter like some income funds it has made profits of 12 7 per cent over the past three years the fund currently has big positions in astrazeneca 7 8 per cent electrocomponents 6 8 per cent rentokil 5 1 per cent and glaxosmithkline 5 per cent it also has five per cent invested in supermarket company morrisons currently subject to a bidding war jupiter income is down 2 per cent over three years but over the past year it has delivered a return of 30 per cent ryan hughes at fund platform aj bell likes temple bar investment trust its big holdings include royal mail itv and anglo american

the indian it industry in fact has gone through a little wall of worry this industry was totally ignored by most investors till one year back it is only people like aberdeen etc who were holding it stocks for 20 years or more so a re rating happened because people decided to move to it in the last six months offering college course website iim lucknow iiml chief operations officer programme visit iim kozhikode iimk chief product officer programme visit iim lucknow iiml chief executive officer programme visit indian school of business isb chief technology officer visit indian it companies have had rupee dollar as their saviour for the last 15 years now if that does not become the saviour for the next five seven years or two years at least in a short term the volatility in prices would come and we will see underperformance of this sector says ceo you are talking about the increase in apple and google and alphabet stock prices just watch till the indians have just not even landed there the indian investor has just about dipped his toe in the market in the next two years the bumpup in these stocks is not going to come from the us alone it is going to come from india and the rest of the world who have started to feel they had been left out in the rally on the biggest stocks so very clearly there is a huge traction on the buy side for all these stocks from global investors and indians in particular these stocks have got enormous value in terms of the demand and number two none of these stocks issue equity they mostly do buybacks and so the supply is also not increasing in the market you can imagine when 200 million indians suddenly start to invest in apple what is going to happen to this stock the indian it industry in fact has gone through a little wall of worry this industry was totally ignored by most investors at this point one year back it is only people like aberdeen etc who were holding it stocks for i think 20 years or more so a re rating happened because people decided to move to it in the last six months the market can go wherever it wants but these stocks have the ability to keep bouncing back they operate in the best global market of the world which is the united states and therefore the us growth rate is critical to them most of them operate in two or three sectors banking etc which has kind of been the bulwark of keeping them going so the parameters are us growth it investors and the fact that in a way they are almost mimicking the consumer companies with regular growth and regular income this traction will continue having said that in the next 12 months or so they will face a little bit of a trough because of the way rupee dollar is behaving it is not going to give them the 3 5 depreciation the rupee went to 75 back to 72 5 back to 73 and that variation is going to take away a lot of profitability from these companies people who are entering are going into a little more volatile period for the it stocks unlike an apple or alphabet which do not have this volatility on their books indian it companies have had rupee dollar as the saviour for the last 15 years now if that does not become the saviour for the next five seven years or two years at least in a short term the volatility in prices would come and we will see underperformance of this sector we believe that in the next 12 months it will underperform the rest of the market developers have never had it better than this for the simple reason that now there are only eight to ten developers in the market whom people trust with their money given what has happened to the rest of the developers therefore they are enjoying a boom also they are able to offload their commercial spaces and that has changed the dynamics we saw what happened to prestige they offloaded the entire portfolio out got the liquidity and can use the liquidity to start 10 new projects this has changed the dynamics for most of the real estate players i keep saying that every single growth economy in the world whether it is singapore or hong kong have real estate companies as a large component of their indices at one point of time india has not seen it perhaps india will see it now when the top four or five developers will offer a multibagger investment opportunity even from this level it is very visible but there is also a lot of scepticism i think these two industries will get re rated in investors mind and will acquire traction and offer the best multibagger opportunities they should outperform everybody else in the market

some investors have learned the hard way that trading financial securities on the robinhood platform is not for them and the securities and exchange commission sec is focusing its attention on robinhood s practices and business model as the sec pursues its initiative in this regard it is important to understand how the concept of suitability applies to investor trading on robinhood and how to form judgments about the degree to which platforms like robinhood are suitable or not for different types of investors in this post i suggest some ideas and statistics for considering this issue brazil 2021 02 01 in this photo illustration the robinhood markets logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen photo illustration by rafael henrique sopa images lightrocket via getty images sopa images lightrocket via getty images suitability was introduced into u s financial market regulation in 1934 after manipulative broker practices during the run up to the stock market crash of 1929 led many investors to take on risks they did not understand and which not surprisingly were inappropriate for their situations suitability is an ethical issue as well as a legal issue there is mounting evidence that for many investors trading on robinhood is totally unsuitable at the top of my unsuitability list are investors who suffer from gambling addiction in 2013 the american psychiatric association reclassified problematic gambling behavior from being an impulse control disorder such as kleptomania to being a disorder related to substance abuse and addiction such as those associated with alcohol and drugs ironically robinhood was founded in 2013 the same year that pathological gambling was reclassified gambling addiction is dopamine related and is part of the phenomenon author anna lembke calls dopamine nation the title of her new best seller lembke describes how addictions stem from people seeking pleasure where sensations of pleasure involve dopamine flows rising above baseline studies document that people who suffer from gambling addiction differ from others in at least two respects first gambling addicts find it more difficult to generate dopamine highs therefore they need more powerful stimuli than others to induce the same kinds of highs second relative to others the executive portion of gambling addicts brains is weaker which leads them to experience greater difficulty with self control taking these two features together means that gambling addicts need to take greater risks to achieve the same psychological highs than others and are more prone to do so even when they know they might be behaving imprudently using digital prompts the robinhood platform does a superb job of generating stimuli which activate the dopamine based reward centers in its users brains this can be akin to giving candy to a baby and for gambling addicts akin to providing them with enough rope to hang themselves there is research to suggest that a portion of the brain connected to vision plays an important role in regulating how much risk people seek plausibly by impacting dopamine flows in regions of the brain associated with anticipation according to the north american foundation for gambling addiction help the percentage of the u s population that suffers from gambling addiction is about 2 6 in my own research on online trading behavior done with financial economist arvid hoffmann we find that the percentage of investors who behave as if they were addicted to gambling is about 2 5 so virtually the same investors seeking high risk bets often trade options the new york times nyt cites a study by the firm alphacution which found that investors using the robinhood platform traded 88 times as many options contracts as investors using the rival schwab platform relative to the average account size in this regard robinhood s ceo told the times that 12 of investors who actively trade on robinhood s platform each month trade options in the data which hoffmann and i use 20 of investors trade options actively and 12 5 stipulate that speculation is their primary motive for trading the intersection investors whose primary motivation for trading is speculation and who use options to do so comprises about 5 of our data sample this group has terrible investment performance on average earning 27 less per year than investors who are non speculators which of course means incurring large losses 1 a key point made in the new york times coverage of robinhood is that many of its users lack investment expertise especially in respect to options my research with arvid hoffmann suggests that a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing specifically the worst performing group of investors are those who in addition to trading options and having speculation as their main investment objective also use technical analysis this last group on average earns a staggering 43 less per year than investors who do not trade options do not have speculation as their primary objective and do not use technical analysis this is the group whose behavior is most consistent with gambling addiction and again represents about 2 5 of our data sample turning next to investors for whom the robinhood platform with its gamification features might be suitable consider investors who trade for entertainment and do so by taking prudent risks and being disciplined in the data underlying my work with arvid hoffmann approximately 25 of investors have entertainment as their primary motivation for trading online just to place the key issue in context investors who use options and technical analysis and who identify an objective other than speculation as their primary motivation for trading on average earn 73 more per year risk adjusted than their speculating counterparts there are plausible grounds to argue that the robinhood platform might be suitable for investors seeking entertainment about 63 of investors in our data report having objectives other than entertainment and gambling for trading online approximately 44 report capital growth as their primary objective and approximately 12 report building a financial buffer for the future the remainder report saving for retirement as their primary objective the suitability issues for the 63 just described strike me as subtle moreover dopamine is an issue here but in a different way than discussed above investment strategies for successful long term wealth creation are typically different from strategies designed short term horizons investing for the long term is less about sensation seeking stock picking and market timing than about mean variance optimization mean variance optimization is largely a boring exercise for most investors meaning low dopamine flows for much of the time investors might know they should be focused on long term wealth creation however they may lack the knowledge of how to construct and implement such a strategy on their own if they are overconfident in their abilities and rely on their intuition their pleasure seeking instincts might induce them to implement strategies on a platform like robinhood which are ill designed for creating long term wealth interesting recent work by behavioral economists finds that investors using the robinhood platform engage in more attention induced trading than retail investors using other platforms and nothing captures investors attention more than the anticipation of a dopamine surge a key finding in the behavioral finance literature is that the more the individual investor trade the worse on average is their performance a key element of this finding is that increased trading results in higher transaction costs this feature also applies to trading on robinhood which claims to offer commission free trading however the claim about commission free trading strikes me as a framing exercise in that the brokers which actually execute the trades on robinhood s platform pay for order flow as a result there is reason to suspect that traders on the robinhood platform might not receive best execution and so incur transaction costs indirectly rather than directly the late john bogle made it his life mission at vanguard to make it easy for investors to choose strategies that are actually well suited to long term value creation these long term strategies are almost as easy to implement as trading on the robinhood platform the thing is that the long term value creation approach does not produce the same dopamine surges as those produced from trading on the robinhood platform this phenomenon too is part of the dopamine nation syndrome
the september 11 terrorist incidents and mass carnage in the us spelled great news for american weapons manufacturers and military contractors which by far lead their foreign counterparts in generating a stunning 7 35 trillion in revenue over the course of the past 20 years a report reveals the overwhelming majority of the astronomical income came from the us defense department or the pentagon which spent trillions of dollars on its military occupation of afghanistan and iraq tying the massive incursions to the 9 11 attacks in what washington proclaimed as its global war on terror us based axios news outlet reported saturday citing a defense news database since 9 11 war has become modernized which means it s fought with extremely expensive weapons bought from highly profitable private sector companies the report noted insisting gone are the days when most of the defense budget was spent directly on soldiers the report further recalls that when the new york stock market finally resumed business on september 17 2001 while still surrounded by ash from the smoking twin towers the s p 500 fell by a sharp five percent from its closing level on september 10 and then continued slipping over the subsequent days however the leading us military contractor lockheed martin did not follow suit rather its stock surged by 15 percent on 9 17 to 43 95 per share today on the 20th anniversary of the 9 11 carnage it trades at 349 nearly eight fold higher in 2000 according to the report lockheed martin s revenue for military sales was 18 billion or nearly 71 percent of its total revenues by 2020 its military revenue had soared to 63 billion which represents 96 percent of the weapons manufacturer s total income the growth in private sector outlays is unlikely to end any time soon the report further underlined citing todd harrison a defense budget analyst at the major washington based think tank center for strategic and international studies csis as saying what you are seeing is primarily funding for r d and procurement of weapons the size of the military is actually about the same as it was prior to 9 11 harrison added pointing out that we still have many of the same modernization needs which means even more funds will be flowing to military contractors the development came as an american expert also revealed that us has spent over 21 trillion since 9 11 on domestic and foreign militarization and explained how such an astronomical sum could have been put to far better use it s been 20 years since 911 and the us response to 911 changed the united states and the world and we wanted to look at what the us has spent on all of this response and that includes everything from the wars in afghanistan and iraq to the us remaking of our own immigration system here and our expansion of the powers of federal law enforcement said lindsay kashgarian program director of the washington based national priorities project so the us response to 911 has included a lot more than just the wars it s also included a lot of things that have increased militarization and oppression here in the united states and we wanted to look at what all of this has cost us especially because right now the us is facing as is the rest of the world a pandemic and a climate crisis and other problems that really require major investments in order to solve them she explained and what we found is that over the last 20 years we spent 21 trillion on war the military and militarizing our own society here in the united states added kashgarian the co author of the recently released report on the state of insecurity cost of militarization since 9 11 earlier this month a us based military news outlet also revealed that eight american generals who commanded american forces in afghanistan had amassed fortunes from their postings in the muslim nation despite their disastrous conduct in the occupied country the generals leading foreign forces in afghanistan including united states army general stanley mcchrystal who demanded and supervised the 2009 us troop surge went on to serve on more than 20 corporate boards according to stars and stripes daily published by the pentagon in an article titled corporate boards consulting speaking fees how us generals thrived after afghanistan the daily revealed how top generals amassed clout despite the failure of the us led military engagement in the war torn nation a review of company disclosures and other releases conducted by the specialized medium showed that the top americans generals who led the mission in afghanistan had thrived in the private sector after leaving the war zone it further added that the generals had gained major influence within businesses at universities and in think tanks in some cases selling their experience in a conflict that left millions of people dead and displaced and costing the united states more than 2 trillion and concluded with the restoration of taliban rule a former us counter terrorism specialist and military intelligence officer of the cia also revealed back in july that the united states had wasted trillions of dollars on the wars in afghanistan and iraq and failed to achieve any goals philip giraldi made the statement in an article as us troops were withdrawing from afghanistan after a 20 year war there and amid increasing pressure on the biden administration to pull out all american troops from iraq the inability of the united states to comprehend what it was becoming involved in when in the wake of 9 11 it declared a global war on terror has to be reckoned one of the singular failures of national security policy over the past twenty years giraldi wrote not only did the wars in afghanistan and iraq make bad situations worse but the fact that no one is washington was able to define victory and think in terms of an exit strategy has meant that the wars and instability are still with us in their wake has been hundreds of thousands of deaths and trillions of dollars spent to accomplish absolutely nothing he added he further lamented that iraq now leans more heavily towards iran than it does to washington
a lobbyist in mark zuckerberg s investors group is promising cautious legislators in congress and conflicted journalists that an amnesty for millions of illegals will actually raise wages for americans the promise of wage gains for americans a 600 extra in 2031 was pushed thursday by susan rice the far left director of president joe biden s domestic policy council in turn that 600 promise was retweeted by alida garcia a senior lobbyist for zuckerberg s fwd us advocacy group more than 50 economists agree the immigration reforms in our build back better legislation would over the next decade raise annual wages for all workers by 600 create more than 400k jobs grow gdp by 1 5 trillion and benefit all americans susan rice ambrice46 september 9 2021 it stretches credulity for investors to claim they support a policy that would raise wages responded steve camarota the research director at the center for immigration studies in general want lower wages he said lower wages spike stock market values by offering higher profits but investors do support the amnesty policy because it will provide them with cheaper labor and more consumers he said it will spur more illegal immigration and more family based immigration it s a win win for them spurring demand and holding down wages increased supply of workers he said this push is led by zuckerberg s fwd us network of coastal investors who stand to gain from more cheap labor government aided consumers and room sharing renters the network has funded many astroturf campaigns urged democrats not to talk about the economic impact of migration and manipulated coverage by the tv networks and the print media the breadth of investors who founded and funded fwd us was hidden from casual visitors to the group s website sometime in the last few months but copies exist at the other sites fwd us allies have produced multiple reports claiming very small wage gains for americans those claims are cited in the 50 economists letter and were debunked by breitbart news in april the september 9 higher wages pitch comes as zuckerberg s fwd us investor group and its progressive subordinates are lobbying and pressuring the senate s debate referee the parliamentarian to include multiple amnesties in the so called reconciliation budget bill as part of that pressure campaign garcia also retweeted a tweet from new york times reporter maggie haberman haberman had shared a pro amnesty tweet from brian deese the chairman of biden s national economic council of advisers but the deese tweet ignored the claim by 50 economists of wage gains for ordinary americans instead deese only used his twitter account on september 9 to restate the unverifiable and uncontroversial prediction that an amnesty would slightly expand the economy and slightly expand the number of jobs by 400 000 or 0 25 percent over the next 10 years yet a week earlier on august 31 deese had retweeted news about confirmed and dramatic pay raises that are being caused by a nationwide shortage of workers from cnn colleague alisonkosik walgreens plans to increase its starting hourly wage for all employees to 15 an hour by next year the latest retailer to raise pay as companies compete for workers in a tight labor market john harwood johnjharwood august 31 2021 walgreen s new 15 per hour starting wage is a 50 percent increase for new employees from the current starting wage of 10 an hour walgreen s 5o percent raise is many many times more valuable to its employers than a promised slow rise to a 600 wage in 10 years moreover the wage gains for walgreen s employees may be blocked by the amnesty pushed by lake garcia and the fwd us investors because they are caused by labor shortages amid widespread worries about the coronavirus disease and also by president donald trump s 2020 curbs on legal and illegal migration supermarketnnews com reported on august 31 the shortage driven wage gains are widespread each wage raise is a loss for investors such as those in fwd us for example the 150 million per year cost of walgreen s wages are taken from profits that would otherwise have added roughly 2 8 billion to the value of the company s shares that are held by wall street investors labor scarcity also promotes wealth boosting productivity as well as wage gains according to a new york times op ed by david autor an economist at the massachusetts institute of technology the labor scarcity we re experiencing is real this is an opportunity not a crisis he wrote on september 4 moreover jobs for americans are more popular than amnesties according to a september 1 2 survey of 1 299 americans for npr ipsos asked would you support or oppose creating a legal way for the following groups of immigrants who meet certain qualifications to become u s citizens all of the estimated 11 million immigrants living illegally in the u s just 19 percent of adults declared strong support while 44 percent strongly opposed democrats split 29 percent strong support 9 percent strong opposition ipsos also asked when jobs are scarce employers should prioritize hiring people of this country over immigrants twenty eight percent strongly agreed and just 6 percent strongly disagreed democrat strongly responses split 17 percent to 9 percent many polls show that labor migration is deeply unpopular because it damages ordinary americans career opportunities cuts their wages and raises their rents migration also curbs their productivity shrinks their political clout widens regional wealth gaps and wrecks their democratic compromise promoting civic culture for many years a wide variety of pollsters have shown deep and broad opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates this pocketbook opposition is multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity americans owe to each other however donor funded gop leaders have downplayed the pocketbook impact of migration on americans communities instead they try to steer voters concerns towards subsidiary non economic issues such as migrant crime the border wall border chaos and drug smuggling the 50 economists letter was signed by a variety of academics and advocates including roughly 24 sociologists health experts and advocates

a developing system in the gulf the national hurricane center is currently watching a developing area of low pressure in the bay of campeche that will bring disturbed weather to the gulf coast states this week with heavy rain and gusty winds tracking a developing system in the gulf latest model runs continue to show a slow drift northward toward the coastal bend of texas areas of heavy rainfall and flash flood concerns can t be ruled out as this system moves through heavy rainfall potential in the gulf latest model runs suggest several inches of rain from the coastal bend of texas to louisiana as we head through the week ahead flash flood concerns can t be ruled out in some of the heaviest rain bands fall color tracker according to the mn dnr much of the state is already experiencing minor changes in the fall color keep in mind that much of the summer was hot and dry so some of the trees are a bit stressed and could be prematurely changing with that being said we are

be a bit more dull val cervenka coordinator from the dnr forest health program shares how the weather can play a roll in those fall colors due to the hot and dry summer that most of experienced it is likely that fall foliage could be less impressive this year with more tans bronzes and auburns typical peak dates for fall color according to the mn dnr fall colors typically start to peak across the northern part of the state in mid late september peak color typically arrives in central and southern minnesota late september and into early mid october note that over the next several weeks you ll

historic lows its causes are debated but the end result was millions of people losing their jobs as prospective consumers became far more reserved in their spending via britannica in america over 15 million people were unemployed facing starvation and homelessness for years other nations suffered through similar hardship with the people of germany and japan becoming desperate enough that they turned to the future axis leaders for salvation for rural america the situation initially might not have seemed like a major issue as they were responsible for supplying food to millions and had no

act like atmospheric mountains new turbulence model gives forecasters the jump in predicting severe storms last week the remnants of hurricane ida spawned tornadoes and high winds that tore across the northeastern united states destroying buildings and taking dozens of lives now scientists have identified a key feature of big storms that could make such extreme weather events easier to predict when most storms form they stay in the troposphere the layer of the atmosphere where the majority of our planet s weather takes place but occasionally they punch up into the stratosphere creating mountains of clouds that trail wispy formations called above anvil cirrus plumes aacps these high flying clouds have been linked to high winds hailstorms and tornadoes on the ground to find out why researchers combined lightning data radar and severe storm warnings to build a 3d visualization of aacps their model revealed that just like winds rushing over real mountains stratospheric winds rush over the high level clouds as if they were solid objects this generates powerful downward winds and turbulent events called hydraulic jumps they report today in science these plumed storms which can inject more than 7 tons of water per second into the normally dry stratosphere might also have an impact on our climate the researchers write because water vapor acts as a greenhouse gas once it enters the stratosphere it could lead to warming temperatures on earth which would in turn spur more supercell storms knowing how these storms work and when and where they occur could improve climate models and

a long line of people waiting to be fed in new york city during the great depression franklin d roosevelt library national archives and records administration the nature of work has undergone a lot of changes during the pandemic millions of office workers began working from home the service industry has struggled to get workers to come back and some businesses like kickstarter are now experimenting with four day workweeks without reducing salaries in congress rep mark takano d calif has introduced legislation to make a 32 hour workweek standard this great reassessment of labor feels revolutionary but we have been here before in 1933 the senate passed and president franklin roosevelt supported a bill to reduce the standard workweek to only 30 hours americans have worked hard perhaps too hard since the colonial era english and other european colonists often had to work longer and harder on farms here than in the old world and a philosophy of working from sunrise to sunset prevailed according to the economic history association the massachusetts colony even passed a law requiring a 10 hour minimum workday enslaved people whose labor profits were stolen generally worked 10 16 hours a day six days a week some studies estimate that when slavery ended the hours african americans spent working fell by 26 35 percent in the 1830s workers in manufacturing were on the job roughly 70 hours a week often in horrendous and even deadly conditions by the 1890s that had dropped to about 60 hours this period also saw the rise of labor unions the creation of labor day as a national holiday grand eight hours leagues and the motto eight hours for work eight hours for rest eight hours for what you will at that time what you will did not include saturday workweeks were generally six days with only sunday off the eight hour day picked up in popularity in the decades preceding the great depression federal workers railroad workers and ford motor co employees all moved to eight hour shifts ceo henry ford first instituted a six day 48 hour workweek for male factory workers in 1914 according to history com in 1926 a five day 40 hour workweek was extended to all employees along with a pay raise ford argued that his employees were more productive in fewer hours critics were skeptical they could be productive enough to make up the difference then came the stock market crash the great depression and record high unemployment after an underwhelming response from president herbert hoover he faced new york gov franklin roosevelt in the 1932 election shorter work hours was a major issue among voters and both candidates had ideas according to historian benjamin hunnicutt in his book work without end abandoning shorter hours for the right to work roosevelt a democrat pushed federal legislation to establish shorter work hours something he had already done at the state level in new york while hoover backed voluntary share the work drives the idea was that if workers had shorter hours no one would be unemployed even if everyone ended up making less money though unions were also pushing for a decent federal minimum wage after roosevelt won the election but before he took office sen hugo black d ala introduced a bill backed by the american federation of labor to temporarily shorten the workweek drastically to only 30 hours six hours a day five days a week for a while it had roosevelt s support and he began negotiating with business leaders behind closed doors if they would shorten the workweek to 30 hours voluntarily then he would go easy on antitrust reforms he said according to hunnicutt as soon as roosevelt took office on march 4 1933 he called congress into a special session what would become its most productive streak in history over the next 100 days roosevelt and his cabinet guided more than a dozen major bills through the house and senate stabilizing the banking system regulating wall street subsidizing farmers and getting relief checks into the hands of the unemployed amid this flurry on april 6 the senate passed black s 30 hour week bill 53 30 in a bipartisan vote supporters claimed it would create 6 million jobs the washington post reported it was expected to pass the house and secretary of labor frances perkins was publicly supportive business leader were up in arms instead of looking at the increase in leisure as inevitable or as potentially beneficial hunnicutt wrote they feared that if workers got a taste of a 30 hour week they would never want to go back and the law would become permanent men of industry held emergency meetings in chicago and philadelphia and perkins who also supported a federal minimum wage was flooded with messages of opposition meanwhile at the white house as roosevelt worked on a comprehensive recovery plan he began to turn against the 30 hour week what if rather than sharing available work there was just more work as the plan for a massive public works program took shape support for the 30 hour week collapsed instead roosevelt used the threat of it as leverage to get industry leaders to agree to ban child labor set a modest minimum wage and limit the standard workweek at 40 hours hunnicutt wrote the resulting national industrial recovery act was a triumph but one that didn t last two years later in may 1935 the supreme court declared it unconstitutional in a decision that so angered roosevelt he threatened to expand the court in 1938 the minimum wage 40 hour week and child labor ban returned in the form of the fair labor standards act this time perkins asked department of labor lawyers to draft a law that had a better chance of passing judicial scrutiny and they had another ace in their sleeve a few months earlier roosevelt had nominated his first justice for the supreme court he chose hugo black for decades the 40 hour week has endured but it didn t seem like it would in the beginning as joe pinsker of the atlantic pointed out in june many economists once assumed we would be working fewer than 40 hours by now in 1956 even then vice president richard nixon predicted a 32 hours four day workweek in the not too distant future it hasn t happened yet in fact in a 2014 gallup poll half of full time employed respondents reported working 41 hours or more per week 18 percent said they worked more than 60 only 8 percent said they worked 39 hours or less

this comes as a survey finds that nearly a third of americans would back the use of bitcoin as legal tender in the us a total of 27 of those polled by yougov support the idea of using bitcoin as payment for goods and services with 11 in strong support 34 responded in the don t know bracket while 39 oppose the idea a large number 44 of those respondents between the ages of 25 and 34 are in

halley at oanda noted that the bitcoin sell off occurred as soon as the move became official in el salvador coincidence possibly i suspect heavy long positioning and nerves once it dropped back through 50 000 00 are better reasons halley said in the spirit of tradeable versus investible assets though there is a huge difference i do not think bitcoin is out for the count yet bitcoin managed to close above its 200 dma at 45 930 00 on a daily basis this week despite the multi day waves of selling that suggests it still has the potential to rally above 50 000 00 once again however failure

jinping a white house statement said the two leaders discussed the responsibility of both nations to ensure competition does not veer into conflict russ mould investment director at aj bell said the fact the two parties are engaging is a positive and perhaps long overdue given this was only biden s second call with xi since coming into power markets will want to see a rebuilding of relationships

the nikkei up 1 3 investors are clearly hoping that better relationships between the us and china will be good for trade add in the fact that the european central bank didn t spook investors too much with its latest policy update reassurance that it will only slowly withdraw stimulus measures meant that markets are ending the week on a much brighter note there are still the headwinds of inflation

in theory be negative for gbp but doesn t seem to have had much impact so far said market analyst marshall gittler at bdswiss this is because many economists and analysts point out the uk economy is likely to already be bouncing back economist kitty ussher at the institute of directors says the final lifting of restrictions on 19 july led to an expansion in the entertainment sector but this was offset by a correction elsewhere from the partial ending of the stamp duty discount at the end of june going forwards we expect the economy to continue its upward trend the vaccine roll out has allowed schools to start the new term with less curbs on their activity there is every reason to think that the autumn will also be strong any shadows that do exist will now come from where

product shortages and spikes in infection rates running loose it s little surprise they dragged back uk economic recovery in july said susannah streeter senior investment and markets analyst at hargreaves lansdown flat services output for the first time since february was to blame in july said paul dales at capital economics not all of which is due to increased consumer caution due to the recent rise in virus cases as people flooded back to sports events theme parks and festivals but retail sales fell by 2 5 month on month and shortages were probably also to blame the gdp reading is

from 1661 until his death in 1715 louis xiv invested huge sums of money transforming the palace of versailles in france into a creation that commanded international admiration philip mansel considers the response of english visitors to this astonishing creation the number and fervour of english visitors to versailles challenges the legend of eternal rivalry between the two countries france and england were connected by many ties of commerce culture and taste and the journey from london to paris before the advent of the railways could take only two days despite frequent wars 1689 97 1702 13 1742 48 1756 63 1778 83 english men and women would be among the most honoured guests most admiring visitors and most fervent imitators of louis xiv s most magnificent and royal palace of versailles as the london gazette called it in 1687 the newspaper was in fact reporting on a model of the palace made in copper gilt over with silver and gold and of all the gardens and waterworks 24 foot in length and 18 in breadth that was being exhibited every day from dawn to dusk in exeter change in the strand for those able to travel versailles was as appealing as the louvre today as it held the best of the royal collections of pictures sculptures and works of art fig 1 in 1698 in one of many english books describing paris and versailles the english doctor martin lister praised versailles as the most magnificent of any in europe the esplanade towards the gardens and parterres are the noblest things that can be seen even the king s private apartments with his personal collections could be visited if the king was away and you had a letter of recommendation louis xiv had created versailles to impress europe as much as france recommended videos for you in 1701 another doctor john northleigh similarly praised versailles as the most beautiful palace in europe its roof glittering with gold affords a glorious prospect at a distance for statues canals groves grotto s fountains waterworks or what else may be thought delightful far surpasses anything to be seen of this kind in italy merchants were no less enthralled and sacheverell stevens after a visit in 1739 particularly praised the grand staircase destroyed in 1752 composed of the most beautiful marbles several copies were made of this celebrated interior including one in the early 20th century at oldway devon derived from engravings fig 3 stevens also praised the exceeding fine music and singing in the chapel only the furniture he considered much soiled far inferior to windsor hampton court or kensington writing a guide to the grand tour of which france was no less part than italy in 1749 thomas nugent called the palace of versailles one of the finest in all europe the great marble staircase surpasses anything in antiquity english visitors also admired versailles for the opportunities it provided to watch the royal family dine in public and attend mass in the royal chapel fig 7 also in 1749 a naval officer called augustus hervey despite having recently been fighting france wrote in his diary that he derived uninterrupted pleasure from watching the royal family s dinner following the royal hunt going to supper with french friends and admiring the fireworks at that pile of magnificence and grandeur versailles fig 5 he received such an idea of the grandeur of the french court that i had a very pitiful opinion of our own at saint james s nor have i ever altered my opinion though later so much in it and so long of it english enthusiasm for versailles suggests that the two nations shared taste for monarchy court life and entertainments could outweigh national antipathies lord chesterfield lord of the bedchamber to george ii considered a visit to versailles part of an education in 1751 he wrote to his son go to the king s and the dauphin s levees an hour at versailles compiegne or saint cloud is now worth more to you than three hours in your closet with the best books that ever were written other courts must form you for your own the frescoed enfilades of boughton blenheim and chatsworth often painted by the frenchman louis laguerre the gobelins tapestries ordered for goodwood newby osterley and other english houses and english patrons passion for french furniture french porcelain and french gardens before the era of capability brown prove the sincerity of their admiration for versailles fig 2 versailles s peak of popularity occurred during the festivities for the marriages of the grandchildren of louis xv between 1770 and 1775 having lost the seven years war the french court was determined to win the peace many english people crossed the channel to watch the fireworks and illuminations in the gardens of versailles fig 4 as well as the entertainments in the palace edmund burke later wrote a panegyric of marie antoinette based on his vision of her glittering like the morning star full of life and splendour and joy at her wedding in 1770 fig 8 another visitor the duchess of northumberland wrote in her journal that was admirably placed for seeing the ceremony in the chapel in the same place where the peeresses stood madame du barry herself lent the duchess her house in versailles and insisted on her sending to her stables kitchen and cellar as though they were my own louis xv ordered her a dish of coffee of his own roasting grinding and preparing versailles was the epitome of the opulence that the duchess tried to create in her own residences at alnwick syon and northumberland house the french courtiers clothes she found were excessively magnificent and the courtiers themselves very polite very civile to me cards in the galerie des glaces and a ball in the newly created opera hall in the north wing where operas are still performed today were really a fine sight such magnificence never before nor such crowds she also recorded louis xv s remark to the comte de saint florentin ministre de la maison du roi monsieur we are old but we have never seen so many people nor so much magnificence another visitor to the festivities dr jeans also praised their great order and regularity the great distinction with which foreigners were treated and the profusion of refreshments the music at mass was the finest i ever heard for mrs thrale a friend of dr johnson versailles and its furniture in 1775 surpassed anything she had seen for luxury splendour and beauty in 1776 thomas bentley a manufacturer of pottery was impressed by the palace the chapel the theatre the gallery the statues in the garden and again the public dinner their majesties talked and laughed much at dinner the queen is young and very handsome she appears to be extremely lively and gay without the forms and attentions that might be expected from her high rank after the french victory in the war of american independence the commercial treaty of 1786 was intended to start a new era between the two countries its negotiator william eden was invited to one of the power centres of versailles the salon of the duchesse de polignac gouvernante des enfants de france and favourite of the queen on the ground floor of versailles eden wrote in 1787 the evening assemblies at madame de polignac s were subjects of greater animadversion than all the extravagance of the court they were probably intended by the king and queen to enhance the court s role as a source of hospitality mixing foreigners and a large circle of courtiers of both sexes the queen conversed played at tric trac or billiards and often had a concert in which she stood as one of the singers and sometimes a small ball at which she danced few english visitors admired marie antoinette and versailles more than the whig leader the duke of devonshire and his wife georgiana they had met the polignacs at spa and become intimate friends despite the american war of independence more civilised than many contemporaries the duchesse de polignac hated war let us end this one i beg you she wrote in 1779 is it possible that two nations which respect each other suit each other seek each other out and love each other so much should have the rage to destroy each other in june and july 1789 as the monarchy collapsed before the revolutionary national assembly the devonshires were staying in paris and often visited versailles the apathetic duke came to life in versailles he likes versailles very much and feels himself quite at home in mme de polignac s room the duke likes it of all things and goes there thursday to be formally presented wrote the duchess of devonshire in the galerie des glaces on june 28 1789 on his way to mass the king stopped and spoke to bess and i a great deal he is less fat better looking and today was better drest than she expected like other english visitors despite their protestantism she was impressed by the chapel la messe du roi was amazing fine and inspired one i think with a great sensation of devotion the elevation of the host was accompanied by beautiful musick drums etc and very striking indeed their friend the queen received us very graciously indeed though very much out of spirit with the times she is sadly altered her belly quite big and no hair at all but she has still great eclat the couple finally left paris for brussels on july 12 missing the fall of the bastille by only two days during the revolution the devonshires would look after the polignacs grandchildren english enthusiasm for versailles suggests that the two nations shared taste for monarchy court life and entertainments could outweigh national antipathies francophilia could be as english as francophobia the most fervent of all english admirers of versailles would be a prince who never went there the future george iv he not only brought splendour back to the english court with the help of massive purchases of the works of art from versailles that still brighten windsor and buckingham palace today but also personally intervened in 1814 to support the deposition of napoleon and the restoration of his friend louis xvi s younger brother louis xviii as they bid farewell in a blaze of festivities in london on april 20 23 1814 louis xviii the regent and their ministers expressed the hope that henceforth peace and trade would unite the two nations indeed in the words of a spokesman for the corporation of the city of london in his congratulatory address to louis xviii france and england should remain so indissolubly allied by the relations of amity and concord as to ensure and perpetuate to both and to europe at large uninterrupted peace and repose for much of the 19th century that programme would be realised the last court ball at versailles would be given in august 1855 by napoleon iii in honour of a state visit by queen victoria confirming the alliance between the two countries unconsciously echoing previous english visitors she called the ball and supper in the opera house fig 6 one of the finest and most magnificent sights we have ever witnessed philip mansel s book king of the world the life of louis xiv is out now penguin 30

qi m a gay man after a decade together and five years of marriage my husband informed me he wasn t really interested in sex anymore that was a year ago and we haven t had sex since he told me i should leave him if regular sex was really that important to me but if i chose to stay i had to remain faithful to him that means me not having sex with anyone else i m 35 he s 38 and he doesn t see his unilateral decision to end our sex life as him breaking faith with me there s also the issue of financial dependance i am not dependent on him he is dependent on me i didn t want to abandon him during a pandemic while he s unemployed so i stayed now he tells me he s asexual and accuses me of being unsupportive of his sexual identity if i so much as mention missing sex to make a long story short three months ago i met a guy at work we re the only people on our floor currently coming into the office and we got to talking and it turned out he s bisexual and married but open i ve been blowing him a couple of times a week for the last two months he s close to my age and i really need this we aren t in the same department so i don t report to him and he doesn t report to me he doesn t reciprocate but i don t care i wasn t on grindr and didn t go looking for this do i need to feel bad about it cheating homo on knees eating dick aso your husband insists you honour the commitment you made to him not to have other sex partners but he s released himself from the commitment he made to you to be your sex partner and invited you to divorce him if you didn t like it and you didn t divorce him you stayed not because you wanna stay in this marriage and not because you re obligated to stay in this marriage to affirm his sexual identity but because he s unemployed and you don t wanna turn him out on the street during a pandemic ok this week on the lovecast have you ever lost a dildo up your butt you don t need to feel bad about this you don t need to feel bad about the dick you re eating at work and if you ve been reading my column for longer than a week choked you knew i was gonna say that so you wanted a permission slip and you ve got it signed and notarized and now if you stop giving those hot non recip blowjobs to the bisexual guy at the office i m gonna be pissed at you for wasting my time so don t let me down here choked keep eating that dick of course eating that dick isn t a long term solution to your problem but that dick will make your life more bearable in the near term it sounds like it has already but ultimately choked you re gonna have to counter your husband s ridiculous ultimatum with a perfectly reasonable ultimatum of your own he doesn t have to be sexual with you he never has to eat your dick ever again but he can t expect you to live a sexless life tell him you re gonna seek dick elsewhere and if he doesn t like it then he can leave qjust wanted to commend you for your advice to having a realistic discussion on needs in last week s column i say this as someone who recently went through a similar though blessedly temporary situation with my girlfriend the first time i lost my erection before i came i was a little bummed but my attitude was basically dang well at least i made her come my girlfriend however had a mild to moderate freak out was everything ok was she doing something wrong was i not attracted to her anymore like hardon s partner i also got in my own head and the same thing kept happening it got to the point where i was avoiding sex because i didn t want to deal with the crisis counselling session that would inevitably ensue if i couldn t come again after a few weeks of this i was finally able to get through to her that talking and obsessing about it was only making it worse she backed off i got to a point where i could relax again and it wasn t long before our happy healthy way hotter than you d expect from a couple of divorced 40 year olds sex life picked up where it left off as you implied to hardon sometimes you just need to stfu and hope for the best guys being who we are nothing sets our deep seated insecurities ablaze like being pestered about our dick problems no matter how well meaning and sincere the pesterer is we re kind of like toddlers who suffer a minor boo boo if we see you frantically running toward us waving your hands and asking what s wrong we re going to flip out but if you don t make a big deal out of it we won t either just wanted to share my straight dude perspective and thank you for your level headed response please end needless interrogations speedily athanks for sharing penis and while i sometimes feel like i should say everybody doesn t always need to come during sex i worry about some straight guys reading that and then giving even less of a shit about getting their female partners off than they already do i don t want to accidentally widen the orgasm gap while more than 95 percent of straight men self report that they always come during sex according to the archives of sexual behavior only 65 percent of straight women said the same we should all want our partners to get off and should make a good faith effort to get them off but we shouldn t make a huge deal out of it if our partner every once in a while for whatever reason doesn t get off qi just read your reply to hardon and i think you missed something i know i know who am i to tell you anything i m a mature woman who had a younger male lover for a while same scenario in that he was super fit had stamina was eager et cetera all was good except that he had to finish himself off with a hard and furious handjob every time i suggested that he go on a masturbation diet stop jerking off every day and when he did masturbate use props e g wrap a cloth around his hand grind against pillows fleshlight whatever he could think of because i had the idea that the intense and hard hold he used when masturbating was the culprit and i was vindicated it took a few patient tries but he got there someone in toronto athank you for sharing sit and i would ve addressed the issue you raised the issue you successfully addressed with your hot young man if hardon had mentioned something similar i e her boyfriend using what i ve long called the death grip to finish himself off dive into the savage love archives sit and you ll find tons of advice for guys who used the death grip during masturbation and then couldn t get off during partnered sex because the inside of a vagina a mouth or a butt doesn t feel like the inside of a bony clenched fist my advice for guys who suffer from death grip syndrome is the same as yours stop jacking off like that use a lighter touch get some lube and maybe a fleshlight and retrain the dick it doesn t work in all cases some guys can t come back for other guys that s just what their dick needs but i ve heard from plenty of men over the years who successfully retrained their dicks to my readers i had to file this column early due to the labour day holiday but i want you to know that i m furious about what happened in texas last week a law banning abortion went into effect and what didn t happen in the us supreme court the trump packed court didn t block that law from going into effect essentially nullifying roe v wade texas s new anti abortion law empowers individual citizens to sue anyone they suspect of having helped a woman get an abortion doctors clinic staffers parents anyone lend a friend some money to pay for an abortion you could be sued drive a friend to a clinic you could be sued if a lawsuit brought against you is successful you could be ordered to pay the person who sued you 10 000 and reimburse their legal expenses if you prevail in court you get nothing no damages none of your legal expenses reimbursed women still have a constitutional right to an abortion in the united states but abortion is effectively illegal now in texas and will be soon in other states as gop legislators and governors drive a truck through the hole the supreme court just ripped open in roe v wade my advice to women and men in texas stock up on morning after pills available over the counter for now and

dear editor the us and guyana have enjoyed friendly and cordial relations spanning many decades recently countries with which the us enjoy such relations have been asked to consider accepting refugees from afghanistan letters have appeared in the press for and against guyana s acceptance of afghani refugees there is a history to our country s role in this matter in 1934 the league of nations at the invitation of the british government appointed a commission to report on the possibility of settling a group of assyrians in british guiana s rupununi district the assyrians are the direct descendants of the ancient assyrian and babylonian empires because of their support to the allied forces of britain france and russia during the first world war the assyrians were deemed collaborators at the end of the war they were subjected to atrocities massacres and even denied their existence as a distinct ethnic group by some arab and turkish rulers they were subsequently chased from their homeland in exchange for their service to britain france and russia they were promised a safe and independent homeland in northern iraq that promise never materialized it was around that period that assyrian refugee migration began and continued up to the period leading up to world war two the commission established by the league of nations believed that assyrians should be able to maintain themselves in the rupununi district by subsistence farming in smallholdings coupled with stock grazing however the commission pointed out the lack of accurate knowledge of the agricultural possibilities of the savannahs and recommended investigation of the problems involved no developments followed on their report report of the mission of brigadier general j g browne and doctor guido renzo giglioli concerning the possibility of settling assyrians in britain guiana district of rupununi february 1935 in 1939 following nazi persecution of jews the british government made a tentative offer of land for the establishment of a jewish settlement in british guiana consequently in the same year a joint american british refugee commission was appointed by president roosevelt to investigate the possibilities of establishing jewish settlements in two areas one in the north west district and the other in the area between the essequibo and courantyne rivers south of 5 degrees north of latitude that commission found that these areas contained certain soils apparently suitable for permanent agriculture and natural resources for industrial development correlated with agriculture the commission found that both areas had a climate to which people of central europe should be able to adapt themselves they therefore recommended the founding of trial settlements of 3 000 5 000 persons in selected localities under properly equipped technical and advisory organizations and added that research and experiment should be directed at soil surveys and cognate matters arrangements were being discussed to send out an advance party of 200 refugees to establish a trial settlement when the outbreak of the war put an end to further action report of the british guiana refugee commission to the advisory committee on political refugees appointed by the president of the united states of america in 1974 information leaked by the international press revealed that the burnham government had agreed to establish a settlement for hmong refugees in guyana the hmong are an ethnic group of people who migrated from the southern provinces of china to the mountainous area of laos where they settled and engaged in subsistence farming during the 1960 to 1975 liberation war waged by the laotian patriotic forces hmong tribesmen were recruited as collaborators with cia operatives in their secret war in support of the royal lao government and against the pathet lao or laotian liberation forces the secret war eventually grew into the largest cia operation in history following the victory by the laotian liberation forces in 1975 the hmong were forced to flee laos thousands were accommodated in refugee camps in canada australia and europe approximately 260 000 were accepted by the us in recognition for the support they provided to the cia against the laotian people s struggle for national and social liberation the ppp opposed the settlement of hmong refugees in guyana on the ground that they would be used as they were in laos as an anti ppp force the government s plan was to establish hmong settlements in the waini yarakita area in the north west district close to the guyana venezuela border the plan was to use the hmong settlements as shields to prevent any encroachment by venezuela on guyana s national territory but the government s plan was aborted in 1980 following a national outcry led by the ppp about 2 500 hmong people eventually ended up in french guiana where they live in an isolated community producing fruit and vegetables in 1974 the burnham administration secretly granted permission to the people s temple led by jim jones a self proclaimed leader of a religious sect to establish a settlement of about 900 american citizens who were followers of jones the settlement was established on approximately 3 800 acres of forested land at port kaituma in the north west district some 650 miles or 240 km from georgetown once again the burnham administration chose for what became known as jonestown a location near guyana s border with venezuela the area venezuela describes as the zona de reclamacion according to burnham s calculations the people s temple settlement would act as a deterrent to any territorial expansionist ambitions by venezuela especially since it would be populated by hundreds of american citizens who the americans would seek to protect at any cost and who the venezuelans would hardly want to cause any harm following the overthrow in 1991 of jean bertrand aristide the democratically elected president of haiti thousands of haitians fled the country others who did not have the means to leave sought help from the us administration to accept them as refugees apart from sanctions on the coup makers the clinton administration sought the support of caricom member states to establish safe havens in their respective jurisdictions where haitian refugees would be accommodated on a temporary basis caricom governments did not find favour with the request guyana for its part was of the view that the answer was not to establish safe havens but to create the necessary internal and external conditions that would allow for the restoration of democracy in haiti and the re instatement of president aristide only one caricom member state agreed to establish a safe haven during the apnu afc coalition administration an unexpected and unexplained number of haitians began arriving in guyana no plausible explanation was offered by the government of guyana suspicions and speculations were rampant so much so that a predominant view was that the haitians were being registered to vote at the 2020 election according to government of guyana s data out of 42 000 haitians who entered guyana 2015 to 2021 only 3 913 can be accounted for several hundred haitians are spread across the country with many being employed in low paying jobs principally in private security services the new ppp c government has since backed away from visa free travel to guyana for haitian nationals and has imposed visa restrictions the political economic and social crisis in venezuela forced thousands of venezuelans to leave their country and head to other countries including neighboring guyana for a better life it is estimated that currently there are approximately 23 000 highly vulnerable venezuelan migrants and refugees who were granted stay permits across the ten administrative regions of the country only recently government announced the enrollment of 740 venezuelan children in public schools across the country the settlement of haitians and venezuelans in guyana was not the same in the case of the assyrians the jews the hmong nor the followers of jim jones in those cases it was a question of persecution racial and political discrimination coupled with calculated formal and conscious decisions by governments to transport and settle the assyrians the jews and the hmong in guyana in the case of the venezuelan and haitians it was more a question of economic hardships that forced the haitians to travel to guyana and for the venezuelans to cross the guyana venezuela border to seek refuge more as economic rather than political refugees from historical and contemporary experiences all things being equal it is clear that guyana has always been considered a favuorable location to house refugees and the settlement of migrants notwithstanding the fact that we are not a state party to the 1951 convention relating to the status of refugees nor its 1967 protocol sincerely clement j rohee former minister of foreign affairs
in a recent survey 23 of partnership members already required coronavirus vaccines for some or all employees and an additional 30 were considering doing so of the remaining 46 that were not most said they feared that some workers would quit rather than submit the president s blanket order applying to all companies with at least 100 employees eliminated that worry harvey said texas is a hotbed of resistance to pandemic health measures its vaccination performance 58 6 of those 12 and older are fully vaccinated trails the national average according to state and federal data employers in the houston area have been talking for weeks about what to do in response to the virulent delta strain of the coronavirus which has emptied workplaces and filled hospitals harvey said now they can get down to it the reality is there are a number of businesses that are wanting the government to step in this gives them the cover to do what they want to do anyway said charles shipan a political scientist at the university of michigan indeed the vocal republican opposition to the president s initiative threatens to leave the gop at odds with its traditional business constituency houston is a largely democratic city but harvey s group has members in 11 counties nine of which backed former president donald trump last year and includes numerous companies in traditionally conservative industries such as oil and banking among them exxonmobil chevron jpmorgan and wells fargo biden s new covid plan also drew backing from some national business groups such as the business roundtable the national association of manufacturers and the american apparel and footwear association and the president cited the example of several large companies that already require employees to be vaccinated including disney and united airlines and even fox news the cable network actually required employees to disclose their vaccination status not get vaccinated according to published reports we re going to reduce the spread of covid 19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across america biden said speaking in the state dining room the president said he was acting in part to protect the economic recovery in recent weeks the resurgent virus has drained momentum from industries that had been rebounding such as the airlines employers added just 235 000 jobs last month well below economists expectations and forecasts for september aren t much better in august the university of michigan consumer sentiment gauge fell to its lowest mark since the pandemic s initial weeks wholesale inflation on friday hit a new annual high of 8 3 and on wall street stock prices have drifted sideways for two months if the need for federal action last week seemed clear the response in some quarters to biden s announcement was hostile several republican governors including in texas georgia and south dakota vowed to fight the mandate in court south carolina gov henry mcmaster said biden and the democrats had declared war against capitalism and he pledged to fight them to the gates of hell to protect the liberty and livelihood of every south carolinian even before the president spoke on thursday afternoon the federalist a right wing publication assailed the vaccine and testing plan as a fascist move j d vance a republican senate candidate in ohio called for mass civil disobedience urging americans to refuse to comply with any new requirement or to pay any subsequent fine and josh mandel another senate aspirant in ohio warned that biden would use the gestapo to enforce his directive social media chatter about workers quitting their jobs rather than complying with the new federal mandate has left wall street economists unimpressed michael feroli of jpmorgan chase called it noise pointing out that employees who quit are not eligible for unemployment insurance jim o sullivan chief u s macro strategist for td securities said the option of weekly testing would offer vaccine skeptics an alternative thus minimizing any workforce loss and cautious service sector workers might be drawn back into the labor force if it appeared that more of their co workers were likely to be immunized he said biden s action is the latest in a long expansion of presidential involvement in business affairs from a laissez faire stance in the 19th and early 20th centuries washington responded to war and economic crises by increasing its sway over commercial activities numerous white house occupants have battled with powerful industries over their commercial practices president theodore roosevelt broke up john d rockefeller s standard oil trust president john f kennedy forced u s steel to roll back price increases at a time of incipient inflation president richard m nixon went farther in 1971 imposing economy wide wage and price controls yet biden s coronavirus plan tests the limits of presidential power according to shipan who has written on the subject the president is requiring employers to delve into employees personal medical practices not companies market behavior this is a break from what presidential power has done in the past said shipan that doesn t mean it s necessarily outside the boundaries of what presidents have the power to do biden has ordered the labor department to write an emergency rule requiring employers with more than 100 workers to demand weekly tests or proof of vaccination violations are punishable with fines up to 14 000 each up to 80 million americans could be covered by the action in 1970 congress gave the department s occupational safety and health administration osha authority to write regulations governing workplace safety including emergency standards that are valid for six months in june the agency issued an emergency rule to prevent the spread of coronavirus in health care settings but courts have fully or partially struck down five of the nine emergency rules osha has promulgated according to the congressional research service josh blackman a constitutional law specialist at the south texas college of law said biden was attempting to stretch a half century old law beyond what congress had intended osha regulations customarily deal with workplace conditions that directly affect employee health and well being such as the handling of hazardous chemicals slippery floors or dangerous stairs this is completely novel there s a credible argument it goes beyond the scope of delegated authority he said lawsuits will be filed and inevitably some judge will find this goes too far

have you ever given any thought to sending him on a trip to belize this was a line in breaking bad uttered by saul goodman in a conversation with walter white they were discussing options on how to handle hank who might have learned of walt s secret prior to this i had never heard of belize after the show ended i wouldn t hear of it again until the american rum geeks started raving about holmes cay s single cask bottling of belizean rum so just where and what is belize it s a caribbean country on the northeastern coast of central america bordering mexico and guatemala belize was were colonized by spain from 1506 to 1862 they became a british colony from 1862 to 1981 today s rum is from travellers liquors in belize there are three other rum distilleries in the country but so far all the belize rum bottled by indie bottlers are from travellers this is due to it being the only distillery that invests in longer aged rum the distillery is currently owned and run by the perdomo family but they weren t always distillers the perdomos only acquired the distillery in 1989 as a result of their father s hard work the patriarch jaime omario perdomo sr aka don omario worked different jobs such as a salesman for an importation company in 1953 jaime sr opened a bar in belize city called travellers he chose that name because most of his clientele were traveling to and from the city it was also mentioned in the rum cast interview with the perdomo family that the bar was located at the entrance of the city during those days it was common for the bars to buy rums from different distilleries and blend their own rum the blends would then be exclusive to those bars jaime sr eventually created an award winning one barrel rum this practice makes me think of the rum shop tradition in the caribbean i m also reminded of the origins of some scotch blends they buy blend and sell whisky under their own brand brands like doorly s and johnnie walker come to mind there was also mention of a lot of barbados rum being imported into belize during the 60 s as competition grew sourcing consistent quality of stocks became harder this made don omario look for an exclusive supplier it led to a partnership with luis alberto espat who agreed to build a distillery in belmopan capital city of belize in the 70 s don omario s sons romel and mayito came of age and joined the family business this led to a huge growth in the company in 1989 mr espat relinquished his shares of the distillery the perdomos bought them all in order to gain full control of the distillery from what i heard in the rum cast podcast a consultant recommended they use a baker s yeast from mexico they also have a three column still which they use to double distill their molasses based rum travellers has a local range of unaged and aged rum ranging from one to three and five years old the oldest distillery bottling they have is 15 year old aside from rum travellers makes and sells products like bitters liqueurs vodka brandy and wine sample x the subject of today s review is a collaboration between dutch indie bottler and importer kintra and rum mercenary kintra is more well known in the eu i haven t really seen their products in asia yet i only have a 30ml sample bottle of this sample x travellers the travellers distillery sample x single cask rum 13 years old review 61 8 abv 79 98 from zeewijck color honey on the nose a big punch of alcohol but not as big as the abv would suggest i get pronounced aromas of something that s like a mix between root beer cherry soda coca cola dates and cane syrup after these are medium aromas of bayleaf honey vanilla candied orange and coconut sugar syrup in the mouth hotter in the mouth but quickly dissipates at some sips the tastes of orange coconut sugar and vanilla are more upfront other times the root beer coca cola dates and cane syrup are more upfront but they come at the same intensity regardless of the order the medium intense tastes of coconut sugar syrup vanilla cherry soda caramelized orange oils dates and honey form up the rest of the body and finish conclusions i like this a lot i m pretty sure this is from a refill ex bourbon cask which makes it similar to other column distilled rum from the spanish speaking parts of the caribbean however i taste more of the distillate here than the cask i haven t had much rum from travellers liquors but i m confident that the distillery dna is pretty consistent it s different too that baker s yeast must do wonders for them my main issue is that it lacks complexity the flavors are solid there are no dull moments with this rum but it s pretty monotonous despite the rising fame and prices of rum i don t think this is worth being close to 80 i can get cheaper rum as good or even better than this i d score this higher if it were at least 15 cheaper score 6 10

the dictionary meaning of the word act is not to pretend or to play different characters or disguise oneself or emote but quite simply to do those who aren t aware of this and that includes an astonishing number of actors i have met will consider it paradoxical to talk of honesty in an activity that is naturally taken to be be an artifice yet even they will admit that the elusive quality of truth is the holy grail of every thinking actor s journey and of their own expectations from the actor before attempting to define what makes for truth in acting it is worth pondering whether there can be such a thing as a dishonest actor actors cannot plagiarise as writers or musicians can nor can someone else do the acting for them actors can and do mimic and steal ideas from each other as does any creative person but unless in their work they employ ideas from life as well the output will remain in the realm of mimicry or theft then there is no trick by which an actor can cheat and improve a bad performance the narcissistic grandstanding frequently resorted to by insecure film stars who believe that being one up on everyone else is a vindication of their own skill does not deserve to be included in any definition of acting honest or otherwise because considering oneself more important than the film though offensive is not dishonest it is indulgent the star does it because he can like the school bully good versus bad actors the one dishonest thing actors can do is to refuse through indolent unwillingness to live up to their potential such actors end up harming themselves and any job they are entrusted with the conclusion should not be drawn however that all actors are scrupulously honest in every way rather it should be said that neither the actor as against the star nor the work he is in stand to gain in any way by dishonesty lumping all actors into either the good or bad category is unjust in any case though doubtless there are some who should not be in the profession at all and even to call them bad would be a compliment but we shouldn t concern ourselves with those there are lethargic actors and industrious actors there are confident actors and anxious actors there are selfish actors and generous actors there are modest actors and showy actors there are enthusiastic actors and reluctant actors there are clever actors and plodding actors just as all these categories of people exist in any profession and indeed in the world anyone at any time can be transcendently wonderful or irredeemably rotten depending on many factors not necessarily talent or intentions alone but in our little pond an actor s punctuality and ability to speak on cue is enough to qualify him as good and being able to cry without the help of glycerine puts him in the league of great as if acquiring and nurturing the superficial qualities of an honest craftsman were an end in itself or an achievement of some kind a carrier of goods the title of the great dr shriram lagoo s autobiography lamaan the carrier of goods is the most apt and concise definition of an actor s job i have come across an actor is a messenger entrusted with conveying something without distorting or damaging it if he fulfills that condition one cannot be judgmental about the approach employed and label it as honest or otherwise in other words whether the goods are carried on the shoulder or the head or under the arm is immaterial provided they are delivered safely and in their completeness there is nothing remotely metaphysical about the craft of acting it is all hard work so is an honest actor one who without thinking of rewards goes against the grain in an effort to create something he considers significant or is it the dutiful one who expends conditioned reflexes and invests a minimum of himself or someone who makes a public display of worshipping the tools of his trade or one who tries to imbue his creation with beauty while retaining its functionality or is an honest craftsman one for whom creation is all i do not know and i cannot with any certainty claim to have the answers so i will dwell instead on what i feel is the responsibility of the actor what is possible for the actor to do and what is not can an actor better the role whether an actor acts merely to showcase his entertaining abilities or there is another less specious dimension to his work and whether an actor can be assessed independently of the quality of the work he chooses to do are questions that answer themselves the reason someone performs splendidly in one job and is disastrous in another is quite simply because his output being largely dependent on factors over which he has no control no actor can ever be better than the work he is in so does honesty mean submitting to the conditions he finds himself in or is an attempt to guide them the way he feels they should go the honest thing to do and is any perception regarding the integrity or otherwise of a person who is conveying another s ideas likely to be an objective one the assessment must hinge upon the actor s choice of work and the conviction with which he performs it but if the material is regressive and reactionary then is the actor s honesty to be judged by his mastery of craft or by his willingness to become a mouthpiece for such ideas emotional honesty crying is infectious just as laughter and yawning is and in any case the audience does not care whether the tears they see are real or glycerine induced thus the actor s emotional honesty is not easy to judge fake tears also produce an emotional resonance thus unabashed weeping always gets mistaken for good acting mr satyajit ray some 40 years ago expressed the utopian wish that our audiences should be more demanding if he were alive he would be deeply depressed to find our audiences today even more dumbed down and fully satisfied with the brain dead efforts that pass off as movies in our country the blame for that lies squarely with the very determined speculators who make these films and whose only purpose now openly acknowledged by the vulgar display of zeroes in the box office collections of films is to milk the audiences gullibility and forgiving nature and multiply their investments a hundred fold having managed to bring general tastes down to their own levels these charlatans would be hit by a crisis of cleopatrian proportions if the audiences one day realised that the recycled rubbish they have been happily swallowing no longer satisfies and began demanding fresh and original films however i daresay that too is utopian thinking so in all this where does an honest approach by the actor come in while everyone is busy worrying about the lowest common denominator isn t expecting the actor to be truthful kind of unfair in this kind of scenario would it not be honest if the actor simply took the money and ran or would it be honest to continue being taken to the cleaners by people making a different sort of film minimalist versus maximalist it has long been understood among the acting fraternity by the way that the term different sort of film is shorthand for you are not getting paid so is an honest actor one who foregoing the money continues all his life to hone his craft or should we call those guileless actors in robert bresson s films or the emotionally transparent renee jeanne falconetti of the passion of joan of arc or the people in bicycle thieves who had never acted before and never did again honest actors or is honesty what we witness in the acting required by bertolt brecht for his plays where characters are not played internally but consciously represented and can we dare say that the much larger than life performances in the kathakali or the kabuki theatre lack honesty play the passion of joan of arc 1928 the birth of stardom the most winning performances in film invariably come from children or animals neither of which species while acting have a clue as to what they are doing the performances are tricked out of them and yet they almost always appear natural so is that what honest acting is if one goes into its origins it is difficult to find a connection between what we understand as acting today and the ritual which according to a fascinating unproven but highly credible theory originated with primeval man s need to plan the hunt those attempts at conveying the same idea to everyone present by having people and animals mock killed would gradually out of necessity have started to include something of a dramatic and emotional element as well surely there were some who played the hunter or the hunted better than others so we could say that s when type casting and the concept of the stock character took root religious connotations and an awed reverence attached itself to the theatre centuries later when religion was being aggressively marketed and complex texts in order to be elucidated had to be enacted in temple theatres for the benefit of largely illiterate congregations when theatre moved out of the temples and acquired its own space actors must still have been judged by their ability to communicate not entertain thus the better communicators gradually acquired more celebrity and taking certain human characteristics for granted competitiveness certainly resulted actors pay packets one assumes then became proportionate to their ability to hold audience attention and thus was born the star waheeda rehman in guru dutt s pyaasa 1957 i hate you like i love you being the most visible component of this activity known as theatre it was the actor who became the face of it synonymous with it representative of it and unwittingly got held responsible for its quality as well even today it s mostly the actor who receives the encomiums or has to endure the taunts and not the people who are really responsible sometimes one hears the very same things said alternately about the same work because it is true that the audience s resentment against a love for actors in general does not always have to do with the quality of their work granted that in many cases the quality of the work is nothing to be proud of i am not referring only to the popular genre here very many films and plays masquerading as serious suffer massively from poorly etched and shoddily played characters as well and pre empting the nostalgic baloney of we made better films in the old days let s recognise that this dreadful acting and writing in our cinema is not a new phenomenon and the argument that this was the style of acting at that time is nonsense if this was indeed the style of acting then how on earth did some of the central actors achieve the refined cinematic restraint they did we don t need to have magnifying glasses on our noses to notice the vast gulf between the acting in our films and their films so let s just admit that it was and is the sensibility which controls the making of most movies in our country that is responsible for our by and large shoddy output iconoclastic as it may sound it has to be said that even some of our wonderful filmic works do bigha zamin kabuliwala and pyaasa contain some performances that are on the verge of grotesque these films were made at the same time or even later than bicycle thieves citizen kane and rashomon i need hardly issue a testimonial to the level of performance achieved by the actors in the latter three play toshiro mifune we are just in the habit of keeping our heroes on pedestals they ve gotten lonely up there it s time we got to know them for what they truly were and started to learn from their strengths and their weaknesses instead of just wallowing in reflected glory and continuing to stoutly defend even their flaws maybe that way instead of just worshipping them we can begin to engage and even prevent the pigeons from defecating on their heads or at least wipe it off when it happens but let us not prostrate ourselves without learning the right things from them the influence of early theatre a casual glance at the history of filmmaking in india informs us that the first ones to venture into it were bengali maharashtrian and parsi entrepreneurs all three communities with more than a passing acquaintance with the theatre most of the earliest male stars in these silent ventures were light eyed maharashtrian or fair complexioned parsi gentlemen whose possibly aryan or caucasian antecedents helped them pass off as western looking cinema then being considered a western medium we had embraced on the distaff side there were naturally european or fair complexioned saraswat brahmin ladies a woman performing on stage was by then no longer taboo in maharashtra our earliest cinema was an amalgam of myth and western films then came the talkies and the large scale plundering of theatre precious little of which was original in the first place began despite the fever of aspiring to be white in every way being then at its zenith what we neglected to borrow from the west was an indigenous form for making films something which despite the efforts of an intrepid few we have still not really achieved instead of treating cinema as a new medium with new rules a different aesthetic and different possibilities we resorted from the beginning to what was immediately available the folk theatre the parsi theatre the nautanki and of course mythology which lent itself wonderfully to cinematic illusion despite the over the top acting melodramatic presentation and emphasis on music and choreography it would be difficult to distinguish those early films from theatre performances filmed around the same time in fact some of them were filmed plays little did anyone suspect that these pioneering efforts were not only creating what would become over 100 years as we keep tom tomming an irreversible cinema language but an incurable malaise besetting our films even today play bicycle thieves 1948 stuck in a moment what the early talkies also did was suck out from the urdu theatre all the talent that had kept it alive no one from the theatre whether actor singer writer dancer musician poet choreographer or set designer could resist the lure of better money and bigger audiences they all got drawn into the cinema bringing with them sensibilities marinated in mythology or plagiarised william shakespeare or musical melodrama or broad comedy of the folk theatre or arabian nights fantasies all this was completely at variance with what was to become the nature of cinema all over the world in the future but we started with it and remained stuck with it because it kept the audiences on familiar ground the advent of talking pictures in the 1930s caused theatre audiences to flock to the cinema instead filmmakers made sure bums stayed on seats by peddling them stuff as close as possible to what they saw in the theatre the rest were fed a steady diet of mythological fare or action films inspired by the west if such was the setting against which our films started being made what was to be expected from the actors but that they should thoroughly conform the era of the talkies spelt the end of the road for the parsi european maharashtrian stars who were unable to handle urdu in which language many of the films then not surprisingly were being made and speaking which had become de rigueur for film actors it was also a time when there was no animosity between hindi and urdu nor was urdu considered a muslim language and hindi a hindu one but that is another story the importance of writers the quantum leap that occurred in film acting in the usa in the 1950s was made possible by the tradition of writing passed on by people like eugene o neill and clifford odets to the arthur millers and edward albees by the perceptiveness of directors like elia kazan frank capra and billy wilder and strange as it may sound by tv which apart from its usual confection brought interviews real life happenings conversations arguments right into bedrooms the difference between false and truthful behavior became apparent when real incidents began to be viewed in a frame just like a film this had to have a huge impact on the future of acting and writing in that country that many of the more celebrated actors of the naturalist school became known and delivered arguably the finest performances of their careers in 1950s american cinema was a lucky coincidence the actors do not deserve sole credit they got to work with written material that blended with and embellished their psychologically driven style of acting they were directed by people to whom form in presentation mattered as much as the dynamics that go into creating a moment of performance truth those actors for all their originality would have been ineffective had they to engage with inferior writing or faulty guidance play billy wilder s sunset boulevard 1950 the need to communicate which many writers not only american but in europe as well seemed to feel strongly at that time blended with technical wizardry and authentic skill to generate a creative energy resulting in significant innovations in the writing and creating of both their plays and films and the acting in them we in india long after the arrival of tv are still regurgitating centuries old fables the viewers ability to distinguish instead of getting sharper is blurring a real life calamity is observed with more impassivity than a bollywood film values that need to be vehemently opposed are being reinforced and a style of writing and acting that should be defunct is being celebrated we just can t seem to break free of the proscenium tradition and the theatre as illusion conviction in both our theatre and cinema the mystery of the missing c while the output of a screenplay writer is often guided by external factors the reason for such sparse writing by competent playwrights in india is puzzling the total number of performable new plays in any language except marathi and perhaps kannada escape notice the past efforts of badal sircar in bengal or vijay tendulkar and satish alekar in maharashtra or girish karnad in karnataka notwithstanding there are very few others willing or capable enough to follow their example actors therefore have a hobson s choice of either working in plays written by people who would rather write films and end up writing neither or working in films written by writers who look down on the theatre and wish to write bigger films most modern indian plays have a tendency to turn incomprehensibly arcane a la the european absurdists of the 1950s 1970s our films adhere unabashedly to formulae which were already fossilised when used by the 19th century playwrights betab ahsan and agha hashr all of whose writing was scrawled in greasepaint as zia mohyedin puts it in his wonderfully concise book theatrics these plays were heightened melodramatic pieces with crude appeals to the emotions and usually a happy ending actors were not afraid to project themselves there was no mumbling no attempt at psychological probing actors acted to the hilt and nobody called them hams the word had not arrived yet the conventions of melodrama were rigorously followed disguised husbands remain unrecognized by their wives reprobate heroes repent in the end characters burst into song every now and then villains always meet their comeuppance the theatre in which hashr s capabilities were sharpened grew almost entirely in imitation of the decadent victorian theatre of the mid nineteenth century the difference being that in the west by the close of that century the theatrical theatre found itself embattled by the theatre of ideas whereas the spectacular urdu theatre in bombay had no such challenge to contend with it is ironic that when the urdu theatre was wallowing in the bombast and bluster of ruritanian surroundings moscow was producing seagull this analogy applies perfectly to the once and future state of filmmaking in our country the poor quality of acting in our films and theatre is a reflection of the quality of the writing and the vision determining it where is an actor to search for truth when smothered on all sides by falseness konstantin stanislavski s experiments themselves would have perhaps yielded no result had anton chekov not been around to distill that vision into the right words some of marlon brando s later films give us an idea what kind of actor he might have been had he started with bedroom comedies instead of engaging with tennessee williams and elia kazan would toshiro mifune have been the same actor he was without akira kurosawa or klaus kinski without werner herzog or soumitra chatterjee without satyajit ray or waheeda rehman without guru dutt a couple of final questions which bother me quite a bit is it not a shame that the capability of marathi theatre giants shriram lagoo and nilu phule will in the future be assessed only by the films they acted in most of which were thoroughly unworthy of them and should the great utpal dutt despite his prolific and committed theatre output be labelled as not honest simply because he simultaneously also chose to act in some of the worst films ever made there are many other examples but i leave these questions hanging in the air and rest my case this essay was delivered

every month in each category but do not think that having a budget means you have to give up your hobbies or your little quirks more on this later cnbc reported in july that credit card debt among americans is rising as the savings rate spiked to a level not seen since world war ii this caused consumers to take the cash they had and pay down debt and often the first kind of debt they paid down was cards which have among the highest interest rates averaging 16 so to avoid losing a good chunk of your pandemic savings to credit card debt you should do your best to avoid this type of debt at all credit cards have high interest rates and low minimum payments and they are usually used to buy depreciating assets investopedia s list of six major credit card mistakes includes only paying the minimum balance using this product to buy everyday items and pay medical bills and taking cash advances so acquiring credit card debt is a no go if you want to live on 35 000 a year a high car payment is always linked to a new car according to data by experian the average monthly loan payment for a new car in the u s is approaching 600 which certainly is more than 20 of your 35 000 a year s monthly income amid the pandemic even loans for used vehicles have hit record highs with monthly payments soaring from 18 to 413 averaging 400 for the first time this is due to the increase in car prices amid the global chip shortage if you still find that a car is necessary do your research on different financing options to avoid relying on car dealership financing alone also be wise when choosing car insurance also extras will significantly raise the price of a vehicle and be foxy enough to haggle with the dealer to lower the price in covid times food delivery skyrocketed especially during lockdowns statista reports that in 2020 instacart went from getting 820 000 orders in february to 9 14 million in april this only goes to show how food delivery became a comforting proxy which in turn increased spending in this rubric still to live on 35 000 a year you must curb your restaurant spending without depriving yourself too much this means decreasing frequency but also applying some tips that will help you tail off the costs many people are not aware of the specials that food establishments often offer not considering the special of the day or the special of the week is a costly mistake so pay attention to the menu these deals are often offered at a significant discount or spread out in large portions to satisfy more than one member of the group keeping a list of bargains offered at popular restaurants and then consulting the list when deciding to go out is a good habit to develop also being attentive to social networks will keep you informed and updated about the specials of your favorite restaurants there is absolutely no doubt that consumer spending plunged during the darkest days of the pandemic and then bounced back in q2 2021 according to mckinsey consumers pent up demand and willingness to spend in some discretionary categories caused spending to grow at 20 to 30 percent year over year reaching 4 to 7 above pre covid 19 levels so those who aim at living on 35 000 a year must be careful of not overindulging in unnecessary spending especially in luxury consumer goods like smartphones laptops sound devices and more if you feel you need to overhaul your closet start by selling what you do not wear also off season shopping is a budget friendly habit as it is buying from thrifty stores looking for coupons online and shopping online for clearance sales it is to some extent a controversial saying but it holds truth when it comes down to living on 35 000 a year sacrifice the present for the future and dream big not everybody is willing to do so but under this scheme you can reap the benefits of a solid financial future this does not mean to live oblivious to the present moment in terms of leisure and having fun but to carefully move around financially with purpose and aplomb nathan w morris personal finance expert and author of your 33 day money action plan says the speed of your success is limited only by your dedication and what you re willing to sacrifice living on 35 000 a year will help you gain control of your personal finances and branch out into passive income investments and pursuing side projects to make some extra cash which can give you the chance to save cash one rule of thumb is the 50 30 20 model according to this your needs wants and savings should represent that proportion respectively as an example your 35 000 a year income represents a 2 300 take home pay without factoring any further deductions this way 50 of such payments should cover your home needs 30 would go to things you want and the remaining 20 would be to save some cash with pen and paper or with the use of any of the available budgeting apps you make a list of all your sources of income including every paycheck regular side house and also income from investment then create a list of all your expenses starting with the big sums like rent and car payments down to transportation utilities groceries and any debt payments the next budget allocation is for the things you might want clothes eating out and entertainment and finally cash for some savings cnbc s robert exley jr writes treating yourself is great but you want to do it within your budget don t be discouraged if your finances don t add up at first the more you track your spending and keep an eye on it the better you ll be at homing in on your expenses it is also important to keeping electronic records as this would help tracking your budget and expenses and feel free to use apps that link credit and debit cards to the budget so you keep your cash within limits money can be tight even if you re doing everything right but the best way not to be scared is to be prepared and a budget is your first step when living on such salary it is possible to make some extra bucks if you make your money work for you this is one of the most important personal finance pieces of advice there are many ways to do this so you can generate solid passive income to also save money for a start you can open a high yield savings bank account high yield checking and saving offer interest rates that exceed 1 100 times what you d get otherwise says business insider if you can do this on an online bank it would be much better as they offer lower costs by ridding brick and mortar premises retirement accounts are another solid alternative sean gould wealth strategist at waddell and associates says the key is to get money in a 401 k save as much as possible to have your money work for you tax efficiently and to get money in the markets the first bucket outside of the emergency fund is the 401 k up to the match you don t want to give away free money some extra cash can be gained through investments able to generate passive income people like the comfort of money in cash because they re burned from 2008 and 2009 but inflation will eat away at your cash gould says the reality is that investing in the market or in real estate is a great move since you can make money while your sleep regarding market investments it is important that you be patient since as business insider says pulling money in and out to take advantage of favorable fluctuations and minimize the loss when the market dips is a strategy most experts advise against on the other hand investing in real estate is certainly an option under the right conditions since housing as previous crises can reveal is not a warranty commercial real estate could be a good a suitable move but always bearing in mind a diversified portfolio in terms of assets there are further options like cd ladders and annuities and even selling items online like ebooks creating online courses on e learning platforms and selling stock photos you do not have to confine your skills to your current job as you always have the chance to make some extra money in other ventures not only there is a financial benefit to it but you can pursue a passion that you cannot explore that much given your job related duties still side hustling should be done right before launching into a new job you must evaluate your skills writing photography or playing an instrument and see which of them can generate extra income besides e commerce undertakings are a good alternative since the business has grown exponentially given the pandemic if you are crafty consider selling your products on etsy if you enjoy refurbishing products such as furniture or technological products you might sell these on various niche websites advises the balance careers becoming a part time realtor in the real estate business is also a good option as you can exercise your time management skills while starting a new revenue stream the convert units website has come up with a very thorough answer to this question exploring a wide variety of scenarios out of 50 full time working weeks in a year and an unpaid 2 week vacation time there are 2 000 working hours with a 35 000 annual salary the math says you make 17 5 per hour in the same scenario with no vacation time taken or a 2 week paid vacation the hourly salary would equal 16 83 per hour now in a full time job done every working day no weekend overtime and a total of 2 088 working hours in the whole of 2021 you would be making 16 76 per hour in a full time position bi weekly payment with no overtime and 40 hours per week you would receive 26 paychecks of 1 356 15 depending again on the contractual conditions with your employer you can use salary calculators online to get more detailed information according to estimates a 35 000 a year salary with an interest rate of 3 75 and a loan term of 30 years plus annual property taxes of 1 400 and a monthly debt payment of 300 you could afford a house worth 134 534 there are several websites that can help you calculate this within the middle class there is no doubt that less than 40 100 a year is considered low income middle income ranges between 41 000 and 120 000 and upper income is anything above 120 000 annually according to a pew research disclosed in december 2020 extrapolating the data to social class groups 35 000 is considered lower middle class still there are other valuables to factor in such as education location and family history to define social class when compared against the 7 25 per hour minimum wage in the u s the 16 83 per hour out of 35 000 annually is certainly twice a good salary still as reported by the how to fire website which quotes the bureau of labor statistics the average american makes 865 a week working full time that comes out to 44 980 per year if you re making 35 000 you are below the average american depending on your financial goals you may or may not consider adding additional streams of income although it might seem like a tough endeavor living on this wage and being able to cover needs health insurance car insurance monthly bills phone bill and student loan payments wants and also save a few dollars is possible not so much so if you tend to waste money for which you would have to keep your splurges in check to remain whenever possible debt free if you need more money you can always find another string to your bow through passive income investments or side hustling but the key is to figure out a budget that will allow for a decent standard of living at a much lower income and for this a whole different approach to financial planning and budget management skills is required
market starts a correction right on cue as however in the meantime the stairstep advance continues with fundamentally weak companies making substantial gains as speculation displaces investment in the market thus while prices remain elevated money flows weaken suggesting the next downturn is roughly one to two weeks away so far those corrections remain limited to the 50 dma which is approximately 3 lower than friday s close but a 10 correction to the 200 dma remains a possibility that correction started on monday with the week ending in 5 straight down days for the which is the worst slide since february however while that sounds terrible the total decline for the week was just 1 69 yes that s it less than 2 while cnbc probably ran their markets in turmoil segment traders were huddled over candles and incense chanting incantations at the fed for more accommodation with sell signals in place volume rising and breadth weak for a retest of the 50 dma early next week will not be a surprise the question will be whether traders show up again as they have done every other time over the last 6 months to buy the dip as shown the market remains well confined to its rising trend with support sitting at the 50 dma did pick up late last week as volume spiked suggesting more selling pressure on monday the question is this time different will the market hold the 50 dma again or has the risk of a more substantial correction finally caught up with investors as noted previously 5 10 corrections are absolutely normal in any given market year however if you didn t like the 1 69 correction this past week a 10 correction will feel like an all out crash such is why we have repeatedly suggested taking some actions in advance macro conditions continue to deteriorate over the last couple of weeks i noted the deterioration of underlying market conditions weakening breadth lower participation and negative divergences all suggest risks of a correction on thursday sentiment trader provided some additional commentary supporting our concern to differentiate temporary slowdowns from real problems we look for significant macro deterioration the macro index model combines 11 diverse indicators to determine the state of the u s economy stock market investors should be bullish when the macro index is above 0 7 and bearish when below or equal to 0 7 once the final reports were in for august the model plunged below 46 the 2nd lowest reading of the past decade at the same time sentiment trader noted their bear market probability indicator also jumped this model has 5 inputs namely the index and valuations the higher the score the higher the probability of a bear market in the months ahead last may the model was in the bottom 10 of all months since 1950 this month it jumped into the top 10 of all months so what does all of this mean according to sentiment trader the combination of these two measures should not be overlooked to wit the chart below shows the spread between the bear market probability and macro index models the higher the spread the higher the probability of a bear market the chart shows that the s p 500 s annualized return is a horrid 17 6 when the spread is above 20 like it is now the point here is that while the market remains exceedingly bullish there are signs of trouble brewing beneath the surface such is why we suggested raising cash levels adding non correlated assets and reducing overall risk but as paul harvey used to say there is more to this story investor record allocations as noted there is certainly cause for concern however investors aren t such should be of no surprise after an extended bull market advance with very low volatility without any concern for corrections individuals have increased equity risk levels relative to their overall net worth or we see the same when we analyze their equity allocations as a percentage of their overall financial assets regardless of the calculations the message is the same as we noted in thursday s states the public buys the most at the top and least at the bottom the two charts above speak volumes as to the wisdom of bob farrell s rules previous peaks in equity ownership have corresponded with peaks in financial markets as the old wall street axiom states if everyone has already bought who is left to buy at the moment however investors are incredibly confident that markets can only go higher as long as the fed remains accommodative while there is undoubtedly a substantial argument as to the ability of the fed to keep markets inflated there are other risks present that could lead to a short term correction an increasing number of correction warnings while investors are carrying record allocations some of the largest wall street banks are worrying a recent article on zero hedge compiled their outlooks to wit andrew sheets warns that equity market internals has continued to follow a midcycle transition that process usually ends with quality stocks like the faamgs getting hit and poses an outsized risk to the s p 500 through october morgan stanley suvita subramanian warned that downside risks remain and asking what good news is left sentiment is all but euphoric with our sell side indicator see ssi closer to a sell signal than at any point since 2007 bank of america deutsche bank s strategists expect an imminent correction even though they see the s p 500 rising back around current levels by year end some more details on the coming pullback in markets which db believes will see the s p drop 6 10 christian mueller glissmann stated that high valuations have increased market fragility if there is a new negative development it could generate growth shocks that lead to rapid de risking as such there is very little buffer left if you get large negative surprises goldman sachs you get the idea between the leverage in the market economic growth slowing and rising inflationary pressures numerous issues could disrupt the high levels of market complacency the bullish argument is that such a correction will force the fed s hand as zerohedge aptly concluded even the smallest market hiccup will prompt a furious response at the marriner eccles building because we are now well beyond the point of no return and jerome powell and company simply can not afford even the smallest drop in stocks without risking a full blown market meltdown much to the chagrin of the banks above who are predicting just that beige book reveals the fed s biggest problem the most significant risk for the market is a change in investor psychology as long as nothing disrupts that bullish bias investors will continue to aggressively buy dips however that psychology is directly linked to the fed s ongoing balance sheet expansion thus the potential problem for investors is inflation the fed s is a summary of economic conditions in the 12 federal reserve districts boston inability to get supplies and to hire

amid widespread labor and supply chain shortages san francisco hiring activity intensified further as did upward pressures on wages and inflation inflation is becoming problematic for the fed mainly if these pressures are not as transient as hoped higher wages are corrosive to both earnings and margins as shown below strongly rising producer prices are initially good for profit margins until inflation can not get passed along to consumers such is the case currently with the most significant historical spread between and cpi with supply chain disruptions looking to last longer than expected the fed is trapped between supporting a slowing economy and fighting inflation it s a battle they are likely going to lose no matter what they choose as noted above market action became sloppier past this week over the last few weeks we discussed that stock selection was essential to portfolio performance as breadth continues to narrow in the market this past week was not much different the question is now whether the previous leaders will become laggards such could suggest more trouble overall for markets in the meantime equity allocations remain underweight we have increased the bond portfolio duration closer in alignment with our benchmark as we continue to look for lower rates as economic growth slows cash remains roughly 10 of our equity allocations as a risk hedge for now as noted above there is a reasonable possibility the market stalls at current levels and works off some of the overbought conditions there is also a more than a possible risk of a correction between 5 and 10 however i don t know which it will be until we start seeing definite signs of the market breaking down at that point it will be too late to make adjustments such is why as we have stated previously this is an opportune time to get in front of risk by taking some simplistic actions tighten up stop loss levels to current support levels for each position hedge portfolios against major market declines cash non correlated assets direct hedges take profits in positions that have been big winners sell laggards and losers raise cash and rebalance portfolios to target weightings these actions will not protect you from a decline they will however lessen the blow and allow you to rebalance risk accordingly where they become present or you can do nothing and hope for the best it s your choice

fashion plc lon jd and monster beverage corp nasdaq mnst those who invested in these companies during their trading days could have accrued substantial profit penny stocks are generally highly volatile and riskier but still represent the possibility of significant growth the appeal of a penny stock is easy to see as if you have 1 000 to invest in the stock market you can get a considerably higher percentage of shares in a smaller company whose shares trade for a few cents rather than buying blue chip shares which can cost significantly more for an extremely small percentage of ownership of course if a penny stock becomes a blue chip you could end up making big profits with the right trading strategy many pharmaceutical stocks that were considered small have reached blue chip level

outperforming the s p 500 index by over 5 one of the key factors to invest in penny stock is to evaluate a company s prospects thinking what could go wrong before investing will give you an idea of what are the macro or internal issues that will affect the company s ability to grow in the long term product viability is one key aspect in terms of what could happen if an important patent expires how could the firm react to a competitor launching a more innovative product the more viable a product is the better chances of good long term growth and short term stock performance although product viability will let you gauge a company s potential for growth this is a metric that should be considered on its own within this aspect potential investors should evaluate the firm s business model business strategy and the actions and reputation of the ceo any of these three elements should be unique difficult to imitate or equal and should have a direct impact on the brand s value other aspects to consider are the firm s ability to innovate research and operational excellence the harder it is for competitors to breach the company s moat the stronger the competitive advantage a firm s balance sheet is essential to look at before investing assets could increase the value of an organization over time while liabilities are debts that must be paid or goods and services obligations that must be fulfilled the strength of a company s balance sheet can be evaluated by three broad categories of investment quality measurements working capital or short term liquidity asset performance and capitalization structure according to investopedia in this regard you must do your research and evaluate the best balance sheet among your short listed organizations yes liquidity matters according to fs investments liquidity is the ease with which an investment can be bought or sold without significantly impacting the price of the security in this regard those stocks that can be either bought or sold effortlessly are said to be liquid while the opposite means they are illiquid in this regard private debt and private equity classes usually have fewer buyers and sellers than more liquid investments and tend to lack standardized terms making it harder for investors to quickly analyze value and in turn buy or sell them this is the golden rule for any stock under 10 cents and any stock in general this rule is applied by people who are in the financial education world and basically means apart from the literal if you are not willing to lose anything do not invest industry reports breaking news and any piece of information you can gather before investing in penny stocks is essential still it is widely assumed that good data on economic growth or job creation are positive for stocks but the price reaction will depend on the particular context when traders are concerned about a possible rise in interest rates they may prefer these figures to be moderate rather than show great strength be careful of using news too simplistically in many cases making a correct reading of certain news is more complex than thought and requires an extra vision of the market context at times prices increase simply because they are fashionable or because of future expectations with no real fundamentals euphoria causes you to buy based solely on the fact that the asset s price is low or to sell because the price is high without thinking that the low price can lead to even lower prices or higher prices can become even higher several otc listed penny stocks are endorsed as the next

what are the macro or internal issues that will affect the company s ability to grow in the long term product viability is one key aspect in terms of what could happen if an important patent expires how could the firm react to a competitor launching a more innovative product the more viable a product is the better chances of good long term growth and short term stock performance although product viability will let you gauge a company s potential for growth this is a metric that should be considered on its own within this aspect potential investors should evaluate the firm s business model business strategy and the actions and reputation of the ceo any of these three elements should be unique difficult to imitate or equal and should have a direct impact on the brand s value other aspects to consider are the firm s ability to innovate research and operational excellence the harder it is for competitors to breach the company s moat the stronger the competitive advantage a firm s balance sheet is essential to look at before investing assets could increase the value of an organization over time while liabilities are debts that must be paid or goods and services obligations that must be fulfilled the strength of a company s balance sheet can be evaluated by three broad categories of investment quality measurements working capital or short term liquidity asset performance and capitalization structure according to investopedia in this regard you must do your research and evaluate the best balance sheet among your short listed organizations yes liquidity matters according to fs investments liquidity is the ease with which an investment can be bought or sold without significantly impacting the price of the security in this regard those stocks that can be either bought or sold effortlessly are said to be liquid while the opposite means they are illiquid in this regard private debt and private equity classes usually have fewer buyers and sellers than more liquid investments and tend to lack standardized terms making it harder for investors to quickly analyze value and in turn buy or sell them this is the golden rule for any stock under 10 cents and any stock in general this rule is applied by people who are in the financial education world and basically means apart from the literal if you are not willing to lose anything do not invest industry reports breaking news and any piece of information you can gather before investing in penny stocks is essential still it is widely assumed that good data on economic growth or job creation are positive for stocks but the price reaction will depend on the particular context when traders are concerned about a possible rise in interest rates they may prefer these figures to be moderate rather than show great strength be careful of using news too simplistically in many cases making a correct reading of certain news is more complex than thought and requires an extra vision of the market context at times prices increase simply because they are fashionable or because of future expectations with no real fundamentals euphoria causes you to buy based solely on the fact that the asset s price is low or to sell because the price is high without thinking that the low price can lead to even lower prices or higher prices can become even higher several otc listed penny stocks are endorsed as the next

lockdowns statista reports that in 2020 instacart went from getting 820 000 orders in february to 9 14 million in april this only goes to show how food delivery became a comforting proxy which in turn increased spending in this rubric still to live on 35 000 a year you must curb your restaurant spending without depriving yourself too much this means decreasing frequency but also applying some tips that will help you tail off the costs many people are not aware of the specials that food establishments often offer not considering the special of the day or the special of the week is a costly mistake so pay attention to the menu these deals are often offered at a significant discount or spread out in large portions to satisfy more than one member of the group keeping a list of bargains offered at popular restaurants and then consulting the list when deciding to go out is a good habit to develop also being attentive to social networks will keep you informed and updated about the

at living on 35 000 a year must be careful of not overindulging in unnecessary spending especially in luxury consumer goods like smartphones laptops sound devices and more if you feel you need to

what you re willing to sacrifice living on 35 000 a year will help you gain control of your personal finances and branch out into passive income investments and pursuing side projects to make some extra cash which can give you the chance to save cash one rule of thumb is the 50 30 20 model according to this your needs wants and savings should represent that proportion respectively as an example your 35 000 a year income represents a 2 300 take home pay without factoring any further deductions this way 50 of such payments should cover your home needs 30 would go to things you want and the remaining 20 would be to save some cash with pen and paper or with the use of any of the available budgeting apps you make a list of all your sources of income including every paycheck regular side house and also income from investment then create a list of all your expenses starting with the big sums like rent and car payments down to transportation utilities groceries and any debt payments the next budget allocation is for the things you might want clothes eating out and entertainment and finally cash for some savings cnbc s robert exley jr writes treating yourself is great but you want to do it within your budget don t be discouraged if your finances don t add up at first the more you track your spending and keep an eye on it the better you ll be at homing in on your expenses it is

can reveal is not a warranty commercial real estate could be a good a suitable move but always bearing in mind a diversified portfolio in terms of assets there are further options like cd ladders and annuities and even selling items online like ebooks creating online courses on e learning platforms and selling stock photos you do not have to confine your skills to your current job as you always have the chance to make some extra money in other ventures not only there is a financial benefit to it but you can pursue a passion that you cannot explore that much given your job related duties still side hustling should be done right before launching into a new job you must evaluate your skills writing photography or playing an instrument and see which of them can generate extra income besides e commerce undertakings are a good alternative since the business has grown exponentially given the pandemic if you are crafty consider selling your products on etsy if you enjoy refurbishing products such as furniture or technological products you might sell these on various niche websites advises the balance careers becoming a part time realtor in the real estate business is also a good option as you can exercise your time management skills while starting a new revenue stream the convert units website has come up with a very thorough answer to this question exploring a wide variety of scenarios out of 50 full time working weeks in a year and an unpaid 2 week vacation time there are 2 000 working hours with a 35 000 annual salary the math says you make 17 5 per hour in the same scenario with no vacation time taken or a 2 week paid vacation the hourly salary would equal 16 83 per hour now in a full time job done every working day no weekend overtime and a total of 2 088 working hours in the whole of 2021 you would be making 16 76 per hour in a full time position bi weekly payment with no overtime and 40 hours per week you would receive 26 paychecks of 1 356 15 depending again on the contractual conditions with your employer you can use salary calculators online to get more detailed information according to estimates a 35 000 a year salary with an interest rate of 3 75 and a loan term of 30 years plus annual property taxes of 1 400 and a monthly debt payment of 300 you could afford a house worth 134 534 there are several websites that can help you calculate this within the middle class there is no doubt that less than 40 100 a year is considered low income middle income ranges between 41 000 and 120 000 and upper income is anything above 120 000 annually according to a pew research disclosed in december 2020 extrapolating the data to social class groups 35 000 is considered lower middle class still there are other valuables to factor in such as education location and family history to define social class when compared against the 7 25 per hour minimum wage in the u s the 16 83 per hour out of 35 000 annually is certainly twice a good salary still as reported by the how to fire website which quotes the bureau of labor statistics the average american makes 865 a week working full time that comes out to 44 980 per year if you re making 35 000 you are below the average american depending on your financial goals you may or may not consider adding additional streams of income although it might seem like a tough endeavor living on this wage and being able to cover needs health insurance car insurance monthly bills phone bill and student loan payments wants and also save a few dollars is possible not so much so if you tend to waste money for which you would have to keep your splurges in check to remain whenever possible debt free if you need more money you can always find another string to your bow through passive income investments or side hustling but the key is to figure out a budget that will allow for a decent standard of living at a much lower income and for this a whole different approach to financial planning and budget management skills is required

outperforming the s p 500 index by over 5 one of the key factors to invest in penny stock is to evaluate a company s prospects thinking what could go wrong before investing will give you an idea of what are the macro or internal issues that will affect the company s ability to grow in the long term product viability is one key aspect in terms of what could happen if an important patent expires how could the firm react to a competitor launching a more innovative product the more viable a product is the better chances of good long term growth and short term stock performance although product viability will let you gauge a company s potential for growth this is a metric that should be considered on its own within this aspect potential investors should evaluate the firm s business model business strategy and the actions and reputation of the ceo any of these three elements should be unique difficult to imitate or equal and should have a direct impact on the brand s value other aspects to consider are the firm s ability to innovate research and operational excellence the harder it is for competitors to breach the company s moat the stronger the competitive advantage a firm s balance sheet is essential to look at before investing assets could increase the value of an organization over time while liabilities are debts that must be paid or goods and services obligations that must be fulfilled the strength of a company s balance sheet can be evaluated by three broad categories of investment quality measurements working capital or short term liquidity asset performance and capitalization structure according to investopedia in this regard you must do your research and evaluate the best balance sheet among your short listed organizations yes liquidity matters according to fs investments liquidity is the ease with which an investment can be bought or sold without significantly impacting the price of the security in this regard those stocks that can be either bought or sold effortlessly are said to be liquid while the opposite means they are illiquid in this regard private debt and private equity classes usually have fewer buyers and sellers than more liquid investments and tend to lack standardized terms making it harder for investors to quickly analyze value and in turn buy or sell them this is the golden rule for any stock under 10 cents and any stock in general this rule is applied by people who are in the financial education world and basically means apart from the literal if you are not willing to lose anything do not invest industry reports breaking news and any piece of information you can gather before investing in penny stocks is essential still it is widely assumed that good data on economic growth or job creation are positive for stocks but the price reaction will depend on the particular context when traders are concerned about a possible rise in interest rates they may prefer these figures to be moderate rather than show great strength be careful of using news too simplistically in many cases making a correct reading of certain news is more complex than thought and requires an extra vision of the market context at times prices increase simply because they are fashionable or because of future expectations with no real fundamentals euphoria causes you to buy based solely on the fact that the asset s price is low or to sell because the price is high without thinking that the low price can lead to even lower prices or higher prices can become even higher several otc listed penny stocks are endorsed as the next big breakout however these large businesses that offer a near guarantee of achievement start with a high priced ipo not on the penny stock market also otc stocks do not need to fulfill minimum standard requirements to remain on the exchange penny stock requires you to trade with volume according to raging bull they have a volume of around thousands of shares a day but penny stock firms with breaking news could have a high volume of millions of shares in a day how do penny stocks make money for you this is the time when you re likely to cash in and in the penny stock world there s some major event nearly every day the type of account you have may or may not allow for day trading for instance if you are a starter your account may enclose restrictions intended to stop you from advanced trading strategies or investing in securities that are illiquid or extremely volatile if this is the case and you re upset by it then instead of viewing the restrictions as something negative it might help to think of them as benevolent brakes in place to keep you from causing yourself financial damage by overtrading without understanding the risks involved staying liquid is also a way to stay invested you only have to take positions when the market situation requires it minimizing the turnover of the assets that make up the portfolio substantially minimizes management costs further controlling losses means that there is a limit in which they can be assumed to have a margin of recovery in the next trade compound interest added over time will allow you to achieve a higher return an asset that is in a winning position can never lead to a losing position online trading platforms are the primary investing tools users have within reach some of the best tools are scattered around the globe and can be used by users from every corner worldwide degiro is great if you are going to put in little money or you are going to leave it for a long time and not going to do constant operations as it will ask for your data you can do it in free mode while it verifies the information one of the drawbacks is that the price update is at night and does not allow you to see the price

individual joint family fiduciary and institutional it also offers seminars to continue learning an academy with courses and training before launching into penny stock trading make sure you answer yourself some key questions yourself the answer is yes but most of the time penny stocks can turn out to be quite risky in fact such actions can lead to many different types of scams however it is important to understand that penny stocks can earn you a lot of money and this is the reason why most investors are always willing to invest in these stocks they believe that the advantages of stocks outweigh the disadvantages among courageous investors these stocks have always been popular and in simple words they can offer impressive returns in a short amount of time according to several expert stock traders this amount is perfectly valid to begin our adventures in the world of the stock market however it is rather used to gain experience not to try to get the most out of them in other words you have a small amount to fine tune your future investment moves which is something very important since you cannot always hit the value that offers the best returns several penny stocks have achieved incredible feats but perhaps the most famous one is apple inc nasdaq aapl while the company remained away from the spotlight for many years it traded at 80 cents per share back in the early 2000s as one of the largest tech companies worldwide the share has hit up to 360 with a return of 46 750 still for every tech company whose penny stocks become a success hundreds fail according to seeking alpha the most heavily shorted stock is currently workhorse group inc wkhs with a 33 short interest the firm is working on electric powered trucks and utility vehicles although still in the early stages of development ahead of a mass market launch there is skepticism on whether the company will be able to meet production targets and if it has the necessary cash for the required investments penny stocks are well known for being extremely volatile and price fluctuations are very common reaching around 20 therefore it is essential to perform a fundamental analysis while following your risk management strategy before deciding whether to proceed with any trading decision also it is good practice to operate in industries where there is great market growth compared to industries that are in decline penny stocks tend not to have much daily trading volume on the stock markets therefore a large buy or sell order is often not needed to move the price if many people are talking about a pea in internet forums for example that could also influence the price it s important not to get caught up in an investment just because you ve had a big one day move and are afraid of losing it what goes up quickly can go down even faster so make sure your reasons for investing in the stock market are correct disclaimer the information provided in this article does not and is not

middle class 4 5 is 35k per year a good salary 5 final thoughts show utter obvious though it may be the first step is to identify what your unnecessary expenses are necessary expenses are usually rent or mortgage health insurance utilities or internet and variable or unnecessary expenses relate to leisure clothing or travel it is important to carry out this classification by categories in order to identify which are the expenses that you can and want to eliminate without affecting your lifestyle too much once this is done it will be easier to prepare a budget to set the limit of your expenses every month in each category but do not think that having a budget means you have to give up your hobbies or your little quirks more on this later cnbc reported in july that credit card debt among americans is rising as the savings rate spiked to a level not seen since world war ii this caused consumers to take the cash they had and pay down debt and often the first kind of debt they paid down was cards which have among the highest interest rates averaging 16 so to avoid losing a good chunk of your pandemic savings to credit card debt you should do your best to avoid this type of debt at all credit cards have high interest rates and low minimum payments and they are usually used to buy depreciating assets investopedia s list of six major credit card mistakes includes only paying the minimum balance using this product to buy everyday items and pay medical bills and taking cash advances so acquiring credit card debt is a no go if you want to live on 35 000 a year a high car payment is always linked to a new car according to data by experian the average monthly loan payment for a new car in the u s is approaching 600 which certainly is more than 20 of your 35 000 a year s monthly income amid the pandemic even loans for used vehicles have hit record highs with monthly payments soaring from 18 to 413 averaging 400 for the first time this is due to the increase in car prices amid the global chip shortage if you still find that a car is necessary do your research on different financing options to avoid relying on car dealership financing alone also be wise when choosing car insurance also extras will significantly raise the price of a vehicle and be foxy enough to haggle with the dealer to lower the price in covid times food delivery skyrocketed especially during lockdowns statista reports that in 2020 instacart went from getting 820 000 orders in february to 9 14 million in april this only goes to show how food delivery became a comforting proxy which in turn increased spending in this rubric still to live on 35 000 a year you must curb your restaurant spending without depriving yourself too much this means decreasing frequency but also applying some tips that will help you tail off the costs many people are not aware of the specials that food establishments often offer not considering the special of the day or the special of the week is a costly mistake so pay attention to the menu these deals are often offered at a significant discount or spread out in large portions to satisfy more than one member of the group keeping a list of bargains offered at popular restaurants and then consulting the list when deciding to go out is a good habit to develop also being attentive to social networks will keep you informed and updated about the specials of your favorite restaurants there is absolutely no doubt that consumer spending plunged during the darkest days of the pandemic and then bounced back in q2 2021 according to mckinsey consumers pent up demand and willingness to spend in some discretionary categories caused spending to grow at 20 to 30 percent year over year reaching 4 to 7 above pre covid 19 levels so those who aim at living on 35 000 a year must be careful of not overindulging in unnecessary spending especially in luxury consumer goods like smartphones laptops sound devices and more if you feel you need to overhaul your closet start by selling what you do not wear also off season shopping is a budget friendly habit as it is buying from thrifty stores looking for coupons online and shopping online for clearance sales it is to some extent a controversial saying but it holds truth when it comes down to living on 35 000 a year sacrifice the present for the future and dream big not everybody is willing to do so but under this scheme you can reap the benefits of a solid financial future this does not mean to live oblivious to the present moment in terms of leisure and having fun but to carefully move around financially with purpose and aplomb nathan w morris personal finance expert and author of your 33 day money action plan says the speed of your success is limited only by your dedication and what you re willing to sacrifice living on 35 000 a year will help you gain control of your personal finances and branch out into passive income investments and pursuing side projects to make some extra cash which can give you the chance to save cash one rule of thumb is the 50 30 20 model according to this your needs wants and savings should represent that proportion respectively as an example your 35 000 a year income represents a 2 300 take home pay without factoring any further deductions this way 50 of such payments should cover your home needs 30 would go to things you want and the remaining 20 would be to save some cash with pen and paper or with the use of any of the available budgeting apps you make a list of all your sources of income including every paycheck regular side house and also income from investment then create a list of all your expenses starting with the big sums like rent and car payments down to transportation utilities groceries and any debt payments the next budget allocation is for the things you might want clothes eating out and entertainment and finally cash for some savings cnbc s robert exley jr writes treating yourself is great but you want to do it within your budget don t be discouraged if your finances don t add up at first the more you track your spending and keep an eye on it the better you ll be at homing in on your expenses it is also important to keeping electronic records as this would help tracking your budget and expenses and feel free to use apps that link credit and debit cards to the budget so you keep your cash within limits money can be tight even if you re doing everything right but the best way not to be scared is to be prepared and a budget is your first step when living on such salary it is possible to make some extra bucks if you make your money work for you this is one of the most important personal finance pieces of advice there are many ways to do this so you can generate solid passive income to also save money for a start you can open a high yield savings bank account high yield checking and saving offer interest rates that exceed 1 100 times what you d get otherwise says business insider if you can do this on an online bank it would be much better as they offer lower costs by ridding brick and mortar premises retirement accounts are another solid alternative sean gould wealth strategist at waddell and associates says the key is to get money in a 401 k save as much as possible to have your money work for you tax efficiently and to get money in the markets the first bucket outside of the emergency fund is the 401 k up to the match you don t want to give away free money some extra cash can be gained through investments able to generate passive income people like the comfort of money in cash because they re burned from 2008 and 2009 but inflation will eat away at your cash gould says the reality is that investing in the market or in real estate is a great move since you can make money while your sleep regarding market investments it is important that you be patient since as business insider says pulling money in and out to take advantage of favorable fluctuations and minimize the loss when the market dips is a strategy most experts advise against on the other hand investing in real estate is certainly an option under the right conditions since housing as previous crises can reveal is not a warranty commercial real estate could be a good a suitable move but always bearing in mind a diversified portfolio in terms of assets there are further options like cd ladders and annuities and even selling items online like ebooks creating online courses on e learning platforms and selling stock photos you do not have to confine your skills to your current job as you always have the chance to make some extra money in other ventures not only there is a financial benefit to it but you can pursue a passion that you cannot explore that much given your job related duties still side hustling should be done right before launching into a new job you must evaluate your skills writing photography or playing an instrument and see which of them can generate extra income besides e commerce undertakings are a good alternative since the business has grown exponentially given the pandemic if you are crafty consider selling your products on etsy if you enjoy refurbishing products such as furniture or technological products you might sell these on various niche websites advises the balance careers becoming a part time realtor in the real estate business is also a good option as you can exercise your time management skills while starting a new revenue stream the convert units website has come up with a very thorough answer to this question exploring a wide variety of scenarios out of 50 full time working weeks in a year and an unpaid 2 week vacation time there are 2 000 working hours with a 35 000 annual salary the math says you make 17 5 per hour in the same scenario with no vacation time taken or a 2 week paid vacation the hourly salary would equal 16 83 per hour now in a full time job done every working day no weekend overtime and a total of 2 088 working hours in the whole of 2021 you would be making 16 76 per hour in a full time position bi weekly payment with no overtime and 40 hours per week you would receive 26 paychecks of 1 356 15 depending again on the contractual conditions with your employer you can use salary calculators online to get more detailed information according to estimates a 35 000 a year salary with an interest rate of 3 75 and a loan term of 30 years plus annual property taxes of 1 400 and a monthly debt payment of 300 you could afford a house worth 134 534 there are several websites that can help you calculate this within the middle class there is no doubt that less than 40 100 a year is considered low income middle income ranges between 41 000 and 120 000 and upper income is anything above 120 000 annually according to a pew research disclosed in december 2020 extrapolating the data to social class groups 35 000 is considered lower middle class still there are other valuables to factor in such as education location and family history to define social class when compared against the 7 25 per hour minimum wage in the u s the 16 83 per hour out of 35 000 annually is certainly twice a good salary still as reported by the how to fire website which quotes the bureau of labor statistics the average american makes 865 a week working full time that comes out to 44 980 per year if you re making 35 000 you are below the average american depending on your financial goals you may or may not consider adding additional streams of income although it might seem like a tough endeavor living on this wage and being able to cover needs health insurance car insurance monthly bills phone bill and student loan payments wants and also save a few dollars is possible not so much so if you tend to waste money for which you would have to keep your splurges in check to remain whenever possible debt free if you need more money you can always find another string to your bow through passive income investments or side hustling but the key is to figure out a budget that will allow for a decent standard of living at a much lower income and for this a whole different approach to financial planning and budget management skills is required

outperforming the s p 500 index by over 5 one of the key factors to invest in penny stock is to evaluate a company s prospects thinking what could go wrong before investing will give you an idea of what are the macro or internal issues that will affect the company s ability to grow in the long term product viability is one key aspect in terms of what could happen if an important patent expires how could the firm react to a competitor launching a more innovative product the more viable a product is the better chances of good long term growth and short term stock performance although product viability will let you gauge a company s potential for growth this is a metric that should be considered on its own within this aspect potential investors should evaluate the firm s business model business strategy and the actions and reputation of the ceo any of these three elements should be unique difficult to imitate or equal and should have a direct impact on the brand s value other aspects to consider are the firm s ability to innovate research and operational excellence the harder it is for competitors to breach the company s moat the stronger the competitive advantage a firm s balance sheet is essential to look at before investing assets could increase the value of an organization over time while liabilities are debts that must be paid or goods and services obligations that must be fulfilled the strength of a company s balance sheet can be evaluated by three broad categories of investment quality measurements working capital or short term liquidity asset performance and capitalization structure according to investopedia in this regard you must do your research and evaluate the best balance sheet among your short listed organizations yes liquidity matters according to fs investments liquidity is the ease with which an investment can be bought or sold without significantly impacting the price of the security in this regard those stocks that can be either bought or sold effortlessly are said to be liquid while the opposite means they are illiquid in this regard private debt and private equity classes usually have fewer buyers and sellers than more liquid investments and tend to lack standardized terms making it harder for investors to quickly analyze value and in turn buy or sell them this is the golden rule for any stock under 10 cents and any stock in general this rule is applied by people who are in the financial education world and basically means apart from the literal if you are not willing to lose anything do not invest industry reports breaking news and any piece of information you can gather before investing in penny stocks is essential still it is widely assumed that good data on economic growth or job creation are positive for stocks but the price reaction will depend on the particular context when traders are concerned about a possible rise in interest rates they may prefer these figures to be moderate rather than show great strength be careful of using news too simplistically in many cases making a correct reading of certain news is more complex than thought and requires an extra vision of the market context at times prices increase simply because they are fashionable or because of future expectations with no real fundamentals euphoria causes you to buy based solely on the fact that the asset s price is low or to sell because the price is high without thinking that the low price can lead to even lower prices or higher prices can become even higher several otc listed penny stocks are endorsed as the next big breakout however these large businesses that offer a near guarantee of achievement start with a high priced ipo not on the penny stock market also otc stocks do not need to fulfill minimum standard requirements to remain on the exchange penny stock requires you to trade with volume according to raging bull they have a volume of around thousands of shares a day but penny stock firms with breaking news could have a high volume of millions of shares in a day how do penny stocks make money for you this is the time when you re likely to cash in and in the penny stock world there s some major event nearly every day the type of account you have may or may not allow for day trading for instance if you are a starter your account may enclose restrictions intended to stop you from advanced trading strategies or investing in securities that are illiquid or extremely volatile if this is the case and you re upset by it then instead of viewing the restrictions as something negative it might help to think of them as benevolent brakes in place to keep you from causing yourself financial damage by overtrading without understanding the risks involved staying liquid is also a way to stay invested you only have to take positions when the market situation requires it minimizing the turnover of the assets that make up the portfolio substantially minimizes management costs further controlling losses means that there is a limit in which they can be assumed to have a margin of recovery in the next trade compound interest added over time will allow you to achieve a higher return

yourself some key questions yourself the answer is yes but most of the time penny stocks can turn out to be quite risky in fact such actions can lead to many different types of scams however it is important to understand that penny stocks can earn you a lot of money and this is the reason why most investors are always willing to invest in these stocks they believe that the advantages of stocks outweigh the disadvantages among courageous investors these stocks have always been popular and in simple words they can offer impressive returns in a short amount of time according to several expert stock traders this amount is perfectly valid to begin our adventures in the world of the stock market however it is rather used to gain experience not to try to get the most out of them in other words you have a small amount to fine tune your future investment moves which is something very important since you cannot always hit the value that offers the best returns several penny stocks have achieved incredible feats but perhaps the most famous one is apple inc nasdaq aapl while the company remained away from the spotlight for many years it traded at 80 cents per share back in the early 2000s as one of the largest tech companies worldwide the share has hit up to 360 with a return of 46 750 still for every tech company whose penny stocks become a success hundreds fail according to seeking alpha the most heavily shorted stock is currently workhorse group inc wkhs with a 33 short interest the firm is working on electric powered trucks and utility vehicles although still in the early stages of development ahead of a mass market launch there is skepticism on whether the company will be able to meet production targets and if it has the necessary cash for the required investments penny stocks are well known for being extremely volatile and price fluctuations are very common reaching around 20 therefore it is essential to perform a fundamental analysis while following your risk management strategy before deciding whether to proceed with any trading decision also it is good practice to operate in industries where there is great market growth compared to industries that are in decline penny stocks tend not to have much daily trading volume on the stock markets therefore a large buy or sell order is often not needed to move the price if many people are talking about a pea in internet forums for example that could also influence the price it s important not to get caught up in an investment just because you ve had a big one day move and are afraid of losing it what goes up quickly can go down even faster so make sure your reasons for investing in the stock market are correct disclaimer the information provided in this article does not and is not

option as you can exercise your time management skills while starting a new revenue stream the convert units website has come up with a very thorough answer to this question exploring a wide variety of scenarios out of 50 full time working weeks in a year and an unpaid 2 week vacation time there are 2 000 working hours with a 35 000 annual salary the math says you make 17 5 per hour in the same scenario with no vacation time taken or a 2 week paid vacation the hourly salary would equal 16 83 per hour now in a full time job done every working day no weekend overtime and a total of 2 088 working hours in the whole of 2021 you would be making 16 76 per hour in a full time position bi weekly payment with no overtime and 40 hours per week you would receive 26 paychecks of 1 356 15

such as education location and family history to define social class when compared against the 7 25 per hour minimum wage in the u s the 16 83 per hour out of 35 000 annually is certainly twice a good salary still as reported by the how to fire website which quotes the bureau of labor statistics the average american makes 865 a week working full time that comes out to 44 980 per year if you re

the loss when the market dips is a strategy most experts advise against on the other hand investing in real estate is certainly an option under the right conditions since housing as previous crises can reveal is not a warranty commercial real estate could be a good a suitable move but always bearing in mind a diversified portfolio in terms of assets there are further options like cd ladders and annuities and even selling items online like ebooks creating online courses on e learning platforms and selling stock photos you do not have to confine your skills to your current job as you always have the chance to make some extra money in other ventures not only there is a financial benefit to it but you can pursue a passion that you cannot explore that much given your job related duties still side hustling should be done right before launching into a new job you must evaluate your skills writing photography or playing an instrument and see which of them can generate extra income besides e commerce undertakings are a good alternative since the business has grown exponentially given the pandemic if you are crafty consider selling your products on etsy if you enjoy refurbishing products such as furniture or technological products you might sell these on various niche websites advises the balance careers becoming a part time realtor in the real estate business is also a good option as you can exercise your time management skills while starting a new revenue stream the convert units website has come up with a very thorough answer to this question exploring a wide variety of scenarios out of 50 full time working weeks in a year and an unpaid 2 week vacation time there are 2 000 working hours with a 35 000 annual salary the math says you make 17 5 per hour in the same scenario with no vacation time taken or a 2 week paid vacation the hourly salary would equal 16 83 per hour now in a full time job done every working day no weekend overtime and a total of 2 088 working hours in the whole of 2021 you would be making 16 76 per hour in a full time position bi weekly payment with no overtime and 40 hours per week you would receive 26 paychecks of 1 356 15 depending again on the contractual conditions with your employer you can use salary calculators online to get more detailed information according to estimates a 35 000 a year salary with an interest rate of 3 75 and a loan term of 30 years plus annual property taxes of 1 400 and a monthly debt payment of 300 you could afford a house worth 134 534 there are several websites that can help you calculate this within the middle class there is no doubt that less than 40 100 a year is considered low income middle income ranges between 41 000 and 120 000 and upper income is anything above 120 000 annually according to a pew research disclosed in december 2020 extrapolating the data to social class groups 35 000 is considered lower middle class still there are other valuables to factor in such as education location and family history to define social class when compared against the 7 25 per hour minimum wage in the u s the 16 83 per hour out of 35 000 annually is certainly twice a good salary still as reported by the how to fire website which quotes the bureau of labor statistics the average american makes 865 a week working full time that comes out to 44 980 per year if you re making 35 000 you are below the average american depending on your financial goals you may or may not consider adding additional streams of income although it might seem like a tough endeavor living on this wage and being able to cover needs health insurance car insurance monthly bills phone bill and student loan payments wants and also save a few dollars is possible not so much so if you tend to waste money for which you would have to keep your splurges in check to remain whenever possible debt free if you need more money you can always find another string to your bow through passive income investments or side hustling but the key is to figure out a budget that will allow for a decent standard of living at a much lower income and for this a whole different approach to financial planning and budget management skills is required

penny stock ever 6 4 what is the most shorted stock right now 7 a final take show a host of well established companies once traded for less than 1 a share including ford motor company nyse f jd sports fashion plc lon jd and monster beverage corp nasdaq mnst those who invested in these companies during their trading days could have accrued substantial profit penny stocks are generally highly volatile and riskier but still represent the possibility of significant growth the appeal of a penny stock is easy to see as if you have 1 000 to invest in the stock market you can get a considerably higher percentage of shares in a smaller company whose shares trade for a few cents rather than buying blue chip shares which can cost significantly more for an extremely small percentage of ownership of course if a penny stock becomes a blue chip you could end up making big profits with the right trading strategy many pharmaceutical stocks that were considered small have reached blue chip level company name market cap mobil nye telesistemy pao mcx mtss 9 6 billion banco bradesco sa preference shares bme xbbdc 54 million veon ltd nasdaq veon 3 02 billion secure energy services inc tse ses 640 3 million annaly capital management inc nyse nly 13 01 billion the first pool of penny stocks under 10 cents is mobile telesystems mobil nye telesistemy pao the company is headquartered in moscow russia and primarily focuses on providing hardware and internet services for its expanding customer base a by product of the privatization that followed the collapse of the soviet union the company announced significant growth before eventually hitting roughly 80 million subscribers this can be both an incentive and a deterrent for some but it should be noted that the company does come with a plethora of attractive features including a long term analytic share price history which shows very little price volatility as for banco bradesco sa preference shares it is a banking and financial services company headquartered in the state of são paulo brazil with a cheap stock price of 5 52 it is currently one of the hottest penny stocks under 10 cents and anyone overlooking this opportunity could miss a profitable trade banco bradesco is the third largest banking company in the country as well as in latin america and it is ranked as one of the top 50 most valuable banks in the entire world the opportunities to trade 10 cents penny stocks are arguably reflected on the prolific third party investment it has received with over fifteen hedge funds investing in banco bradesco in its fourth quarter of 2020 veon ltd is a dutch telecom company with a current stock price of just over 1 7 despite its very small market price it is actually one of the largest companies on the list with annual revenue of just under 8 billion in 2020 with a current market capitalization of over 3 billion veon ltd is certainly an option for those looking for strong penny stocks secure energy services inc is certainly another good option for penny stocks under 10 cents this is a public energy services company specializing in solutions to upstream oil and natural gas corporations in the canadian hemisphere and the u s its headquarters are based in alberta canada and its current stock price is just over 4 the company is categorized into several segments all encapsulating different services annaly capital management inc currently priced at 9 3 seems to come with a surprising number of advantages for penny stocks when considering its rather low market price the company is currently one of the largest mortgage investment trusts in the state of maryland with its main headquarters stationed in new york city u s annaly capital management penny stocks under 10 cents provide an astounding dividend of over 9 this is a massive incentive for individuals looking for a potentially sustainable source of income in the future as its shares have risen by over 50 in the last 12 months outperforming the s p 500 index by over 5 one of the key factors to invest in penny stock is to evaluate a company s prospects thinking what could go wrong before investing will give you an idea of what are the macro or internal issues that will affect the company s ability to grow in the long term product viability is one key aspect in terms of what could happen if an important patent expires how could the firm react to a competitor launching a more innovative product the more viable a product is the better chances of good long term growth and short term stock performance although product viability will let you gauge a company s potential for growth this is a metric that should be considered on its own within this aspect potential investors should evaluate the firm s business model business strategy and the actions and reputation of the ceo any of these three elements should be unique difficult to imitate or equal and should have a direct impact on the brand s value other aspects to consider are the firm s ability to innovate research and operational excellence the harder it is for competitors to breach the company s moat the stronger the competitive advantage a firm s balance sheet is essential to look at before investing assets could increase the value of an organization over time while liabilities are debts that must be paid or goods and services obligations that must be fulfilled the strength of a company s balance sheet can be evaluated by three broad categories of investment quality measurements working capital or short term liquidity asset performance and capitalization structure according to investopedia in this regard you must do your research and evaluate the best balance sheet among your short listed organizations yes liquidity matters according to fs investments liquidity is the ease with which an investment can be bought or sold without significantly impacting the price of the security in this regard those stocks that can be either bought or sold effortlessly are said to be liquid while the opposite means they are illiquid in this regard private debt and private equity classes usually have fewer buyers and sellers than more liquid investments and tend to lack standardized terms making it harder for investors to quickly analyze value and in turn buy or sell them this is the golden rule for any stock under 10 cents and any stock in general this rule is applied by people who are in the financial education world and basically means apart from the literal if you are not willing to lose anything do not invest industry reports breaking news and any piece of information you can gather before investing in penny stocks is essential still it is widely assumed that good data on economic growth or job creation are positive for stocks but the price reaction will depend on the particular context when traders are concerned about a possible rise in interest rates they may prefer these figures to be moderate rather than show great strength be careful of using news too simplistically in many cases making a correct reading of certain news is more complex than thought and requires an extra vision of the market context at times prices increase simply because they are fashionable or because of future expectations with no real fundamentals euphoria causes you to buy based solely on the fact that the asset s price is low or to sell because the price is high without thinking that the low price can lead to even lower prices or higher prices can become even higher several otc listed penny stocks are endorsed as the next big breakout however these large businesses that offer a near guarantee of achievement start with a high priced ipo not on the penny stock market also otc stocks do not need to fulfill minimum standard requirements to remain on the exchange penny stock requires you to trade with volume according to raging bull they have a volume of around thousands of shares a day but penny stock firms with breaking news could have a high volume of millions of shares in a day how do penny stocks make money for you this is the time when you re likely to cash in and in the penny stock world there s some major event nearly every day the type of account you have may or may not allow for day trading for instance if you are a starter your account may enclose restrictions intended to stop you from advanced trading strategies or investing in securities that are illiquid or extremely volatile if this is the case and you re upset by it then instead of viewing the restrictions as something negative it might help to think of them as benevolent brakes in place to keep you from causing yourself financial damage by overtrading without understanding the risks involved staying liquid is also a way to stay invested you only have to take positions when the market situation requires it minimizing the turnover of the assets that make up the portfolio substantially minimizes management costs further controlling losses means that there is a limit in which they can be assumed to have a margin of recovery in the next trade compound interest added over time will allow you to achieve a higher return an asset that is in a winning position can never lead to a losing position online trading platforms are the primary investing tools users have within reach some of the best tools are scattered around the globe and can be used by users from every corner worldwide degiro is great if you are going to put in little money or you are going to leave it for a long time and not going to do constant

individual joint family fiduciary and institutional it also offers seminars to continue learning an academy with courses and training before launching into penny stock trading make sure you answer yourself some key questions yourself the answer is yes but most of the time penny stocks can turn out to be quite risky in fact such actions can lead to many different types of scams however it is important to understand that penny stocks can earn you a lot of money and this is the reason why most investors are always willing to invest in these stocks they believe that the advantages of stocks outweigh the disadvantages among courageous investors these stocks have always been popular and in simple words they can offer impressive returns in a short amount of time according to several expert stock traders this amount is perfectly valid to begin our adventures in the world of the stock market however it is rather used to gain experience not to try to get the most out of them in other words you have a small amount to fine tune your future investment moves which is something very important since you cannot always hit the value that offers the best returns several penny stocks have achieved incredible feats but perhaps the most famous one is apple inc nasdaq aapl while the company remained away from the spotlight for many years it traded at 80 cents per share back in the early 2000s as one of the largest tech companies worldwide the share has hit up to 360 with a return of 46 750 still for every tech company whose penny stocks become a success hundreds fail according to seeking alpha the most heavily shorted stock is currently workhorse group inc wkhs with a 33 short interest the firm is working on electric powered trucks and utility vehicles although still in the early stages of development ahead of a mass market launch there is skepticism on whether the company will be able to meet production targets and if it has the necessary cash for the required investments penny stocks are well known for being extremely volatile and price fluctuations are very common reaching around 20 therefore it is essential to perform a fundamental analysis while following your risk management strategy before deciding whether to proceed with any trading decision also it is good practice to operate in industries where there is great market growth compared to industries that are in decline penny stocks tend not to have much daily trading volume on the stock markets therefore a large buy or sell order is often not needed to move the price if many people are talking about a pea in internet forums for example that could also influence the price it s important not to get caught up in an investment just because you ve had a big one day move and are afraid of losing it what goes up quickly can go down even faster so make sure your reasons for investing in the stock market are correct disclaimer the information provided in this article does not and is not

president obama constantly told falsehoods to the american people about how his policies worked how they would be implemented and what the benefits were his most famous one if you like your health care plan you can keep it got him the lie of the year but when president trump does his own spinning it all of a sudden becomes a moral conundrum for the liberal media the stacked anti trump panel on nbc s meet the press proved this point on sunday when they debated when to call him a liar moderator chuck todd actually set aside time in the program so he and his stacked panel could go over recent statements by the president and rake him over the coals you have to be a sort of taxonomist of falsehoods i mean traditionally the president s stock and trade has been to traffic in a substance that s identical to my initials declared new york times columnist and faux conservative bret stephens having found great amusement in the low brow joke todd reminded viewers that stephens initials were b s the columnist then appeared to push the cnn backed conspiracy theory that something was wrong with the president s head and there s always a question also about the president s state of mind because he says stuff and then often doesn t seem to remember what he had said the day the hour the minute before he suggested todd thought it was a fair point and funny that stephens would question the president s mental capacity even though neither had training in the field he then promoted the ramblings of conservative columnist andrew sullivan you went there this is what he wrote helen if someone behaved like this in my actual life if someone kept insisting that the sea was red and the sky was green i d assume they were a few sandwiches short of a picnic it s vital to remember this every day almost no one else in public life is no openly living in his own disturbed world what do you want me to do laughed new york times pentagon correspondent helene cooper as she went on the explain the times policy on using the word lie and we have said lied in the past but what dean baquet the executive editor of the times has said is that he thinks we shouldn t use it all the time because if you use it all the tie it loses the meaning according to cooper she couldn t remember ever wrestling with whether or not to use the term t s something i m not used to having to deal with as a reporter when you re talking about the president she lamented todd sympathized with her and described the trump era as disorientating this is a different level and i think what we struggle with as reporters is what do you label a lie because a lie has to be deliberate said nbc national reporter carol lee so president with trump you know in order to call it a lie you have to be able to show that he is deliberately and intentionally doing that a lot of times when he s ill informed he s misinformed and you don t know what his intent is republican strategist and former head of the american conservative union al cardenas claimed there were only two reasons for why the president would twist the truth one of them being that he had a mental problem todd also though cardenas made some great points and huffed about how obama was punished by receiving the lie of the year label by politifact he didn t serially do it so here he is punished for one in a way uniquely but claiming obama was uniquely slapped with lie of the year was in itself a falsehood because trump also got that label in 2017 the transcript is below click expand to read

tehran the chief of the un s nuclear watchdog was in iran sunday for talks on the nuclear dispute days after the iaea criticised tehran for a lack of cooperation rafael grossi who arrived in tehran the previous evening was to meet iran s vice president mohammad eslami who also heads the country s nuclear agency official sources said grossi s visit comes as talks remain locked in vienna on saving tehran s 2015 deal with major powers that promised it sanctions relief in return for curbs on its nuclear programme the landmark deal was torpedoed in 2018 by former us president donald trump s unilateral decision to withdraw the united states from it and impose a punishing sanctions regime iran has since stepped away from many of its commitments but the administration of us president joe biden has advocated a return to diplomacy to save the agreement point of contention a point of contention this year has been limits iran has imposed on the iaea s ability to monitor various of its nuclear facilities it has refused to provide real time footage from cameras and other surveillance tools that the un agency has installed in these locations under a compromise deal the monitoring equipment remains in the agency s custody but the data is in iran s possession and must not be erased as long as the arrangement remains in force initially agreed for three months the compromise was extended by another month and then expired on june 24 the iaea has since been urging tehran to inform it of its intentions in its statement last tuesday the iaea said its verification and monitoring activities have been seriously undermined by tehran s actions it also said that iran had boosted its stocks of uranium enriched above the levels allowed in the 2015 deal formally known as the joint comprehensive plan of action jcpoa iran s ultraconservative new president ebrahim raisi said wednesday that his country was transparent about its nuclear activities the state run iran newspaper said the two sides would discuss sunday the temporary arrangement on the supervision of iaea inspectors and the contents of iaea surveillance cameras installed in iranian nuclear centres

the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 tcja made significant reductions in individual income estate taxes benefiting many americans but with a new administration and new tax proposals from president biden s office some may be worried about possible changes to their tax rates what many people are overlooking is that the tcja has a sunset provision at the end of 2025 at that time tax rates will revert to the higher rates of 2017 or perhaps even higher considering our mounting national debt while some may be concerned with future tax hikes many are missing the current opportunity for strategic tax planning regardless of present or future political dynamics with the tcja still in place we essentially have a tax holiday until the start of 2026 with taxes on sale we can take advantage of rates that may never be this low again some people are concerned that the current administration will soon increase taxes in addition to the 2026 increase realistically however politicians have little incentive to promote tax hikes now when current legislation already has a tax increase scheduled why be the bad guy who raised taxes when it s already written into existing legislation subscribe to

couple currently earning 250 000 a year currently they re in the 24 tax bracket prior to the tcja that same 250 000 income fell in the 33 tax bracket the current 24 bracket includes a wide range of incomes and avoids the tax wall jumping from the 24 bracket to 33 until reaching almost 330 000 in income for a couple earning 250 000 that means they have about 80 000 of annual wiggle room to increase their income and still be taxed at a 24 rate this provides options for future tax reduction and tax free growth one way to achieve this is through roth conversions though subject to income tax in the year s of conversion roth iras are never taxed again this couple could convert 80 000 per year through 2025 and pay the 24 in income tax now avoiding the scheduled guaranteed tax increase to at least 33 in 2026 and beyond these are three ways to take advantage of our current tax holiday soften the blow of capital gains taxes with long term capital gains taxes perhaps doubling for those making over 1 million if president biden s proposal is enacted it might be prudent to sell off some high gainers you ve had in the stock market because the market is experiencing all time highs it may make sense to sell and pay taxes on the capital gains now if you make more than 1 million per year additionally this provides an opportunity to better manage risk through portfolio diversification and allocation considering the huge gains in certain stocks and sectors of the market some portfolios have become very unbalanced in recent years convert to a roth ira considering the current administration s tax proposals it s worthwhile to consider a roth conversion during the tax holiday period conversions are taxable in the year they are done but for many it s better to do it now while tax rates are relatively low the long term benefits of a roth make it worth taking a tax hit now the money grows tax free and is not taxable when withdrawn properly after age 59½ furthermore a roth conversion now is good for your beneficiaries later when the secure act was signed into law by president trump in 2019 a major change happened that requires retirement accounts to be fully distributed and taxed to non spouse beneficiaries within 10 years though beneficiaries must deplete the roth ira within 10 years they can let it grow tax free for the full duration then withdraw it all at once without tax consequence there is no required minimum distribution rmd on roth iras if the funds aren t needed that money can continue to sit and grow tax free regardless of how high tax rates climb in the future consider life insurance strategies besides roth iras another tax free investment is life insurance various legislators are proposing a reduction in the estate tax exemption reducing it from 11 7 million to potentially as low as 3 5 million for a single person double the values for married couples this will increase substantially the number of people paying estate taxes life insurance provides an influx of cash that can help your beneficiaries pay the estate taxes plus with the addition of an irrevocable life insurance trust ilit these life insurance proceeds can potentially be removed from the estate completely for purposes of calculating the estate tax of course an important consideration for married couples is protecting the surviving spouse if one spouse passes away the other will experience a reduction in social security income and potentially pension income the death benefit from a life insurance policy provides a lump sum of money that the surviving spouse can use to replenish lost income sources and pay any necessary taxes additionally life insurance can protect against long term care costs an increasingly common thief of wealth among the elderly most people needing long term care spend down their assets at a significant clip to fund their care upon death the surviving spouse may not have enough left to support a comfortable lifestyle with a life insurance policy that incorporates long term care the cost of care is deducted from the policy s death benefit and extends beyond the death benefit if needed unlike traditional use it or lose it long term care policies if you don t require long term care on these policies the death benefit stays intact and passes tax free to your beneficiaries the time is now to take advantage of your tax holiday the moves you make between now and 2026 will forever impact your tax situation and that of your beneficiaries tax wise there s never been a better time to control your financial future dan dunkin

every month in each category but do not think that having a budget means you have to give up your hobbies or your little quirks more on this later cnbc reported in july that credit card debt among americans is rising as the savings rate spiked to a level not seen since world war ii this caused consumers to take the cash they had and pay down debt and often the first kind of debt they paid down was cards which have among the highest interest rates averaging 16 so to avoid losing a good chunk of your pandemic savings to credit card debt you should do your best to avoid this type of debt at

is always linked to a new car according to data by experian the average monthly loan payment for a new car in the u s is approaching 600 which certainly is more than 20 of your 35 000 a year s monthly income amid the pandemic even loans for used vehicles have hit record highs with monthly payments soaring from 18 to 413 averaging 400 for the first time this is due to the increase in car prices amid the global chip shortage if you still find that a car is necessary do your research on different financing options to avoid relying on car dealership financing alone also be wise when choosing car insurance also extras will significantly raise the price of a vehicle and be foxy enough to haggle with the dealer to lower the price in covid times food delivery skyrocketed especially during lockdowns statista reports that in 2020 instacart went from getting 820 000 orders in february to 9 14 million in april this only goes to show how food delivery became a comforting proxy which in turn increased spending in this rubric still to live on 35 000 a year you must curb your restaurant spending without depriving yourself too much this means decreasing frequency but also applying some tips that will help you tail off the costs many people are not aware of the specials that food establishments often offer not considering the special of the day or the special of the week is a costly mistake so pay attention to the menu these deals are often offered at a significant discount or spread out in large portions to satisfy more than one member of the group keeping a list of bargains offered at popular restaurants and then consulting the list when deciding to go out is a good habit to develop also being attentive to social networks will keep you informed and updated about the specials of your favorite restaurants there is absolutely no doubt that consumer spending plunged during the darkest days of the pandemic and then bounced back in q2 2021 according to mckinsey consumers pent up demand and willingness to spend in some discretionary categories caused spending to grow at 20 to 30 percent year over year reaching 4 to 7 above pre covid 19 levels so those who aim at living on 35 000 a year must be careful of not overindulging in unnecessary spending especially in luxury consumer goods like smartphones laptops sound devices and more if you feel you need to overhaul your closet start by selling what you do not wear also off season shopping is a budget friendly habit as it is buying from thrifty stores looking for coupons online and shopping online for clearance sales it is to some extent a controversial saying but it holds truth when it comes down to living on 35 000 a year sacrifice the present for the future and dream big not everybody is willing to do so but under this scheme you can reap the benefits of a solid financial future this does not mean to live oblivious to the present moment in terms of leisure and having fun but to carefully move around financially with purpose and aplomb nathan w morris personal finance expert and author of your 33 day money action plan says the speed of your success is limited only by your dedication and what you re willing to sacrifice living on 35 000 a year will help you gain control of your personal finances and branch out into passive income investments and pursuing side projects to make some extra cash which can give you the chance to save cash one rule of thumb is the 50 30 20 model according to this your needs wants and savings should represent that proportion respectively as an example your 35 000 a year income represents a 2 300 take home pay without factoring any further deductions this way 50 of such payments should cover your home needs 30 would go to things you want and the remaining 20 would be to save some cash with pen and paper or with the use of any of the available budgeting apps you make a list of all your sources of income including every paycheck regular side house and also income from investment then create a list of all your expenses starting with the big sums like rent and car payments down to transportation utilities groceries and any debt payments the next budget allocation is for the things you might want clothes eating out and entertainment and finally cash for some savings cnbc s robert exley jr writes treating yourself is great but you want to do it within your budget don t be discouraged if your finances don t add up at first the more you track your spending and keep an eye on it the better you ll be at homing in on your expenses it is also important to keeping electronic records as this would help tracking your budget and expenses and feel free to use apps that link credit and debit cards to the budget so you keep your cash within limits money can be tight even if you re doing everything right but the best way not to be scared is to be prepared and a budget is your first step when living on such salary it is possible to make some extra bucks if you make your money work for you this is one of the most important personal finance pieces of advice there are many ways to do this so you can generate solid passive income to also save money for a start you can open a high yield savings bank account high yield checking and saving offer interest rates that exceed 1 100 times what you d get otherwise says business insider if you can do this on an online bank it would be much better as they offer lower costs by ridding brick and mortar premises retirement accounts are another solid alternative sean gould wealth strategist at waddell and associates says the key is to get money in a 401 k save as much as possible to have your money work for you tax efficiently and to get money in the markets the first bucket outside of the emergency fund is the 401 k up to the match you don t want to give away free money some extra cash can be gained through investments able to generate passive income people like the comfort of money in cash because they re burned from 2008 and 2009 but inflation will eat away at your cash gould says the reality is that investing in the market or in real estate is a great move since you can make money while your sleep regarding market investments it is important that you be patient since as business insider says pulling money in and out to take advantage of favorable fluctuations and minimize the loss when the market dips is a strategy most experts advise against on the other hand investing in real estate is certainly an option under the right conditions since housing as previous crises can reveal is not a warranty commercial real estate could be a good a suitable move but always bearing in mind a diversified portfolio in terms of assets there are further options like cd ladders and annuities and even selling items online like ebooks creating online courses on e learning platforms and selling stock photos you do not have to confine your skills to your current job as you always have the chance to make some extra money in other ventures not only there is a financial benefit to it but you can pursue a passion that you cannot explore that much given your job related duties still side hustling should be done right before launching into a new job you must evaluate your skills writing photography or playing an instrument and see which of them can generate extra income besides e commerce undertakings are a good alternative since the business has grown exponentially given the pandemic if you are crafty consider selling your products on etsy if you enjoy refurbishing products such as furniture or technological products you might sell these on various niche websites advises the balance careers becoming a part time realtor in the real estate business is also a good option as you can exercise your time management skills while starting a new revenue stream the convert units website has come up with a very thorough answer to this question exploring a wide variety of scenarios out of 50 full time working weeks in a year and an unpaid 2 week vacation time there are 2 000 working hours with a 35 000 annual salary the math says you make 17 5 per hour in the same scenario with no vacation time taken or a 2 week paid vacation the hourly salary would equal 16 83 per hour now in a full time job done every working day no weekend overtime and a total of 2 088 working hours in the whole of 2021 you would be making 16 76 per hour in a full time position bi weekly payment with no overtime and 40 hours per week you would receive 26 paychecks of 1 356 15 depending again on the contractual conditions with your employer you can use salary calculators online to get more detailed information according to estimates a 35 000 a year salary with an interest rate of 3 75 and a loan term of 30 years plus annual property taxes of 1 400 and a monthly debt payment of 300 you could afford a house worth 134 534 there are several websites that can help you calculate this within the middle class there is no doubt that less than 40 100 a year is considered low income middle income ranges between 41 000 and 120 000 and upper income is anything above 120 000 annually according to a pew research disclosed in december 2020 extrapolating the data to social class groups 35 000 is considered lower middle class still there are other valuables to factor in such as education location and family history to define social class when compared against the 7 25 per hour minimum wage in the u s the 16 83 per hour out of 35 000 annually is certainly twice a good salary still as reported by the how to fire website which quotes the bureau of labor statistics the average american makes 865 a week working full time that comes out to 44 980 per year if you re making 35 000 you are below the average american depending on your financial goals you may or may not consider adding additional streams of income although it might seem like a tough endeavor living on this wage and being able to cover needs health insurance car insurance monthly bills phone bill and student loan payments wants and also save a few dollars is possible not so much so if you tend to waste money for which you would have to keep your splurges in check to remain whenever possible debt free if you need more money you can always find another string to your bow through passive income investments or side hustling but the key is to figure out a budget that will allow for a decent standard of living at a much lower income and for this a whole different approach to financial planning and budget management skills is required

estimates that the trio plus near billionaire kanovich have a combined net worth almost entirely made up of dlocal stock of 10 billion that s more than one fifth of the country s 47 billion gross domestic product in 2020 uruguay s tiny internal market meant that dlocal needed to move abroad early on starting with neighboring brazil but rather than compete with larger payment rivals such as stripe and adyen both of which are worth nearly 100 billion in the established markets of north america and europe dlocal instead carved out its niche in fast growing emerging countries that strategy has paid off not just in growth but profitability unlike many other fintech startups dlocal was already profitable before it went public nearly doubling its sales and net income to 104 million and 28 million respectively in 2020 the key to those profits is the high prices dlocal charges for its service on a typical 100 transaction on amazon for example dlocal pockets 4 four times the average rate for payments firms dlocal enables emerging market consumers to buy from developed market ecommerce companies and pay with their local funding sources says james friedman an analyst at susquehanna capital amazon and microsoft are their largest customers and you can tell they add value because their prices are high a 20 minute drive from dlocal s office in the country s third tallest building in the capital city of montevideo the halls of universidad ort are a far cry from the rarefied world of such tech giants uruguay s largest private university was founded in 1942 by the organization for research and training a jewish educational foundation established in st petersburg in 1880 to empower russia s jewish population with trade and professional skills universidad ort was set up in uruguay to support jewish migrants fleeing postwar europe and seeking to build a new life in south america that spirit lives on through four of its alumni none of whom were on campus at the same time but who came together to found dlocal kanovich fogel and bzurovski all attended the university along with dlocal s president jacobo singer fogel who is a member of forbes councils began teaching a class on digital disruptions there in 2008 before joining forces with bzurovski fogel had cycled through various startups that didn t catch on including a voice over ip company and a failed venture he started with his wife it was a very very bad idea he later said of the experience in a september 2020 interview with the youtube channel 20minuteleaders in 2009 fogel and bzurovski teamed up to launch astropay a payments firm that helps consumers in emerging markets store funds online using a prepaid virtual debit card they recruited kanovich as general manager in 2012 within two years kanovich then 24 was ceo and singer had joined as a software engineer one of the company s first investors was azar currently dlocal s chairman who had made a small fortune selling ireland s largest operator of data centers to a competitor for 144 million in 2011 the first external cash came in 2019 when general atlantic which had previously invested in dutch payments firm adyen invested an undisclosed amount dlocal has been profitable from its first year money wasn t a driver for any of the funding rounds we did before we became public says kanovich at some point we realized that we wanted to get to the next level and we were looking for a partner that would help us scale and think internationally in september 2020 general atlantic put in another 200 million and seven months later dlocal closed a 150 million funding round with investors including alkeon capital management tiger global and d1 capital partners that valued the firm at 5 billion when dlocal finally went public with shares priced at 21 apiece in june the markets valued it at more than 6 billion that valuation has long since been eclipsed with a market capitalization now hovering around 20 billion the company s valuation has grown by 1 560 in just two years as the company grew the founding team moved across borders to open new offices after his two months stint in china kanovich settled in israel where fogel also studied and lived for a decade fogel is now back in uruguay bzurovski lives in uruguay but has a home in miami while the firm s chief technological officer resides in buenos aires the rest of the executive team is spread out across spain philadelphia and california borders don t mean anything anymore the person can be sitting in sunnyvale or in new york or in argentina said fogel in a youtube interview still no matter how many more countries it expands to its young ceo believes dlocal s culture will always be rooted in the rolling plains and tight knit cities of uruguay uruguay is a small market that looks to the outside a lot we always understood that we had to adapt because no one cared about our home says kanovich remaining humble is a very common thread of uruguayan society and
