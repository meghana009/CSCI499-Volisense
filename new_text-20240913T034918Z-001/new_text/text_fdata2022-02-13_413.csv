tensions in russia and a surprise federal reserve meeting are having a big impact on the crypto market this weekend what happened the cryptocurrency market started dropping on friday but the sell off hit a peak early on saturday as investors try to digest a number of macro news items that could impact all markets around the world the most pressing concern is rising tension between russia and ukraine and the federal reserve potentially calling an emergency meeting for monday as of 1 40 p m et bitcoin btc 3 62 was down 1 1 in the last 24 hours but had fallen as much as 3 4 earlier in the day ethereum eth 1 06 was down 3 5 but fell as much as 6 7 in 24 hours with a 13 gap from its thursday peak to its saturday low dogecoin doge 0 95 is down 3 4 in the last 24 hours but like ethereum was down 17 from its peak earlier in the week to the lows of this morning so what the biggest concern for crypto investors and the stock market late on friday was increasing tensions between russia ukraine and u s president biden urged americans to leave ukraine immediately saying that an invasion could happen at any time russia has been placing troops near the border and the concern is that an invitation will lead to a broader conflict with the u s and europe any uncertainty around the situation will cause investors to sell risky assets like cryptocurrencies and stocks which is a big reason the market is down right now on the policy front the federal reserve has an emergency meeting on monday to discuss interest rates following a 40 year high inflation rate of 7 5 reported last week based on the market s reaction investors are expecting a short term rate hike as early as monday in order contain inflation higher rates would make lower risk assets like bonds more attractive for investors potentially pushing money out of higher risk assets like cryptocurrencies higher rates certainly aren t a surprise in 2022 but investors may have thought increases were coming later in the year now it seems like the federal reserve will be pushing up that timeframe before inflation gets out of control now what the crypto crash over the last day and a half has been more of a macro market move rather than anything to be concerned about for bitcoin ethereum or dogecoin specifically but as they are highly volatile assets it s not surprising that these digital coins magnified the stock market s move lower on friday i wouldn t be surprised to see volatility continue over the next few weeks as well as investors digest inflation earnings and interest rate information in the crypto market investors should continue to watch utilities like payment systems and nfts as signs of growth for the industry long term that s where the future is for cryptocurrency and days like today could be buying opportunities for long term investors
some places do power rankings here at cageside we do a stock report in this weekly series we identify three superstars or groups of superstars who are on their way up and three that are moving in the opposite direction after a busy week that included rk bro winning a quiz bowl natalya beating aliyah in a dungeon style match and lita landing a moonsault on becky lynch a lot of fortunes were changed with that in mind let s see whose stock has increased the most this week stock up 3 kevin owens kevin owens doesn t wrestle in saudi arabia so he lost an elimination chamber qualifying match to austin theory on the jan 31 episode of raw he rebounded from that defeat by winning two matches on this week s feb 7 episode first he pinned theory in a rematch and then he won a tag team match against rk bro in the main event there s a storyline brewing about adam pearce not being sure if he can fit ko onto the stupendous wrestlemania card this defies logic a bit considering wrestlemania is a two night event but it indicates that wwe likely has a plan in place for ko over the next two months stock up 2 naomi naomi didn t beat charlotte flair for the smackdown women s championship in this week s feb 11 main event but she couldn t have done a better job of showing wwe s decision makers why they should push her naomi and flair simply tore the house down for roughly 20 minutes this was the best match of naomi s career and it s the only time i can recall wwe giving her this much time in a singles match naomi is now booked in a pay per view premium live event match in a tag team alongside ronda rousey will this lead to meaningful feuds for naomi opposite the top stars in the women s division it s hard to know for sure and it s still likely an uphill battle but naomi did everything possible to prove she belongs in the spotlight stock up 1 happy corbin wwe commentators made a very big deal out of happy corbin s undefeated record since adopting his new moniker if i was a betting man i d put money on corbin remaining undefeated until he puts over drew mcintyre at wrestlemania 38 even if that s not the direction it looks like happy will continue his hot streak against mid and low card jabronis like cesaro for the foreseeable future now let s see whose stock has decreased the most this week stock down 3 big e kofi kingston here is something wwe commentator corey graves said about big e on last night s smackdown i was privy to witness all of big e s wwe championship reign on monday night raw but i have to be honest with you it s as though there s a certain level of comfort that e shows when he s in the ring competing alongside kofi kingston given recent rumors about the reason behind big e s demotion from the singles upper card scene it s easy to interpret those words as wwe s way of informing the fans that big e didn t belong in his previous spot as the wwe champion and top babyface on raw i guess big e just wasn t as comfortable brushing shoulders with brock lesnar bobby lashley and seth rollins as he is mixing it up with angel and humberto that s what wwe wants you to think new day big e kofi kingston lost against los lotharios this week on smackdown i suppose someone has to put over the relatively new act so who better to do it than a pair of former wwe champions who are apparently quite comfortable losing in the mid card stock down 2 liv morgan liv morgan lost a match against doudrop this week on raw to help establish doudrop as a threat to win the elimination chamber match prior to the match there was a somewhat awkward pre taped promo where morgan admitted that her losses to becky lynch almost broke her it feels like a long time ago when fans actually had a reason to think morgan could win the raw women s championship stock down 1 damian priest wwe still doesn t seem to know where they want to go with damian priest s struggling new gimmick losses are becoming a regular thing now and he was thrown out of the royal rumble match like a nobody two weeks ago he was pinned by aj styles on this week s raw and the fan response to priest was quiet aj now gets a united states title match with damian next week it would be strange for aj to lose considering he s booked in a wwe championship elimination chamber in saudi arabia later that week so if priest is going to retain the gold he might have to resort to causing another unpopular disqualification or count out finish there you have it cagesiders whose stock do you think has changed the most this week

a new big bang for the city that is the way the ideas outlined last week by john glen mp economic secretary to the treasury for a new more competitive and agile regulatory framework have been greeted for anyone familiar with the renaissance of london following the reforms of financial regulation in 1986 it is a seductive precedent now that the uk is free from eu regulation the head of a huge british enterprise once described this to me as the ball and chain of europe we are free to get rid of restrictive practices as we did then and allow the financial services industry to go outright for the global market seductive but misleading what happened then was that we replaced its home grown regulations with the international ones developed by the us fast forward the challenge is to look at all the reasons why business might go elsewhere the uk system including the split between jobbers and brokers on the stock exchange and between investment banking merchant banking as we called it then and commercial banking had become impossible to sustain it was hard for example to justify fixed commissions for trading stocks and shares but our jobbers and brokers were too small to survive without that price cartel so we went global which led to a huge boom in london s overall financial business but at the cost of losing british ownership of most of the brokers jobbers and merchant banks it s different now what s in prospect is tweaking the present regulations some of which have been brought in as part of our membership of the eu and some of which are home grown so that we can do two things one is to increase our share of global financial business the other is to make it easier to get more of the pile of cash waiting to find a home into productive investment in britain both are admirable one of the things i have found frustrating is the focus of much of the commentary on the amount of business lost as a result of leaving the eu there was always going to be some shift because europe was going to try to use its regulatory powers to make companies move so there have been the 7 000 jobs that are reported to have gone to european centres but in the first quarter of last year there were 1 140 000 jobs in financial services in the uk including 548 000 in london and the south east that overall figure has been remarkably stable for 30 years it was 1 113 000 in 1992 and 1 119 000 in 2016 on the eve of the brexit vote fussing about the odd 7 000 jobs going is absurd what matters is whether new business and the employment that goes with it is coming to london are we getting our share of new listings does it matter if arm the chip designer for mobile phones gets its primary quote in new york rather than london is deloitte right with its global city report that london is number one city in the world for fintech companies with more than 2 100 of them my answers to those questions by the way are we are doing better but still a fair way behind new york i am afraid it does a bit and yes absolutely you see the point business is fluid what matters is how much new stuff you can generate not how much old stuff you can cling on to so the challenge is to look at all the reasons why business might go elsewhere or the ways silly bureaucratic requirements add to admin costs mr glen talked of a new agility in regulation well yes but tell that to someone i know who had to supply both their driving licence and the 30 digit code on the bottom of their passport to show they were suitable to be a trustee of a charity apparently to comply with money laundering legislation actually i suspect that issues such as the ease of getting visas for foreign staff are just as important for the uk s international business as financial regulation a final point finance is a service industry it collects savings and channels them into investments some parts work reasonably well the home loans business is an example of that and the uk is the largest residential mortgage market in europe the international financial business taken as a whole works well for if it didn t london would not rank alongside new york as one of the two financial capitals of the world what we now need is attention to detail small changes that remove blockages in the flow of funds and small changes that keep the system sweet and bring the chancers to heel

bills banning members of congress from trading stocks are gaining increased bipartisan support including from a former skeptic house speaker nancy pelosi after a series of investigations involving potential insider trading by lawmakers particularly in the early days of the covid 19 pandemic there s wide agreement among voters that legislators should be banned from trading stocks while in congress since their position can give them access to information about companies and industries that ordinary people don t have while there are some policies in place to at least provide transparency about how legislators are making money from the stock market there aren t significant punishments for violating those rules in fact as business insider s dave levinthal reported earlier this month at least 55 members of congress violated the stop trading on congressional knowledge act in 2021 alone the law better known as the stock act was passed in 2012 to curtail the use of inside information to trade stocks but many lawmakers now believe it didn t go far enough to curb abuses business insider s reporting as well as the high profile investigations of sen richard burr r nc and former sens kelly loeffler and david perdue for suspiciously well timed trades around the advent of the pandemic have somewhat belatedly spurred new energy around legislation to prevent members of congress from trading stocks while in office with multiple bills introduced in the house and senate aiming to do just that albeit with varying degrees of stringency and a lack of clarity regarding who exactly should be targeted according to craig holman a lobbyist for the government watchdog group public citizen public frustration with ethical issues and widespread public support for a stock trading ban is likely driving the current push sometimes we have to embarrass congress into doing the right thing and it works once the public gets involved he told the atlantic in january congressional leadership is also warming to the issue pelosi in a shift from her position late last year appeared to endorse a ban this week and senate majority leader chuck schumer offered his own endorsement on the senate floor this is something that the senate should address schumer said on wednesday hopefully we can act on it soon and hopefully it can be done in a bipartisan way like many of the bills we are looking at this week but while there s widespread consensus that something has to be done legislators aren t yet in agreement about key aspects of an eventual bill including who the ban should cover and how severe repercussions should be pandemic trades looked suspicious and raised alarms ethics experts say there are abundant reasons why lawmakers should be barred from trading individual stocks but the problem was cast into particularly stark relief by the start of the covid 19 pandemic specifically in early 2020 when many americans suddenly lost their jobs due to the pandemic not to mention had to deal with unexpected medical bills and child care us senators raked in millions after placing fortuitous trades in the stock market loeffler who lost her seat to democratic sen raphael warnock last year reportedly made millions after she and her husband sold some of their interests in january 2020 and invested in the teleworking company citrix the next month burr the former head of the senate intelligence committee dumped between 628 000 and 1 7 million in stocks including stocks in hotel companies just weeks before covid 19 hit the us in full force and perdue a very active trader who also lost his reelection bid in 2021 routinely traded assets of companies that his former senate committees oversaw loeffler and burr were both accused of insider trading which they fiercely denied and along with sens dianne feinstein d ca and james inhofe r ok were subject to an fbi investigation of their conduct which ultimately did not result in charges that s not especially surprising insider trading is hard to prove under normal circumstances donald sherman senior vice president and chief counsel of citizens for responsibility and ethics in washington crew told vox and when it comes to members of congress he said that bar in practical effect gets even higher insider trading is illegal for everyone not just members of congress but as sherman points out it s exceedingly hard to prove and lawmakers are subject to additional checks on their trading behavior those don t always work either according to former chief white house ethics lawyer richard painter the 2012 stock act confirmed that insider trading laws apply to members of congress and their spouses using nonpublic information learned in congress to trade securities is illegal but in the nearly 10 years since the stock act s passage nobody in congress has been prosecuted for insider trading based on congressional information specifically the stock act requires legislators to file disclosures regarding their trading activity but members of congress violate it often the law is not well enforced and the punishment for violation is often something like a 200 fine as business insider s reporting found members of congress just have way too much access to way too much information tyler gellasch a former senate staffer who helped write the stock act told politico on saturday can congress really stop members from trading stock momentum is building behind a push to ban stock trading in congress but no single clear plan has emerged so far despite bipartisan bicameral consensus on the basic policy there are multiple different proposals across both chambers of congress that vary in breadth and enforcement one of the most stringent bills introduced by sen jon ossoff d ga and sen mark kelly d az last month stipulates that not only legislators but their spouses and any dependent children put their stocks and other investment assets into a blind trust managed by an independent party for the duration of their congressional career the penalty for violating the bill s requirement would be a fine equivalent to the member s entire congressional salary according to ossoff s office members of congress should not be playing the stock market while we make federal policy and have extraordinary access to confidential information ossoff said in a press release announcing the new legislation the ossoff kelly bill which has yet to find a republican co sponsor in the senate is modeled closely on a bipartisan bill in the house which was first introduced by reps abigail spanberger d va and chip roy r tx in 2020 and reintroduced last year that bill the trust in congress act doesn t cover other asset classes like mutual funds or government bonds as its senate counterpart does but would still impose substantial divestment requirements on lawmakers if placing limitations on how we can buy and sell stock makes it so that someone trusts us a bit more congress doesn t have a great approval rating i think that is a quote unquote sacrifice we should make to positively affirm we are deserving of that trust or to positively affirm we are working for the american people and not our pocketbooks spanberger told the washington post last month but sherman the crew chief counsel says it s not enough just to divest from individual stocks and that other asset classes can be subject to insider knowledge too individual stocks is the floor he told vox and putting them in a blind trust doesn t do the job in addition to the ossoff kelly or spanberger roy proposals sens josh hawley r mo and ben sasse r ne have each introduced their own proposals the hawley bill would take a narrower approach and doesn t include a ban on dependent children s portfolios while sasse s bill comes with a hefty penalty a fine as large as 1 million up to five years in prison or both neither however has garnered as much support as the ossoff kelly or spanberger roy proposals in the house there s also the ban conflicted trading act which was introduced last year by rep raja krishnamoorthi d il and currently has 51 co sponsors ranging from rep alexandria ocasio cortez d ny to rep matt gaetz r fl that bill would ban members of congress and their senior staff from trading individual stocks but doesn t have a ban on trades for spouses and dependent children it s supported by a number of democratic senators yet another permutation of a stock trading ban the bipartisan bicameral congressional stock ownership act which counts sens elizabeth warren d ma and steve daines r mt as co sponsors does not address dependent children s holdings but covers lawmakers and their spouses and would impose a 50 000 fine for violations additionally rep katie porter d ca and sen kirsten gillibrand d ny are proposing changes to the 2012 stock act building on the current legislation by banning stock trading strengthening disclosure requirements and expanding the offices covered by the stock act to include members of the federal judiciary and federal reserve bank presidents vice presidents and members of the federal reserve boards of directors whatever congress settles on sherman told vox the penalties need to be significant enough that it does have a financial impact on violators financial penalties he said can and should have a chilling effect on legislators motivation to engage in trading likely even more so than other punitive measures the biggest hurdle might be getting legislators to agree on one bill none of the bills are perfect but ethics experts say some are better than others one particular priority spouses and children a congressional stock trade ban that doesn t cover spouses is worthless walter shaub the project on government oversight s senior ethics fellow and former director of the office on government ethics tweeted friday a congressional stock trade ban that doesn t cover spouses is worthless share this with your member walter shaub waltshaub february 11 2022 sherman agrees the exclusion of spouses and dependent children is a giant loophole he told vox that loophole is particularly visible in the case of rep mike kelly r pa whose wife victoria made thousands of dollars from stock trades potentially using inside information in april 2020 insider trading is already incredibly difficult to prove insider trading by a spouse would be even more so despite the fact that it would likely benefit both parties in the marriage a ban would also head off the appearance of impropriety regardless of actual violations for example pelosi herself benefits from the enormous wealth generated by her husband s stock trading in july 2021 paul pelosi netted 5 3 million from a well timed transaction according to fortune though there s no evidence of wrongdoing on either of their parts as katy o donnell wrote in politico despite the glut of legislation on hand there are still many unanswered questions regarding what a final bill would look like and what it could do while the sentiment of the bills is the same the specifics are so divergent that the disagreements could completely derail the positive movement toward enacting a ban lawmakers though have indicated that they re willing to compromise in pursuit of the larger goal of ending congressional stock trading what we re trying to do as a group is make sure we don t lose sight of the central premise of the immediate effort sen jeff merkley d or a co sponsor of the krishnamoorthi bill said friday now we re going to have to work to bring everybody into a common effort and make sure that this happens and we don t get distracted or lost in the field of every possibility sherman told vox that he was somewhat encouraged by the outright bipartisan support for such a measure with all the ethical reforms that have been met with roadblocks this is something that can get across the finish line and should get across the finish line he said krishnamoorthi has also signaled that he s willing to compromise on aspects of his proposal specifically banning members spouses from trading but he said at a press conference thursday right now we want this thing to move correction february

nyse bldr at the close of the third quarter in contrast to 60 hedge funds with bullish bets on the company in q2 2021 investment firm merion road capital management talked about builders firstsource inc nyse bldr in its q3 2021 investor letter here s what the fund said i added to our position in builder s firstsource bldr during the quarter bldr is the largest national supplier of structural building products and value added components to the residential construction market they have been active in consolidating the industry most notably with the merger of bmc earlier this year like other distributors bldr benefits from scale advantages that afford them a robust product offering enhanced purchasing power and fixed cost leverage they will continue to acquire smaller competitors and have announced 5 new deals so far this year i view the strategic benefit of these acquisitions in three different buckets there are the core tuck in acquisitions of facilities and customer lists that increase scale and geographic reach an example would be the company s may acquisition of john s lumber a lumber and specialty product distributor serving the detroit msa at 0 5x revenue there are product acquisitions that leverage their platform to increase distribution and improve the product offering for instance last month bldr announced the acquisition of california trusframe a designer and manufacturer of prefabricated components like trusses and wall panels at 1 3x revenue and lastly bldr has begun investing in software and services in june they spent 450mm on the purchase of wts paradigm a software company that addresses the complexity around building configuration estimating and manufacturing at 9 0x revenue by utilizing software to in the planning process wts paradigm cuts down on material and labor waste ensures an optimal fit of product and design and eases the contractor s workload bldr has followed this up with a much smaller software acquisition in september bldr is in the very early innings of their software investment so it is difficult to pinpoint exactly how it will impact the company in the coming years management believes that there is a lot of low hanging fruit pointing to a mckinsey study ranking the construction industry as second to last on overall digitization if anyone has had any work done to their house i am sure they can anecdotally attest to this bldr plans to leverage wts paradigm to increase internal productivity i e improved estimating leading to fewer visits to the job site cross sell the software to existing clients and drive greater adoption of value added products so thinking a few years out i think the goal would be to have higher margins on their commodity business a greater mix of revenue coming from value added

reported substantial room night growth compared to the year ago period which was heavily affected by covid intra quarter booking holdings consolidated room nights approached almost 90 of pre covid levels because both domestic and international travelers have had to endure a few years of pent up travel aspirations and are being eased back into the market with various governments relaxing some of their most stringent covid related travel restrictions although infection rates related to new covid variants particularly omicron have risen subsequent to last quarter we think populations around the world are coming to grips with the risk of infection and will inevitably return to spending on travel booking holdings represents a key source of demand for the small and medium sized hospitality industry and has the second largest global booking volume for alternative accommodations the latter observation is significantly misunderstood by investors and represents substantial upside to the stock regardless of the timing of the recovery of traditional hospitality spending hence we added to our position in booking holdings 6 msci inc nyse msci atalan capital s stake value 112 54 million

engagements by chidi amuta between the federal government and the organized trade union of nigerian university teachers asuu a familiar dance is about to resume few adult nigerians can remember any length of time in the recent past when asuu was not on strike the last stretch coincided with the covid 19 lockdown making it harder to know what exactly kept the students marooned at home for so long if news is the definition of momentous happenings worthy of public attention i am not sure that anyone will call an asuu strike or threats thereof news in any serious sense if the tradition of irrational obstinacy on both sides prevails as usual the teachers may resume their paid vacation in the name of strike any time from now i am not aware that they have lost even a single month s pay during each of the many decades of their serial strikes the pattern has become familiar with each threat of strike asuu reactivates a litany of unfulfilled promises and violated agreements on the part of government as employers of university teachers in federal and state service our governments have been less than responsible guarantors of public trust by any known rules of employer employee contracts our public university teachers should have been fired en masse several times over and made to refund salaries received for work not done our governments play to the gallery about the arguably unreasonable demands of asuu without admitting that the government side has been in the habit of reneging on nearly every agreement entered into with asuu responsible governments do not trifle with agreements but asuu is dealing with governments led by nigerian politicians a unique breed of cavalier creatures the persistent blame tossing between the federal government and asuu is not likely to end soon it is an unwinnable war for many reasons the governments may never find enough money to satisfy the ever expanding demands and entitlements of asuu quite disturbingly asuu leadership has become something of a perpetual profession in itself some otherwise brilliant scholars have found it more profitable to be perpetual asuu unionists than committed teachers and researchers ironically between the politicians at the ministries of labour and education respectively and professional asuu trade unionist professors endless televised negotiation sessions have become national theatre a curious reversal of roles has taken place in the process the perennial asuu chieftains in their opportunistic appeals to public sentiments have been playing politics with the future careers of our students on their part the negotiating government officials seem to enjoy the photo opportunities and endless negotiations with asuu so much that they are beginning to look more like the actual trade unionists themselves there is enough luggage of faults and blames on both sides but government bears the greater burden being the employer of academics comes with extra requirements of candor and civility asking university teachers to literally queue up for their pay while the federal ministry of finance completes a centralized digitized centralized pay platform is an insult it undermines the legal autonomy of individual universities ordinarily it is the bursary department of each university that should administer their respective staff salaries holding back arrears of sundry allowances due teachers for whatever reason is autocratic and insensitive moreover habitually reneging on agreements reached with asuu is reckless and irresponsible however in the process of the perpetual ego ping pong between politicians and asuu chieftains over the years certain fundamental questions about our university sector have been raked up it is only by asking these questions and seeking serious answers to them that we can hope to salvage our university system from the present rot is a university a social service or a business enterprise or better still is a university teacher an executive in a business venture or a civil servant in a state charity or parastatal what university tradition of all existing models is nigeria following should university education be cost free to parents and students deservedly academics like all other skilled professionals and workers need to be adequately remunerated this is even more imperative in a system that limits their options of employment to mostly the universities governments that insist on maintaining a regulatory and proprietorship stranglehold on public universities should match their monopolistic clutch by paying the teachers well politicians and parents who desire uninterrupted academic calendars and tranquility on the campuses should pocket their ego and stop treating intellectuals like mundane civil servants and glorified houseboys the long struggle between asuu and our governments is rooted in a bit of confusion on both sides about precisely what university tradition nigeria is following the assumptions that inform asuu s endless labour struggles are rooted in an old soviet style unitary university model in that model the universities belong to the government as public institutions higher education is an entitlement of all citizens who qualify hardly any fees are charged university teachers are public servants and are equal irrespective of the depth of their research and the currency of their findings they progress according to a unified pecking order not necessarily according to research relevance or significant breakthroughs a rigid government approved pay structure unites all academics irrespective of the profundity of their scholarship politically the public is indoctrinated into a certain sense of entitlement that tertiary education is the right of every citizen whether or not they can afford it the whole approach of asuu to issues of university funding and tuition fees is founded on this communist model asuu trade unionism is an offshoot of the communist era labour internationalism an ideological remnant of the cold war in this struggle for a utopian communist egalitarianism asuu teachers want to compete with politicians for lavish perks but insist on insulating the students from paying sensible fees that would make the public universities sustainable asuu unionist teachers and the more naïve students and their parents are stuck in a dead entitlement society culture new realities have emerged governments have run out of cash to fund higher education and pay the teachers but government remains reluctant to cede ownership and control it hands out appointments to university councils to all comers as political patronage the office of vice chancellor has become another chieftaincy title in which extant selection criteria are often subordinated to the whims of powerful political influencers external influence on the universities from abuja and the state capitals stretches to contract awards admissions promotions employment and staff tenure we are now in a sad place infrastructure in public universities have crumbled under the weight of student population explosion the quality of available teaching manpower has been eroded and diluted by an unplanned expansion in the size of public universities dire economic conditions have forced an exodus of high caliber academic staff either abroad or lately to the many new private universities tragically the low fees and dilapidation in our public universities are yielding vast dividends of wrath we are confronted with youth armed with cudgels machetes and even ak 47s at every street corner or highway bend sophisticated campus cyber criminals yahoo boys ritual murderers an epidemic of rape and suicides cultists and a flowering of superstition on nearly all our public university campuses the privileged children that we have sent abroad in the hope that they will return to form a new elite born in nigeria but bred and tutored abroad now return home to face the monsters that the hypocrisy and neglect of our elite have bred on the average most of nigeria s youngest and brightest are staying put in the west adding to their bank of genius while deepening our development deficits our lip service to modernity now finds a huge mocking bird at the gates of our public universities where there are endless festivals of the cultural traits of the dark ages it is not only the government that has to be blamed on the descent into hell on our public university campuses asuu s prolonged absence from its primary duty posts is a grave disservice to our youth in particular and the nation at large there is a way out as against the persisting soviet model university system we are confronted with an alternative system since 1985 86 nigeria has migrated into an imperfect free market system this reality dictates a different university model which lies somewhere between the united states and the british models the american model boasts of both private and public institutions the classic private model is at its best in places like harvard for purposes of teaching learning and research harvard boasts of some of the best faculty and facilities this solid base is supported by a sound business model which ensures the sustainability of the infrastructure and resources required to keep the tradition of excellence running but those who want to go to harvard or send their children to study there must ensure that in addition to solid academic credentials they can afford the hefty tuition and boarding costs today harvard has an endowment surplus fund in excess of 34 billion dollars slightly more than our total external reserves as a nation that fund is managed by a crop of some of the best wall street class investment experts they do what they know how to do best in order to grow the wealth of the university while the academic leadership get on with the work of research learning and teaching to sustain the tradition of excellence some of america s most successful public universities thrive on charging modest but sensible fees to ensure sustainability of systems and affordability of access their eyes are set on the models of academic excellence set by the ivy league universities while conscious of their responsibility to a wider catchment population of students in both private and public institutions the us university system lays emphasis on both academic excellence and system sustainability the university teacher remains a disciple of the long established tradition of pursuit of learning and enlightenment they are not perpetual trade unionists locked in relentless pitch battles against politicians and government bureaucrats let us face it the current regime of token fees charged in nigeria s public universities is laughable at today s rates it costs more to keep a kid in a private urban kindergarten in a term than it costs to keep an undergraduate in a nigerian public university for a whole year similarly it costs more to keep a teenager in a modest private secondary school in a year than it costs to pay for four years of public university education we cannot expect to make the top ranks of universities in the world while no one wants to pay for the facilities and personnel required to compete in a world that is surging ahead we all appreciate the value of sound uninterrupted education for our children that is why for the last 25 years most of us politicians asuu chieftains senior government officials big journalists etc have sent our university age children to some of the best institutions in the world while closing our eyes to the funding needs and the crying necessity for reform in our public universities at home we have been ready to pay an average of 50 000 75 000 a year for undergraduate courses abroad to keep our children in choice american and european universities yet we advocate the retention of paltry token fees sometimes as low as n100 000 per student per annum for undergraduate studies in nigerian public universities these schools are now reserved for the children of the less privileged only recently has a middle of the road option emerged there are now a spiraling number of private universities the rise of private universities in nigeria is driven solely and exclusively by a profit motive nigerian entrepreneurs have seen the billions of dollars nigerian parents are spending to send their children abroad and concluded that even a fraction of that amount would support a profitable sector nigeria now has a total of 79 private universities as against 43 federal and 48 state universities average tuition and accommodation costs in nigerian private universities are between n1m and n1 5m far much lower than the 50 000 average in american universities there is a disconnect between the current two penny public university and the practical realities of an open market economy and society the free market means that the labour force being trained by our soviet style university system will service the needs of a free market where labour and manpower are commodities with price tags profit and competition are the key words in this jungle unfortunately therefore our public universities need to charge sensible fees to remain competitive and sustainable infrastructure needs to be maintained and expanded libraries and laboratories need new current stock of books and equipment staff need to be motivated to go out and compare notes with their colleagues in the rest of the world so that they can compete and excel admittedly competitive fees and charges will strain the social fabric where poverty remains a limitation to high educational aspirations the politics of inequality will stroll into education where it should not but we need to initiate a series of innovations indigent students can be helped bursaries scholarships and grants from local state and federal governments as we had in the 1970s and 80s would come in handy for federal institutions grants on the basis of student enrolment would be a more advisable option the defunct students loans scheme should not be revived to advance loans tied to bonds of service after graduation students that study with loans from government should serve the nysc longer than others the differential between their nysc allowance and their market value as young graduates should be calculated as repayments for their students loans universities should be encouraged to offer both real time and online degree programmes the online option should be at a lower cost to ensure that the benefits of higher education reach the highest number of citizens nationwide trade unionism among teachers in all public universities should be prohibited by a national assembly legislation the work of university teachers in public universities should be re categorized as strategic national service on the same level as the armed and security services who cannot engage in trade unionism or collective bargaining up to 50 of municipal and junior staff jobs in the public universities should be reserved for students who opt to participate in a work study programme as janitors cafeteria servers part time cooks gardeners horticulturists electricians plumbers and drivers of campus buses university teachers salary scales should be partially deregulated teachers with more relevant research and whose work attract external grants endowments and funding should earn more than those who do more routine teaching and research as a former university teacher and asuu branch chairman i have had time to reflect on the crisis in our university system i have come up with an inconvenient conclusion both asuu and the government have been wrong all along

there is no good and there is no evil there is only the flesh and the patterns to which we submit it at least that was one of the things which the character pinhead was supposed to say according to a proposed script for one of the hellraiser movies based on the writings of clive barker even though the line was not used in the film to a certain extent there is some truth to that the dual perspective based on the good evil distinction was mostly introduced by religions such as christianity which refer to two main entities two antagonists one representing good like god and the other representing demonic evil like the devil in real life such distinctions become blurred a person can have both good and evil inside the soul what matters most is what a person chooses to act upon unfortunately many humans choose to act on evil with entities like demons which are regarded as actual manifestations of demonic evil humans acting on evil imply their choice and many sources argue that the patterns of human evil can in reality be much worse than those of demonic evil this essay looks into the origins of these ideas of good and evil through the ages the curiosity of pandora led her to open a box and release all the evils into the world archivist adobe stock demonic evil origins everywhere in christianity eve introduced sin and evil into the world by eating from the tree of knowledge some researchers claim that her sin had not been limited only to this but that she had also mated with the snake however the concept of introducing evil into the world is much older in the greek tradition pandora was the first woman having been created by the gods out of earth and water to her a box was offered which she was not to open but curiosity pushed her to do exactly the contrary when pandora opened the box received as a gift from the gods all the evils were released into the world when the woman closed the box it was already too late the evils had escaped inside the box on the bottom only the spirit of hope named elpis had remained in the bible evils appear under the form of the four horsemen of the apocalypse who are released in turn as the lamb of god opens one by one the four seals of the parchment from the right hand of god sealed in total with seven seals thus the horsemen symbolize the apocalypse announcing the coming of the moment of final judgment conquest is the first horseman who is described in the text as follows then i saw when the lamb broke one of the seven seals and i heard one of the four living creatures saying as with a voice of thunder come i looked and behold a white horse and he who sat on it had a bow and a crown was given to him and he went out conquering and to conquer interpretations of this horseman associated with military conquests sometimes consider him to be the antichrist or a representation of false prophets within the bible the second horseman is war representing mass slaughter he has a sword symbolizing the blood which will flow and he is described in the following manner when he broke the second seal i heard the second living creature saying come and another a red horse went out and to him who sat on it it was granted to take peace from earth and that men would slay one another and a great sword was given to him famine follows when he broke the third seal i heard the third living creature saying come i looked and behold a black horse and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand and i heard something like a voice in the center of the four living creatures saying a quart of wheat for a denarius and three quarts of barley for a denarius but do not damage the oil and the wine the last horseman is death or the grim reaper about whom the bible says when the lamb broke the fourth seal i heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying come i looked and behold a pale horse and he who sat on it had the name death and hades was following with him out of all the horsemen of the apocalypse only death is named in an explicit manner and about all of them as a group the biblical text affirms that authority was given to them over a fourth of the earth to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth 1796 painting death on a pale horse artist depiction of the four horsemen of the apocalypse vortbot public domain evil with demonic origins in the middle ages humans wanted to blame someone for all the evil of the world and so there began to appear thick volumes which described the appearance powers and ranks of demons from the infernal hierarchy priests told people to permanently guard themselves against the malefic influence of demons and to be vigilant in what regarded such aspects in the 13th century an abbot established the number of demons at 1 758 176 he explained every human being is pursued by several demons just like a human who dives into the sea is surrounded by water above as well as below that is how demons surround humans from all sides then after approximately 300 years the church increased the number of demons to 7 405 926 as it is said that demons have abilities domains of action and specific positions within the infernal hierarchy in the world there is a large number of demonological catalogues which record the names of demons and describe them wizards used such catalogues to choose the demons they were about to invoke to ask for their help in exchange they offered their souls to the demons nevertheless evil does not come solely from demons there have existed a lot of cases in which human evil surpassed demonic evil in terms of ingenuity and cruelty from here also come the legends about humans turned demons or about demons who look for humans as cruel and perverse as possible in order to manifest themselves and to be able to accomplish their diabolical plans depiction of the devil from 1591 public domain the devil impressed by humans roman polanski s 1999 film entitled the ninth gate follows a character specialized in finding authenticating and selling old books he must find the original variants of nine engravings placed in the correct order these were said to open the nine gates of the entrance to hell the idea presented in this modern day hollywood production comes from a much older legend it is said that in hell the devil was looking around when his attention was attracted by the evils performed by human demons this had to do with those demons who had been created from a perverted human soul the evils done by them greatly surpassed those performed by the demons who had actually been born in demonic form ever since the beginning amazed and surprised beyond measure the devil could not understand this aspect how could human demons surpass in cruelty and ingenuity actual demons desiring an answer the devil decided to incarnate himself as a human in this way he could live a number of successive lifetimes as a human being and he could discover what made human demons more atrocious and crueler than pure blood demons taking into account that he would be absent from hell for quite some time in case of emergency the devil included in his plan a safety system should his presence be greatly needed in hell a ritual would remind him his true identity a thing that would help him to take on again his true demonic form and return to his business the idea was that in the case of an emergency a certain demon would come to him before the end of the pre established number of human lives and help him execute a ritual allowing him to become himself once again the demonic ritual of initiation appears in the film mentioned previously in an adapted cinematic version according to the legend the devil did not pass through all of the pre established lives his urgent presence in hell being highly needed for this reason the devil himself has remained eternally fascinated by the cruelty of the evil with human origin people have throughout history attempted to explain the origins of demonic evil bastetamon adobe stock evil of human origin psychopathologist adrian raine from the university of southern california has conducted scientific research which has shown that a large portion of criminals have a lack of neurons in the pre frontal cortex the neurological studies have demonstrated that ever since childhood conscience the feeling of guilt and altruism appear and develop as a result of a correct functioning of the pre frontal cortex many psychopaths and criminals have suffered from apd antisocial personality disorder which determines the lack of any feeling of affection antisocial behavior perfidy and irresponsibility in addition many of these psychopaths lacked the nervous cells mentioned previously thus professor adrian raine ended up asking himself whether criminals can be considered responsible for the crimes they commit taking into consideration the fact that they are missing part of their brain he also considers that for these reasons it is late for someone to deal with the teenagers and the minors from correction schools and with convicts the right time to prevent and treat antisocial behavior is during childhood the accuracy of this study is situated somewhere at 75 so there are psychopaths who have no neuron lacking from their pre frontal cortex aside from this there are also humans who indeed have the respective neurons lacking but who do not present any antisocial behavior a psychiatrist at st bartholomew hospital of london doctor martin deahl claims that there are indeed abnormalities in the brains of psychopaths but these are not standard abnormalities on the basis of which an exact diagnostic can be attributed so in a latent state a psychopath can exist inside any individual everything depends only on specific conditions and on triggering factors the brazen bull was a roman torture device where people would be locked inside a metal bull and a fire would be lit below it stuart yeates cc by sa 2 0 torture as epitome of human evil another legend claims that saint anthony had sent a letter to the devil asking him to explain himself and to stop all evils on earth apparently the devil responded claiming that he had a lot of business to attend to in hell and no time at all to intervene in the affairs of humans in his reply he also added that saint anthony would discover the source of evils from earth if he asked the church this was a time when the inquisition had unjustly killed and tortured unthinkable numbers of people in this way a religion of mercy as christianity is regarded to be had led to the death of a larger number of people than the two world wars put together ever since antiquity as well as during the middle ages a large number of methods and instruments of torture has been created and used some more inventive than others depicted in engravings and described in real manuals of torture these taught and helped executioners in their job the brazen bull of the romans was a large metallic bull whose belly opened to allow for one or more humans to be locked inside it the fire then lit below the bull s belly made it hot and it slowly fried the man inside meanwhile the cradle of judas implied sitting the condemned on a pyramid shaped chair with a sharp top the bindings made for every movement no matter how small to move the entire body to increase pain the pain was unbearable because the sharp edge was stuck inside the anus or inside the vagina and as the chair was not really washed even in the case of an acquittal the individual could die shortly after because of the infections resulted after applying the torture method other convicts were locked inside cabinets in the form of a sarcophagus which had spikes on the interior this was the iron maiden which in the moment when it was locked it would pierce the body of the convict with its spikes killing him other methods of torture included the wheel which ensured a very slow death the old method of flaying and impaling invented by the turks witches and wizards were executed by placing a board on top of their horizontally bound bodies on the board very heavy boulders were placed the condemned being able to hear their bones crushing before death in the cases in which confessions were wanted the chair with spikes was the most often used the use of the lethal injection is the ultimate expression of human evil felipecaparros adobe stock human evil evident in the death penalty in the world there are no new things only new people there are still countries where the death penalty continues to be applied through various methods such as the lethal injection hanging shooting or the electric chair in the case of the first method three substances sodium thiopental a barbituric which sedates the convict pancuronium bromide which paralyzes the muscles and the lungs and blocks the breathing system and potassium chloride which causes cardiac arrest are introduced in turn inside the body of the condemned in doses established in such a way that only a single one can cause death studies performed in this regard have shown that in the cases without a proper anesthesia even though pancuronium bromide paralyzes the lungs and the muscles it leaves the convict in a perfect state of lucidity in this state the convict goes through a state of suffocation intensified by injecting the potassium chloride this latter substance irritates the walls of blood vessels and the individual passes through the sensation of burning alive because of these terrible pains which it produces pancuronium bromide has been forbidden when it comes to animal euthanasia in the case of humans it is still used because with the individual being sedated from the exterior perspective of those who are witnesses to the event all that is observed is an individual who seems unconscious who does not move and whose calm expression leaves the sensation of a slow descent into an eternal sleep why is such an awful and painful method of execution still used in the case of humans on one side because it induces fear the fear of breaking the law and committing crimes legally punishable by death from this perspective it is a method of control and of making sure the laws are respected from an external perspective the mental comfort of those who witness such an execution is taken into account many have no idea about the pain the convict experiences they just see him tied up and sedated having the impression of a calm death only a few are aware of the reality of the actual excruciating pain felt by the convict in fact a painless method of execution implies quickly destroying the nerves that send the pain signals to the brain this could be achieved by attaching explosives to a convict s head and detonating them but for lawbreakers this would mean a fast painless death and for the witnesses to the execution it would imply a disturbing sight so no fear for potential lawbreakers to deter them and no moral comfort for those who witness the execution when it comes to myths and legends as relates to demons these merely symbolize the latent evil that exists inside every human as long as evil continues to exist in the world these legends will attempt to offer up explanations to help us understand the inexplicable potential for cruelty that exists in human nature top image personification of demonic evil source likozor adobe stock by phoenix vald

after the blessed virgin mary and her assorted shrines and grottoes evangelical catholics in canada and united states flock to and draw inspiration from the north american martyrs shrines in midland ontario and auriesville new york where collectively six clerics and two donné or lay people were killed supposedly in odium fidei in hatred of the faith representation of the north american martyrs communio the pageant after world war two jesuit showman and strong anti communist daniel lord produced a pageant in the large auditorium in auriesville it presented native americans dancing around pyres of burning wood ready to slay the jesuit priests in that grisly way we all heard of growing up catholic in the 1960 s and before more recent representations show pacified native people in outrageously inaccurate dress father john wynne the auriesville shrine s most zealous promoter said that the canonization of the eight men in 1930 was a godsend to the american catholic church it gave stature to a relatively small politically powerless religious body which was suspect in matters of doctrinal purity americanism was one of the modernisms that the papacy was obsessed with in the late 19th century by the hierarchs in rome and under represented in councils and synods interior of the coliseum at the national shrine of the north american martyrs auriesville new york showing the sanctuary and high altar public domain in the early decades of the 20th century first generation american catholic immigrants feeling the sting of wasps white anglo saxon protestants all around them could now believe themselves to be fully native sons and beloved children of the true church this is quite ironic since the eight men were all french and most died in canada what impact do the martyrs shrines have today the martyr s shrines and the devotional cult that has developed around them is relevant to the roman catholic church s ongoing dialogue and healing with indigenous peoples since it was one specific native group now known as the haudenosaunee but formerly feared and reviled as the iroquois that traditionally have been charged with the death of the eight men however in jurisprudence and courts of law there is a term called justifiable homicide we shall see how it may be applied here recommendations 58 60 in the canadian government s truth and reconciliation commission report where the pope himself is called to issue a formal apology to native peoples in canada relates to the martyrs shrines the phrase to respect indigenous spirituality in its own right and prevent spiritual violence refers to the activities catholic clerical orders such as the recollects sulpicians and the society of jesus jesuits engaged in hundreds of years ago in the untamed wilderness of north america le grand voyage du pays des hurons 1632 by gabriel sagard public domain no formal study has been done about the influence among catholic and non catholics alike that the martyrs shrines have had on shaping attitudes towards not just the iroquois but all indigenous people leading indirectly to intergenerational trauma and then to everything from biased court verdicts missing aboriginal women and polluted water on northern reserves the martyrs shrines have yielded thousands of cultural artifacts from tea sets to commemorative plates inscribed rosaries pennants medals and postcards over the decades martyrs shrine midland ontario canada terry adobe stock there have been special masses with high ranking dignitaries present youth pageants tour bus excursions

shrine midland ontario author provided visitors recall statues and paintings pitting the dreaded savages against the noble jesuit priests that are apparently now locked away in the labyrinth of rooms and corridors underneath the midland shrine this statue in orillia says a great deal just by the different placement of the figures a statue showing a jesuit priest and two indigenous people in orillia ontario canada author provided collectively can all of this have added to a negative and skewed impression of indigenous people it is a problem which has accrued over the years and one that the catholic church must now do its part to correct the wendat in 1632 the jesuits were given the sole task of ministering to aboriginals in new france the most promising group was the iroquois speaking wendat people dwellers of the peninsula traditionally known as the hurons from french hure meaning ruffian or savage who resided in palisaded villages of up to 2 000 people in a rectangle of land measuring a mere thirty five miles 56 33 km from east to west and twenty miles 32 19 km from north to south in present day simcoe county in ontario canada the bressani map of 1657 depicts the martyrdom of jean de brébeuf and gabriel lalemant public domain the wendat were first contacted by the explorer samuel champlain in 1615 who reported the presence of 30 000 sedentary people tilling the soil for most of their food supply they were organized like the iroquois to the south in a confederacy consisting of four tribes the discovery of the wendat nation must have shocked the europeans since they were used to interacting with nomadic algonquin s and montagnais who largely lived on roots fish caught from streams and small animals the catholic clerics who accompanied champlain envisioned a rich harvest of worthy souls although their numbers had been depleted by disease mostly smallpox which they had no natural immunity to combat the wendat were still a proud fierce entrepreneurially minded people with impressive physiques and sophisticated spiritual practices including the remarkable feast of the dead in the end only a few christianized hurons who were pragmatists rather than true believers resigned themselves to the fact the europeans were the wave of the future the jesuit project was a failure three huron wyandot chiefs from the huron reservation lourette now called wendake in quebec canada at far left is michel tsioui teachendale war chief center is stanislas coska aharathaha second chief of the council at far light is andre romain tsouhahissen first chief of the council public domain the catholic religion was institutional hierarchal and dogmatic while the wendat s was spiritual animistic and non hierarchal however there appeared to have been a catholic wendat hybrid religion in which elements of both traditions were melded together this acculturated catholicism still exists in parts of mexico and india and is enthusiastically embraced by pope francis in canada s first nation ground breaker olive dickason whose 1970 mcgill university doctoral thesis was the first dissertation ever written on first nations people in canada claims that it was the economic benefits of the fur trade that both the wendat and french sought over half of the furs sent back to europe came through the wendat and their trading connections with northern and western tribes it was champlain who was insistent upon having the missionaries present a huron wendat hunter calling moose public domain dickason argues the wendat were likely to become christian because they could then get the same price for their furs as french traders it must be said here that the only reason we know anything about the wendat and their kin the petun tobacco and chonnonton neutrals is due to the annual reports that the jesuit priests in the field sent to the superior general in quebec each summer who then sent them onto the provincial of the order in paris these have been compiled in twenty three volumes called the jesuit relations and allied documents and may represent the most precise detailed ethnographic record of any indigenous people so early in the contact period page after page provides meticulous detail on how the wendat went to war how they dressed how they practiced slash and burn agriculture and on the nuances of the huron language all of this is broken by earnest lamentations on the seemingly impossible task of conversion read part ii top image skull in the martyrs shrine midland ontario canada source jeff s

by s t patrick while every generation waxes retrospectively about their halcyon days each generation also marks the loss of its innocence with a great american tragedy for the greatest generation as tom bro kaw termed them it was pearl harbor for baby boomers it was the assassination of president john f kennedy for generation x it was 9 11 as we approach the 20th anniversary of sept 11 2001 watching the biden administration marginally pull out of afghanistan there are still unanswered questions that plague any serious study into that day unlike the kennedy assassination research community that has spent decades digging a continental divide between the lone nutters and the conspiracy theorists there are many valuable lines of research that have emanated from the search for answers regarding the bombing of the world trade center wtc in 1993 the attack on the wtc and the pentagon in 2001 and the downing of united flight 93 over pennsylvania the mainstream research community is best evidenced by peter lance an award winning journalist who was a former correspondent for abc news lance does not believe there is a 9 11 conspiracy that goes beyond massive governmental malfeasance and legal incompetence in digging into the governmental blunders however lance has now done two dec ades of the best work on the events leading up to 9 11 lance is the author of 1000 years for revenge international terrorism and the fbi the untold story triple cross how bin laden s master spy penetrated the cia green berets and the fbi and cover up what the government is still hiding about the war on terror lance s general thesis is that there are political reasons why the fbi s new york office bungled simple leads that could have easily created a valuable timeline that led to 9 11 many of the main characters operated openly and under their noses one such operator was omar abdel rahman the blind sheik who taught at mosques around new york city and personally guided spiritually those found responsible for the 1993 world trade center bombing it was the sheik s student el sayyid nossair who was also linked to the 1990 assassination of rabbi meir kahane founder of the jewish defense league terror group lance charges that u s attorney patrick fitzgerald mislead the courts and the public in ways that failed to uncover an al qaeda cell in new york city triple cross details al qaeda spy ali muhammad s infiltration of the u s intelligence apparatus in the years just before 9 11 similar to what rahman did with religion muhammad trained the top al qaeda operators within the u s in spy craft and violent militarism because muhammad was embedded into american culture he also trained them to act as americans muhammad s trainees included nossair and others involved in the 1993 wtc bombing and the kahane assassination the negligent character in triple cross is fitzgerald who later became the u s attorney in chicago and prosecuted both journalist judith miller and illinois gov rod blagojevich fitzgerald began a public relations campaign trying to get harper collins to pull triple cross it was unsuccessful lance s three 9 11 books are the canon for mainstream coverage and it s unlikely that anyone will do better critical work that follows the road to 9 11 david ray griffin is the author of the new pearl harbor and many other valuable 9 11 works for those ultra skeptical of the u s government s 9 11 narrative griffin should be the starting point that jim marrs and former liberty lobby attorney mark lane are for the jfk assassination the title is taken from the neo conservative group project for a new american century pnac a group that before 9 11 released a call to action in the middle east entitled rebuilding america s defenses one section stated further the process of transformation even if it brings revolutionary change is likely to be a long one absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event like a new pearl harbor to those who do not believe the mainstream media narrative on the events of 9 11 sept 11 is that new pearl harbor the false flag used to invade iraq and afghanistan as pnac had always wanted to do pnac included dick cheney donald rumsfeld paul wolfowitz richard perle james woolsey john bolton and others it was founded by bill kristol and robert kagan the husband of controversial joe biden state department appointee victoria nuland griffin and others such as kevin ryan also look at the typical conspiratorial questions regarding 9 11 was there an implosion in new york city at what temperature does steel melt is it possible that thermite was used why were there no visible plane parts shown after the pentagon was hit in the most protected air corridor in the world why does no clear video of the pentagon being attacked publicly exist what was posted on the pentagon website was admittedly a recreation of the event if a pilot did make that difficult turn and dive into the pentagon why does the hole not seemed shaped as such that the wings hit the walls as well as the nose why were parts of united 93 spread for miles over the fields of pennsylvania was united 93 shot down by u s military aircraft what happened to building 7 and why did it collapse was there an order to pull it building 7 meaning to implode it by controlled demolition who profited from the insurance policies on the world trade center complex and who shorted the stocks just before 9 11 whatever happened to the dancing israelis there are so many questions that stem from the events of 9 11 griffin boldly and brilliantly covers them all but what lance and griffin do so well is to criticize the road to 9 11 and the government s bungling of events after the attacks the 9 11 commission was another warren commission in terms of its selective use of evidence and it s mishandling or ignoring of important witnesses that did not fit the narrative they needed told compared to the volume of work that has been done on pearl harbor or jfk 9 11 is a toddler today lance and griffin deserve your attention but the best work may be ahead of us

with accelerating climate variability and change novel approaches are needed to warn managers of changing ecosystem state and to identify appropriate management actions one strategy is using indicator species like seabirds as ecosystem sentinels to monitor changes in marine environments here we explore the utility of western gulls larus occidentalis breeding on southeast farallon island as a proxy of ecosystem state in coastal california by investigating the interannual variability in gull foraging behavior from 2013 to 2019 in relation to upwelling conditions prey abundances and overlap with humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae as gulls frequently feed in association with whales western gulls have a flexible diet and forage on land and at sea we combined gull gps tracking data during the incubation phase ecosystem survey data on multiple predator and prey species and derived oceanographic upwelling products when foraging at sea gulls overlapped with cool upwelled waters during 2015 2017 25 more gull foraging trips visited land than in other years where land trips were on average 8 h longer and 40 further than sea trips which coincided with high compression of coastally upwelled waters habitat compression in 2015 2016 gull foraging behavior was related to local prey abundances where more foraging occurred near shore or on land when prey abundances were low however visual surveys indicated that 70 of humpback whale observations co occurred with gulls and the year with the most foraging on land 2017 corresponded to regionally low relative whale abundances suggesting gull movement patterns could be an indicator of whale presence further both whales and gulls forage near shore under high upwelling habitat compression and low krill abundance hence the deployment of year round tags on gulls with the capability of near real time data accessibility could provide important fine scale metrics for conservation and management of the threatened yet recovering eastern pacific humpback whale population between infrequent and coarse surveys entanglement in fishing gear and ship strikes are major inhibitors to whale recovery and have increased concomitantly with human use of ocean resources moreover as climate variability and change increase novel indicators should be explored and implemented to inform marine spatial planning and protect species across multiple scales from new risks introduction ecological indicators can be used to assess ecosystem state such as indicator species that are easy to monitor respond to a stressor in a predictable way and can be used to guide management actions dale and beyeler 2001 siddig et al 2016 samhouri et al 2017 seabirds are near the apex of most marine food chains and thus many are well known as ecosystem sentinels to monitor changes in marine environments durant et al 2009 hazen et al 2019 grémillet et al 2020 sydeman et al 2021 for example seabird foraging behavior breeding phenology breeding success diet population and body condition can be indicative of the productive capacity of ecosystem states durant et al 2009 sydeman et al 2021 long term monitoring of seabirds can be accomplished using different methodologies demographic monitoring at breeding colonies biologging as a means to characterize movement and distribution and at sea visual surveys each approach provides different but often complementary information on the annual status of a population analyzed separately demographic monitoring provides no information of at sea distributions biologging distribution data is often limited to a small number of individuals and at sea surveys provide population level distribution data but are only a snapshot in time however when evaluating the utility and potential effectiveness of a seabird species indicator the power of compiling information from different monitoring approaches may provide a more holistic ecosystem view novel ecosystem based management approaches such as indicators and dynamic ocean management tools are increasing in use in the california current region to understand various interacting factors that threaten species survival for example through the california current integrated ecosystem assessment cciea a variety of environmental biological economic and social indicators are publicly available harvey et al 2020 in addition there are operational dynamic ocean management tools aimed at protecting key species from human activity or other ecosystem stressors many of these tools provide either an annual index or the resolution of the mapped data is limited by satellites or models days to months 10 25 km as climate change and variability are amplified indicators at higher spatiotemporal scales that improve predictability are increasingly necessary e g days to weeks 10 km the foraging locations and trip characteristics of tracked animals such as seabirds can resolve key fine scale oceanographic or predator prey dynamics that in conjunction with current ecosystem indicators can improve our understanding of ecosystem state for management for example seabird hotspots from multispecies tracking data can inform marine protected area design davies et al 2021 thus considering additional indicators is critical as increased variability in ecosystem conditions has led to surprises in ecological interactions and a recognition that new approaches are needed for effective management santora et al 2020 a particularly concerning issue in the california current system is severe whale injury or mortality as a result of entanglements in fishing gear and ship strikes williams and o hara 2010 redfern et al 2013 rockwood et al 2021 with the urgent need to utilize ecosystem data to advise marine resource management working groups were established to develop mitigation strategies and understand drivers of increased whale entanglement santora et al 2020 feist et al 2021 ingman et al 2021 and ship strikes hazen et al 2017 abrahms et al 2019 blondin et al 2020 rockwood et al 2020 specifically humpback whales megaptera novaeangliae can shift between onshore and offshore foraging habitats depending on prey availability driven by upwelling conditions see figure 1 shoreward upwelling habitat compression can lead to nearshore foraging and intensify the overlap between whales and nearshore crab fishing gear santora et al 2020 thus a monthly habitat compression index hci the areal extent of cool upwelled water aids in understanding the risk of interactions between fishing activities and humpback whales however the hci was not designed to capture the fine scale spatiotemporal dynamics of whale distributions given it is calculated monthly integrated over 4 5 latitude suggesting the development of other high resolution indicators would be useful figure 1 figure 1 conceptual model showing how climate variability causes optimal or suboptimal upwelling habitat conditions that alters the distribution and or abundance of prey and humpback whales which leads to changes in western gull foraging behavior the habitat compression index hci is an existing environmental indicator that was developed to predict the risk of interactions between crab fishing activities and humpback whales in this study we propose western gull foraging behavior as a new ecological indicator that provides higher resolution information on ecosystem conditions compared to the hci seabirds and cetaceans often associate at sea either through overlapping spatial distributions when targeting the same foraging habitats yen et al 2004 cox et al 2018 sutton et al 2019 or by maximizing foraging efficiency when feeding together harrison 1979 ballance et al 1997 maxwell and morgan 2013 in these feeding associations seabirds are the likely beneficiaries as cetaceans make food more accessible by driving prey that is typically out of reach toward the surface and sometimes concentrating prey into tight groups evans 1982 gulls are one species known to benefit from associating with whales e g harrison 1979 haynes et al 2011 garcía cegarra et al 2020 because they are only capable of shallow plunge dives henkel 2009 in particular western gulls larus occidentalis are regionally abundant throughout coastal california and oregon spanning the range of biologically productive waters known for high cetacean biodiversity and are anecdotally known to associate with whales when breeding western gulls are central place foragers with high repeatability in foraging locations a capacity to respond quickly to changing conditions due to relatively high flight speeds and they often feed in aggregations when attracted by social facilitation shaffer et al 2017 their adaptability is also related to being a generalist carnivore feeding on a diversity of forage species while at sea and exploiting human refuse when feeding at landfills and urban centers annett and pierotti 1989 annett and pierotti 1999 cassell 2016 shaffer et al 2017 conservation strategies building upon seabird cetacean feeding associations have been suggested veit and harrison 2017 but these common multi species associations have not been explored as an ecological indicator here we examined the movement patterns and distribution of western gulls to evaluate their utility as an indicator of ecosystem state and specifically humpback whale presence in coastal central california humpback whales migrate through central california to feed on krill and forage fish historically during the late summer fall upwelling season calambokidis et al 2000 but currently arrive in the farallon island region in may june nearly 4 months earlier than during the early 1990s ingman et al 2021 this time period overlaps with the incubation and chick rearing phases of western gulls breeding at the farallon islands using multiple years of high resolution tracking data from incubating western gulls we characterized interannual variability in foraging behavior e g foraging at sea vs on land trip distance and duration in relation to 1 upwelling conditions 2 prey abundances and 3 humpback whale presence we combined gull tracking data with ecosystem assessment surveys that monitor predator and prey species abundances and upwelling conditions derived from an oceanographic model ultimately the ecosystem relationship between predator prey oceanographic interactions see figure 1 allowed us to test whether western gull foraging movements and distributions could serve as an indicator of ecosystem conditions and humpback whale feeding aggregations in an effort to minimize negative human impacts on this threatened species we aim to show that gull foraging behavior can provide a high resolution near real time indicator of where and when whales may be foraging or switching their distributions to nearshore regions indicating a shift in ecosystem state see figure 1 where entanglement or ship collision is more likely to occur combining multiple data streams leads to a better understanding of indicators and more robust conservation and planning approaches materials and methods western gull tracking and data processing western gulls were studied at southeast farallon island 37 697n 123 001w within the farallon islands national wildlife refuge located 45 km from the coast of san francisco california united states southeast farallon island is one of the largest seabird breeding colonies in the eastern pacific and has the largest breeding population of western gulls in california ainley 1990 in addition to this region containing important seabird habitat the san francisco bay area contains a large port with high shipping and fishing traffic high humpback whale density and is a hotspot for the commercial dungeness crab metacarcinus magister fishery the largest fixed gear fishery in central california feist et al 2021 birds were captured using noose mats or a single foot snare during the incubation phase of breeding between mid may and early june of each year in 2013 2019 see shaffer et al 2017 table 1 their breeding phenology at this colony is remarkably consistent sydeman et al 1991 western gull pairs exchange incubation duties where one individual forages while the mate remains at the nest to incubate and protect the eggs each gull was captured twice at their nest once to deploy a gps logger and again 2 6 days later for logger recovery a total of 133 adults table 1 were equipped with a gps data logger 20 g igotu gt 120 or 32 g gt 600 mobile action technology taiwan that recorded location data at 1 2 min intervals spatial accuracy 3 4 m manufacturer specifications gps loggers were encased in adhesive line heat shrink tubing and attached to the base of 4 5 central tail feathers using tesa tape for a total package that was 30 min in duration and 1 km away from the colony because gulls can make short trips offshore to drink or rest foraging trip metrics included the maximum linear distance from the colony total travel distance over a trip and trip duration measured as the total time outside of a 1 km buffer from the colony shaffer et al 2017 within trip activity patterns were categorized into periods of transiting travel speeds 6 km h 1 between consecutive locations and stationary travel speeds 10 had no support burnham and anderson 2002 we removed models that had negative r2 values which indicated the model fit was worse than a horizontal line we report the r2 deviance explained and akaike weight as an indicator of model performance for all models with a δaic c 0 05 but the durations of land trips were significantly longer than sea trips in all years z statistic z 3 7 to 11 9 p 0 05 in all years the maximum distances of land trips were significantly farther than sea trips z 2 8 to 12 6 p 20 for the proportion of foraging events on land indicates low whale abundances or suboptimal at sea foraging habitats second gull tracking data could be mapped and viewed in relation to crab pot fishing vessel locations or shipping lanes e g figure 6 and alerts can be set up to provide an early warning system of potential human wildlife conflicts for example when the gull core foraging area overlaps with a shipping lane vessel speed reductions could be implemented until that region is no longer highly utilized by gulls likened to a seasonal management area with the designation of temporary areas to be avoided keen et al 2019 found a 2 3 kt reduction significantly reduces ship strike risk by 20 50 core foraging areas could also indicate risky crab pot deployment locations or signal fishers to retrieve deployed gear third more simply notifying ship captains of these predictable seabird cetacean relationships could mitigate ship strike risk as it is easier to spot a gull aggregation above the water and adjust course than a whale on the sea surface visualizations or metrics derived from the tracking data could feed into existing ocean observing dashboards and provide information to the public fishers fisheries managers scientists and other teams who consider the tradeoffs between economic needs and the risk to protected resources tracking data yields cost effective information on fine time and space scales complementing and improving upon existing coarse resolution indicators used in central california the tracking and monitoring of new indicator species in addition to existing indicators can provide critical information for identifying and establishing management tools and arming managers with the best

and i know you re all busy people here s the definition government by the least suitable or competent citizens of a state as regular readers will also know i m currently in america where disturbing details of their own recent kakistocracy under donald trump are coming to light as the committee investigating the attack on the us capitol last january makes headway in his last days in office trump did a lot of firing of competent people and replacing them with deeply unsuitable ones his bodyguard was put in charge of white house personnel a former marine with very little experience became secretary of state for defence arguably the most important position in the cabinet their qualifications just one unstinting loyalty to trump and so to the uk there s dominic raab the deputy pm but also the justice minister someone who should be technically interested in you know justice saying that boris johnson s disgraceful lies about keir starmer failing to prosecute jimmy savile the same lies repeated by the right wing mob who tried to attack starmer last week were just part of the cut and thrust of politics that they were in effect just there s nadine dorries the minister for digital and culture going around happily thinking that the internet has existed for about 10 years there s jacob rees mogg being made minister for brexit opportunities the job title equivalent of minister of

been made poorer by the decision to leave the eu a decision rees mogg encouraged them to make by the way nah me neither there s liz truss the foreign secretary took a trip to moscow and managed to destroy uk russia relations at a time when war is looming on the ukrainian border the whole thing would have been like an episode of mr bean if it wasn t for the fa hang on we need to stop there for a moment don t we we need to stop and ask ourselves in what world could someone like truss reach the position of foreign secretary like all her colleagues i just mentioned only in a world where the man who hires them requires just one skill set total loyalty here s an interesting thought experiment to help you get a feel for the level of kakistocracy we re living in these days jack monroe recently wrote about the appalling effects of inflation on food poverty in the uk she has now succeeded in getting supermarkets to pay attention to her with asda promising to stock its budget ranges in all 581 supermarkets and online the retailer said we want to help our customers budgets stretch further and have taken on board the comments about the availability of our smart price range made by jack monroe there you had it someone who genuinely knows what they are talking about monroe has lived in food poverty and written about it extensively convincing the powerful to do something decent to help the less fortunate in society but last week there was another woman in the public eye making comments about a hot button issue tv presenter kirstie allsopp in a newspaper interview she talked about young people and home ownership she suggested that kids needed to give up luxuries such as netflix gym memberships and coffee if they wanted to be able to afford a house she also suggested people could move in with their parents or find homes up north in cheaper areas when i bought my first property the foolish human doily went on the whole going abroad easyjet coffee gym netflix lifestyle didn t exist naturally it didn t take long with a calculator to find out that a first time buyer who gave up a starbucks latte every day a netflix subscription a gym membership and two return flights to europe on easyjet a year would save about 1600 annually according to halifax the average deposit for a first time buyer is now 59 000 that s right it would take someone in their 20s just 37 years of cutting out these luxuries in order to save up that kind of deposit they d probably make it into their new place just in time for it to become their retirement home their new retirement home up north hundreds of miles away from the children who ll soon need to be looking after them similarly it also didn t take long with google to find out that allsopp s father is baron allsopp former chairman of the auction house christie s and that she grew up in a privately educated life of privilege oh and her parents gave her the deposit for that first property she bought again there you have it a clueless buffoon with absolutely no idea how ordinary people live throwing around idiotic patronising and utterly unworkable comments about how they should run their lives so here s the thought experiment which one of these women could you see being asked to serve in johnson s cabinet yep me too welcome to downing street madame allsopp the new minister for housing and poverty you ll fit right in around here don t

startup sees first florida launch end in heartbreak and loss of 4 satellites poseidon is 4 satellites richer following an unsuccessful rocket launch from up and coming space company astra the launch was the first time for the company operating out of cape canaveral florida and was expected to be a landmark occasion announcing their entry into the east coast space race rocket 3 was carrying 4 satellites from the nasa elana 41 mission on a trip cut far too short shortly after the 1st stage disengaged from the rocket rocket 3 appeared to fall out of its previous trajectory as the cameras on the ground showed a small dot from the camera aboard the rocket the second stage was shown to ignite and almost immediately tumble end over end recording for a few seconds before cutting out entirely the satellites included are of course unrecoverable lost somewhere in the sea the first of the losses was the bama 1 cubesat by the university of alabama which was testing a drag sail meant to evaluate a deorbit accessory for end of life satellite termination the second was new mexico state university s ionospheric neutron content analyzer a satellite that would have studied the neutron spectrum in low orbit the third was the qubesat from uc berkeley it would have tested the effects of space on quantum gyroscopes lastly the r5 s1 satellite from the johnson space center was a cheap technology demonstrator designed to evaluate certain equipment for further use testing out better hardware improved transmission capability and improved software astra has not released their statement yet and what exactly went wrong remains to be seen the failure follows another no go from a week previous when rocket 3 scrubbed the second attempted launch only 50 minutes into the short 3 hour launch window astra stood down that day with ceo and founder chris kemp saying that out of an abundance of caution we are giving the team time to complete a more complete review of the data under the tweet a plethora of detectives began dissecting every bit of media available from the launch one noted the on board camera catching a brief weight shift that they surmise was an unsecured element either payload or equipment they noted the shift happening just after the cutoff of the 1st stage which was then followed by the 2nd stage rotation just before its ignition other theories included the possibility of moisture buildup around the explosive bolts caused by the wait time in the humid florida atmosphere the explosive bolts being iced over could have led to a failure during stage separation which would account for the tumble if the rocket was subjected to asymmetric thrust unfortunately for the small startup failure in all its forms is punished quite harshly by the market over the last week astra stock tumbled from around 5 29 on february 9th to 3 28 2 days later the ceo s apology tweet became a battlefield for earnest space enthusiasts accepting the difficulty of making rockets from scratch and angry day traders smarting from their wounds i ve now lost 120 000 investing in astra said one investor i feel they entered the public trading market far too soon and people like me have suffered i know it s my fault for not understanding spaceflight so i am not blaming astra others echoed the sentiment the most unlucky astra buyers being those who bought in at 19 55 in february 2021 many remain optimistic noting the growing pains inherent to every space venture ideally the lessons learned from rocket 3 will prevent future occurrence of a repeat failure and astra seems set on acing the next one
tehran afp for literature lovers in sanction hit iran a new novel has long provided a brief respite from a grinding economic crisis triggered by international pressure imposed over tehran s contested nuclear programme advertising read more but now losing yourself in a good book is becoming harder as cash strapped publishers struggle because the price of paper is soaring if a 200 page novel sold for 400 000 rials 1 60 last year its price today is 1 000 000 rials 4 10 most of which is the cost of production said reza hasheminejad who runs the ofoq publishing house iran does not produce its own paper pulp for publishing so relies on imports and while those are not under sanctions they must be paid for in foreign currency that means the price of a book depends directly on the fluctuation of iran s rial so publishers are not only slashing the number of titles published but also cutting the number of pages of those they do print by shrinking the font size a member of staff at iran s houpa publishing house prepares publications for transfer to bookshops larger publishers have had to adapt to survive atta kenare afp publishing has suffered a major crisis which could become existential said emily amrai collection director at the houpa publishing house while publishers worldwide face growing challenges to the way people read and consume literature iran is facing an extra problem the united states under former president donald trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from a landmark accord to prevent iran from acquiring an atomic bomb a goal tehran has always denied pursuing with washington then reimposing tough economic sanctions as soon as the us sanctions were reinstated in 2018 the price of paper rose amrai said a miracle long running negotiations to revive a deal with iran continue in austria but until an international agreement turns the page the impact of sanctions grows worse the devaluation of our currency against the greenback the global rise in the price of paper paid in dollars and the increase in the cost of transport also paid in foreign currency has plunged publishing into the doldrums said hossein motevali owner of houpa which specialises in children s books houpa publishing house owner hossein motevali says he is at the mercy of currency fluctation i can lose everything atta kenare afp because book prices are fixed in iran profits are pegged to the rapidly fluctuating price of paper between receiving the manuscript laying it out and setting the price of the book i can lose everything if the price of paper has gone up suddenly hasheminejad said that happens because i m at the mercy of the fluctuation of the currencies as for the authors they are paid by the number of the pages in the book whether they are famous or not selling books is a miracle today because the majority of customers belong to the middle class and given the economic conditions their priority is to obtain essential goods such as food said

recent hits shock but as the crisis deepens several small publishing houses have been driven out of business today many independent publishers who have published excellent works have been eliminated from the market said amrai a book stall in tehran where even a second hand title can be difficult to afford atta kenare afp larger publishing houses have had to adapt to survive we have reduced our profits by as much as possible in order to keep our customers we have reduced printing and pagination and publish digital books to avoid paper and reduce costs said hasheminejad but that will only last a year or two for even the most solid companies so far books printed before recent spikes in paper costs provided a buffer but those stocks are running low in a few months when the books stored in the depots are exhausted it will be a shock for the customer when they see the new prices hasheminejad warned on enghelab street tehran s main book market retired teacher behjat mazloumi 60 already

condominiums under construction in dana point calif in 2021 bing guan bloomberg with demand waning and supplies increasing the housing market is in for a lot of pain low interest rates have been a boon to housing making mortgages more affordable and allowing consumers to refinance existing loans with many of them tapping the equity in their homes for extra cash in the third quarter of 2021 loans for refinancing totaled 512 billion compared with 442 billion for purchases but the federal reserve is tightening monetary policy and rates on 30 year fixed rate mortgages have already risen from 2 82 in february 2021 to a recent 3 84 also the spread between those mortgage rates and yields on 10 year u s treasuries to which they are linked has risen from 1 4 percentage points in may to 1 9 percentage points suggesting that mortgage rates will continue to rise faster than treasury yields furthermore the central bank was a massive buyer of mortgage backed securities purchasing some 2 7 trillion during the last cycle or 23 of the amount outstanding as it concludes those purchases in march and then very likely begins to sell what it holds the negative effects on the mortgage market will be much greater than past fed tightenings no wonder that a survey released by fannie mae this week showed that the share of americans who think it s a good time to buy a house fell to an all time low of 25 in january the high probability of a fed precipitated recession is also a major negative for single family housing the central bank doesn t intend to touch off business downturns when it tightens credit but in 11 of the 12 times in raised its main policy rate since the early 1950s a recession followed the only soft landing was in the early 1990s the challenge of ending purchases of treasuries and mortgage backed securities and reducing its balance sheet assets this time only raises the likelihood of a recession if the fed dumps mortgage related securities on the market the increased supply will reduce demand for new issues by banks and other institutional buyers further raising borrowing costs meanwhile monthly rents jumped more than 14 in december from a year earlier according to redfin this has made homeownership more attractive but also reduced funds available for downpayments just as bigger downpayments are needed to compete with the plethora of all cash buyers last month the median single family house price jumped 14 to 357 000 from a year earlier according to redfin the median priced house leaped from 4 2 times median household income in the first quarter of 2019 to 5 6 times median in the fourth quarter of 2021 exceeding the previous record high of 5 times during the fourth quarter of 2005 when the subprime mortgage bubble was in full swing the

conditions for houses plunged from 143 in january 2020 to 63 in november the mortgage bankers association index of mortgage applications dropped from 348 in january 2021 to 227 in december new home sales which jumped from a 649 000 annual rate in october to 811 000 in december will no doubt drop in future months ditto for existing home purchases which rose from a 5 88 million annual rate in august to 6 18 million in december furthermore the pandemic inspired stampede from small expensive urban apartments to more spacious single family houses in suburbs and rural areas appears to have peaked as the economy reopens the desirability of home offices and classrooms is no longer growing and many especially millennials are returning to big city apartments as demand for single family houses begins to weaken supply is starting to leap after the 2008 financial crisis wiped out many homebuilders the survivors were extremely cautious but with the passage of time their confidence has leaped from an index low of 9 in 2009 it climbed to 76 in december 2019 just before the pandemic and in january of this year rose further to 83 well above the pre financial crisis top of 72 in june 2005 the number of new houses under construction exceeds completions by the largest margin since 1984 this will increase inventories of unsold new houses they ve already risen from 3 5 months supply in october 2020 to 6 0 months in december rising costs for everything from lumber to copper will make these houses more expensive and harder to sell the national association of realtors index of pending house sales in december fell 7 from a year earlier the likely drop in single family house prices that is coming will reduce inflation but more in a technical than functional way decades ago the commerce department accounted for housing costs by using the prices of houses sold this was misleading since home sales 6 9 million in 2021 are just 5 of the 142 million single family housing stock so the statisticians switched to owners equivalent rent or eor now 23 5 of the total consumer price index this number is suspect since it s based on the relatively few single family houses that are rented also it assumes that homeowners rent their houses from themselves paying oer but who looks at this concept in figuring their cost of living in any event removing it from the total cpi reduces the year over year cpi increase in december from 7 1 to 6 2 if single family house prices drop overall as i expect oer inflation will decline and so will the total rise in cpi i don t look for a huge single family housing price plunge as during the subprime mortgage collapse but a decline of 15 to 20 seems likely this would be a big shock to the many who have relied on housing as well as stock appreciation to support their spending equity investors are already anticipating weakness in housing the spdr s p homebuilders etf is down about 16 from its december top as usual wall street bulls are trying to make these stocks look cheap they ve emphasized prices in relation to forecasted earnings over the next 12 months which is almost always lower than using the last 12 months but

by chris vermeulen of the technical traders while the reality is hopefully not quite that bad as traders and investors we need to consider our silent partner the taxman and how to minimize his cut of our profits having a tax problem can be a good problem to have but we re not obligated to pay any more in taxes than tax laws and regulations in our jurisdiction require as george harrison of the beatles famously penned let me tell you how it will be there s one for you nineteen for me cause i m the taxman yeah i m the taxman are there strategies we can use to significantly reduce our tax bill even to as low as 0 you bet before we dive in here are a few caveats we re not tax advisors you absolutely should review any taxation questions strategies or issues with a tax professional that is well versed in your tax jurisdiction and familiar with your circumstances much of the following pertains to those in the usa but there s some information here that may be useful to those outside the usa as well tax strategies can range from simple to complex some have rock solid legal standing while some of the more aggressive strategies may invite unwelcome scrutiny from tax authorities personally i prefer simple strategies that are easy to maintain and not subject to debate with the irs lastly laws and tax codes are subject to change you need to continually educate yourself and have a good tax advisor to stay on top of any changes traders tax free accounts paypal founder peter thiel famously used the roth ira to turn a small investment in founder s shares into more than 5 billion tax free google it it s a fantastic testimony to the power of the roth ira hands down the roth ira first created in 1997 is a simple and powerful tool for legally avoiding taxes why because any gains in the account are not taxed not now not ever reporting individual trades on your tax return in a roth ira is super simple why because none is required maintenance and reporting for a roth ira couldn t be easier the tradeoff is that like a regular ira you generally cannot withdraw funds tax free until age 59 ½ there are ways around that with a 72t plan for example and contributions to a roth ira are not tax deductible like they are with a regular ira we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us if you have earned income in the united states you should seriously consider maximizing contributions to a roth ira even if you currently don t have earned income but you have a regular ira there are ways to convert all or part of those funds into a roth ira should you choose to do so typically you d have to pay taxes on the converted funds but once that s done the taxes are paid in full this is commonly known as the backdoor roth ira which is also a way around the income based annual contribution limits for a roth tax deferred accounts second best to the roth ira is a regular ira contributions are tax deductible in the year made capital gains in the account are not taxed until funds are withdrawn distributions after age 59 ½ are taxed as regular income when they are made it used to be that the investment vehicles and strategies that could be used in both regular and roth iras were somewhat limited now there is an extensive range of asset classes and strategies permitted for example as an options trader almost any defined risk strategy is permissible in either a regular or roth ira at most options brokers special tax treatment section 1256 contracts were created to eliminate a tax avoidance where contracts were sold near year end to show a loss and like kind were repurchased in the following tax year section 1256 contract rules were created to require marked to market at year end whether the contracts are sold or not the big side benefit of section 1256 contracts is the 60 40 tax treatment where 60 of gains are treated as long term capital gains and taxed at a lower rate the other 40 are treated as short term capital gains and taxed as ordinary income if you re trading in a taxable account it can be very beneficial to choose section 1256 contracts where those happen to fit into your strategy section 1256 contracts include futures options on futures and certain indexes like spx and vix and options on those indexes be sure to verify section 1256 treatment and report with your broker and tax advisor state taxes an additional layer of the tax burden is at the state level one way to avoid that is to live in one of the states with no income tax for individuals these are alaska florida nevada south dakota tennessee texas washington and wyoming you generally must file a federal tax return in those states keep in mind that the tax free states tend to have higher excise sales and property taxes you should consider your overall tax burden and affordability ranking if you re thinking about moving to one of those states some traders live in multiple states and claim their residency in a tax free state that can get a little tricky as rules and enforcement will vary you ll need to keep good records of your time spent in the tax free state and be sure to comply with all regulations for both states tax splitting regardless of where you live it can be possible legal and common to create a separate entity such as a c corporation that is domiciled in a tax free state such as nevada instead of capital gains bumping you into a higher marginal tax bracket as an individual you could tax split and have the entity pay taxes on its gains at a lower federal level and with no state taxes due typically there are tax implications in your home state if you take income out of the entity for your use as an individual but be aware that you can create and control a separate entity from yourself that has its own p l for taxation purposes and that can reduce the overall tax burden summary roth ira if it s available to you think about maximizing it outside of that consider tax deferred accounts section 1256 income

wall street stocks tumbled and oil prices surged on friday as the white house warnings of a possibly imminent russian invasion of ukraine reverberated through financial markets markets lurched during a briefing by the us national security advisor jake sullivan who said a russian invasion could begin at any time including during the beijing winter olympics if a russian attack on ukraine proceeds it is likely to begin with aerial bombing and missile attacks that could obviously kill civilians sullivan said any american in ukraine should leave as soon as possible and in any event in the next 24 to 48 hours investors had become less worried about an imminent invasion of ukraine in recent days following western diplomacy with russian president vladimir putin but stocks tumbled after sullivan s remarks with the s p 500 ultimately losing 1 9 percent analysts said the sell off was likely heightened by the timing just before the weekend with investors shifting into a risk off mode to reduce their exposure for the two days when there is no trading the russia ukraine tensions have hovered over already shaky investor sentiment said john lynch chief investment officer for comerica wealth management investors have been counting on a diplomatic resolution but recent developments indicate this may be wishful thinking and therefore not fully priced into the markets
steve wiggins has worked at houlton farms dairy for 45 years photo for the washington post by tristan spinski like many americans tracey albert has grown accustomed to shortages at supermarkets over the past two years toilet paper cat food potato chips ramen noodles then the pandemic came for her chocolate milk albert 38 has been drinking the chocolate milk made by houlton farms dairy in northern maine since she was in elementary school now she buys it for her own children nothing holds a candle to it she said but when albert went to the supermarket late last year the shelf where she finds her weekly one gallon jug was empty the latest casualty of a supply chain warped by two years of a global pandemic there was no problem with the cows a farm near the town of houlton in aroostook county pressed up against the canadian border continued to supply fresh milk seven days a week just as it had for as long as anyone could remember the issue was a custom made chocolate powder normally delivered four times a year from a factory in illinois when eric lincoln the co owner of the dairy spoke to his supplier in december he learned it might take 12 weeks triple the normal time to receive the crucial ingredient that s when lincoln knew he d have to curtail production the story of the disappearing chocolate milk is a microcosm of a much larger struggle businesses are grappling with historic transportation delays and shifts in behavior as americans buy more goods than they did before the pandemic that has produced abrupt and sometimes baffling shortages affecting anything from baby formula to semiconductors while also spurring rising prices after two years of adapting and improvising companies understand there are no quick fixes what s more no one really knows when the disruptions will end we have a mess in shipping that s going to take awhile to unwind even if we get back to normal behavior said phil levy a former member of the council of economic advisers who is now chief economist at flexport a freight forwarder according to a flexport measure it currently takes goods 110 days to make their way from factories in asia through ports in the united states four days short of the record high levy believes that the supply chain disruptions won t abate before 2023 that means more scrambling for small businesses like houlton farms which was founded in 1938 lincoln has spent his entire working life at the dairy starting with a part time job when he was a high school student in 1981 he bought the business with his parents and brother now he s 63 he talks about the dairy s recent supply chain disruption with a weary stoicism you hear everybody is having trouble lincoln said it s just our turn to have our turn it s not the first time houlton farms has faced shortages during the pandemic in the warm weather the dairy runs three ice cream shops last year lincoln discovered that pineapple topping was suddenly difficult to find so too were vanilla syrup banana syrup and paper containers then came the egg nog debacle the dairy s longtime supplier in maine announced in july that it would no longer make the product due to supply issues of its own lincoln raced to find a replacement and ordered one from california customers noticed the difference and weren t happy i almost wish i never bought it lincoln said that was a good lesson not to mess with the chocolate milk every three months a pallet of 40 bags of chocolate milk powder normally arrives at the houlton farms production facility the formula has remained unchanged for four decades in the early 1980s a representative of a company called bowey krimko told the lincolns that he would create a superior chocolate milk powder for them one that would produce just the right shade of brown and the right amount of creaminess houlton farms continued to order the same customized mix year in and year out long after bowey krimko disappeared in a series of acquisitions now lincoln buys the powder from an arm of tate lyle a global food and beverage conglomerate headquartered in london darrin peterson is an executive with tate lyle based in illinois who oversees the company s global stabilizers and functional systems business functional systems are the mixes used by food manufacturers to make everything from chocolate milk to salad dressings soups to ice creams they provide not just flavor but also a particular feel with ingredients to prevent separating clumping and melting peterson said that while the houlton farms mix is unique tate lyle doesn t make that particular product for any other customer its challenges are not anyone in the food industry today whether you re a small processor like houlton or a large one like kraft foods everybody is feeling the same kinds of pinches in their supply chains peterson said it s unavoidable iri a market research firm tracks grocery shortages in the united states according to its data 88 of consumer goods were in stock across the country last week but there were considerable variations by region and product among the items in shorter supply energy drinks frozen baked goods refrigerated dough and pest control products peterson said the delay in getting houlton farms its chocolate powder a mix of cocoa a stabilizer called carrageenan and several other ingredients was caused by a tangle of factors not a shortage of one particular item all of tate lyle s imported raw materials are being impacted by continuing logjams at ports he said where wait times remain far longer than they were before the pandemic worker shortages have also played a role the company s facility in sycamore ill usually employs about 120 people including in a dedicated cocoa room peterson estimates that the labor pool is down about 10 employees who quit aren t easily replaced while others have been out sick as coronavirus infections soared for the first time in more than a decade the company began actively recruiting from the local high school at the same time demand for certain products has come roaring back when schools across the nation reopened in september for instance orders for chocolate milk mixes which tate lyle calls chocolate dairy powders or cdps surged you have everybody in the marketplace looking for these raw materials from all points peterson said to supply customers like houlton farms tate lyle used to import cocoa powder from places like west africa and brazil now the company is shifting its sourcing strategy to buy cocoa from domestic distributors in the united states to try to speed up delivery times meanwhile the team tasked with finding the fastest ways into the country for raw materials by varying ports or suppliers has dialed its efforts up to 11 peterson said i don t want to say has been a nightmare he said but he has never seen a supply chain like the one that exists today two of the company s containers were stuck on a ship that blocked the suez canal last year several suppliers of emulsifiers another key ingredient in food mixes have invoked legal clauses that allow them to break contracts due to forces beyond their control we re all living in unprecedented times peterson said in houlton a town of about 6 000 people in the northeast corner of maine word of the chocolate milk shortage traveled quickly lincoln decided to use whatever supplies he had to continue providing small chocolate milks to local schools where generations of kids have grown up drinking the dairy s products that left only a trickle for retail stores lincoln wrote an apologetic post on facebook saying the company expected to be out of the product until march at county yankee grocer a local supermarket some customers reacted by stockpiling whatever houlton farms chocolate milk they could find including a few who bought 12 half gallons at once said joshua brisley the store manager at the dairy s request brisley said he instituted a limit of one chocolate milk per customer brisley 44 ticks off the other products the supermarket has run short of in recent weeks saltine crackers campbell soups prego spaghetti sauce his shelves of fruit snacks for kids are currently empty he hears cereal might become an issue soon there s no predictability to it he said at the end of last month lincoln received some welcome news tate lyle sent an email to the dairy saying that it was aiming to deliver the chocolate milk mix earlier than expected and lincoln hopes the order will come this week once the powder is delivered it will be combined in a tank with 2 milk cane sugar and small amounts of vitamin a and vitamin d then the mixture is pasteurized and packaged the whole process takes about an hour and a half lincoln said still he is bracing himself for more complications ahead one supplier told him that a stabilizer the dairy uses to make ice cream could become hard to find so lincoln ordered more in preparation for summer he heard the same thing about raspberry extract and citric acid key ingredients in sherbet he is keeping an extra inventory of rubber gaskets for his milk pipes it used to take a week to get a new one but now it takes more than two months it s just a lot of things that you never used to think about now you have to think about lincoln said one of the customers lucky enough to find the chocolate milk at county yankee in early january was albert the houlton native and mother of four she could only purchase one and it felt like buying contraband albert said with a laugh my 4 year old and 8 year old absolutely love it and i do too she said before admitting that she is lactose intolerant even that doesn t keep her from drinking the chocolate milk it s worth it she said eric lincoln right talks with brian little a deliver driver in the walk in

foundation stones remain from samuel phillips large farmhouse on benedict pond road north of the picnic area and campground in beartown state forest kansas territory activists william and jared phillips grew up here photo bernard a drew 2010 the phillips brothers left their home in what is now beartown state forest and moved to kansas where they were caught up in that territory s fierce battle over whether it would become a free or a slave state bleeding kansas was a turbulent time in the 34th state in the late 1850s when it was still a territory more than 50 individuals died in skirmishes over whether it would be admitted to the union as a slave or free state this story though starts in great barrington s lofty beartown a mountaintop shared with stockbridge lee tyringham and monterey much of the land is now beartown state forest the first two settlers of this section were two brothers samuel and seth phillips who came from connecticut about a hundred years ago berkshire gleaner publisher henry m white wrote in a chapter of his serialized history of the isolated community in 1905 they cleared an opening in the forest and laid the foundation of the settlement samuel phillips house was still standing at the time white traipsed the mountain it is a mansion compared with any other in beartown it is on the east side in the midst of green meadow is a good size and has a modern veranda across the long front it is the home of nelson weeks who owns the two adjoining farms the rugg and samuel phillips jr properties it has come about in the changes in beartown that there are far less landed proprietors than in the old days different holdings having been combined in several instances while there is little to tell of seth phillips the history of the family of samuel phillips is important he came to beartown when a young man and became the leading farmer in the mountain he was a heavy cattle raiser and kept a hundred head of cattle and dairy stock besides his horses and sheep he also had a sawmill there being in former times a small pond on the beartown brook where it runs through this section a handful of deeds attest phillips first took an interest in beartown when he acquired one half part of a certain sawmill known by the name of hall s sawmill in 1892 phillips paid ebenezer hall 35 for it in 1792 both men lived in new marlborough later the same year phillips acquired 13 acres 13 rods of woodland from daniel winchel then 12½ acres from peter chapin in 1805 phillips settled near the sawmill in 1802 when he and brother seth acquired 300 acres from amos mansfield and others the most thorough description of the mountaineer is by levi beebe well known as a lumberman weather prognosticator and eccentric who lived northeasterly of the phillips place he wrote a sketch of the samuel phillips family that is included in four papers of the berkshire historical and scientific society vol 1 1886 samuel phillips 1777 1860 grew up in new marlborough his first wife was elizabeth betsey pixley 1779 1820 of great barrington they had six children his second wife was mary mccollum 1794 1874 daughter of david and millicent wilson mccollum of tyringham they had eight offspring samuel phillips was a strong healthy man whose word was as good as his bond beebe wrote he was a jeffersonian democrat as to his religious faith i know nothing he had religion enough to make him honest and was much beloved and respected by his neighbors according to beebe in the good old days every farm house was something more than a farm house for all kinds of manufacturing were carried on under the same roof where the butter and cheese were made and the cloth from the wool flax and tow was made in all these operations the little fingers were kept busy and the little time they had to play was much enjoyed body and mind were strengthened in the house as well as in the field where the boys rode down the mountain side on ice glades with their loads of wood and logs that would make the dwellers in villages shudder with fear in this old mountain district in those early days there were from 40 to 50 scholars and i wish i could draw a picture of those young people as they hoked their cattle and hitched them to wagon or sleigh to go on a husking apple cut or candy pull wealth literary attainments and etiquette had not separated the strong from the weak as is the case to day but these gatherings were full of fun and frolic as only strong and healthy children can enjoy the pleasures and duties of life younger sons william jared and jackson phillips attended the lenox academy samuel phillips died in 1860 beebe pegged the diminishment of beartown s remote population beginning with phillips passing by then most of the phillips children had scattered to the western territories beebe did a yeoman s job of describing events leading up to bleeding kansas on that territory s road to statehood and a fierce tug and push over whether it would be a free or slave state his sources included william phillips writings and interviews with phillips daughters laura fairchilds and julia battles and jared phillips widow eliza perry phillips two phillips sons were caught up in the maelstrom that ultimately avoided compromise at one time it was proposed kansas be a slave state nebraska a free state there were attacks verbal and physical perpetuated by both sides a member of the bar and a correspondent with the new york tribune william phillips settled in leavenworth kansas his brother jared settled nearby both supported a free state and they faced violence for their views phillips wrote a 420 page book the conquest of kansas by missouri and her allies a history of the troubles in kansas from the passage of the organic act until the close of july 1856 the boston publisher advertised in this work we have the results of the actual observation of an eye witness a man fully competent to understand and depict the course of events and disposed to state the case as fairly as possible by his own third person account he told a chilling story from 1855 mr phillips was in company of some of his neighbors who were erecting a building when the pro slavery band came upon them as neither mr phillips nor his friends were prepared for defense none was made he was taken prisoner and carried on board a skiff and taken over the river and up to the town of weston some eight miles distant meanwhile his friends tried to get the authorities to interfere and rescue him but in vain fort leavenworth with a considerable military force was only three miles off and between leavenworth city and weston but there was no remedy when mr phillips captors got to weston they stripped and tarred and feathered him in this condition he was borne about the streets of weston on a rail subjected to the most grievous indignities and insults and sold at auction by a negro after suffering this they permitted him to escape ordering him to leave the territory with threats of death for non compliance he didn t live to write an account of an even more violent confrontation the next year dale e watts in how bloody was bleeding kansas political killings in kansas territory 1854 1861 published in kansas history a journal of the central plains in summer 1995 documents 56 deaths during the territorial episode and found the antislavery party was not the innocent victim of violence that its propagandists both contemporary and subsequent tried to portray both sides employed violent tactics and both were adept at focusing blame on their opponents habitually claiming self defense in any killings committed by their own men however the antislavery party as the ultimate victor in the contest was in a position to write the history of the period from its point of view there was a shootout in leavenworth on september 1 1856 a mob led by sheriff green i todd came to jared phillip house where william was staying the party led by frederick emory ordered him from town a gun battle ensued william phillips killed two unidentified antislavery men the vigilantes shot and killed phillips the new york times carried this item on sept 8 1856 the brothers phillips of kansas the two brothers phillips said to have been murdered in leavenworth city are william and jared phillips from berkshire mass they were young married men of excellent characters and possessed of considerable property william the eldest was a lawyer and for protesting against the legality of the election was tarred and feathered a year ago last may jared was a farmer both were possessed of the entire confidence and respect of the community where they resided a terrible vengeance will be visited upon their murderers ere long in the meantime let those who scoff at the shrieks of freedom from kansas think of the desolation of their young widows left unprotected among their murderers actually jared didn t die he was severely wounded and lost an arm a veteran of the california gold fields jared was married to eliza j perry daughter of pardon perry of beartown jared in 1861 was a member of freshly minted kansas senator james lane s frontier guard a volunteer assemblage of free staters that served without pay to protect the white house and president abraham lincoln in washington d c until relieved by federal troops several years later in 1860 jared traveled with a band of adventurers on their way to washington territory and was captured and killed by snake river indians in colorado territory william was married to mary ann ecker of illinois the same state where william was admitted to the bar following her husband s death mary went to great barrington and later married william s brother jackson thus the story of violent times for two great barrington sons explains a kansas historical society website because kansas territory became a place for guerrilla warfare as the debate over the expansion of slavery led to violence in kansas the settlers involved in this debate receive the most attention events in kansas and along the kansas missouri border were part of the national conflict that ultimately led to the civil war kansas was admitted to the union in january 1861 as a free state in april 1861 fort sumter was attacked launching the civil war levi beebe summed up so we must conclude if the phillips boys and other good and true men had not given their lives for the freedom of kansas it would have been a slave state abraham lincoln would not have been elected president of the united states how much longer the slaves would have been kept in bondage by this great national sin no eye can see but his who orders all things well
novel crisis iran s books shrink as us sanctions bite tehran feb 13 2022 bss afp for literature lovers in sanction hit iran a new novel has long provided a brief respite from a grinding economic crisis triggered by international pressure imposed over tehran s contested nuclear programme but now losing yourself in a good book is becoming harder as cash strapped publishers struggle because the price of paper is soaring if a 200 page novel sold for 400 000 rials 1 60 last year its price today is 1 000 000 rials 4 10 most of which is the cost of production said reza hasheminejad who runs the ofoq publishing house iran does not produce its own paper pulp for publishing so relies on imports and while those are not under sanctions they must be paid for in foreign currency that means the price of a book depends directly on the fluctuation of iran s rial so publishers are not only slashing the number of titles published but also cutting the number of pages of those they do print by shrinking the font size publishing has suffered a major crisis which could become existential said emily amrai collection director at the houpa publishing house while publishers worldwide face growing challenges to the way people read and consume literature iran is facing an extra problem the united states under former president donald trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from a landmark accord to prevent iran from acquiring an atomic bomb a goal tehran has always denied pursuing with washington then reimposing tough economic sanctions as soon as the us sanctions were reinstated in 2018 the price of paper rose amrai said a miracle long running negotiations to revive a deal with iran continue in austria but until an international agreement turns the page the impact of sanctions grows worse the devaluation of our currency against the greenback the global rise in the price of paper paid in dollars and the increase in the cost of transport also paid in foreign currency has plunged publishing into the doldrums said hossein motevali owner of houpa which specialises in children s books because book prices are fixed in iran profits are pegged to the rapidly fluctuating price of paper between receiving the manuscript laying it out and setting the price of the book i can lose everything if the price of paper has gone up suddenly hasheminejad said that happens because i m at the mercy of the fluctuation of the currencies as for the authors they are paid by the number of the pages in the book whether they are famous or not selling books is a miracle today because the majority of customers belong to the middle class and given the economic conditions their priority is to obtain essential goods such as food said hasheminejad i really wonder how people still buy books at these prices bookstores in iran look similar to shops anywhere in the world as well as shelves of iranian writers popular sellers include translations of foreign works from 20th century european classics to self help and psychology books farsi translations of mary trump s tell all on her uncle donald trump as well as the memoir of former us first lady michelle obama have been recent hits shock but as the crisis deepens several small publishing houses have been driven out of business today many independent publishers who have published excellent works have been eliminated from the market said amrai larger publishing houses have had to adapt to survive we have reduced our profits by as much as possible in order to keep our customers we have reduced printing and pagination and publish digital books to avoid paper and reduce costs said hasheminejad but that will only last a year or two for even the most solid companies so far books printed before recent spikes in paper costs provided a buffer but those stocks are running low in a few months when the books stored in the depots are exhausted it will be a shock for the customer when they see the new prices hasheminejad warned on enghelab street tehran s main book market retired teacher behjat mazloumi 60 already struggles to afford second hand books i haven t been able to buy a book for years said mazloumi even street vendors sell books at a very high price the cost rise will have wider impacts too experts say children in poorer areas where access to literature is already limited will soon find themselves priced out completely hasheminejad said today we see people in some disadvantaged areas who cannot even communicate properly in farsi he said they will certainly experience difficulties

ulysses s grant in his visit to ireland in 1879 covered much of the same territory as president clinton did on his visit in 1995 ulysses s grant was not actually president of the united states when he arrived in dublin from london on january 3 1879 his tenure as a two term republican president had ended in march of 1877 he was succeeded by rutherford b hayes another republican who lost the popular vote for president but gained enough electoral votes to be given the presidency in the great compromise of 1877 which withdrew the last federal troops from the south in may of that year exhausted by the rigors of the presidency and politics grant embarked upon a two year journey that would take him around the world a voyage that he desperately longed for after 16 years of military and government service grant traveled throughout europe for a year and a half before coming home as he expressed it to his wife to the land of his great grandfather john simpson who was born in 1738 near dungannon in county tyrone simpson emigrated to bucks county pennsylvania in 1763 where he married and had a son also named john who moved to ohio in 1818 the third of john s children hannah married jessie root grant and gave birth to ulysses in 1822 arriving in dublin on the morning of january 3 grant was met by lord mayor j barrington and taken to the sumptuous shelbourne hotel by carriage later in the day he toured the city with the mayor and the american consul in dublin their stops included the corporation hall festooned with union jacks and american flags the bank of ireland the stock exchange on dame street trinity college and the royal irish academy after the trinity college tour he was taken up sackville street described by john russell young a writer who accompanied grant on the world tour as one of the finest avenues in the kingdom being very broad and lined on either side by very fine and costly buildings at the end of sackville street grant admired the nelson column in rutland square the statue of the english admiral was blown up by the i r a in the early 1970s offering irish president eamon de valera an opportunity for a rare display of wit when he commented that nelson had returned to england by air given the freedom of the city grant told the crowd gathered outside city hall that i have been made a citizen of quite a number of towns and cities but nothing has given me more pleasure than to be made a citizen of the principal city of ireland i am by birth a citizen of a country where there are more irishmen either native born or the descendants of irishmen than there are in all of ireland in a gentle dig at the queen he delighted the crowd by adding that when in office he had the honor and pleasure of representing more irishmen and their descendants than the queen of england does dr isaac butt the protestant leader of the home rule movement also addressed the crowd five months later butt would die leaving the leadership of the home rule campaign to charles stewart parnell that evening a large banquet was held in grant s honor at the mayor s residence an event he described as keeping him up until the late or early hours the following two days he spent walking and touring the city and resting at the shelbourne he had been scheduled to travel to cork city but a number of catholic members of the town council accused grant of insulting the irish people by according to a mr barry getting up a no popery cry there a number of other catholic council members joined barry in demanding that no municipal honors or public reception be given to grant alderman dwyer stated during the debate that it would be an act of impropriety on the part of the corporation of cork to pay any mark of respect personally to general grant needless to say grant changed his plans to travel to cork and headed north to what one historian called his own people in ulster the historical record is unclear on grant s attitude towards catholics while he was president in his memoirs however grant admitted to being a member of the anti catholic know nothing party for a brief time in the 1850s according to professor john y simon editor of the grant papers at southern illinois university grant attended a few meetings of the know nothings after losing a job to a foreigner in st louis county grant had also given a famous speech in des moines iowa while president where he stated his support for public schools and education free of sectarianism simon suggests that these actions could have been interpreted as being anti catholic but grant also showed tolerance of fenian activities in the united states in 1871 when five irish revolutionary prisoners recently released from british jails steamed into new york harbor there was a message of welcome from the grant administration and as thomas brown historian of irish american nationalism points out grant tolerated fenian activity fearing irish political strength and used their bellicosity as a bargaining chip with the british nevertheless after being spurned by the cork town council he traveled to the city he called londonderry arriving there on january 6 after brief stops in dundalk omagh and strabane where he greeted people who gathered at the train stations to welcome him he was met by mayor john browne and taken to the imperial hotel and then to the town hall for a speech on the ulster american connection grant told the large gathering the belfast newsletter covered his arrival in derry and suggested that the whole town and neighborhood had come out to see him that his trip would have been incomplete without seeing the ancient and illustrious city of londonderry whose history is so well known throughout america he spoke of the kindly feeling existing between the two countries and then spoke of his own ulster connection without revealing precisely what that connection was we all have relations on this side of the water although some of us would unluckily enough have to go back five or six generations to find them professor simon suggests that grant was probably more interested in his paternal lineage as most men were during that time he then engaged in some post presidential politicking inviting everyone to america and offering them citizenship just not as rapidly as you have made me a citizen here today if there is a home for many more millions yet we hope to see more of the people of derry and ireland when you become more crowded and want more room we hope you will go there and establish your shirt and linen factories while in derry grant toured the historic city walls coming across another statue this one of the fiery protestant reverend george walker governor of londonderry who defended the city against the troops of james ii in 1689 almost 300 years later the replica of walker which looked down upon the catholic bogside would meet the same fate as the likeness of nelson grant was also shown the cannon called roaring meg which was used during the siege of derry and can be found on the ancient walls today the following day grant traveled by train to belfast by way of coleraine and ballymena in coleraine he was met by commissioners of the borough who spoke publicly for the first time of the protracted economic depression that the area was experiencing and stated their hopes that improved economic conditions in the united states would benefit ireland and to grant s great joy he was also met by a number of men who had served under him in the civil war he was their general a man who had stated a simple but successful philosophy for conducting war the art of war is simple enough grant said find out where your enemy is get at him as soon as you can strike at him as hard as you can and keep moving on at 2 30 in the afternoon grant s train pulled into northern countries railway station in belfast to another great welcome from the mayor john browne the large linen mills near the train depot had stopped work and workers stood out in the rain in the thousands all the public buildings were draped in english and american colors at a late luncheon the american ambassador to france who accompanied grant on the ireland trip reminded the audience that as president grant had appointed two belfast men a t stewart and george stuart to the cabinet posts of secretary of the treasury and secretary of the navy stewart owned the biggest department store in the world and was considered a political fixer for grant in new york after lunch grant again met with old soldiers who had served under him and one soldier who had fought with the rebels and had been captured by grant at the battle of paducah and toured the white star shipyards where the famous steamers that would transport so many of ireland s people to america were built grant also took time to meet with mr cronin the editor of the catholic union and bishop ryan of buffalo new york that evening he made his final speech in ireland and he again spoke of the ulster connection and the sons and daughters of belfast who had helped build america he closed his talk by stating that he could not possibly go around the world without seeing the dear old emerald isle the next day he left for dublin at another train stop in drogheda a young girl asked grant to give her love to her aunt in america he promised to do so a few days later in paris grant wrote his friend george childs back in the states he told childs i have just had a delightful run through the north of ireland i saw no distress and no poverty it is fairly clear from those revealing comments that grant saw only what his hosts wanted him to see a kind of potemkin village irish style it must be remembered that 1879 was also the year the irish national land league was formed by michael davitt just a year and a half out of a british prison it was also a year of agrarian outrages and the start of the so called land war one of the greatest mass movements of modern ireland the winter of 1878 79 saw an economic crisis that historian t w moody says threatened the rural population with a disaster comparable to that of the great famine there are a number of similarities between grant s trip to ireland and president bill clinton s visit in 1995 but while he may not have seen a great deal more of ireland during his stay in belfast derry and dublin from the exact itinerary that grant had taken 116 years earlier it is clear that clinton knew what grant did not the social and political turmoil that percolated beneath the surface of a presidential visit what the papers said a first hand account from the city archives of dublin january 4 1879 of the conferring of the freedom of dublin on ulysses s grant 18th president of the united states one o clock in the council chamber city hall was appointed for the ceremony of making general grant an honorary freeman of dublin and at one o clock the chamber was as vividly bright as beauty fashion celebrity and scarlet togas could make it there was our english chief secretary arthur james balfour enjoying his first glimpse of an irish crowd there was the genial home rule leader isaac butt first of the new made freemen regaled with many a congratulation on his returning strength and there were as many members of parliament lawyers doctors priests bankers and beauties besides as could conveniently or even inconveniently be stowed into the given allowance of cubic feet general ulysses s grant ex president of the united states shouted from the entrance at the head of the central staircase brought everybody in the house to his or her feet amidst a short sharp earnest burst of welcome the hero of the day stalked placidly up the centre of the chamber with his eyes fixed straight before him looking neither to right nor to left until he was seated quietly on the right of the lord mayor while the roll was calling general grant sat immovable as a man of marble never once raising his eyes and never once wasting a word upon his neighbors the simple severity of republicanism and straightforwardness of martial law rolled into one and were visible in every detail of his dress face and manner a somewhat undersized thickset dingy looking man with powerful chest and sinewy limbs his head alone would mark him out from the mob a well preserved gentleman of fifty six who might easily pass for a dozen years younger but that head would be singled out of a million a massive square built forehead rising perpendicularly over a pair of close set piercing gray eyes sheathed under heavy eyebrows a short flat nose and mouth with bloodless lips and teeth fastened by being locked together all pursed up into the one expression of concentration stubborn force and sleepless energy and all framed in short dusky square clipped whiskers running all round cheeks that must have had their baptism of gunpowder it required little in physiognomy to make sure that here was the lion hearted and dogged soldier who beat down buckner and johnston and beauregard and bragg and over a hundred thousand corpses crashed his way through the lines of richmond following a speech by the lord mayor general grant upon rising was heartily cheered he said my lord mayor gentlemen of the town council of dublin and ladies and gentlemen i feel very proud to be made a citizen of the great city which you represent and to be a fellow citizen with those whom i see around me today since my arrival on this side of the atlantic i have had the pleasure of being made a citizen of quite a number of towns and cities none have given me more pleasure than being made a citizen of the principal city of ireland applause i am by birth a citizen of a country where there are more irishmen either native born or descendants of irishmen than you have in all ireland cheers i have had the honor and pleasure therefore of of representing more irishmen and their descendants when in office than the queen of england does hear hear not being possessed of the eloquence of your worthy lord mayor i shall say no more than simply to thank you again cheers mr dawson three cheers for america the cheers were heartily given

shuts out millions of people whiteman there s a lot of room for improvement let s get to upstart specifically they have this algorithm they re using ai lots of data points trying to paint a picture of the individual in theory if it works banks would like that better because it should be more certainty that means more aggressive pricing power and hopefully less default it should open up more people more access to credit and hopefully at better rates if i m not just thrown on a bucket with everybody who some computer thinks might be like me but based on my specific history that s either good or bad news for me but that s on me to figure out hall they re not even thrown in a bucket there s a bunch of buckets that people are in and these are the people that can t even get in a bucket whiteman but even all of us jason those of us who are in a bucket there s a lot of uncertainty in their pricing and that means the banks charge for that uncertainty that s part of their margin this is a fast growing business 12 billion in annualized loan volume in the third quarter triple the year prior right now for most of its history it s from personal loans it s expanding into auto which is a 670 billion market opportunity another 1 3 trillion in refinancing although i personally think that number is way overstated holy grail is the mortgage industry 4 5 trillion or so if this works it should work it is a profitable business today the interesting thing about this company right now is that the demand is there the need is there i think if this works it will be embraced we re at the point now where we know they ve built a mousetrap and we re waiting to see if it turns out it s a better mousetrap really there s no way to tell that other than time to see if it works i m bullish on what we ve seen their partners continue to use it some of their partners have actually given up the fico score they just added a new partner to its referral network but feb 15 earning we re going to learn a lot the excitement arguably was out of control on the beginning it s much more reasonable now i really believe given the market opportunity and given the fact that again the incumbent is just so out of favor with almost all of its constituencies if this works this is going to be a winner we re just now in the time where we re figuring out we have to wait and see the data come and see if it works matt frankel i like that the valuation makes a lot more sense now for the risk reward like you mentioned we don t know if this is going to work the only way is to try it we don t know what upstart s lending methodology does in a down market it was founded after the financial crisis we haven t seen how it performs in a real recession where the government isn t just printing trillions of dollars in stimulus things like that jason s showing you a chart of the consumer credit default rates right now they are at record lows
these stalwarts can be solid investment pillars to build a strong portfolio one solid strategy for boosting your portfolio s long term value is by investing in dividend stocks those recurring payments will generate cash flow you can make use of without selling your investments three stocks that are excellent sources of recurring income are novartis nvs 0 95 bce bce 0 90 and kraft heinz khc 1 03 collectively they can help diversify your portfolio and at their current share prices all yield more than double the s p 500 s average yield of 1 3 1 novartis swiss drugmaker novartis is the ideal type of investment to tuck away in your portfolio it may not be an exciting hyper growth business but you can count on it for consistency in the past five years the company s revenues haven t deviated much its top line has stayed within the 48 billion to 54 billion range and during that period the lowest profit margin it achieved was over 15 but that doesn t mean that growth isn t on the horizon the u s food and drug administration approved the company s cholesterol drug leqvio late last year at its peak it could generate more than 2 billion in annual sales for the business but that s not all novartis believes it has more than 20 treatment candidates in its pipeline that could be potential blockbusters and that could earn regulatory approval by 2026 the business has also generated free cash flow of more than 10 billion in each of the past four years funds which the healthcare company can use to explore more opportunities and enhance its pipeline in 2021 novartis also spent 7 4 billion on its dividend which at current share prices yields 3 7 and another 3 billion on share buybacks novartis has a strong business and with a modest payout ratio of 30 its stock could be an income investor s dream buy 2 bce canadian telecom giant bce is an industry leader as well as a reliable dividend payer there may not be much in the way of growth here but it s pretty consistent in 2021 its top line rose 2 5 to 23 5 billion canadian dollars and over the past four years its sales have been quite steady ranging between ca 22 billion and ca 24 billion net earnings increased by 7 2 this past year to ca 2 9 billion as the business returns to pre pandemic levels that equates to a strong profit margin of 12 which is typical for the business in 2022 management expects sales to grow by as much as 5 the company is continuing to expand its 5g network which it says now reaches 70 of canada s population while that s all good the real value in the stock is as an income investment at the current share price bce pays a dividend that yields an impressive 5 5 annually it announced a 5 1 payout hike earlier this month when it released its year end results although the company s payout ratio is technically over 100 now bce has a history of paying out a high percentage of earnings a return to something closer to pre pandemic normal in terms of travel and thus roaming revenue should help get that ratio back down in 2022 historically the company s free cash flow has been strong enough to support dividend payments bce isn t a dividend stock i d worry about the business is fairly stable and it s among the leaders in canada s telecom industry 3 kraft heinz another stalwart that investors can count on is kraft heinz the company s business is built on some popular household brands including oscar mayer philadelphia and of course kraft and heinz the company s products are essentials in many homes and that can make the stock a relatively safe buy especially in a year when inflation could weigh down other investments food companies like kraft with popular widely used products have greater flexibility to increase their prices to offset the impact of rising costs and on the company s earnings call in october management expressed confidence that it would be able to adjust for inflation that s not something all companies can do which could make kraft particularly attractive to risk averse investors over the long haul it also doesn t hurt that kraft s top customer is big box chain walmart the company s revenue of 26 3 billion over the past 12 months is remarkably similar to the 26 billion plus in annual revenue it has generated in four of the past five years coupled with operating margins that are normally around 20 that makes this business a fairly stable one while kraft had to cut its dividend a few years ago and incurred a steep 10 billion loss in 2018 after recording impairment charges of more than 15 billion the company s fundamentals remain strong and its brands are top notch and its payouts are also much more manageable now kraft has generated free cash flow of 3 2 billion over the past four quarters which has been more than sufficient to cover its dividend payments of just under 2 billion during that time frame such an excess of cash flow wasn t common prior to the dividend cut that makes its dividend which yields 4 6 at the current share price look a lot more attractive right now you may not be able to expect much growth from kraft s business but the stock can still make for a solid income investment to hang on to for the long term
new york feb 11 reuters geopolitical worries have added another layer of volatility to an already jumpy market as investors priced in the possibility of escalating conflict between russia and ukraine though some doubted the issue would weigh on u s asset prices over the longer term reports of rising tensions between the two countries slammed stocks on friday and lifted prices for treasuries the dollar and other safe haven assets investors were already rattled by a hawkish turn from the federal reserve the market is reacting because an actual invasion has not yet been priced in said michael farr of farr miller and washington llc the severity of an invasion if one occurs will correlate to the severity of the market s reaction russia has massed enough troops near ukraine to launch a major invasion washington said on friday it urged all u s citizens to leave ukraine within 48 hours read more white house national security adviser jake sullivan said it remained unclear whether russian president vladimir putin had definitively given the order to invade sullivan said he expected u s president joe biden to press for a phone call soon with his counterpart despite market gyrations some investors were skeptical whether a more serious conflict would drag broader markets over the longer term the reaction the market is likely to have is selling until it becomes more evident what an invasion looks like and then what kind of response u s and european allies have to it said mark luschini chief investment strategist at janney montgomery scott we re not suggesting making any changes predicated on the news cycle around the topic the benchmark s p 500 index closed down nearly 1 9 while the tech heavy nasdaq was off around 2 8 the moves followed weakness on thursday sparked by expectations that the fed will aggressively fight surging inflation the cboe volatility index vix wall street s fear gauge was up for a second straight session hitting its highest since the end of january ryan detrick chief market strategist at lpl financial said the impact of major geopolitical events on u s stocks has been limited for instance after jfk was assassinated in november 1963 stocks went on one of their best six month runs ever he said the truth is a solid economy can make up for a lot of sins jay hatfield chief investment officer at infrastructure capital management said the s p 500 would probably find support at around 4 200 more than 200 points below friday s closing level an intensifying conflict could add more credence to our view that the fed will be more dovish than the market currently believes as the war would make the outlook even more uncertain he said but the fed could stay aggressive if oil prices keep surging crude has already soared to seven year highs on ukraine jitters read more by pushing energy prices even higher a russian invasion would likely exacerbate inflation and redouble pressure on the fed to raise interest rates said bill adams chief economist for comerica bank in a friday note from the fed s perspective the inflationary effects of a russian invasion and higher energy prices would likely outweigh the shock s negative implications for global growth he said on friday brent crude futures settled up 3 03 or 3 3 at 94 44 a barrel u s west texas intermediate crude clc1 rose 3 22 or 3 6 to 93 10 a barrel worries over the conflict will create volatility until people verify it s true and what is the duration before international leadership steps in and to what extent does the rest of the world step in said thomas hayes managing member at great hill capital llc in new york we just have to see how this plays out over the weekend and whether or not international leadership can bring this under wraps he said

local media is rife with speculation about hong kong leaning on the mainland to rein in the latest covid 19 outbreak with cases rising to record numbers since the start of the pandemic over the last week the government has severely tightened restrictions on just about every aspect of life in public and private spaces its health policies still stand in stark contrast to the situation on the ground just as they did when hong kong had zero daily cases the hope is that vaccination rates will climb which is happening but not fast enough to get ahead of rising cases in addition compulsory mass testing has resulted in lines snaking around blocks for hours as thousands queue up or face a fine meanwhile four people from different households can still sit together in some restaurants all in all there is chaos fatigue and fear as cases rose to more than 1 300 infections each day compared with upwards of 7 400 in new york and 7 900 in london all of hong kong s vulnerabilities have been exposed testing capacity is severely constrained when i connected with the health department last weekend as new restrictions were going into place they were still in the process of procuring tests the exact cost of testing while not discussed openly is very high in september 2020 it cost almost 70 million to test less than a quarter of the territory s 7 5 million residents hospitals are overwhelmed while a quarantine center for close contacts has been turned into one for asymptomatic patients talk of another isolation center built with china s help emerged friday deaths of the unvaccinated elderly officials biggest fear have ticked up it s hard to see how any of this works to contain the outbreak locking down the city as beijing did in wuhan in the early days of the pandemic has been recommended by a government advisor and discussed in the media but going down that path would just serve to confirm the ham handedness of the city s covid policy making when beijing shut down the city of around 11 million people for over 70 days the costs were brutal the health burden was estimated to be 4 5 billion yuan 707 5 million and the burden on residents mental health at 114 5 billion yuan direct economic losses from sectors like transport food and beverage were 21 6 billion yuan while the monthly indirect economic losses of all industries were 36 4 billion yuan according to an academic study on a monthly basis that s economic losses of 27 8 billion to be sure the study also found that lives were saved as was 30 billion yuan in medical costs for hong kong a city of deep inequalities where gross domestic product fell even under relatively light restrictions in 2020 costs at this scale would inflict damage on the banking and finance sectors batter businesses and destroy livelihoods in addition the wuhan approach was implemented in the early days when little was known about the disease the aim was broadly to ensure the unknown virus wouldn t spread rapidly across china and beyond the city s borders now we have powerful data evidence and experience ignoring that will be foolish if hong kong were to attempt this now when various strains of covid 19 are still spreading across both developing and developed economies it would be misguided this backward looking approach is far from what a global financial center or even china s should adopt what s more one of the biggest risks to hong kong is a poorly executed lockdown and the ensuing damage to its reputation the case of the chinese city of xi an shows how all this can go wrong videos of a pregnant woman who couldn t get adequate care and lost her baby went viral and resulted in officials being fired food shortages increasingly the case in hong kong were rampant hong kong s large estate lockdowns have also shown how much misery is being inflicted on people financially socially and economically the approach will prove short termist much like the policies of the last two years at this point in the pandemic strict lockdowns won t help rein in the outbreak there are now many locally transmitted untraceable cases to hope that infection rates will reverse to close to nil is absurd as the experience of several countries now show given other countries city state experiences it seems likely that it s now not possible to go back to a zero covid strategy and over the next 6 8 weeks many hong kong ers will be exposed to the virus analysts from jefferies group llc wrote recently so where to now hong kong needs to accept the reality that the city has thousands of infections properly and gently executed testing home quarantining for mild cases and alleviating residents growing fear and resentment will go a long way in addition reducing the burden on the health system one created by existing policies would free up space for care for those that need it and avert deaths other concessions like loosening border requirements are also needed so the territory doesn t find itself isolated when it needs resources most it must allow more air travel and cargo to prepare for bringing in food medical supplies personnel and make it possible for residents to order at home tests from overseas quickly currently most pharmacies are out of stock the list of small but effective measures is long now only if there was a willingness to act on it bloomberg
investors are bracing for more gyrations in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as worries over a hawkish federal reserve threaten to squelch risk appetite across markets the volatility traditionally associated with cryptocurrencies has been on full display in recent weeks bitcoin the largest cryptocurrency is up by around 33 since january 24 and recently traded at 43 850 rebounding from a tumble that cut its price in half from november s record high its main rival ether is up around 45 since january 24 at around 3 200 following a nearly 56 nosedive from its record high of 4 868 also in november while proponents of cryptocurrencies once touted their lack of correlation to other assets bitcoin and its peers saw huge gains over the last two years rallying along with stocks as the fed and other central banks pumped unprecedented levels of stimulus into the global economy bitcoin is up 1 039 since march 2020 and ether has risen 2 940 though the rallies in both cryptocurrencies have been interrupted by numerous stomach churning selloffs their recent volatility has come amid a broader market selloff driven by investors recalibrating their portfolios to account for a more aggressive fed which is now expected to raise rates as many as seven times this year as it fights surging inflation worries that an aggressive central bank tightening cycle going forward will hamstring risky assets has made it difficult for some traders to maintain their bullish outlook on bitcoin and other cryptos an asset class already identified with intense volatility escalating tensions in ukraine where washington warned a russian invasion could begin any day could also spark broad market moves investors said bitcoin has really become the ultimate momentum trade and there are so many risks that can trigger a 40 drop out of nowhere said edward moya senior analyst at oanda bitcoin s volatility has not stopped some analysts from trying to gauge the currency s fair value or point out potentially important price levels analysts at jpmorgan estimate bitcoin s current fair value at around 38 000 some 15 below its recent price based on its volatility in comparison with that of gold another asset investors often use to hedge their portfolios against inflation and economic uncertainty vanda research meanwhile said in a recent note that most of the bearish bets on a weaker bitcoin price were entered at around 47 000 and there could be a large short squeeze if the aforementioned threshold is crossed and retail investors return to crypto trading meanwhile correlations between bitcoin and the s p 500 reached an all time high on january 31 according to data from bofa global research undercutting the case for those hoping to use the cryptocurrency as a hedge against market turbulence investors next week are expecting minutes from the fed s most recent monetary policy meeting due out wednesday walmart and chipmaker nvidia corp will be among the companies reporting results as corporate earnings season rolls on some investors are steeling themselves to ride out the volatility in bitcoin betting that the long term value proposition of blockchain technology the built in supply limit and the network effect it produces will endure despite frequent price swings jurrien timmer director of global macro at fidelity likened the current speculation in cryptocurrencies to the turbulence tech stocks experienced during the dot com era more than two decades ago a boom and bust period that saw a comparatively small group of companies left standing amazon is still around and apple is still around and they re bigger than ever and the thinking is that for bitcoin that will be the same he said but it is not immune to those waves of speculation and sentiment bitcoin could reach 100 000 as soon as 2023 timmer has said based on his supply and demand models others believe mature cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether are unlikely to deliver the kind of eyewatering gains they have notched since their founding instead they are looking to the universe of new alternative coins that are being created to take advantage of the money pouring into the crypto space including the metaverse and nfts which saw 30 billion worth of venture capital investment last year according to pitchbook
when anonymous hackers infiltrated the cryptocurrency exchange bitfinex in 2016 it shook the nascent world of digital currency and prompted speculation about who might have stolen what was then 71 million in bitcoin but unlike traditional financial transactions bitcoin trades are publicly visible moving the coins risked revealing who was behind the heist and so for six years as the value of bitcoin soared the loot sat in plain sight online as tiny fractions of the giant sum occasionally disappeared in a blizzard of complex transactions it was as if a robber s getaway car was permanently parked outside the bank locked tight money still inside and then this month the car sped off in the strange and sometimes shadowy world of cryptocurrency it was as if the earth shook in the years since the bitfinex hacking crypto had exploded into the mainstream and the theft had become notorious a bounty worth over 4 billion at last it seemed the hackers had emerged from hiding

companies find that raising aquatic livestock far from natural water bodies makes business and environmental sense as the world population grows in number and affluence the demand for high quality protein is putting unsustainable pressure on wild fish stocks but also creating opportunities for aquaculture alongside dryland farming the market for salmon is large global and growing said sylvia wulf chief executive officer of aquabounty technologies current methods of farming can t keep up we all know that even traditional net pen farming has its challenges they can t control the weather they can t control the climate aquabounty raises atlantic salmon genetically modified to grow faster than wild salmon allowing them to come to market weight in half the time and hence with fewer inputs the company sold its first commercial scale harvest out of its indiana facility in may 2021 while the first fish came onto the canadian market from its prince edward island facility in november 2021 the company uses a recirculating aquaculture system ras fish are raised in large tanks with water pumps providing a constant current water is constantly removed treated aerated and returned to the tanks wulf said their systems recycle 95 to 97 percent of their water and what little that is released goes out as good or better than the original source we believe that land based ras farms have to play a critical role in the future and we think that s going to be true of a number of species salmon just being one of them wulf said since ras systems are self contained they can be located anywhere they make the most sense for market access or other reasons for example the farm in indiana and the farm in ohio are accessible within 24 hours to 80 percent of the population in the u s wulf said the reason for that is really to minimize our carbon footprint the challenge right now is that we re air freighting imports any time you re minimizing transportation you re minimizing the carbon footprint while aquaculture does need a supply of good quality water it s far less than other livestock said john derksen this means fish farming is perfectly viable on the dry windy grasslands of southern alberta one of the biggest tilapia producers in the west is actually 45 minutes from here in fort macleod and he supplies the live food market in vancouver said derksen chair of the aquaculture centre for excellence at lethbridge college in alberta ten years ago he was a pig farmer and he still has pigs in a barn but one barn he totally converted over to fish semi arid and with few lakes southern alberta might seem an unlikely spot for aquaculture something derksen said his colleagues in ontario observed when he took the job in the early 2000s at that time the alberta government was exploring the idea of using grass carp an herbivorous fish as an alternative to pesticides to control excess vegetation in irrigation canals the idea worked and the program even provided fish to farmers for weed control in their own sloughs and dugouts the problem the fish had to be removed at the end of every season and they didn t overwinter well in pens selling fingerlings to farmers had potential but regulations stipulate they must be sterile generally through a simple process that makes them genetically triploid three sets of chromosomes rather than the usual diploid the technique is standard for non native fish such as rainbow trout and salmon used to stock lakes all over canada however some carp have a reputation for becoming invasive so regulators stipulated an extra step each grass carp fingerling had to be tested and confirmed sterile before shipping this drove up the cost to 20 per fingerling higher than the market would bear while these factors made the canal clean up program untenable it didn t take fish off the table derksen and his colleagues continued their research into aquaculture they specialize in ras systems specifically aquaponics which is a combination system that produces food plants using water enriched by the nitrogen from fish waste aquaponics is a little tricky to set up but once it s running it delivers two product streams plants and fish and is more stable the lethbridge facility has been running aquaponics systems since 2003 it is an ecosystem you re trying to sustain and maintain so it has to be balanced derksen said so you can t just have a high density of fish and a low area of plant growth you re just going to get an overabundance of nutrients there is a lot to know but once you have it operating it runs like an ecosystem it takes care of itself almost it is much easier to maintain once you have it going the lure of fish farming has derksen responding to inquiries from greenhouse owners livestock producers and even a pet food manufacturer looking for information answers and advice about a market that seems primed to take off fish farming checks a lot of boxes both from a practical and marketing standpoint it has the potential to reduce pressure on overfished wild stocks while providing high quality protein to meet growing demand ras systems use scarce water resources extremely efficiently and can be located close to population centres or food or feed processing facilities this avoids the challenges of pandemic strained supply chains also fish farmers deliver one thing better than any other livestock producer omega 3 fatty acids the nutrients are essential building blocks for brain health and function such as learning and memory with the boomer generation reaching an age where dementias are becoming a concern this could be a strong selling point for more fish in diets the thing with fish is that it is omega 3s that have been the big selling feature for people eating fish derksen said because of that there s been a lot more avenues other protein sources trying to get in on that omega 3 market and you ve seen it in eggs having omega 3s while some crops such as flax have some omega 3s levels are many times higher in fish but there s a catch while fish such as tilapia are herbivores close to three quarters of the farmed fish in canada are salmonids carnivorous species such as salmon and trout in the wild these animals eat other fish their farmed cousins consume feed pellets made of species such as menhaden a small ocean fish similar to sardines but these wild stocks are also under pressure this is driving research into alternatives which presents challenges first the product must taste good to the fish or they won t eat it or even recognize it as food it must nourish them providing all the nutrients in a form the fish can digest finally any fish food recipe must not impart any off flavours to the final product to finicky human consumers one of the things we talk about internally quite a bit is you change the diet you change the health of a nation wulf said the more we can provide a healthy protein like salmon make it affordable and accessible and have it taste great you know we ll change diets and that changes health certain canola protein fractions show promise to supply some of the fishes nutritional needs and algae based solutions are also being looked at while these opportunities may lie somewhere in the future wulf said aquaculture facilities provide some immediate benefits fish waste like that from any livestock is high in nitrogen and makes excellent fertilizer ras facilities also provide a range of jobs from someone to feed the fish to skilled technicians who can build and maintain the sophisticated water circulation and treatment systems to researchers to develop new technologies our purpose is to feed a growing population by transforming aquaculture with technology she said and the types of technology we believe will play an increasing role are the use of land based ras farms and biotechnology advertisement

board reservations are highly recommended if not required 6 view gallery rutenberg winner of best restaurant photo buzzy gordon rutenberg best restaurant ambiance the setting and location of this restaurant are as unlikely as any prediction might have been that the little known and remote rutenberg would be crowned israel s best restaurant an obscure wooden hut in the hinterlands of the jordan valley is hardly where one expects to find the country s number one dining establishment but this is exactly where kibbutznik couple hila and yizhar sahar toil to realize their vision of serving excellent food made from nature s nearby rural bounty despite the extremely humble surroundings and very basic furniture white tablecloths and impeccable service add fine dining touches drinks there are no cocktails but wine expert hila has curated an excellent wine list available online comprising no fewer than 200 vintages she will be happy to provide tastes and advise on wine choices menu there is no written menu as it changes not only daily but at each meal moreover two different tasting menus are served daily five courses at lunch served 13 00 15 00 and 13 at dinner from 19 00 all ingredients are grown and or sourced locally or even foraged recommended many dishes can be quite small and even the main courses are not large but there is range as well as variety we enjoyed an equal number of vegetarian fish and meat dishes it is hard to recommend anything in particular since it is unlikely that dishes will be repeated the home baked bread accompanied by soft butter lightly dusted with with powdered jerusalem artichoke and cocoa might well be a worthy exception and the gluten free substitute cornbread in the form of sliced polenta is unforgettable rutenberg old gesher

fabled nahalat binyamin street is already threatening to burst at its seams its small bar with limited seating is nonetheless fully stocked and although tables are necessarily rather close together both indoors and on the sidewalk outside the feeling is one of intimacy rather than crowdedness in short an ideal place for a first date even if not for parties of more than four the pleasant international playlist helps as well drinks there are no specialty cocktails but there is a more than adequate international wine list with a few vintages available by the glass menu the hebrew only menu comprises two sections first courses and main courses many items on the menu rotate daily recommended amberjack tartare in potato tacos spicy calamari stuffed chicken wings while it is likely that the replacement of dishes on the food menu will not be as frequent as in rutenberg there is of course no guarantee that these will always be available in the dessert category meanwhile it is hard

alter winner of best new restaurant photo buzzy gordon best new restaurant alter ambiance the premises are a rustic cabin situated somewhat incongruously a few steps from the busy main street of an upscale northern tel aviv suburb in addition there is a sprawling vegetable garden in the rear from which the restaurant derives the title of its cuisine urban farm the wooden house is not completely winterproofed but there is every reason to believe that it would be a pleasant place to eat in warmer weather drinks there are no cocktails but there are three special tonic blends with the optional addition of gin or vodka menu the hebrew only printed menu comprises three sections starters cold dishes and hot dishes as we have seen in what is now a trend many items on the menu rotate daily especially since vegetables from the rear garden are constantly being harvested as they ripen recommended bearing in mind the caveat of daily changes panisse palamida larb and warm mangold leaves stuffed with georgian cheese the separate dessert menu comprising four items is liable to reflect greater stability and here we enjoyed basbousa with yogurt whipped cream crunchy crust alter 79

drinks a few specialty cocktails in particular the house pomegranate lemonade infused with arak menu the bilingual printed menu reflects the few major sections that are featured prominently on the large blackboard as the cuisine category suggests the stars are the familiar staples of israeli street food recommended not surprisingly the crunchy falafel balls with interiors of dark green as one

made with choices of premium gins and flavored with the persian bouquet garni sabzi it is also possible to substitute vodka for gin the extensive kosher wine list itemizes whites rosés sparkling and reds in bottles and carafes with a few vintages and no full bodied reds available by the glass a supplemental wine list bears the title private cellar menu darya s modern silk road cuisine consists of delicacies from the swath of central asian countries extending from turkey to china and india thus reflecting to a great extent the persian heritage of chef tavakoli whose ancestry also stems from north africa another influence that surfaces occasionally some of the menu and in particular the lavish appetizer spread bears similarities with the persian mediterranean fusion that characterizes the chef s other award winning restaurant animar recommended there are standouts from each of the four menu categories black eggplant spread and fava bean confit appetizers cig kofte and kashmir cut small plates grilled duck and grilled tenderloin large plates and fallude washed down with afghan tea desserts in addition to the aforementioned winners an award was bestowed on the best culinary

following chris lloyd s trip to bambudda last week we stumbled into saltfish houndgate townhouse some may quibble over the description new restaurant opening because houndgate townhouse has been around for a few years now as a boutique hotel and it has always had a restaurant but this incarnation follows a closure of more than two years thanks to the pandemic and trading difficulties which pre dated that so that counts as new to me for those who didn t come across it in a previous incarnation it is one of the most beautiful georgian buildings in darlington and lovingly restored ten years ago by the darlington builders bussey and armstrong they did a splendid job of it and the town was grateful for its track record in making the most of its georgian and victorian heritage is not exactly first class that gratitude didn t seem to extend to patronising the place in great numbers we got the impression it was never a very profitable venture now post pandemic it has new hands at the helm in the shape of jack bowles and his wife and business partner ellie richmond jack s front of house and ellie s in the kitchen they opened last october not great timing with the benefit of hindsight houndgate townhouse and saltfish restaurant pictures tracy kidd they first made their name in these parts converting the carlbury arms at piercebridge into the fox hole a top to toe transformation that was generally well received for the quality of the food the modern up scale interior and atmosphere we never quite came to terms with the battleship grey exterior paint job but it certainly stood out the couple must have a thing about strikingly coloured pubs and foxes for that matter because they next surfaced at the fox hall inn on the a66 west of scotch corner which for many years previously was primarily noteworthy for its shriekingly yellow colour that yellow has been toned down to a tasteful cream and you ll be relieved to know the colour scheme at their new venture is certainly in keeping with the grade ii listed building in which it is housed there s a bit of bling in the shape of some neon green lighting around the bar but in every other respect the look is might best described as restrained swank it looks good as the name suggests the restaurant is big on fish and seafood we can t recall darlington having previously had a specialist fish restaurant and that s also good houndgate townhouse and saltfish restaurant pictures tracy kidd those who are really not keen on fish other than haddock and chips need not be put off there are meat and vegetarian alternatives and haddock and chips with mushy peas for those not keen on anything fishy without batter sylvia was really looking forward to some lobster recalling a particularly good experience with a classic thermidor at the fox hole a few years back sadly the problem off our coast with algae bloom which has devastated stocks of both lobster and crab meant it wasn t on the menu her disappointment was brief thanks to the magnificent steak 25 95 she settled for a well marbled 8oz sirloin chargrilled medium rare great flavour very tender and a bucket of garlic butter to go with all the usual trimmings onion rings mushroom etc my t bone halibut 27 95 was almost as meaty this king of fish baked to perfection had the texture and weight to cope with some powerful accompaniments samphire spinach salsify and a brown shrimp and caper butter the well salted chips were excellent too we also had starters a lip smacking lobster bisque i didn t ask where the lobster shells came from presumably not redcar beach served with chunks of sourdough and for that provencal touch a pot of rouille a mayonnaise consistency sauce dip made with egg yolk oil and lots of cayenne pepper fully justified its 7 95 price tag i can hear some of you saying eight quid for a bowl of soup even more pricey was the luxury prawn cocktail 9 95 ostensibly the luxury bit was the addition of two crevettes that s king sized shell on prawns perched on top of the standard prawns in marie rose sauce but we thought these just as good as the fancy pair tasked with adding a bit of visual stardust the bill was 97 but it did include a rather special 25 bottle of cava which was good to see on the wine list instead of the usual ubiquitous prosecco remember when before our national obsession with italian fizz we drank the spanish equivalent this was a reminder that we should reacquaint ourselves with a wine that s a lot closer to the champagne we would probably prefer to sup service was fine led by the personable jack and just one other they are understandably running a tight ship until calmer waters are reached but it should shortly be full steam ahead saltfish houndgate townhouse 11 houndgate

service and privacy policy you can opt out at any time advertisement inflation is running way ahead of where everyone including the federal reserve expected this year data on thursday showed the consumer price index cpi which measures the price of everyday goods and services rose by 7 5 in january the highest rate since 1982 and ahead of economist expectations for a rise of 7 3 the surging cost of energy food housing and medical care among other factors are adding to the existing pressure from labor shortages supply disruptions and strong demand in the wake of the covid 19 pandemic core cpi which excludes volatile food and energy categories and is the fed s preferred means of measuring inflation soared 6 in january from the previous year also the highest since 1982 and above forecasts for 5 9 advertisement investors quickly sold off riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies and dumped short dated bonds sending the yield on the two year treasury note up by the most in one day since mid 2009 the jump in inflation beat all market forecasts and weighed on the markets with the s p 500 dow jones and nasdaq opening lower on the news 10 year us treasury yields hit 2 for the first since 2019 while the dollar fell 0 15 the greater than expected surge has added more pressure on the federal reserve to raise interest rates and contain inflation and consumer demand it s also prompted investors to reassess how fast the central bank is likely to increase interest rates based on the cme group s fedwatch tool investors are attaching a 70 chance of a 50 basis point rise at the fed s next meeting in march that s up from around 34 a week ago advertisement some of the world s biggest banks and asset managers weighed in on how thursday s data has changed the outlook for us rates we list their comments below goldman sachs jay hatzius chief economist following this morning s strong cpi print we are raising our fed forecast to include seven consecutive 25 basis point rate hikes at each of the remaining fomc meetings in 2022 vs five hikes in 2022 previously we continue to expect the fomc to hike three more times at a gradual once per quarter pace in 2023q1 q3 and to reach the same terminal rate of 2 5 2 75 but earlier we see the arguments for a 50 basis point rate hike in march the level of the funds rate looks inappropriate and the combination of very high inflation hot wage growth and high short term inflation expectations means that concerns about falling into a wage price spiral deserve to be taken seriously advertisement so far though most fed officials who have commented have opposed a 50 basis point hike in march we therefore think that the more likely path is a longer series of 25 basis point bp hikes instead st louis fed president james bullard became the first fomc participant to call for a 50 basis point hike earlier today and we would consider changing our forecast if other participants join him especially if the market continues to price high odds of a 50 basis point move in march jpmorgan asset management jai malhi global market strategist us inflation has consistently beaten expectations and today s inflation release saw more of the same this provides a significant challenge for the fed as it aims to keep price increases under control while at the same time sustaining the economic expansion advertisement high energy prices and supply issues are stoking inflation but these issues should eventually fade of greater concern is that wage pressures are building and the central bank will not want to risk a wage price spiral looking ahead though real consumer spending on discretionary goods and services is likely to cool naturally as higher energy costs begin to bite the bond market is currently suggesting that there is a good chance the fed will hike rates more than five times by the end of the year while today s release will be uncomfortable reading for the fed the squeeze on real incomes suggests they can perhaps afford to be a little more patient than the market thinks hsbc private banking and wealth willem sels global chief investment officer advertisement the consumer price index was expected to rise further in january but it jumped even more than anticipated and so the debate around inflation will rage on for now what markets really want to know is when us inflation will peak but this upward surprise again illustrates how difficult it is to accurately forecast inflation the inflation debate is not settled and we advocate three strategies in portfolios to deal with high inflation first we look for quality stocks companies with strong market positions that allow them to charge through higher input costs to their customers so they can protect their margins second tech stocks can be vulnerable to higher rates and hence we balance them with value style stocks such as banks and energy stocks and thirdly we think investors need to expect continued volatility in markets until it is clear that inflation is coming down and we manage this through disciplined portfolio diversification pimco advertisement tiffany wilding north american economist regarding monetary policy this print surely increases the probability of the federal reserve increasing rates by 50 basis points in march and consistently the market pricing moved to a 50 probability however we still think the fed would prefer to hike sequentially at every meeting instead of a more abrupt adjustment furthermore if the credit card data that we use to forecast retail sales turns out to be right the combination of the cpi and retail sales prints suggests that the ability to pass on further price adjustments may be waning nevertheless this print will surely concern the fed and makes it tough for them to push back against market pricing at a minimum today s data solidifies our expectation that the fed will likely begin hiking rates at a once per meeting pace deutsche bank advertisement chief strategist jim reid indeed the 7 5 yoy print vs 7 2 expected even raised the small possibility of the first inter meeting fed rate hike since 1994 and before that since 1979 it also raises the risk that a recession might be increasingly difficult to avoid our us economists yesterday moved up their us fed call to a 50 basis point hike in march plus five more 25 basis point hikes in 2022 a hike at all but the november meeting and totalling 175 basis points in 2022 they also highlight the increasing risk of a 2023 or 2024 recession clearly forward guidance is a useful tool when you have uncertainty but around regime change it can prove a nightmare for several months we ve had to wait patiently until march to start the fight against inflation when in previous eras when every meeting would have been live rates would have likely been hiked many meetings ago

novel crisis iran s books shrink as us sanctions bite world world novel crisis iran s books shrink as us sanctions bite now losing yourself in a good book is becoming harder 13 february 2022 11 10 am tehran afp for literature lovers in sanction hit iran a new novel has long provided a brief respite from a grinding economic crisis triggered by international pressure imposed over tehran s contested nuclear programme but now losing yourself in a good book is becoming harder as cash strapped publishers struggle because the price of paper is soaring if a 200 page novel sold for 400 000 rials 1 60 last year its price today is 1 000 000 rials 4 10 most of which is the cost of production said reza hasheminejad who runs the ofoq publishing house iran does not produce its own paper pulp for publishing so relies on imports and while those are not under sanctions they must be paid for in foreign currency that means the price of a book depends directly on the fluctuation of iran s rial so publishers are not only slashing the number of titles published but also cutting the number of pages of those they do print by shrinking the font size publishing has suffered a major crisis which could become existential said emily amrai collection director at the houpa publishing house while publishers worldwide face growing challenges to the way people read and consume literature iran is facing an extra problem the united states under former president donald trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from a landmark accord to prevent iran from acquiring an atomic bomb a goal tehran has always denied pursuing with washington then reimposing tough economic sanctions as soon as the us sanctions were reinstated in 2018 the price of paper rose amrai said a miracle long running negotiations to revive a deal with iran continue in austria but until an international agreement turns the page the impact of sanctions grows worse the devaluation of our currency against the greenback the global rise in the price of paper paid in dollars and the increase in the cost of transport also paid in foreign currency has plunged publishing into the doldrums said hossein motevali owner of houpa which specialises in children s books because book prices are fixed in iran profits are pegged to the rapidly fluctuating price of paper between receiving the manuscript laying it out and setting the price of the book i can lose everything if the price of paper has gone up suddenly hasheminejad said that happens because i m at the mercy of the fluctuation of the currencies as for the authors they are paid by the number of the pages in the book whether they are famous or not selling books is a miracle today because the majority of customers belong to the middle class and given the economic conditions their priority is to obtain essential goods such as food said hasheminejad i really wonder how people still buy books at these prices bookstores in iran look similar to shops anywhere in the world as well as shelves of iranian writers popular sellers include translations of foreign works from 20th century european classics to self help and psychology books farsi translations of mary trump s tell all on her uncle donald trump as well as the memoir of former us first lady michelle obama have been recent hits shock but as the crisis deepens several small publishing houses have been driven out of business today many independent publishers who have published excellent works have been eliminated from the market said amrai larger publishing houses have had to adapt to survive we have reduced our profits by as much as possible in order to keep our customers we have reduced printing and pagination and publish digital books to avoid paper and reduce costs said hasheminejad but that will only last a year or two for even the most solid companies so far books printed before recent spikes in paper costs provided a buffer but those stocks are running low in a few months when the books stored in the depots are exhausted it will be a shock for the customer when they see the new prices hasheminejad warned on enghelab street tehran s main book market retired teacher behjat mazloumi 60 already struggles to afford second hand books i haven t been able to buy a book for years said mazloumi even street vendors sell books at a very high price the cost rise will have wider impacts too experts say children in poorer areas where access to literature is already limited will soon find themselves priced out completely hasheminejad said today we see people in some disadvantaged areas who cannot even communicate properly in farsi he said they will certainly experience difficulties

contributor jeff somers even if you aren t paying attention to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies you might have noticed that their value plummeted last week with the total value of the market tumbling from a high of us3 trillion last year to about us1 5 trillion in a matter of days bitcoin the most famous and largest cryptocurrency saw its value go from us69 000 this is around 95 786 in aussie dollars to a low of about us33 000 45 811 this means if you invested in bitcoin or any cryptocurrency recently chances are you just took what experts call a bath but this isn t unusual cryptocurrencies are volatile and always have been in just the last 12 months there have been two massive slumps in the value of bitcoin this is one reason crypto enthusiasts are always telling each other to hodl hold on for dear life these dips aren t unexpected and the value usually claws back to new heights eventually with this latest volatility however some are questioning the fundamentals of crypto especially the claim that it s a good safe harbour hedge investment like gold safe harbours are supposed to be resistant to inflation and market volatility though goldbugs love gold because its value holds steady even when other markets are doing flips the same can t be said for bitcoin and the other 17 000 or so cryptocurrencies on the market where does crypto s value come from cryptocurrency is difficult to understand because it s essentially just computer code every cryptocurrency is built on what s known as a blockchain a truly nifty piece of code that tracks transactions in an incredibly secure public way this makes tampering with the transaction record almost impossible but also offers anonymity and privacy the main reason cryptocurrency has any value is because people say it does and the people saying it does are mostly the folks who have large crypto positions so they re not exactly objective bitcoin is the biggest cryptocurrency in the world but it s still very difficult to buy anything using it and its volatility makes it really difficult to use as a currency the fee structures around crypto transactions are also incredibly volatile and difficult to predict which makes every move you make in the crypto world an exciting and often expensive adventure and then there s the climate impact bitcoin is designed to be limited in supply new bitcoins are mined by solving complex equations all this required was a home computer when the cryptocurrency launched in 2008 and new coins were mined pretty quickly but as more coins are minted it gets harder to mine new ones so hard in fact that bitcoin now uses up more electricity than some small countries and its power demands are only going to get worse this is not only a terrible way to produce anything the costs in terms of finances and climate impact are becoming increasingly concerning undermining faith in cryptocurrencies going forward no wonder el salvador the only country using bitcoin as legal tender contemplated building a mining operation on top of a volcano and finally many countries are poised to rain on crypto s parade russia s central bank is probably going to ban crypto china already has and in the u s the federal reserve seems ready to wade in with its own cryptocurrency but experts are divided on whether this would bolster the market or kill it entirely crypto s association with criminality both in terms of the rising scams luring naive investors to their doom and its popularity with criminal gangs who like the anonymity almost assures that at some point governments are going to start creating and enforcing a lot of regulations around them which doesn t bode well for their future growth should you invest in crypto crypto seems more and more like a massive bubble that s going to burst eventually so the fundamental advice around whether or not to invest in crypto is to regard it as a form of gambling even more so than the stock market with stocks you re always taking a chance but at least there is real definable information you can use to make decisions yes you might get the price of concentrated orange juice futures wrong and see your investments melt away but at least your guess was educated with crypto there s simply no way to predict anything there s zero data bitcoin might soar to 100 000 tomorrow or drop to 10 000 no one knows and worse there s no way to know that means you shouldn t invest any money into crypto you can t afford to lose consider the story of mark cuban billionaire and co star of shark tank he s a guy who regularly tells people what they should be doing to be successful in business and finance but he lost us200 000 277 640 trying his hand at a form of crypto investing called yield farming where you buy crypto tokens and lend them back to the platform to earn interest as he told the new york times i should have done more homework on it bottom line the crypto bubble may not burst today or tomorrow but it s too volatile to risk with your rent money
i have always been a little bit amazed at money not really fascinated by it or consumed by it but more just amazed at it i have some friends who have done well financially and have some serious money sometimes they themselves did well and other times they inherited well in minnesota that generally has to do with inheriting farmland then there are those people you can read about in magazines and newspapers and see on tv you know celebrities star athletes and ceos of large corporations many of those folks make millions of dollars every year why is what they do so much more valuable than what an er nurse for instance does who is saving lives every day you may ask or worth more than what you and i do every day don t even get me started on the super rich you know the multi billionaires the ones who have so much money they need to spend some on sending themselves and some friends into space i mean really how much money does a person need how much can you spend in one lifetime before you are dead and buried and leave it all behind to someone in your will and please please don t get me started on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies now we have money that is not really money it is bad enough to have money in the stock market where you have this much one day and a lot less the next but then again what is good old u s currency money anyway isn t it just a piece of paper that someone somewhere says is worth a certain value ok i have digressed once again and i mean i have really digressed i wonder what you do with your money we all have bills to pay and other things we want to do with our money like get a new car take a vacation maybe buy a boat but if you happen to have some extra money there are a lot of places you can give it to to help make a difference in your world maybe you already do a bit of that you might give money to your church and other charities and if you do good for you locally there are a lot of other places people and organizations which can always use your financial help things like your local food shelf there is one in blue earth and in wells they each serve a side of the county then there is your local united fund a group which raises money and then disperses it to many other worthwhile local organizations in blue earth there is a drive going on right now you probably received a letter recently most schools have an education foundation and raise money to help out local students many of our towns have community foundations which do the same thing for their local communities i could go on but i think you get the idea i hope you are a person who gives some of your money to help others and i hope you like to give locally to help out the community where you live and the people who are your neighbors ok now let s finally get to the crux of this column i have an idea where you could give some money if you have a little extra you can spare and you are not saving up in order to send yourself to outer space the blue earth library and specifically the friends of the blue earth community library and fossil discovery center are having a fund drive to put new banners on an outside wall as you may have seen in last week s faribault county register the cost is between 12 000 and 14 000 and they have half that amount saved and need to raise the other half then there is also a fund drive to purchase a large dinosaur fossil for the new fossil discovery center which is located inside the library both of these projects are being done outside the usual budget of the library so no city taxpayer funds are involved thus they need to get donations in order to proceed with them now in full disclosure i am a member of the library board and the friends of the library so i do have a bit of a vested interest in these things the library board needs its budgeted funds for things like books fixing the roof and paying the heat bill so that is why the friends of the library was created to help raise funds for these extra items which all help make the library an interesting place to go so if you would like to make a donation please write a check to the friends of the blue earth community library and drop it off at the library or at the faribault county register office or mail it to the friends of the blue earth community library c o the blue earth community library 124 w 7th st blue earth mn 56013 please designate it as for the wall banners or the dinosaur fossil if you wish and please note unfortunately at this time we are unable to accept bitcoin as a donation
understandably enough commentaries on the crisis between russia and the west tend to dwell on ukraine after all more than 100 000 russian soldiers and a fearsome array of weaponry have now been emplaced around the ukrainian border still such a narrow perspective deflects attention from an american strategic blunder that dates to the 1990s and is still reverberating during that decade russia was on its knees its economy had shrunk by nearly 40 while unemployment was surging and inflation skyrocketing it reached a monumental 86 in 1999 the russian military was a mess instead of seizing the opportunity to create a new european order that included russia president bill clinton and his foreign policy team squandered it by deciding to expand nato threateningly toward that country s borders such a misbegotten policy guaranteed that europe would once again be divided even as washington created a new order that excluded and progressively alienated post soviet russia the russians were perplexed as well they should have been at the time clinton and company were hailing russian president boris yeltsin as a democrat never mind that he had lobbed tank shells at his own recalcitrant parliament in 1993 and in 1996 prevailed in a crooked election abetted weirdly enough by washington they praised him for launching a transition to a market economy which as nobel laureate svetlana alexievich so poignantly laid out in her book second hand time would plunge millions of russians into penury by decontrolling prices and slashing state provided social services why russians wondered would washington obsessively push a cold war nato alliance ever closer to their borders knowing that a reeling russia was in no position to endanger any european country an alliance saved from oblivion unfortunately those who ran or influenced american foreign policy found no time to ponder such an obvious question after all there was a world out there for the planet s sole superpower to lead and if the u s wasted time on introspection the jungle as the influential neoconservative thinker robert kagan put it would grow back and the world would be imperiled so the clintonites and their successors in the white house found new causes to promote using american power a fixation that would lead to serial campaigns of intervention and social engineering the expansion of nato was an early manifestation of this millenarian mindset something theologian reinhold niebuhr had warned about in his classic book the irony of american history but who in washington was paying attention when the world s fate and the future were being designed by us and only us in what washington post neoconservative columnist charles krauthammer celebrated in 1990 as the ultimate unipolar moment one in which for the first time ever the united states would possess peerless power still why use that opportunity to expand nato which had been created in 1949 to deter the soviet led warsaw pact from rolling into western europe given that both the soviet union and its alliance were now gone wasn t it akin to breathing life into a mummy to that question the architects of nato expansion had stock answers which their latter day disciples still recite the newly born post soviet democracies of eastern and central europe as well as other parts of the continent could be consolidated by the stability that only nato would provide once it inducted them into its ranks precisely how a military alliance was supposed to promote democracy was of course never explained especially given a record of american global alliances that had included the likes of philippine strongman ferdinand marcos greece under the colonels and military ruled turkey and of course if the denizens of the former soviet union now wanted to join the club how could they rightly be denied it hardly mattered that clinton and his foreign policy team hadn t devised the idea in response to a raging demand for it in that part of the world quite the opposite consider it the strategic analog to say s law in economics they designed a product and the demand followed domestic politics also influenced the decision to push nato eastward president clinton had a chip on his shoulder about his lack of combat credentials like many american presidents 31 to be precise he hadn t served in the military while his opponent in the 1996 elections senator bob dole had been badly injured fighting in world war ii worse yet his evasion of the vietnam era draft had been seized upon by his critics so he felt compelled to show washington s power brokers that he had the stomach and temperament to safeguard american global leadership and military preponderance in reality because most voters weren t interested in foreign policy neither was clinton and that actually gave an edge to those in his administration deeply committed to nato expansion from 1993 when discussions about it began in earnest there was no one of significance to oppose them worse yet the president a savvy politician sensed that the project might even help him attract voters in the 1996 presidential election especially in the midwest home to millions of americans with eastern and central european roots furthermore given the support nato had acquired over the course of a generation in washington s national security and defense industry ecosystem the idea of mothballing it was unthinkable since it was seen as essential for continued american global leadership serving as a protector par excellence provided the united states with enormous influence in the world s premier centers of economic power of that moment and officials think tankers academics and journalists all of whom exercised far more influence over foreign policy and cared much more about it than the rest of the population found it flattering to be received in such places as a representative of the world s leading power under the circumstances yeltsin s objections to nato pushing east despite verbal promises made to the last head of the soviet union mikhail gorbachev not to do so could easily be ignored after all russia was too weak to matter and in those final cold war moments no one even imagined such nato expansion so betrayal perish the thought no matter that gorbachev steadfastly denounced such moves and did so again this past december you reap what you sow russian president vladimir putin is now pushing back hard having transformed the russian army into a formidable force he has the muscle yeltsin lacked but the consensus inside the washington beltway remains that his complaints about nato s expansion are nothing but a ruse meant to hide his real concern a democratic ukraine it s an interpretation that conveniently absolves the u s of any responsibility for ongoing events today in washington it doesn t matter that moscow s objections long preceded putin s election as president in 2000 or that once upon a time it wasn t just russian leaders who didn t like the idea in the 1990s several prominent americans opposed it and they were anything but leftists among them were members of the establishment with impeccable cold war credentials george kennan the father of the containment doctrine paul nitze a hawk who served in the reagan administration the harvard historian of russia richard pipes another hardliner senator sam nunn one of the most influential voices on national security in congress senator daniel patrick moynihan a one time u s ambassador to the united nations and robert mcnamara lyndon johnson s secretary of defense their warnings were all remarkably similar nato s expansion would poison relations with russia while helping to foster within it authoritarian and nationalist forces the clinton administration was fully aware of russia s opposition in october 1993 for example james collins the chargé d affaires at the u s embassy in russia sent a cable to secretary of state warren christopher just as he was about to travel to moscow to meet yeltsin warning him that nato s enlargement was neuralgic to russians because in their eyes it would divide europe and shut them out he warned that the alliance s extension into central and eastern europe would be universally interpreted in moscow as directed at russia and russia alone and so regarded as neo containment that same year yeltsin would send a letter to clinton and the leaders of the united kingdom france and germany fiercely opposing nato expansion if it meant admitting former soviet states while excluding russia that would he predicted actually undermine europe s security the following year he clashed publicly with clinton warning that such expansion would sow the seeds of mistrust and plunge post cold war europe into a cold peace the american president dismissed his objections the decision to offer former parts of the soviet union membership in the alliance s first wave of expansion in 1999 had already been taken the alliance s defenders now claim that russia accepted it by signing the 1997 nato russia founding act but moscow really had no choice being dependent then on billions of dollars in international monetary fund loans possible only with the approval of the united states that organization s most influential member so it made a virtue of necessity that document it s true does highlight democracy and respect for the territorial integrity of european countries principles putin has done anything but uphold still it also refers to inclusive security across the euro atlantic area and joint decision making words that hardly describe nato s decision to expand from 16 countries at the height of the cold war to 30 today by the time nato held a summit in romania s capital bucharest in 2008 the baltic states had become members and the revamped alliance had indeed reached russia s border yet the post summit statement praised ukraine s and georgia s aspirations for membership adding we agreed today that these countries will become members of nato president george w bush s administration couldn t possibly have believed moscow would take ukraine s entry into the alliance lying down the american ambassador to russia william burns now the head of the cia had warned in a cable two months earlier that russia s leaders regarded that possibility as a grave threat to their security that cable now publicly available all but foresaw a train wreck like the one we re now witnessing but it was the russia georgia war with rare exceptions mistakenly presented as an unprovoked moscow initiated attack that provided the first signal vladimir putin was past the point of issuing protests his annexation of crimea from ukraine in 2014 following an illegal referendum and the creation of two republics in the donbas itself part of ukraine were far more dramatic moves that effectively initiated a second cold war averting disaster and now here we are a divided europe increasing instability amid military threats by nuclear armed powers and the looming possibility of war as putin s russia its troops and armaments massed around ukraine demand that nato expansion cease ukraine be barred from the alliance and the united states and its allies finally take russia s objections to the post cold war security order seriously of the many obstacles to averting war one is particularly worth noting the widespread claim that putin s concerns about nato are a smokescreen obscuring his true fear democracy particularly in ukraine russia however repeatedly objected to nato s eastward march even when it was still being hailed as a democracy in the west and long before putin became president in 2000 besides ukraine has been a democracy however tumultuous since it became independent in 1991 so why the russian buildup now vladimir putin is anything but a democrat still this crisis is unimaginable without the continual talk about someday ushering ukraine into nato and kyiv s intensifying military cooperation with the west especially the united states moscow views both as signs that ukraine will eventually join the alliance which not democracy is putin s greatest fear now for the encouraging news the looming disaster has finally energized diplomacy we know that the hawks in washington will deplore any political settlement that involves compromise with russia as appeasement they ll liken president biden to neville chamberlain the british prime minister who in 1938 gave way to hitler in munich some of them advocate a massive weapons airlift to ukraine à la berlin as the cold war began others go further urging biden to muster an international coalition of the willing readying military forces to deter putin and if necessary prepare for war sanity however can still prevail through a compromise russia could settle for a moratorium on ukrainian membership in nato for say two decades something the alliance should be able to accept because it has no plans to fast track kyiv s membership anyway to gain ukraine s assent it would be guaranteed the freedom to secure arms for self defense and to satisfy moscow kyiv would agree never to allow nato bases or aircraft and missiles capable of striking russia on its territory the deal would have to extend beyond ukraine if it is to ward off crises and war in europe the united states and russia would need to summon the will to discuss arms control there including perhaps an improved version of the 1987 intermediate range nuclear forces treaty that president trump ditched in 2019 they would also need to explore confidence building measures like excluding troops and armaments from designated areas along the nato russian borderlands and steps to prevent the now frequent close encounters between american and russian warplanes and warships that could careen out of control over to the diplomats here s wishing them well this article has been republished with permission from tomdispatch

this song together as for his involvement with the song exile joe had written that entire piano part and he was singing the bon iver part he was just singing it and so i was entranced and i asked if

someone especially if you ve met someone who has a very grounded normal way of living i oftentimes in my anxieties can control how i am as a person and how normal i act and rationalise things but i cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives i can t control if there s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow robert kamau getty images asked by mccartney does your partner sympathise with that and understand taylor responded oh absolutely but i think that in knowing him and being in the relationship i am in now i have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids whether that s deciding where to live who to hang out with when to not take a picture the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain but it s really just trying to find bits of normalcy that s what that

governors this year voters in four of those states will also choose secretaries of state who will administer future elections while the new governor of pennsylvania will appoint someone to that role the fight could be particularly consequential in wisconsin where two gop candidates for governor favor scrapping the bipartisan commission that oversees elections trump leaned on republican state officials to overturn his losses in 2020 and is backing primary challengers in georgia against gov brian kemp and secretary of state brad raffensperger because they refused the former president who remains influential with gop voters is promoting midterm candidates who support restrictive voting laws and who echo his debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him layered atop trump s eagerness to have loyalists in place is the inability so far of senate democrats to pass federal election legislation they contend is necessary to blunt state level voting restrictions democratic governors and secretaries of state are already pushing back on proposed voting restrictions advanced by conservative legislatures i think what is clear is that the state actors like a governor are going to be critical to defending our democracy pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro a democrat running for governor said in an interview with nbc news and pennsylvania i believe will be at the epicenter of that fight voting rights and election integrity rated as a top three issue facing the country behind jobs and the economy and the pandemic in an nbc news poll last month among the adults surveyed 76 percent said they believed there was a threat to democracy and majority rule what s happened to our democracy wisconsin gov tony evers a democrat seeking re election this year wondered in an interview we should make it easier for eligible people to vote not more difficult in a video that played before recent gop debates among senate and gubernatorial hopefuls in pennsylvania trump repeated his lie that he won the state in 2020 and stressed that the vote counter is more important than the candidate shapiro who boasts of beating trump and his allies dozens of times in court over cases of alleged voter fraud said appointing a secretary of state who will respect the rule of law is among his top priorities two other democrats running for governor this year stacey abrams in georgia and beto o rourke in texas emerged as national advocates for voting rights in recent years biding their time after losing campaigns four years ago abrams for governor and o rourke for the senate o rourke organized voter registration efforts even driving to register some voters personally and raised money for the state lawmakers who fled texas while fighting some of the strictest voting rights restrictions in the country last year abrams testified before congress repeatedly in support of federal voting legislation and threw her support behind potential compromise legislation in arizona secretary of state katie hobbs has seen her political stock rise since the 2020 election like shapiro she s hoping to parlay that profile into a promotion to governor trump has endorsed kari lake a former tv news anchor in phoenix who has said she would not have certified biden s victory in the state in the crowded republican primary i don t know that i d have the same momentum that i have hobbs said of her bid for governor following her high profile defense of the 2020 election and its results as arizona s secretary of state democrats running for secretary of state this year said that while the job has gotten harder fighting misinformation facing harassment on the job their platform is bigger there are people who do not believe in democracy running to oversee elections that s like giving a bank robber the keys to a bank said jena griswold colorado s secretary of state and chair of the democratic association of secretaries of state that platform and voters newfound understanding of their work has made campaigning easier the 2020 election fundamentally changed the conversation about being in this extremely administrative position said new mexico secretary of state maggie toulouse oliver who is seeking re election it s changed the conversation from being about how well do you administrate to whether or not you believe our democracy is in peril the increased awareness has translated into campaign contributions candidates for secretary of state in arizona georgia michigan minnesota nevada and wisconsin are raking in contributions that are collectively three times higher than at this point in the 2018 cycle and eight times higher than the same point in 2014 cycle according to a report out this month from the brennan center for justice at the new york university school of law michigan secretary of state jocelyn benson a democrat is running for a second term this year in a state biden won and where trump challenged the results in court with baseless claims of fraud trump has endorsed republican kristina karamo who worked as a detroit poll challenger in 2020 and is known for making false election claims those who have supported me in the past have in some cases doubled or tripled or quadrupled what they ve given in the past because they have seen the sense of urgency increase in my race benson said georgia s raffensperger is one of the few republicans running on a defense of the election system while also playing to those skeptical of past results by pushing for a constitutional amendment that would reaffirm that only citizens can vote raffensperger said his pitch to voters includes a clinical explanation of how trump lost the state by fewer than 12 000 votes in 2020 he tells them of the 28 000 georgians who skipped the presidential race but voted for down ballot candidates including then sen david perdue a republican who later lost a runoff perdue is now challenging kemp for governor with trump s endorsement and then i say let that sink in said raffensperger who is facing a gop primary against trump backed rep jody hice and then i say that s why president trump came up short in wisconsin evers is likely to present a strong contrast against his opponent this fall on the issues of elections and voting rights last august he vetoed six republican bills that he believed would restrict voter access including a measure that would have ended a photo id exemption for voters with disabilities the two leading republican candidates rebecca kleefisch and kevin nicholson both want to disband the wisconsin elections commission the bipartisan body that administers elections in the state republicans favored the commission when it was created in 2015 but have scrutinized its work since the 2020 election this month the wisconsin supreme court declined a lawsuit from kleefisch a former lieutenant governor who had challenged the commission s guidance for ballot drop boxes evers and other democrats connected the importance of election issues to progress on issues that resonate more with voters jobs health care education and infrastructure of course it is a priority but i just have to keep saying this the people of wisconsin do care about kitchen table issues too evers said we can walk and chew gum at the same time but it is important obviously to save our democracy correction feb 16 2022 6 22 p m et a previous version of this article misstated the rate at which candidates for secretary of state in arizona georgia michigan minnesota nevada and wisconsin are taking in contributions compared to this point in 2014 based on incorrect information from the brennan center for justice according to an updated report from the center the rate is eight times higher not almost eight times higher

regardless of what was to be a maine boy s occupation or profession an indispensable part of his upbringing was a voyage in the west india trade so begins chapter 6 titled the west india trade of william hutchinson rowe s 1948 the maritime history of maine rowe describes how young male mainers would take the opportunity to see some of the world and sow their royal oats about the author seth goldstein is a maritime historian based out of south portland he teaches history at the maine college of art and design and is educational coordinator for the atlantic black box project the author goes on to describe the many commodities that maine shipped to the west indies including house frames all ready to put up oxen and horses for the plow the sugar and the treadmill farm produce such as parsnips potatoes onions and grain beef mutton pork pickled fish soap candles and dried codfish in drums of from five to eight hundred pounds each lumber from the banks of maine rivers which cost there 8 00 a thousand sold in havana for 60 00 beets and parsnips brought 16 00 a barrel in the french islands remarkably rowe s entire chapter on the west indies trade also known as provisioning trade does not once mention the labor of enslaved africans this to me seems like an apt metaphor for how we have treated our maritime heritage in new england generally and the state of maine specifically we put our historical ships and mariners on a pedestal but we don t ask hard questions like where were these ships and crews sailing to what cargo did the holds of the vessels contain historians have only begun to grapple with maine s complicity in the economics of atlantic world enslavement recent exhibits such as begin again reckoning with intolerance in maine at the maine historical society in portland and the ongoing cotton town at bath s maine maritime museum are encouraging early steps in acknowledging this history but there is still much work to be done if we are to have an accurate historical representation of the significance of this trade to the city of portland and the state of maine the fact that 73 of the 89 ships that departed portland harbor in 1787 were bound for the west indies is indicative of the significance of the trade to the region the sugar producing islands of the west indies found the proceeds from sugar sales so lucrative that forests were cut down on the islands and sugar was grown almost exclusively in these locales hence maine and other regions of new england supplied the necessary lumber to build plantations the casks to ship the molasses and rum and the salt cod and other produce that fed the enslaved africans salt cod caught in the gulf of maine and cured on the portland waterfront was of particular significance in this exchange as salt cod was the most affordable protein available before the advent of refrigeration because of cod s low fat content it took the salting process better than any other type of fish or meat only the lowest quality salt cod that was shipped to the west indies to feed the enslaved africans as the better quality fish was traded to the catholic countries on the north shore of the mediterranean there the cod was consumed on fridays when meat was banned advertisement although we today think of casks as barrels a barrel is in fact a size of cask along with a hogshead a tierce and a firkin historically almost all commodities were shipped in casks artisans who crafted casks were known as coopers casks would have been broken down for shipping purposes into their basic components of numbered staves headers and hoops and shipped to the plantations of the west indies these casks would then be assembled once they reached the plantations and filled with molasses and rum for export maine coopers would travel to the west indies to do this work these casks of molasses and rum would then make up the return cargo of maine ships involved in this exchange the seven rum distilleries that dotted the portland waterfront in the early 18th century are a testament to the importance and volume of this trade some of the rum distilled in portland was then used as a trade good on the west coast of africa to buy enslaved africans large quantities of rum along with molasses were consumed in portland and in maine s interior where they were shipped using the extensive canal infrastructure most notably the cumberland and oxford canal following the haitian revolution in the late 1700s the center of maine s exchange with the west indies shifted from the island of hispaniola to the spanish colony of cuba horrifically the life expectancy of an enslaved african in cuba should they survive the dreaded middle passage across the atlantic was seven years planation owners coldly determined that it was more financially sound to import new enslaved africans than to properly feed and take care of these individuals enslaved africans were literally worked to death in his essay comunidad escondida latin american influences in 19th and 20th century portland david carey jr writes at a time when cuba was the united states third largest trading partner portland was one of the major ports in this exchange and maine made ships were among the most common vessels trafficking in the west indies ships loaded with lumber bricks and ice set sail for the caribbean islands and returned with sugar molasses rum and goods to stock local grocery stores the wealth generated in this trade affected portland s physical environment from landfill extended wharves to large homes that remain central to portland s identity the portland bricks that dot the streets of trinidad cuba are symbolic of the intricate relations between portland and latin america carey uses the term cognitive dissonance to refer to the relationship of portland s citizens with the labor of enslaved africans while many mainers supported abolition in the united states he notes they benefited from the labor of enslaved africans abroad the ornate sugar bowls in the possession of the maine historical society add credence to carey s assertion historically the working poor would have used molasses to sweeten their food and beverages but rich portlanders would have had a bowl of refined white sugar on their dining tables to offer and impress their guests the magnitude of this exchange is evident in the fact that the largest building on the portland waterfront in the 19th century was the j b brown sugar refinery which began operations in the 1840s a thousand people worked in the seven story building by the 1860s and the company was processing 20 percent of the nation s molasses more than in any other city in the united states its proprietor used some of the proceeds from this robust business to purchase a large swath of land on portland s western promenade there he built a palatial mansion which he named bramhall and sold plots of land to other well to do merchants involved in the west indies trade although bramhall burned to the ground the neighborhood is still today known by that name and the mansions of brown s fellow merchants still stand as evidence of the profitability of the trade following the death of their father brown s sons philip henry and john marshall constructed the j b brown building which still stands on congress street to honor their father it is a testament to the power of generational wealth that j b brown sons is still today deeply involved in portland commercial real estate according to the company s website they developed 51 residential units and a retail space at 40 free st in 2020 the company is described as still family owned another example of portland s architectural heritage that was built on proceeds from business of sugar production is the safford house at 93 high st today the headquarters of greater portland landmarks which recently announced its intent to sell the building the structure was built for the merchant william safford in 1858 safford made much of his money through the importation of molasses from cuba and frequently traveled to that island to look after his sugar interests in the city of cardenas one of his children his daughter inez was born in cardenas in 1848 african diaspora history is american history and should not be relegated to the month of february the labor of enslaved africans built this country this region this state and this city until we acknowledge this painful but necessary history we cannot recognize or grapple with our current inequities and continued issues of race and racism in the state

in 1983 a restaurant named reza s opened on the corner of berwyn avenue and clark street in chicago s andersonville neighborhood marked by a simple sign and glass fronted doors it was small with barely enough room for six tables but it quickly became a hub for iranian immigrants in the windy city the iranians who gathered there were looking more or less for the same things community and persian flavors floral saffron scented basmati rice creamy soups thick stews and tender braised meats these were the tense unsettling years following the 1979 iranian revolution and iran hostage crisis my mother and aunt who were born in iran but settled in chicago after the revolution found reza s in its early days it quickly became a home away from home for them and the families they established in chicago it s not too much of a stretch to say that i grew up within the chicago common brick walls of reza s dining room in the mid 1980s the restaurant expanded from its original cramped footprint to an expansive set of rooms eventually with a capacity to seat 200 guests or more this might be hard to believe but i was a picky eater as a kid my mother tells me that when i was 5 or 6 i wanted to eat nothing except the appetizer that reza s served free with every entree order a chunky lentil soup with a tomato base thick with rice and finished with lemon juice and lots of chopped parsley after we ordered our main courses long skewers of grilled meat or chicken lamb shanks braised with onions and tomatoes fesenjan or ghormeh sabzi the servers would parade out of the kitchen with bowls of the soup baskets of warm pita and plates of feta and herb sprigs naan o paneer o sabzi it s rare for a formal iranian meal to exclude this combination of warm bread cheese and herbs but reza s added the soup advertisement i had my own little ritual around it i d crumble bits of feta and bread into it letting the cheese almost poach into creamy dumplings in the hot soup while the bread thickened it into a porridge when family members pushed their soup bowls away to save room for their main courses i asked for their uneaten bowls at one point my mom asked the manager at reza s if they d share the recipe but they always refused saying it belonged to reza s mother and was a family secret as an adult i ve re created it from taste memory it s a bowl of tangy warmth with soft lentils and rice suspended in a ruddy broth flavored with onions cumin cinnamon and parsley for the full experience serve it with warm pita feta and fresh herbs to nibble on between spoonfuls persian style tomato and lentil soup active time 20 minutes total time 50 minutes advertisement 4 to 6 servings makes about 7 cups of soup inspired by soup served at reza s restaurant in chicago this recipe highlights lentils which figure prominently in iranian cuisine here they re simmered in a tomato based broth with basmati rice sweet onions and lots of warming spices the key to this version s flavor is a generous amount of chopped parsley and lemon juice added just before serving i wouldn t skip the onion here as it adds a subtle sweetness but you could substitute garlic or leeks if that was all you had green or brown lentils are ideal though yellow or red split peas would work too if you re out of basmati you can use another kind of long grain rice or more lentils instead no tomato paste use a 15 ounce can of crushed tomatoes and reduce the broth to 4 cups the soup will be less tomato y but will still work advertisement if you dislike parsley try basil or a mix of tender herbs serve soup with warm pita hunks of feta and plenty of fresh tender herbs storage notes leftovers can be refrigerated for up to 4 days ingredients 3 tablespoons ghee or olive oil 1 medium yellow onion 8 ounces diced advertisement 3 4 cup 5 ounces green or brown lentils 1 2 cup 3 1 2 ounces uncooked basmati rice 1 6 ounce can tomato paste 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon dried mint leaves optional 1 2 teaspoon fine salt plus more as needed advertisement 1 4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 4 teaspoon ground cinnamon 6 cups low sodium vegetable or chicken broth divided 1 2 bunch 2 ounces fresh parsley preferably curly leaves and tender stems finely chopped and divided plus more for serving 1 4 cup fresh lemon juice from 2 large lemons plus more to taste fresh herbs

medium high heat until it shimmers add the onion and stir occasionally until it starts to brown about 5 minutes stir in the lentils and rice coating them in the fat add the tomato paste cumin dried

and bring to a boil decrease the heat to medium low stir cover and simmer until the rice and lentil are cooked through 20 to 25 minutes if soup thickens more than you d like add water 1 4 cup at a

the mixed signals of campaign 2022 the sunday political brunch february 13 2022 in 1980 former gov ronald reagan r california asked such a simple question are you better off today than you were four years ago to many the resounding answer was no reagan coined the phrase misery index to reflect double digital inflation unemployment and interest rates under president jimmy carter inflation reached 7 5 percent this week the highest since 1982 but unemployment is at 4 with interest rates at 25 we are nowhere near the misery index when unemployment exceeded 10 percent with interest rates at 20 percent still inflation alone can have an impact let s brunch on that this week inflation conflagration one of my most famous and often quoted political axioms is that politics is as much about the math as it is about the ideology in other words you can have the greatest ideas on earth but if you don t have the votes you won t win the reason i say inflation could still be of concern to voters and the politicians is that it is something people see and feel every day yes virtually everyone who wants a job has a job and buying long term investments such as homes and cars come with low interest rates but inflation is simply in your face at the gas pump and the grocery store these days that s a big concern for democrats who control the white house senate and house of representatives they are in charge and have to defend their record in an election year manchin weighs in as he so often does the nation s most powerful lawmaker sen joe manchin d west virginia is weighing in with a stinging punch at his own party for months i have been ringing the alarm bell about inflation once again we are witnessing that the threat of inflation is real there is not a corner of this nation where hard working families are able to escape the noticeable impact of this inflation tax inflation taxes are draining the hard earned wages of every american and it s causing real and severe economic pain that can no longer be ignored it s beyond time for the federal reserve to tackle this issue head on and congress and the administration must proceed with caution before adding more fuel to an economy already on fire as inflation and our 30 trillion in national debt continue a historic climb only in washington dc do people seem to think that spending trillions more of taxpayers money will cure our problems let alone inflation ukraine strain the tensions between the u s and russia over a possible ukraine invasion aren t helping matters and it s giving the financial markets jitters

signaled interest rate hikes are coming real clear politics clarity the latest real clear politics composite poll on presidential approval is not good news for the biden white house either the average of the latest polls gives president biden an approval rating of 41 percent and a disapproval rating of 54 percent those are not the kind of numbers you want nine months from a midterm election the latest cnn poll as of february 6 showed a disapproval rate of 57 percent and an insider advantage poll from january 23 put the biden disapproval rating at 59 percent it s trending in the wrong direction for the white house no matter how you slice it gop censure dissent even intra party dissent is one of the healthiest aspects of democracy especially in american politics and should not be discouraged said dr mark curtis a 46 year political reporter and analyst okay so i quoted myself lol here s my point i don t get why the republican national committee would take the time to censure rep liz cheney r wyoming and rep adam kinzinger r illinois for serving on the house select committee investigating the january 6th assault on the u s capitol can t we all agree to disagree hmmmm republican ronald reagan challenged incumbent president gerald ford for renomination in 1976 and almost won democrat ted kennedy challenged president jimmy carter for renomination in 1980 and lost why should intra party challengers such as cheney and kinzinger be punished folks just let democracy happen and it will voters don t need to be guided by censure sometimes intra party dissent leads to change when a group of republican u s senators led by howard baker and hugh scott went the white house in 1974 and told president nixon he could not survive he resigned pence rebuke fallout late last week came word that former vice president mike pence was at odds with his old boss about the 2020 election count pence said president donald trump is wrong in claiming that pence had the right to overturn the 2020 election on january 6th 2021 it is un american to suggest one person could have decided the outcome pence paraphrased is the rnc now going to censure pence pence vs desantis folks i think you have to assume trump is the frontrunner for the republican presidential nomination in 2024 but when trump is taken out of the mix the harvard caps harris poll of 1 815 registered voters named desantis as first choice with 30 percent with pence just behind on 24 percent and sen ted cruz tx is in third place with 14 percent that leaves 32 percent of voters either undecided or backing candidates who poll in the single digits from a purely political standpoint pence may be trying to attract those voters by distancing himself from trump it will be fascinating to watch this play out

consumer price index cpi which measures the price of everyday goods and services rose by 7 5 in january the highest rate since 1982 and ahead of economist expectations for a rise of 7 3 the surging cost of energy food housing and medical care among other factors are adding to the existing pressure from labor shortages supply disruptions and strong demand in the wake of the covid 19 pandemic core cpi which excludes volatile food and energy categories and is the fed s preferred means of measuring inflation soared 6 in january from the previous year also the highest since 1982 and above forecasts for 5 9 advertisement investors quickly sold off riskier assets like stocks and cryptocurrencies and dumped short dated bonds sending the yield on the two year treasury note up by the most in one day since mid 2009 the jump in inflation beat all market forecasts and weighed on the markets with the s p 500 dow jones and nasdaq opening lower on the news 10 year us treasury yields hit 2 for the first since 2019 while the dollar fell 0 15 the greater than expected surge has added more pressure on the federal reserve to raise interest rates and contain inflation and consumer demand it s also prompted investors to reassess how fast the central bank is likely to increase interest rates based on the cme group s fedwatch tool investors are attaching a 70 chance of a 50 basis point rise at the fed s next meeting in march that s up from around 34 a week ago advertisement some of the world s biggest banks and asset managers weighed in on how thursday s data has changed the outlook for us rates we list their comments below goldman sachs jay hatzius chief economist following this morning s strong cpi print we are raising our fed forecast to include seven consecutive 25 basis point rate hikes at each of the remaining fomc meetings in 2022 vs five hikes in 2022 previously we continue to expect the fomc to hike three more times at a gradual once per quarter pace in 2023q1 q3 and to reach the same terminal rate of 2 5 2 75 but earlier we see the arguments for a 50 basis point rate hike in march the level of the funds rate looks inappropriate and the combination of very high inflation hot wage growth and high short term inflation expectations means that concerns about falling into a wage price spiral deserve to be taken seriously advertisement so far though most fed officials who have commented have opposed a 50 basis point hike in march we therefore think that the more likely path is a longer series of 25 basis point bp hikes instead st louis fed president james bullard became the first fomc participant to call for a 50 basis point hike earlier today and we would consider changing our forecast if other participants join him especially if the market continues to price high odds of a 50 basis point move in march jpmorgan asset management jai malhi global market strategist us inflation has consistently beaten expectations and today s inflation release saw more of the same this provides a significant challenge for the fed as it aims to keep price increases under control while at the same time sustaining the economic expansion advertisement high energy prices and supply issues are stoking inflation but these issues should eventually fade of greater concern is that wage pressures are building and the central bank will not want to risk a wage price spiral looking ahead though real consumer spending on discretionary goods and services is likely to cool naturally as higher energy costs begin to bite the bond market is currently suggesting that there is a good chance the fed will hike rates more than five times by the end of the year while today s release will be uncomfortable reading for the fed the squeeze on real incomes suggests they can perhaps afford to be a little more patient than the market thinks hsbc private banking and wealth willem sels global chief investment officer advertisement the consumer price index was expected to rise further in january but it jumped even more than anticipated and so the debate around inflation will rage on for now what markets really want to know is when us inflation will peak but this upward surprise again illustrates how difficult it is to accurately forecast inflation the inflation debate is not settled and we advocate three strategies in portfolios to deal with high inflation first we look for quality stocks companies with strong market positions that allow them to charge through higher input costs to their customers so they can protect their margins second tech stocks can be vulnerable to higher rates and hence we balance them with value style stocks such as banks and energy stocks and thirdly we think investors need to expect continued volatility in markets until it is clear that inflation is coming down and we manage this through disciplined portfolio diversification pimco advertisement tiffany wilding north american economist regarding monetary policy this print surely increases the probability of the federal reserve increasing rates by 50 basis points in march and consistently the market pricing moved to a 50 probability however we still think the fed would prefer to hike sequentially at every meeting instead of a more abrupt adjustment furthermore if the credit card data that we use to forecast retail sales turns out to be right the combination of the cpi and retail sales prints suggests that the ability to pass on further price adjustments may be waning nevertheless this print will surely concern the fed and makes it tough for them to push back against market pricing at a minimum today s data solidifies our expectation that the fed will likely begin hiking rates at a once per meeting pace deutsche bank advertisement chief strategist jim reid indeed the 7 5 yoy print vs 7 2 expected even raised the small possibility of the first inter meeting fed rate hike since 1994 and before that since 1979 it also raises the risk that a recession might be increasingly difficult to avoid our us economists yesterday moved up their us fed call to a 50 basis point hike in march plus five more 25 basis point hikes in 2022 a hike at all but the november meeting and totalling 175 basis points in 2022 they also highlight the increasing risk of a 2023 or 2024 recession clearly forward guidance is a useful tool when you have uncertainty but around regime change it can prove a nightmare for several months we ve had to wait patiently until march to start the fight against inflation when in previous eras when every meeting would have been live rates would have likely been hiked many meetings ago

five planes from egyptian resorts returned to boryspil airport yesterday picked up new passengers and flew back a plane also flew in from the cuban resort of varadero where my friend the publisher anetta antonenko recently had 10 days rest ukrainians are already used to warming up and sunbathing in egypt in winter i do not know how they feel now flying to warmer climes do they take with them documents for their property and everything that the ukrainian government advised its citizens to put in one emergency suitcase along with a supply of food for two days a change of underwear and personal documents actually i checked the departures arrivals website because the british embassy sent an email to my english wife with a warning that she and the children must leave while there are commercial flights if they stay they should not count on the help of the embassy i am not british i am a citizen of ukraine nobody sends me emails demanding i leave as soon as possible my wife decided to stay as did our sons theo and anton who do not want to go anywhere the elder theo works at an animation film studio and recently signed a contract until the end of may anton is 19 and waiting for spring to fix a 1974 soviet moskvich car he bought a year ago for 800 in the past two days there have been many statements from the united states canada japan and other countries announcing that almost all diplomats are leaving ukraine as there is information that active hostilities including city bombing may begin in the next 48 hours but as long as the planes are flying i am calm not only that my wife and i are going to dinner with the ambassador of brazil tonight brazil has not yet made any announcements my friend said that we should actually keep an eye on the chinese embassy as soon as it announces the evacuation of its employees then the threat of war must be taken seriously russia will definitely warn china before bombing kyiv they are now strategic partners the chinese embassy is silent for now our close friends an elderly japanese french couple are at a loss they have been living in kyiv for a long time they bought two large apartments in the centre one is for rent the other is for living as is the case with many of the foreigners who moved to ukraine they too don t want to go anywhere i ve lost a lot because of the pandemic i wouldn t want to lose everything again this time because of the war the war barometer in kyiv is exchange rates and statements by the president volodymyr zelensky if the dollar and the euro rise sharply against the hryvnia then the war has become even closer today the dollar and the euro have risen in price more than usual but in truth in recent weeks they have already been at this level and even more expensive petrol has already risen noticeably in price too but it is still cheaper than in the uk zelensky again reassured ukrainians and said that everything was under control he has repeatedly accused western politicians of exaggerating the danger of a russian attack though after his speeches i feel as if he s downplayed the threat i am one of many ukrainians who has to change euros and dollars regularly to pay for living and utility bills my main income comes from selling books abroad a week ago i went to the exchange office where the rate is usually very good a young guy was standing at the window of the exchange office and changing several packs of 100 bills for hryvnias an employee approached me and said this client has a very large amount the cashier will be busy for a long time how much do you want to change one hundred dollars i replied tanya give me small change for a hundred dollars putting the hryvnias in my pocket i went outside and for the first time thought about the fact that 100 no longer means so much in ukraine prices in the country have long since become european while ordinary salaries and pensions have largely remained post soviet most of my neighbours in the village receive a pension of just over 100 a month but they usually have large stocks of vegetables and canned food in the cellar however civil servants in kyiv receive salaries of thousands of dollars a month they live in a different reality now both of these realities are under threat under the threat of war yesterday i noticed that the exchange office where i changed money the other day had already closed disappeared it is no more but there are several other exchanges nearby as long as banks and exchange offices are open you can be relatively calm today my friend invited my wife and me to one of the best restaurants in kyiv for his birthday next saturday 19 february does this mean that there will be no war until 19 february i really hope so i ve lost a lot because of the pandemic trips abroad book festivals and exhibitions and also for we need pleasure dinners in good restaurants i wouldn t want to lose everything again this time because of the war it s so strange to think that the whole world now depends on what can happen in the head of a single ageing man
