china s securities regulator and american authorities have initiated talks on the audit inspection of us listed chinese companies which could stave off the potential delisting of these firms after years of non compliance the relevant regulators of china and the us have started the negotiations over the regulatory cooperation issues have made some progress according to a statement from the china securities regulatory commission csrc on friday the csrc released the statement soon after us regulator the public company accounting oversight board pcaob published early on friday a report which determined that it was unable to inspect or investigate completely registered public accounting firms headquartered in mainland china and hong kong because of the position taken by authorities in those markets do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world get the answers with scmp knowledge our new platform of curated content with explainers faqs analyses and infographics brought to you by our award winning team seven mainland chinese and eight hong kong accounting firms are currently overdue for inspection according to the pcaob the report indicated that the pcaob has never completed an inspection of a mainland chinese firm and has not finished an inspection of a hong kong firm since 2010 the facade of the china securities regulatory commission headquarters in beijing photo simon song alt the facade of the china securities regulatory commission headquarters in beijing photo simon song the 15 accounting firms mentioned in the us regulator s report are responsible for auditing 191 us listed chinese firms with a combined market capitalisation at us 1 9 trillion the csrc however said on friday that the us report did not fully reflect china s efforts to reach a solution it indicated that both the us securities and exchange commission and pcaob have been working with chinese authorities to draw up a solution story continues we are ready to have further discussions with us authorities any time the csrc said as long as both sides adopt an approach of mutual respect and trust that follows international practice the two sides can find a path that could meet the regulatory requirements of both parties to protect the interests of the global investors and the development of the capital markets of the two countries last year the csrc presented proposals to collaborate with the pcaob since 2019 these were geared towards reconciling local auditing rules with global bookkeeping standards rebutting criticisms that beijing was allowing chinese companies to cheat on us capital markets the csrc s latest statement comes months after it pledged to cooperate with the us over how it supervises the auditing of chinese companies which could prevent these firms from being delisted from american bourses in three years if they do not share their audits for review china has long denied us securities regulators the ability to inspect the financial audits of its us listed companies saying they contain state secrets chinese law bars financial institutions including accounting audit and legal firms from providing any securities related documents to foreign parties without permission despite the creation of a pilot scheme for cross border cooperation in 2016 the pcaob has not completed any investigation about audit work done on us listed chinese companies because beijing refuses to allow the us regulator to conduct such routine inspection as such the pcaob report said hong kong and mainland china cannot comply with audit inspection requirements under the holding foreign companies accountable act a company that fails to comply with this us law for over three consecutive years is subject to delisting people are seen on

while the pcaob is expected to publish another report about this matter next year it is still keen to negotiate with mainland chinese regulators we remain interested in a relationship with authorities that facilitates the access necessary to oversee pcaob registered audit firms in mainland china and hong kong consistent with the robust international regulatory cooperation we experience everywhere else in the world said duane desparte acting chairman of pcaob in a statement on thursday to protect investors and to carry out the pcaob s mandate our inspectors and investigators need consistent access across all jurisdictions to the audit work performed for public companies in us capital markets the pcaob report marks a step on the journey to delist the chinese issuers should the present situation remain unresolved said clement chan chairman of hong kong association of registered public interested entity auditors however it is not a dead end yet said chan who is managing director of bdo one of the hong kong based accounting firms identified in the us report the csrc and pcaob should continue their efforts to reach a middle ground and overcome this hurdle as both have the same goal of maintaining a robust and healthy capital equity market local brokers also urge the two sides to reach an agreement as soon as possible it is vital for hong kong as an international financial centre to give confidence to investors said tom chan pak lam chairman of the hong kong institute securities dealers an industry body of local brokerage houses there are a lot of us listed chinese companies that have dual primary listing or secondary listing in hong kong if they were labelled as non compliant with the us regulation it will affect investors confidence in these companies

suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of u s cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that whole of government effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that that s going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure u s officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly it s unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning it s also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the u s following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any drop off in high profile attacks to u s efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on large scale attacks won t work because it s way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they don t even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since biden s discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say they ve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said there s been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why it s hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginia s legislature the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the school s it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the school s online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if it s going to happen but when it s going to happen ___
if i had to make a list of memorable products from the 2021 pca convention trade show black works studio s the hive would be a pretty early entrant in a year when samplers of all shapes and sizes seemed to be more en vogue than samplers normally are few captured my attention quite like the 27 count sampler centered around the company s series of cigars named after bees and other stinging insects the box is a hexagon reminiscent of the shape of honeycomb inside are six different cigars all of them new and so far exclusive to the hive sampler the quantities of each of the six cigars range from three to six cigars 6 black works studio green hornet lancero 7 1 4 x 42 4 black works studio green hornet perfecto 5 x 60 4 black works studio kato candela robusto 5 x 50 6 black works studio killer bee connecticut lancero 7 1 4 x 42 3 black works studio killer bee lancero 7 1 4 x 42 4 black works studio killer bee perfecto 5 x 60 hive is an idea i ve had for a few years now said james brown creator of black label trading co and partner at fabrica oveja negra in a press release the killer bee green hornet lines are some of our most popular and over the years i ve played with a lot of different ideas for both the hive is a mix of some of my favorite bee hornet samples that have yet to be released for anyone that is a fan of the killer bee green hornet this is a must have

smoked for review 3 this is one of the most radical looking cigars you ll see the shape itself is pretty different but that s a complete afterthought given all that s going on with the wrappers depending on the cigar there are between three and four dark stripes up top and four light stripes on the bottom though you ll need to turn the cigar to see the full array as interesting as it all looks upon closer inspection it s not the cleanest cigar ever rolled i don t think it s fair to criticize the evenness of the stripes but i m surprised how loose the seams of the main wrapper are on each cigar in the above picture you can see a bit of this on the right side the aroma from the killer bee perfecto is a medium plus mixture of barnyard roasted coffee and acidity it s pretty reminiscent of the aroma of a cup of generic black coffee that is brewed too hot the foot is medium plus with earthiness over barnyard floral sweetness black tea and a bit of pepper my normal approach is to cut off a smaller amount than most as i like draws a bit tighter and then perform a second cut if i think it s necessary i m surprised how open the draw is after cutting off less than a third of an inch of the cigar flavor wise i pick up earthiness some acidity and at times a soapy flavor the black works killer bee perfecto begins with a medium full mixture of oak earthiness and some burnt meatiness that reminds me of poultry more than beef or pork there s a fair bit of black pepper that reminds me of connecticut shade tobacco though there isn t the accompanying creaminess that i typically find fortunately the draw is tighter than it was on the cold draw though it s not too tight the profile is led by earthiness over creaminess sunflower seeds mineral flavors and a hard breadstick flavor it finishes with a damp earth sunflower seeds a crisp bread flavor that reminds me of pringles some nuttiness and white pepper one sample is similar to the other two save for green pepper replacing white pepper and some added lemon retrohales remind me of the complexity of previous killer bees earthiness and graham crackers over an orange liqueur nuttiness peanut shells and leather the finish sees the peanut shells come to the forefront on top of creaminess and some sort of sauce flavor that reminds me of a balsamic glaze though not entirely there flavor is medium full body is medium plus and strength is medium plus construction is great on two cigars though one cigar needs touch ups to deal with an uneven burn my lasting impression of the killer bees i had before the first third of this cigar was that of an excellent cigar which is not how i would describe the decent but not great first third the complexity knob gets turned up in the second third and i m all about it earthiness remains the strongest flavor but the secondary flavors close the gap intensity wise and increase in the quantities those flavors include sunflower seeds leather straw a cream soda like sweetness mineral flavors and some burnt sensations the finish is a bit sweeter thanks to the cream soda flavor though there s plenty of contrast with a vibrant darker earthiness minerals leather and some black pepper retrohales have leather lemon ritz crackers and a touch of cinnamon there s a building herbal flavor that intensifies towards the retrohale s finish after 15 or so seconds i m tasting leather ritz crackers hay lemon sourdough bread and black pepper what s bizarre is almost all of those flavors are on the back of the throat while the rest of taste buds seem to just detect earthiness flavor is medium full body is medium full and strength picks up full of note the retrohale is milder than the main flavor i d peg it closer to medium all three cigars need a touch up for one reason or another while the first and second thirds were pretty similar or at least as homogenous as this odd collection of flavors could be the final third is quite a bit different each cigar gets a lot toastier pushing the earthiness into a secondary flavor each cigar has a different type of creaminess but creaminess nonetheless and between the three cigars i find leather a fruitiness that reminds me of canned cranberry sauce and mineral flavors the finish is not particularly pleasant there s a potent mixture of barnyard white pepper and black pepper i still taste earthiness but i think that might be more of a residual flavor retrohales have leather earthiness creaminess minerals and a generic cracker flavor as intense as the main flavor s finish is the retrohales finish with honey earthiness creaminess and a touch of pepper flavor is medium full body is medium full and strength is medium full construction wise two cigars need touch ups while one avoids any assistance from the lighter final notes black works studio is a sister brand of black label trading co there are a lot cigars that get named after one thing or another with seemingly zero explanation about why they got called that this is leaning into a theme as much as just about any cigar and the execution is very good in my opinion there s no question why this box is called the hive that being said there s certainly room to do a box where the cigars are placed in individual sections of honeycomb and then you remove them one by one i have to image the difference in cost between what black works made and my idea is not cheap the killer bees always remind me of what happens when i play around with an online car configurator if there was a configurator where you could design your own cigar these seem like just about every obscure option you could select earlier in the week i was on a family zoom call with some of my relatives who are not cigar smokers they were fascinated to learn that cigar manufacturers release as many new products as they do and that there are different size cigars that exists for reasons beyond just how long does a person want to smoke i can only imagine their confusion if i would have pulled out the hive box there are some companies that make cigars that look like this that are more concerned with how the cigars look versus how they taste i don t have much issue if anyone wants to label those cigars after smoking them as gimmicks what black works studio has done with its apocirta the suborder that includes bees wasps and ants family of cigars is not a gimmick you may or may not like them but these cigars aren t just made to look at each cigar needed touch ups two need touch ups in two different thirds of the cigar most of these were smoke production related though one cigar has an uneven burn as has pretty much always been the case i can t detect much of a difference when smoking through the different types of wrapper the one exception was the distinct connecticut shade like pepper at the first third cigars for this review were purchased by halfwheel site sponsor atlantic cigar co lists the hive sampler but is currently out of stock 87 overall score pulling back the curtain a bit this is my second attempt at writing this bottom line the first time i spent way too many characters comparing the killer bee perfecto to the two previous killer bees i ve reviewed both of which were good enough to earn consideration for our top 25 lists in the respective years they were reviewed in short this isn t as good as either one of those cigars but i don t think it s fair to just focus on the comparison between the three cigars the killer bee perfecto is a mixed bag at times there were puffs that were as enthralling as i could hope just about any cigar could be other times there was a sustained number of puffs led by a pretty generic earthiness on top of some other flavors that weren t enough for me to recommend buying a whole sampler just to smoke this cigar the construction issues hurt the score but it s not the main takeaway while the second third was bordering on excellence for its complexity the first and final thirds failed to provide the same sort of exciting profile

worry for 2022 according to money manager surveys is that the fed will begin tightening monetary policy while the economy slips into recession and bitter political divisions in washington mean that there will be no more fiscal stimulus note 43 million americans will be required to resume payments on student loan debt beginning february the average monthly loan payment is 393 and the total student loan debt is 1 7 trillion this will effectively be a tax increase and a drag on consumer spending given that consumer spending is 70 of gdp then omicron the market does not view the latest covid variant as a significant threat any change in that assessment could tip the scales to a broader bearish sentiment the mountain of cash on the sidelines some people see all that cash as dry powder that will be fomoed into the market and drive it much higher maybe but i think that mountain of cash may be a sign that primarily wealthy people see a lot of risk in the stock market at these

currency except the israeli shekel and the chinese rmb the canadian dollar lowest weekly close against the usd in 13 months the cad bounce more than a full cent wednesday thursday following the fed meeting but as stocks and crude oil weakened on friday and the usd gained against most other currencies the cad weakened to 7850 gold rebounded as much as 60 from a 2 month low following the fed announcement it gained 15 friday to friday immediately before any major scheduled market risk event like this week s fed announcement dealers traders in all markets pull their bids and offers the depth of market dom thins out to practically nothing and there is relatively no liquidity the risk event happens the machines have their fun prices spike or dive for a few seconds and then liquidity returns sometimes stops get hit comex gold dropped 10 to more than a 2 month low within a few seconds following the fed announcement and then rallied back 12 within 2 minutes comex traded about 800 000 ounces in those 2 minutes my short term trading the only position i carried over from last week was short cad i had sold it when it fell back from the highs made following the boc meeting wednesday of last week i covered the position for more than a one cent gain on tuesday when the cad had an excellent opportunity to take out the early december lows but didn t i scalped the s p from the short side tuesday when it broke below the previous three day s lows i covered the trade for a 20 point profit later that day i wanted to be flat going into the wednesday fed announcement i took barney for a two hour walk wednesday morning i wanted to be away from my screens when the fed announcement press conference happened i did not want to have a position on and be subject to the wild price swings that often follow such events i wanted to let the market settle down before i made any new trades following the fed announcement press conference the s p ran up 140 points to new all time highs in the wednesday overnight session i did not participate in that terrific move the thursday day session opened below the overnight highs and i got short about an hour after the opening i covered that trade for a 90 point gain just after the friday day session began friday was a huge option expiry day i expected a lot of volatility and saw the early friday dive to new lows for the week as a gift and closed my position i re shorted the cad thursday morning about the same time i shorted the s p it had bounced more than a full cent off its pre fed lows tracking the s p and wti and rolled over like the s p i covered that trade for 30 point gain at the same time as i covered the short s p early friday i stayed out of the markets for the balance of friday and i m flat going into the weekend i had a good week my p l was up more than 2 on the week and i didn t want to give back any of those gains in what i expected to be a very choppy friday due to the quad witching opex i was remembering that peter brandt likes to say it s easy to make money trading the hard part is hanging onto it thoughts on trading i stay in touch with a few old trading friends one of them knew i had shorted the s p and the cad thursday and when he saw they were down hard friday morning he sent me a note saying that he hoped i had shorted a bunch i replied the old saying is that you never have enough on when you re right i want my size to be small enough so that each trade is just a trade no big deal if it wins or loses i ve caught a couple of good moves luckily missed getting clobbered on some other moves i m up about 2 on the week i might stay flat now this is a huge option expiry today price action could continue to be choppy using stops before initiating a position i pick out a level where i want to be out if the market goes against me after i take my position i place a gtc stop at that level i see the stop as a fail safe if the market goes there i m out even if i m away from my screens we know it s not really a fail safe crazy things that i can t control can happen but i can control placing the stop acknowledging that the trade could go against me and i ve taken what steps i can to limit losses if the market goes in my favour i will usually trail my stop behind the market not with an eye to simply reducing the dollar amounts of risk but to new levels that make sense and that also reduce risk if the market moves quickly and a lot in my favour like the s p did early friday morning i often take my profits and cxl the stop i have a long history of taking losses quickly and profits quickly that may come from sitting in front of screens for 40 years and getting too caught up in short term movements some friends tell me that i need to learn how to stay with winning trades longer i d like to do that for instance i could trail stops behind the market and only exit a profitable trade when my stop gets hit maybe someday i ll change but if my goal is to make money as opposed to being right i ll probably keep booking profits when i have the chance quotes from the notebook inflation is not a coincidence it is a policy daniel lacalle december 2021 my comment i agree 100 daniel s quote is a subset of don t fight the fed if the fed wants inflation bad enough they will do whatever it takes to get it the boj might also want to create inflation and they have tried without much success to get it but just because they have not succeeded doesn t mean they have not made a policy decision you want to be on the right side of any major policy decision for most investments sizing is more important than entry level harley bassman repeatedly over the years my comment i ve watched several video interviews with harley listened to many of his podcasts and read commentary on his website for years he is an innovative successful veteran trader who has forgotten more about the bond market than most people will ever learn he is not a day trader he is an old school value investor and that s his way of saying risk management is more critical to long term success than where when you decide to pull the trigger a small request if you like reading the trading

shortages for days though it resumed service after paying more than 4 million in ransom soon after came an attack on meat processor jbs which paid an 11 million ransom advertisement biden met with putin in june in geneva where he suggested critical infrastructure sectors should be off limits for ransomware and said the u s should know in six months to a year whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order he reiterated the message in july days after a major attack on a software company kaseya that affected hundreds of businesses and said he expected russia to take action on cybercriminals when the u s provides enough information to do so since then there have been some notable attacks from groups believed to be based in russia including against sinclair broadcast group and the national rifle association but none of the same consequence or impact of those from last spring or summer one reason may be increased u s government scrutiny or fear of it the biden administration in september sanctioned a russia based virtual currency exchange that officials say helped ransomware gangs launder funds last month the justice department unsealed charges against a suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of u s cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that whole of government effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that that s going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure advertisement u s officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly it s unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning it s also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the u s following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any drop off in high profile attacks to u s efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on large scale attacks won t work because it s way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they don t even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since biden s discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say they ve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said there s been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why advertisement it s hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginia s legislature the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the school s it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the school s online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system advertisement the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if it s going to happen but when it s going to happen

it is a miserable run up to christmas and the new year and we all know why what we can t know is how hard the omicron variant will hit us all in the next few months i will take a break from the column for the holiday week but as we head into it let s just pause and think about what we have learnt about global economics and finance over the past year and look for ways in which it will help us think about 2022 the first thing to say is that 2021 despite everything has been a year of reasonable success rising inflation the lags between what the central banks do and what happens to price levels are uncertain but we know they can be very long says hamish mcrae we won t have figures for several months but it looks as though the us economy will have grown by 5 5 per cent and be well ahead of its peak before the pandemic struck the uk may have grown by 6 5 per cent but because we had a really bad hit last year we will at best be only just back to where we were in january 2020 however job growth just about everywhere is strong exceptionally so in britain with more people employed now than ever before and job vacancies the highest for at least 40 years this picture of a resilient recovery has been reflected in financial markets the ftse 100 index has been a bit of a laggard in global terms but it is up more than 10 per cent in the year to date the dow jones in new york is up more than 18 per cent and the wider s p 500 up 26 per cent similarly house prices the halifax figures for november show the uk up 8 per cent and nationwide up 10 per cent these numbers are not estimates by economists they tell what has actually happened and they are saying it hasn t been a bad year we will need all our resilience to carry us through next year it has of course been a terrible year for people in the hospitality or airline industries and in human terms it has been a great strain for many the events of the past fortnight are testimony to that and i fear there is more to come but in broad macro economic terms it has been ok or it would have been were it not for one huge cloud one that will also hang over 2022 inflation we have had the uk figures this week showing consumer prices up 5 1 per cent and retail prices up 7 1 per cent and we have had the bank of england s response in increasing interest rates there are similar increases in prices in the us and europe though the response in increasing interest rates there has not really begun the trouble for most people however is that very few of us got 5 to 7 per cent increases in our incomes we are being squeezed and though there will be solid increases in pay for people in strong negotiating positions for many that squeeze from inflation will tighten in the months ahead and so for 2022 look we have learnt over the past 12 months how extraordinarily resilient the global economy has become for all the problems the continuing pandemic the glitches in the supply chains the chopping and changing government restrictions the pressure to cut back on emissions and so on the recovery has continued governments have helped but the tough stuff has been done by businesses large and small all over the world the supermarket shelves have been stocked and restocked the airlines have managed to keep flying and the vaccines are being pumped out in huge quantities with detractors please note the oxford astrazeneca one now the most widely produced in the world with 2 2billion doses delivered we will need all this resilience to carry us though whatever is thrown at us next year but what worries me most is inflation the lags between what the central banks do and what happens to price levels are uncertain but we know they can be very long imagine you are filling a bucket you keep on pouring the water in kettle after kettle and nothing seems to happen then you pour in one kettle too many and suddenly the water is all over the kitchen floor i think that is what is happening now the central banks have been pumping the money in year after year now bang they find they have flooded the world inflation will eventually be brought under control but until it is we will need all our resilience to cope with the social and economic distortions it will cause

when mining giant anglo american snapped up the yorkshire based potash project sirius minerals for 405million it was a sorry day for the group s band of loyal investors the deal left thousands nursing ruinous losses and many cried foul graham clarke was operations director at sirius from october 2011 until the anglo takeover now he is chief executive of emmerson another potash company this time in morocco midas recommended the firm in march 2019 when the price was 3 1p today it s 6 05p for some investors the association may be too much to swallow but clarke is a different animal with a different pedigree from the ebullient sirius frontman australian chris fraser born and bred in yorkshire clarke has worked in the potash industry all his life starting out as an underground miner for cleveland potash on the north york moors he worked his way up to managing director of the business spending 26 years at the company before moving to sirius down to earth and softly spoken clarke has a reputation for getting on with the job trying to keep expenses down and workers motivated along the way he is determined to do just that at emmerson and the early signs are encouraging midas recommended the firm in march 2019 when the price was 3 1p clarke took the helm a year later and today the stock is 6 05p with supportive investors suggesting that it should be worth significantly more emmerson like sirius is at a development stage the potash is there but the mine needs to be built it is however far less costly less complex and less ambitious than its british counterpart the project is expected to cost 400million 300million to construct a fraction of the funds associated with sirius and clarke recently bagged up to 46million towards the scheme from a singapore based investment group a second large equity investor should add further ballast and clarke expects to secure about 250million in bank debt in the next few months emmerson s mine is relatively simple to construct work is already under way and the site should be up and running by 2024 swiftly ramping up to annual production of more than 700 000 tons emmerson is also based less than 100 miles from the moroccan port of casablanca so the potash can easily be shipped overseas there is a huge need for potash in morocco as well most common fertilisers have three key ingredients potash from potassium nitrogen and phosphate morocco is home to the biggest phosphate producer in the world ocp a multi billion dollar state owned company however the country is also a big importer of potash a situation that should be dramatically reversed once emmerson is in production potash prices have risen sharply this year and the outlook is promising as demand for fertiliser increases worldwide midas verdict investors bruised by sirius may have no interest in another pre revenue potash business but emmerson is moving in the right direction clarke has his head screwed on and demand for the end product is rising the company is valued on the stock market at 55 4million but that valuation should rocket as and when clarke secures the funding he needs and emmerson moves into production investors who bought in 2019 may choose to sell some shares and bank a profit but they should not sell out completely at 6 05p the stock is also worth a punt for adventurous new investors traded on aim ticker eml contact emmersonplc com or 020 7236 1177
worried it s beginning to look a lot like last christmas how to omicron proof your portfolio and spot the potential winners and losers stocks in travel and hospitality sectors have already taken a hit amid omicron a lot depends on the outcome of omicron and further lockdowns if situation worsens tech companies offering stay at home activities may prevail food delivery businesses such as just eat and ocado could also do well but if no more restrictions some are predicting a rally in bombed out shares it s beginning to look a bit like christmas last year there s a tree in the grand hotel one in the park as well and plenty of rumours about tightening lockdowns and restrictions as the latest covid variant gets going but the jury is out on what the latest plot twist in the pandemic saga will bring for our investments and what we should do about it should we be buying last year s pandemic winners from peloton to zoom or should we be assuming that this latest wave will be short lived and that stocks especially travel and airlines will recover jason hollands managing director of wealth platform bestinvest is optimistic about a continuation of normal life and believes there are bargains to be had he says i see little prospect of a rerun of 2020 when lockdowns created a narrow clutch of stock market winners and many losers we are now in a very different place with both vaccines and treatments for coronavirus the winding down of emergency stimulus measures by central banks and governments as well as recognition of the damaging effects of lockdowns on health education and the economy look out for potential winners and losers not everyone sits in hollands optimistic camp victoria scholar is head of investment at wealth manager interactive investor she says stocks in the travel and hospitality sectors have already taken a hit amid rising fears about the threat of omicron if the new variant continues to pose a risk to public health stocks such as iag easyjet whitbread and intercontinental hotels could come under more pressure ryan hughes investment director at rival wealth manager aj bell believes there will be both investment opportunities and risks in the coming months he adds the problem is that we face a binary outcome with different parts of the market doing better or worse depending on whether further restrictions are introduced he adds speculating as to what might happen with a possible lockdown is fraught with danger get it right and you can make decent profits but get it wrong and you could be in for some short term investment pain how you respond to the omicron surge is a subjective decision some investors will opt to do nothing preferring to think long term while others will make slight adjustments to their portfolios but to help you decide what camp you want to be in we provide some ideas on how to position your investments for what looks like a challenging few months stocks set to gain if more stay at home with a work from home order already in place it is tempting to assume that we already know how the next few months will play out and that includes how the stock market will react if the government defies many of its own mps and orders a lockdown in 2020 the market dipped sharply when lockdown was announced before recovering some sectors did better than others with companies whose products chimed with a lockdown lifestyle faring better than those involved in hospitality and travel companies like peloton may benefit from another lockdown according to analysts darius mcdermott managing director of investment platform chelsea financial services says that if and it is a big if omicron leads to any kind of lockdown we may see something similar in the short term he adds the winners will be tech companies and companies focused on stay at home activities such as zoom and peloton the losers will be travel leisure entertainment and hospitality stocks scholar agrees she says omicron is likely to benefit the stay at home stocks with zoom the poster child during the pandemic last year expected to outperform if governments impose tighter restrictions food delivery businesses such as just eat and ocado would enjoy a tailwind as restaurant meals are replaced by home delivery services but on peloton she is less positive arguing that many consumers have already made such big ticket purchases on the investment fund front those with a technology bent should prosper james carthew head of investment companies at research group quoteddata likes investment trust polar capital technology stating it represents a good long term buy the stock market listed trust has generated returns of 127 per cent over the past three years large holdings include apple and microsoft and nearly three quarters of its investments are in the united states chelsea s mcdermott likes fund axa framlington global technology it has also delivered investor profits of 127 per cent over the past three years top holdings are apple and google parent alphabet be ready for a rally in bombed out shares another possibility is that no more restrictions are introduced or that they are sufficiently shortlived not to make a dent in the stock market in this case investment experts say there may be bargains to be had in bombed out sectors that then recover fairly quickly hollands says if you re of the view that omicron will not turn out to be as dangerous as feared and economies will remain primarily open then investors need to look at sectors that will benefit from ongoing economy recovery if omicron does not turn out to be as dangerous as feared companies like banks and mining giants may be a good investment we re talking financial companies such as the banks mining companies and those industrial giants with the ability to pass on higher costs to customers and maintain profit margins some investment experts believe there could be a value rally where those stocks currently undervalued by the stock market bounce back mcdermott says this is possible if a lockdown doesn t happen i suspect businesses in retail and entertainment will see sales dip as some people decide to stay away we ve seen this a little already over the past few days but we could also get a short term value rally as the market realises any restrictions will be limited if such a scenario plays out he suggests funds ninety one global special situations and schroder global recovery their respective three year returns are 19 and 29 per cent go for gold if you re wary about markets there are investment funds and shares for investors who wish to adopt a safety first approach in the coming months dzmitry lipski head of funds research at interactive investor says gold is a good option in the past gold has performed well relative to equities and other risk assets during periods of extreme economic turbulence market volatility and high inflation he says fund ishares physical gold tracks the gold price gold could be a good investment for those who wish to adopt a safety first approach alternatively investors could consider a multi asset investment vehicle such as capital gearing it has 30 per cent of its assets in us treasury inflation protected securities such bonds offer protection when stock markets fall as well as providing a shield against inflation respective three year returns for the ishares fund and investment trust capital gearing are 35 and 26 per cent look past crisis for long term returns investing is all about the long term so many professional investors are keen to look past the short term omicron noise one of them is andrew millington head of uk equities at fund manager abrdn he says companies with strong balance sheets and pricing power are best able to deal with lockdowns and recessions and emerge in an even stronger competitive position he is positive about stocks such as online card supplier moonpig pets at home and financially resilient companies such as national express millington adds none of us know what the new year will bring but the world will keep turning and great businesses will find a way to succeed that s a maxim investors should hold on to as we navigate a tricky few months hunt for bargains in healthcare it might seem obvious that healthcare stocks are a buy when the nhs is once again under strain and covid is surging but despite the booster rollout the stock market performance of this sector has been volatile of late this means the valuations of some companies are attractive staying away from vaccine suppliers is probably a good idea as their shares are already highly priced the stock market performance of the health sector has been volatile of late andrew millington head of uk equities at asset manager abrdn likes numerous healthcare companies operating outside of the coronavirus bubble the likes of abcam genus and dechra pharmaceuticals ryan hughes of wealth manager aj bell likes investment trust worldwide healthcare he says the trust has struggled over the past year as a result of exposure to the chinese stock market and an out of favour biotech sector but the experienced team at healthcare specialist orbimed who manage the trust should deliver long term investment returns the fund has generated a return of 41 per cent in the past three years

in the months since president joe biden warned russia s vladimir putin that he needed to crack down on ransomware gangs in his country there hasn t been a massive attack like the one last may that resulted in gasoline shortages but that s small comfort to ken trzaska trzaska is president of lewis clark community college a small illinois school that canceled classes for days after a ransomware attack last month that knocked critical computer systems offline that first day trzaska said i think all of us were probably up 20 plus hours just moving through the process trying to get our arms around what happened even if the united states isn t currently enduring large scale front page ransomware attacks on par with ones earlier this year that targeted the global meat supply or kept millions of americans from filling their gas tanks the problem hasn t disappeared in fact the attack on trzaska s college was part of a barrage of lower profile episodes that have upended the businesses governments schools and hospitals that were hit get a weekly recap of the latest san francisco bay area housing news sign up for nbc bay area s housing deconstructed newsletter the college s ordeal reflects the challenges the biden administration faces in stamping out the threat and its uneven progress in doing so since ransomware became an urgent national security problem last spring u s officials have recaptured some ransom payments cracked down on abuses of cryptocurrency and made some arrests spy agencies have launched attacks against ransomware groups and the u s has pushed federal state and local governments as well as private industries to boost protections yet six months after biden s admonitions to putin it s hard to tell whether hackers have eased up because of u s pressure smaller scale attacks continue with ransomware criminals continuing to operate from russia with seeming impunity administration officials have given conflicting assessments about whether russia s behavior has changed since last summer further complicating matters ransomware is no longer at the top of the u s russia agenda with washington focused on dissuading putin from invading ukraine the white house said in a statement that it was determined to fight all ransomware through its various tools but that the government s response depends on the severity of the attack there are some that are law enforcement matters and others that are high impact disruptive ransomware activity posing a direct national security threat that require other measures the white house statement said ransomware attacks in which hackers lock up victims data and demand exorbitant sums to return it surfaced as a national security emergency for the administration after a may attack on colonial pipeline which supplies nearly half the fuel consumed on the east coast the attack prompted the company to halt operations causing gas shortages for days though it resumed service after paying more than 4 million in ransom soon after came an attack on meat processor jbs which paid an 11 million ransom biden met with putin in june in geneva where he suggested critical infrastructure sectors should be off limits for ransomware and said the u s should know in six months to a year whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order he reiterated the message in july days after a major attack on a software company kaseya that affected hundreds of businesses and said he expected russia to take action on cybercriminals when the u s provides enough information to do so since then there have been some notable attacks from groups believed to be based in russia including against sinclair broadcast group and the national rifle association but none of the same consequence or impact of those from last spring or summer one reason may be increased u s government scrutiny or fear of it the biden administration in september sanctioned a russia based virtual currency exchange that officials say helped ransomware gangs launder funds last month the justice department unsealed charges against a suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of u s cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that whole of government effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that that s going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure u s officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly it s unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning it s also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the u s following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any drop off in high profile attacks to u s efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on large scale attacks won t work because it s way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they don t even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since biden s discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say they ve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said there s been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why it s hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginia s legislature the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the school s it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the school s online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if it s going to happen but when it s going to happen in 2019 a ransomware attack wiped out 750 government computers across texas in less than 90 minutes as hospitals local governments agencies and businesses increasingly become the targets of ransomware attacks here s what you should know about the threat ___ suderman reported from richmond virginia associated

chef tsuyoshi hachisuka grills eel at his restaurant in hamamatsu shizuoka prefecture in april afp photo by mathias cena agence france presse hamamatsu japan tsuyoshi hachisuka gently places skewered eel on a grill preparing a much loved japanese delicacy that is now so endangered it commands eyewatering prices and the attention of international traffickers consumed worldwide eel is particularly popular in asia and perhaps nowhere more so than japan where remains found in tombs show it has been eaten on the archipelago for thousands of years despite its enduring popularity much about the eel remains a mystery precisely how it reproduces is unclear and coaxing it to do so in captivity without intervention has proved unsuccessful so far pressures on wild stocks ranging from pollution to overfishing mean supplies have dwindled dramatically in recent decades while the writhing snake like creature is repellent to some it is a mainstay of japanese cuisine and since the 17th century has most often been prepared kabayaki style skewered grilled and basted in a mixture of soy sauce and mirin rice wine in central japan s shizuoka 66 year old hachisuka s restaurant in hamamatsu city has used the same basting sauce base for four decades i adjust it as i go it mustn t be too sweet or too salty he told afp but while his recipe has stayed the same his product has not the annual catch in japan of young known as glass eels has fallen to 10 per cent of 1960 levels that has driven prices sky high even in a country that has battled for years to achieve inflation a dish of unaju is today nearly three times more expensive than when i started said hachisuka there are 19 species and subspecies of eel many of them now threatened in 2014 the japanese eel was listed as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature which cited factors including habitat loss overfishing pollution and migration barriers enduring mysteries protecting the animal is complicated by their complex life cycle which unfolds over a vast area and the many unknowns about how they reproduce the mystery of eel reproduction has fascinated scientists for thousands of years with even ancient greek philosopher and naturalist aristotle puzzling over it he theorised eels must simply emerge spontaneously in mud because he could find no traces of their larvae we think that the eel emerged approximately 60 million years ago near the island of borneo explains mari kuroki assistant professor at tokyo university s aquatic biosciences department as continental drift affected marine currents and the distance grew between the areas where eels lived and laid eggs the creature has adapted she told afp it is now present in every ocean except the antarctic but despite their ubiquity it wasn t until the early 20th century that european scientists discovered that european and american eels are born somewhere in the sargasso sea near cuba with their larvae then carried by currents to different regions and the precise location of eel spawning sites remained an enigma until 2009 when a scientific mission pinpointed the breeding grounds of the japanese eel west of the mariana islands some 2 000 3 000 kilometres from japan s coasts evidence suggests the species mates and lays its eggs at the spot but the process has still never been observed once they hatch into larvae the creatures drift towards coastlines growing on the way into glass eels they swim into estuaries and rivers in japan taiwan china and south korea and live in freshwater habitats for between five and 15 years before swimming back out to sea to spawn and then die white gold eels are vulnerable to a wide range of catastrophic human behaviours and climate change linked phenomenon like el nino have affected the ocean currents that carry them as well as their spawning sites the deterioration of their freshwater habitats including by river development also plays a significant role along with pollution dams can block migratory routes and eels are sometimes caught in hydroelectric turbines a leading cause of death for the species since 2012 scientists in the four territories where the japanese eel is most commonly found have worked together on conservation setting aquaculture quotas in 2015 but restrictions including an eu ban on exports in 2010 have created a flourishing black market with poaching and international trafficking over 99 per cent of the supply in japan consists of caught or imported glass eels raised to maturity on farms in 2020 declared catches and legal imports of glass eels for farms in japan amounted to 14 tons according to japan s fisheries agency jfa but the country s farms reported buying over 20 tonnes of glass eels a gap indicating the role of illicit trade environmental group wwf japan believes the true scale of the problem is even larger estimating between 40 to 60 per cent of eels raised in japan come from illegal sources in hamamatsu the brackish waters of lake hamana near the sea are an ideal habitat for eels and the hunt for the creatures takes place there each year between december and april under a cloak of secrecy the eel is the most valuable fish in this lake says kunihikokako a 66 year old fisherman holding a long net with a conical end that he uses for his catch so we have to be careful the creature is so precious it is sometimes dubbed white gold with prices fluctuating wildly depending on the catch size farms paid an average of 1 32 million yen 11 680 at today s rates in 2020 for a kilo of glass eel according to the jfa after a record of 2 99 million yen in 2018 appreciate each eel with stocks falling and prices rising eel consumption in japan has changed and the dish is now seen as a treat rather than a regular meal a record 160 000 tons was consumed across the country in 2000 but that figure has fallen by two thirds in the past all the meals sold at grill places and local hotel restaurants had eel in them says senichiro kamo a seafood wholesaler on lake hamana it was also in the bento boxes sold at stations but since the price has tripled that s no longer possible adds kamo half of whose sales are of eel eels of all types are notoriously resistant to breeding in captivity and since the 1960s japanese researchers have worked to coax them into the mood but without success in 2010 experts bred two consecutive generations of japanese eels in a lab for the first time a major advance but these artificial eels aren t likely to hit the market anytime soon says ryusukesudo of the japan fisheries research and education agency in the izu region southwest of tokyo the biggest problem now is that the method is very expensive he told afp each eel requires individual human intervention the reproduction rate is low and creatures produced in captivity also grow slower than their wild counterparts he said researcher kuroki believes the best way to protect the species is to make consumers more mindful we need to appreciate each eel we eat she said keeping in mind that this is a precious natural resource

virus afoot despite rising concerns over the omicron variant spider man no way home not only shattered pandemic era box office records it became the third best opening of all time behind avengers endgame and avengers infinity war the sony and marvel blockbuster grossed a stunning 253 million in ticket sales from 4 325 north american locations according to studio estimates on sunday the web slinger s success couldn t have come sooner for a movie business that has had a rollercoaster 2021 and could be headed for a difficult start to 2022 as the o micron variant of the coronavirus forces more and more event cancellations this weekend s historic spider man no way home results from all over the world and in the face of many challenges reaffirm the unmatched cultural impact that exclusive theatrical films can have when they are made and marketed with vision and resolve said tom rothman sony pictures chairman and ceo in a statement all of us at sony pictures are deeply grateful to the fabulous talent both in front of and behind the camera that produced such a landmark film in its five days playing in theaters internationally it s amassed 334 2 million in ticket sales bringing its global total to 587 2 million against a 200 million production budget the film has yet to open in markets like thailand and japan and there is no release date set for china as the third standalone spider man film in the tom holland era no way home was always going to be an event film for fans after several delays over the year sony planted its launch in the pre christmas frame and as of late last week had anticipated a pandemic best opening in the 130 to 150 million range but it quickly became clear that spider man was going to fly much higher the film netted an incredible 121 5 million in its first day bumping star wars the force awakens out of the no 2 position directed by jon watts no way home picks up with holland s peter parker grappling with the world finding out about his superhero identity and features zendaya marisa tomei and benedict cumberbatch as doctor strange the promise of spoiler reveals only added to the feverish hype that led to lines and sell out showings across the country for the target audience this is absolute must see required viewing said paul dergarabedian the senior media analyst for comscore there is no way fans were going to opt out because of omicron many moviegoers also shelled out top dollar to see the film on the biggest screens possible according to imax an estimated 36 2 million of the global total is from their large format screens spider man no way home is an exclamation point on the comeback we ve seen at the box office in 2021 said rich gelfond ceo of imax with these historic results imax continues to see blockbuster releases generate box office at or exceeding pre pandemic levels and it s not just fans who have been giving the film good marks reviews have been overwhelmingly positive as well it has a 94 fresh rating on rotten tomatoes holland on instagram thanked audiences for the record numbers you made this possible your love and support means the world to me holland wrote on saturday thank you thank you thank you and if you haven t seen spider man no way home yet merry christmas and you know what to do before this weekend sony s venom let there be carnage held the record for best opening of the pandemic with 90 1 million but it wasn t all celebrations at the box office this weekend in spider man s wake were some high profile casualties including guillermo del toro s star studded nightmare alley which grossed a mere 3 million from 2 145 theaters it opened in fifth place behind spider man encanto 6 5 million west side story 3 4 million and ghostbusters afterlife 3 4 million nightmare alley had prestige and awards buzz behind it with a cast including bradley cooper cate blanchett and rooney mara but a week after steven spielberg s west side story underwhelmed it s a stark reminder of moviegoing realities during the pandemic and the power of the marvel fanbase in the one movie takes all environment more often than not that one movie has been a marvel movie including no way home marvel releases will make up five of the top six films of the year including shang chi and the legend of the ten rings venom let there be carnage black widow and eternals and lest anyone was holding onto hopes that west side story would have a profitable greatest showman run after its lackluster start the 20th century studios release fell 67 in its second weekend in theaters bringing in only 3 4 million but spider man could also help the industry at large as it heads into 2022 it s almost hard to describe how important this debut is to an industry that was beset with one of the biggest challenges in its history in the pandemic dergarabedian said to have this resounding mandate in favor of the movie theater experience as expressed in these numbers that even just a few months ago were unthinkable makes this a watershed moment for movie theaters that i think will be discussed for decades
just over a decade ago i predicted the arrival of water as an asset class i foresaw a massive expansion of investment in the water sector including the production of fresh clean water from other sources desalination purification storage shipping and transportation of water this would result in a globally integrated market for fresh water within 25 to 30 years once the spot markets for water are integrated futures markets and other derivative water based financial instruments puts calls swaps both exchange traded and otc will follow there will be different grades and types of fresh water just the way we have light sweet and heavy sour crude oil today in fact i believed that water would eventually be the single most important physical commodity based asset class dwarfing oil copper agricultural commodities and precious metals ten years later the future is now though not quite what i expected in december 2020 the chicago mercantile exchange group created the first futures market in water cash settled water futures with a maximum contract period of two years are now traded on the cme globex electronic trading system i view this development as somewhat premature for futures markets and markets for other derivatives like put and call options to function properly the underlying spot market in this case the spot market for physical water or water rights should be liquid and transparent cme group s futures market is based on the nasdaq veles california water index which tracks the cash price of physical water rights in california based on transactions in surface water and in four groundwater markets because the local and regional water supplies often are not connected let alone fully integrated the spot market underlying the futures market is too segmented it does not represent a single homogeneous commodity or asset today s spot markets for water and water rights thus are too illiquid and non transparent to support an economically and socially useful futures market but there is hope the regional and global integration of physical water supplies and the associated spot markets for water and water rights is making spectacular progress two ongoing developments stand out one is project greenland created and sponsored by thomas schumann capital in partnership with north atlantic research and survey ltd under its iceberg management and water extraction program suitable free floating north atlantic icebergs weighing 1 2 1 4 million tonnes are towed to an operational location in scotland where the ice and water are prepared for international transportation the target markets are in the water deprived middle east and north africa the project is scalable and relies on established technologies and infrastructures being deployed in an innovative and disruptive manner given time additional technological advances and proper spot water pricing icebergs from antarctica also could become viable sources of fresh water a second fascinating entrant to the global water markets is skyh2o s atmospheric water generation awg system a proprietary technology that extracts clean fresh water from the atmosphere the business model here is flexible and scalable because awg capacity can be deployed in a distributed manner to reach the ultimate customers be they governments households or industrial commercial and agricultural users its cost effectiveness relative to alternatives like desalination and distillation depends on atmospheric humidity and the price of energy in the proximity of the customers the future of water as a significant asset class depends on the willingness of governments and ultimately of society at large to price water at its long run social marginal cost as a scarce renewable resource including the cost of addressing the negative environmental externalities associated with its production and distribution globally over 70 of fresh water is used in agriculture and most of this usage is either free or heavily subsidised households in many countries also pay but a small fraction of the long run social marginal cost of the water they use i hope and expect that both these anomalies will soon end there is growing recognition of deepening freshwater scarcity crises around the world as well as a greater willingness on the part of policymakers to price negative environmental externalities appropriately to recognise water as a scarce renewable resource a tradable commodity and a marketable asset is not to diminish its unique significance as a good that is essential to life and viewed by many as a gift from god when socially efficient water pricing creates economic hardship an appropriate fiscal response through targeted income support is required if this fails perhaps because the state cannot identify who is adversely affected by proper water pricing a two tier tariff may be required while a social subsistence level of water should be provided for free or at a heavily subsidised price all additional water usage could be priced at its full long run social marginal cost to preserve the right incentives water is indeed becoming an asset class give it another decade and exchange traded funds for water and water rights will be part of the new normal for investors project syndicate willem h buiter is a visiting professor of international and public affairs at columbia university

in the months since president joe biden warned russia s vladimir putin that he needed to crack down on ransomware gangs in his country there hasn t been a massive attack like the one last may that resulted in gasoline shortages but that s small comfort to ken trzaska trzaska is president of lewis clark community college a small illinois school that canceled classes for days after a ransomware attack last month that knocked critical computer systems offline that first day trzaska said i think all of us were probably up 20 plus hours just moving through the process trying to get our arms around what happened even if the united states isn t currently enduring large scale front page ransomware attacks on par with ones earlier this year that targeted the global meat supply or kept millions of americans from filling their gas tanks the problem hasn t disappeared in fact the attack on trzaska s college was part of a barrage of lower profile episodes that have upended the businesses governments schools and hospitals that were hit get southern california news weather forecasts and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc la newsletters the college s ordeal reflects the challenges the biden administration faces in stamping out the threat and its uneven progress in doing so since ransomware became an urgent national security problem last spring u s officials have recaptured some ransom payments cracked down on abuses of cryptocurrency and made some arrests spy agencies have launched attacks against ransomware groups and the u s has pushed federal state and local governments as well as private industries to boost protections yet six months after biden s admonitions to putin it s hard to tell whether hackers have eased up because of u s pressure smaller scale attacks continue with ransomware criminals continuing to operate from russia with seeming impunity administration officials have given conflicting assessments about whether russia s behavior has changed since last summer further complicating matters ransomware is no longer at the top of the u s russia agenda with washington focused on dissuading putin from invading ukraine the white house said in a statement that it was determined to fight all ransomware through its various tools but that the government s response depends on the severity of the attack there are some that are law enforcement matters and others that are high impact disruptive ransomware activity posing a direct national security threat that require other measures the white house statement said ransomware attacks in which hackers lock up victims data and demand exorbitant sums to return it surfaced as a national security emergency for the administration after a may attack on colonial pipeline which supplies nearly half the fuel consumed on the east coast the attack prompted the company to halt operations causing gas shortages for days though it resumed service after paying more than 4 million in ransom soon after came an attack on meat processor jbs which paid an 11 million ransom biden met with putin in june in geneva where he suggested critical infrastructure sectors should be off limits for ransomware and said the u s should know in six months to a year whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order he reiterated the message in july days after a major attack on a software company kaseya that affected hundreds of businesses and said he expected russia to take action on cybercriminals when the u s provides enough information to do so since then there have been some notable attacks from groups believed to be based in russia including against sinclair broadcast group and the national rifle association but none of the same consequence or impact of those from last spring or summer one reason may be increased u s government scrutiny or fear of it the biden administration in september sanctioned a russia based virtual currency exchange that officials say helped ransomware gangs launder funds last month the justice department unsealed charges against a suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of u s cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that whole of government effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that that s going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure u s officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly it s unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning it s also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the u s following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any drop off in high profile attacks to u s efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on large scale attacks won t work because it s way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they don t even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since biden s discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say they ve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said there s been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why it s hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginia s legislature the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the school s it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the school s online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if it s going to happen but when it s going to happen in 2019 a ransomware attack wiped out 750 government computers across texas in less than 90 minutes as hospitals local governments agencies and businesses increasingly become the targets of ransomware attacks here s what you should know about the threat ___ suderman reported from richmond virginia associated

it s beginning to look a bit like christmas last year there s a tree in the grand hotel one in the park as well and plenty of rumours about tightening lockdowns and restrictions as the latest covid variant gets going but the jury is out on what the latest plot twist in the pandemic saga will bring for our investments and what we should do about it should we be buying last year s pandemic winners from peloton to zoom or should we be assuming that this latest wave will be short lived and that stocks especially travel and airlines will recover winter cheer experts tip zoom workout business peloton apple and just eat as strong performers in the pandemic jason hollands managing director of wealth platform bestinvest is optimistic about a continuation of normal life and believes there are bargains to be had he says i see little prospect of a rerun of 2020 when lockdowns created a narrow clutch of stock market winners and many losers we are now in a very different place with both vaccines and treatments for coronavirus the winding down of emergency stimulus measures by central banks and governments as well as recognition of the damaging effects of lockdowns on health education and the economy look out for potential winners and losers not everyone sits in hollands optimistic camp victoria scholar is head of investment at wealth manager interactive investor she says stocks in the travel and hospitality sectors have already taken a hit amid rising fears about the threat of omicron if the new variant continues to pose a risk to public health stocks such as iag easyjet whitbread and intercontinental hotels could come under more pressure ryan hughes investment director at rival wealth manager aj bell believes there will be both investment opportunities and risks in the coming months he adds the problem is that we face a binary outcome with different parts of the market doing better or worse depending on whether further restrictions are introduced he adds speculating as to what might happen with a possible lockdown is fraught with danger get it right and you can make decent profits but get it wrong and you could be in for some short term investment pain how you respond to the omicron surge is a subjective decision some investors will opt to do nothing preferring to think long term while others will make slight adjustments to their portfolios but to help you decide what camp you want to be in we provide some ideas on how to position your investments for what looks like a challenging few months stocks set to gain if more stay at home with a work from home order already in place it is tempting to assume that we already know how the next few months will play out and that includes how the stock market will react if the government defies many of its own mps and orders a lockdown in 2020 the market dipped sharply when lockdown was announced before recovering some sectors did better than others with companies whose products chimed with a lockdown lifestyle faring better than those involved in hospitality and travel companies like peloton may benefit from another lockdown according to analysts darius mcdermott managing director of investment platform chelsea financial services says that if and it is a big if omicron leads to any kind of lockdown we may see something similar in the short term he adds the winners will be tech companies and companies focused on stay at home activities such as zoom and peloton the losers will be travel leisure entertainment and hospitality stocks scholar agrees she says omicron is likely to benefit the stay at home stocks with zoom the poster child during the pandemic last year expected to outperform if governments impose tighter restrictions food delivery businesses such as just eat and ocado would enjoy a tailwind as restaurant meals are replaced by home delivery services but on peloton she is less positive arguing that many consumers have already made such big ticket purchases on the investment fund front those with a technology bent should prosper james carthew head of investment companies at research group quoteddata likes investment trust polar capital technology stating it represents a good long term buy the stock market listed trust has generated returns of 127 per cent over the past three years large holdings include apple and microsoft and nearly three quarters of its investments are in the united states chelsea s mcdermott likes fund axa framlington global technology it has also delivered investor profits of 127 per cent over the past three years top holdings are apple and google parent alphabet be ready for a rally in bombed out shares another possibility is that no more restrictions are introduced or that they are sufficiently shortlived not to make a dent in the stock market in this case investment experts say there may be bargains to be had in bombed out sectors that then recover fairly quickly hollands says if you re of the view that omicron will not turn out to be as dangerous as feared and economies will remain primarily open then investors need to look at sectors that will benefit from ongoing economy recovery if omicron does not turn out to be as dangerous as feared companies like banks and mining giants may be a good investment we re talking financial companies such as the banks mining companies and those industrial giants with the ability to pass on higher costs to customers and maintain profit margins some investment experts believe there could be a value rally where those stocks currently undervalued by the stock market bounce back mcdermott says this is possible if a lockdown doesn t happen i suspect businesses in retail and entertainment will see sales dip as some people decide to stay away we ve seen this a little already over the past few days but we could also get a short term value rally as the market realises any restrictions will be limited if such a scenario plays out he suggests funds ninety one global special situations and schroder global recovery their respective three year returns are 19 and 29 per cent go for gold if you re wary about markets there are investment funds and shares for investors who wish to adopt a safety first approach in the coming months dzmitry lipski head of funds research at interactive investor says gold is a good option in the past gold has performed well relative to equities and other risk assets during periods of extreme economic turbulence market volatility and high inflation he says fund ishares physical gold tracks the gold price gold could be a good investment for those who wish to adopt a safety first approach alternatively investors could consider a multi asset investment vehicle such as capital gearing it has 30 per cent of its assets in us treasury inflation protected securities such bonds offer protection when stock markets fall as well as providing a shield against inflation respective three year returns for the ishares fund and investment trust capital gearing are 35 and 26 per cent look past crisis for long term returns investing is all about the long term so many professional investors are keen to look past the short term omicron noise one of them is andrew millington head of uk equities at fund manager abrdn he says companies with strong balance sheets and pricing power are best able to deal with lockdowns and recessions and emerge in an even stronger competitive position he is positive about stocks such as online card supplier moonpig pets at home and financially resilient companies such as national express millington adds none of us know what the new year will bring but the world will keep turning and great businesses will find a way to succeed that s a maxim investors should hold on to as we navigate a tricky few months hunt for bargains in healthcare it might seem obvious that healthcare stocks are a buy when the nhs is once again under strain and covid is surging but despite the booster rollout the stock market performance of this sector has been volatile of late this means the valuations of some companies are attractive staying away from vaccine suppliers is probably a good idea as their shares are already highly priced the stock market performance of the health sector has been volatile of late andrew millington head of uk equities at asset manager abrdn likes numerous healthcare companies operating outside of the coronavirus bubble the likes of abcam genus and dechra pharmaceuticals ryan hughes of wealth manager aj bell likes investment trust worldwide healthcare he says the trust has struggled over the past year as a result of exposure to the chinese stock market and an out of favour biotech sector but the experienced team at healthcare specialist orbimed who

it is a miserable run up to christmas and the new year and we all know why what we can t know is how hard the omicron variant will hit us all in the next few months i will take a break from the column for the holiday week but as we head into it let s just pause and think about what we have learnt about global economics and finance over the past year and look for ways in which it will help us think about 2022 the first thing to say is that 2021 despite everything has been a year of reasonable success rising inflation the lags between what the central banks do and what happens to price levels are uncertain but we know they can be very long says hamish mcrae we won t have figures for several months but it looks as though the us economy will have grown by 5 5 per cent and be well ahead of its peak before the pandemic struck the uk may have grown by 6 5 per cent but because we had a really bad hit last year we will at best be only just back to where we were in january 2020 however job growth just about everywhere is strong exceptionally so in britain with more people employed now than ever before and job vacancies the highest for at least 40 years this picture of a resilient recovery has been reflected in financial markets the ftse 100 index has been a bit of a laggard in global terms but it is up more than 10 per cent in the year to date the dow jones in new york is up more than 18 per cent and the wider s p 500 up 26 per cent similarly house prices the halifax figures for november show the uk up 8 per cent and nationwide up 10 per cent these numbers are not estimates by economists they tell what has actually happened and they are saying it hasn t been a bad year we will need all our resilience to carry us through next year it has of course been a terrible year for people in the hospitality or airline industries and in human terms it has been a great strain for many the events of the past fortnight are testimony to that and i fear there is more to come but in broad macro economic terms it has been ok or it would have been were it not for one huge cloud one that will also hang over 2022 inflation we have had the uk figures this week showing consumer prices up 5 1 per cent and retail prices up 7 1 per cent and we have had the bank of england s response in increasing interest rates there are similar increases in prices in the us and europe though the response in increasing interest rates there has not really begun the trouble for most people however is that very few of us got 5 to 7 per cent increases in our incomes we are being squeezed and though there will be solid increases in pay for people in strong negotiating positions for many that squeeze from inflation will tighten in the months ahead and so for 2022 look we have learnt over the past 12 months how extraordinarily resilient the global economy has become for all the problems the continuing pandemic the glitches in the supply chains the chopping and changing government restrictions the pressure to cut back on emissions and so on the recovery has continued governments have helped but the tough stuff has been done by businesses large and small all over the world the supermarket shelves have been stocked and restocked the airlines have managed to keep flying and the vaccines are being pumped out in huge quantities with detractors please note the oxford astrazeneca one now the most widely produced in the world with 2 2billion doses delivered we will need all this resilience to carry us though whatever is thrown at us next year but what worries me most is inflation the lags between what the central banks do and what happens to price levels are uncertain but we know they can be very long imagine you are filling a bucket you keep on pouring the water in kettle after kettle and nothing seems to happen then you pour in one kettle too many and suddenly the water is all over the kitchen floor i think that is what is happening now the central banks have been pumping the money in year after year now bang they find they have flooded the world inflation will eventually be brought under control but until it is we will need all our resilience to cope with the social and economic distortions it will cause
new york just over a decade ago i predicted the arrival of water as an asset class i foresaw a massive expansion of investment in the water sector including the production of fresh clean water from other sources storage shipping and transportation of water this would result in a globally integrated market for fresh water within 25 to 30 years once the spot markets for water are integrated futures markets and other derivative water based financial instruments puts calls swaps both exchange traded and otc will follow there will be different grades and types of fresh water just the way we have light sweet and heavy sour crude oil today in fact i believed that water would eventually be the single most important physical commodity based asset class dwarfing oil copper agricultural commodities and precious metals ten years later the future is now though not quite what i expected in december 2020 the chicago mercantile exchange group created the first futures market in water cash settled water futures with a maximum contract period of two years are now traded on the cme globex electronic trading system i view this development as somewhat premature for futures markets and markets for other derivatives like put and call options to function properly the underlying spot market in this case the spot market for physical water or water rights should be liquid and transparent cme group s futures market is based on the nasdaq veles california water index which tracks the cash price of physical water rights in california based on transactions in surface water and in four groundwater markets because the local and regional water supplies often are not connected let alone fully integrated the spot market underlying the futures market is too segmented it does not represent a single homogeneous commodity or asset today s spot markets for water and water rights thus are too illiquid and non transparent to support an economically and socially useful futures market but there is hope the regional and global integration of physical water supplies and the associated spot markets for water and water rights is making spectacular progress two ongoing developments stand out one is project greenland created and sponsored by thomas schumann capital in partnership with north atlantic research and survey ltd under its iceberg management and water extraction programme suitable free floating north atlantic icebergs weighing 1 2 1 4 million tonnes are towed to an operational location in scotland where the ice and water are prepared for international transportation the target markets are in the water deprived middle east and north africa the project is scalable and relies on established technologies and infrastructures being deployed in an innovative and disruptive manner given time additional technological advances and proper spot water pricing icebergs from antarctica also could become viable sources of fresh water a second fascinating entrant to the global water markets is skyh2o s atmospheric water generation awg system a proprietary technology that extracts clean fresh water from the atmosphere the business model here is flexible and scalable because awg capacity can be deployed in a distributed manner to reach the ultimate customers be they governments households or industrial commercial and agricultural users its cost effectiveness relative to alternatives like desalination and distillation depends on atmospheric humidity and the price of energy in the proximity of the customers the future of water as a significant asset class depends on the willingness of governments and ultimately of society at large to price water at its long run social marginal cost as a scarce renewable resource including the cost of addressing the negative environmental externalities associated with its production and distribution globally over 70 per cent of fresh water is used in agriculture and most of this usage is either free or heavily subsidised households in many countries also pay but a small fraction of the long run social marginal cost of the water they use i hope and expect that both these anomalies will soon end there is growing recognition of deepening freshwater scarcity crises around the world as well as a greater willingness on the part of policymakers to price negative environmental externalities appropriately to recognise water as a scarce renewable resource a tradable commodity and a marketable asset is not to diminish its unique significance as a good that is essential to life and viewed by many as a gift from god when socially efficient water pricing creates economic hardship an appropriate fiscal response through targeted income support is required if this fails perhaps because the state cannot identify who is adversely affected by proper water pricing a two tier tariff may be required while a social subsistence level of water should be provided for free or at a heavily subsidised price all additional water usage could be priced at its full long run social marginal cost to preserve the right incentives water is indeed becoming an asset class give it another decade and exchange traded funds for water and water rights will be part of the new normal for investors willem h buiter is a visiting professor of international and public affairs at columbia

international bola a akinterinwa nigerians witness daily breaking news of insecurity which is deepening in different ramifications president muhammadu buhari pmb strongly believes that he and his government are doing the best possible in the collective interest but most concerned nigerians do not share pmb s perspective for reasons of psychology of human differences former military head of state and elected president of nigeria chief olusegun okikiola obasanjo noted on monday 13th december 2021 that president buhari has done his best that is what he can do if we are expecting anything more than what he has done or what he is doing that means we re whipping a dead horse and there is no need in reaction to chief obasanjo s observation the minister of information and culture alhaji lai mohammed said that while there is nothing wrong in the citizens expressing their concerns over the insecurity in the country we wish to say that the use of incendiary and insulting words especially by leaders of all hues can only overheat the polity and heighten tension more important alhaji mohammed added that while the government provides leadership all nigerians have a role to play in securing our nation security is not the sole responsibility of the security forces alone we must not only support our security agencies but we must also say something anytime we see something that hampers our safety and security as encapsulated in the mantra if you see something say something in this regard if lai mohammad believes that seeing something is also saying something in which way has what chief obasanjo seen and said constitute an insult we believe strongly that it is precisely alhaji mohammed who has been recklessly insulting nigerians of all hues he takes the whole people of nigeria for granted by seeking to teach them how to think how to see or observe and how to evaluate one typical example is his description of the lagos state judicial panel of inquiry report on restitution for victims of sars related abuses and other matters as tales by moonlight with the seriousness of purpose objectivity of investigation and honesty of reconciliatory efforts a minister of information and culture can have the effrontery to liken such a report as another chiffon de papier it is the taking of public opinion on a lighter mood and neglecting this type of tales by moon light that are fueling national insecurity in nigeria muammar gaddafi s observation is a case in point the reported chinese intention to establish a military base on the coast of equatorial guinea is another dilemma gaddafi s tales by moon light to an extent the information minister is correct that all nigerians should support the security agencies and that if one sees something one should say something however the problem with alhaji mohammed s observation is the emptiness of it he complained about leaders making incendiary statement and insulting pmb since alhaji mohammed was reacting to chief obasanjo s perceived incendiary statement it is logically deducible that he believes chief obasanjo was insulting pmb considering that both chief obasanjo and pmb are both military turned politicians and were both heads of state through coups d état and elected presidents of nigeria it is useful to note that chief obasanjo is senior to pmb in the military and as a militician it is a truism in military tradition that a junior officer cannot court martial his senior by implication chief obasanjo can insult pmb if need be but pmb cannot insult his senior even if we still admit that respect begets respect chief obasanjo is advising warning about the likely dangers ahead instead of taking an objective look at the advice at the warnings at the implications the information minister is pontificating on tales by moon light to no avail in other words he sees the complaints as a child s play it is this type of perception of foreign observations often considered as a child s play that has been largely responsible for the deepening of national insecurity in nigeria at the level of the libyan tale by moon light so to say muammar gaddafi said in 2010 that nigeria should be split along religious lines that is muslim north and christian south vide reuters filippo monteforte pool files the government of nigeria was angered to the extent of recalling its principal representative ambassador isah mohammed for urgent consultations gaddafi s suggestions were made considering the violent clashes between the muslim and christian groups in jos in the words of gaddafi the jos crisis was a deep conflict of religious nature and therefore called for the splitting of nigeria in the belief that it would stop bloodshed and burning of places of worship the national assembly passed a motion which requested the government to ask the african union to carry out an independent investigationinto whether libya was supplying infiltrators to destabilizenigeria there is no information to educate us on the outcome of the investigation what is on record is that nigeria s foreign minister said that the insensitive and oftentimes irresponsible utterances of colonel gaddafi his theatrics and grandstanding at every auspicious occasion have become too numerous to recount these have diminished his status and credibility as a leader to be taken seriously this is another mania of saying that muammar gaddafi is a tale by moon light himself the mere consideration that he is not serious a leader implies not taking his words seriously the issue is not accepting gaddafi s suggestion of splitting nigeria but to seek a better understanding why religion remains a do or die matter in nigeria is it because of farmland needs in the middle belt or because of jihadist agenda many notable nigerians have accused pmb of nursing an islamisation and a fulanisation agenda whether the allegations are right whether they are wrong remains a different kettle of fish entirely what is undeniable however is the attitudinal disposition of pmb which apparently lends credence to the accusations consistent with government s attitude of tales by moonlight no one bothers about whether there is fulanisation or islamisation agenda while national insecurity is deepening as regards the planned chinese military base on the coast of equatorial guinea this will be the second time that equatorial guinea will be used to seriously threaten nigeria s national security and particularly nigeria s existential survival the first time was when apartheid south africa wanted to establish itself in equatorial guinea the strategic calculation by then was to be able to contain nigeria s anti apartheid activities nigeria fought both south africa and equatorial guinea tooth and nail and south africa did not make haste slowly in throwing her military presence in the country to the dustbin of history on this second experience the wall street journal has reported based on classified us intelligence that chinais planning to launch its first permanent military facility on the atlantic ocean and that the base will be on the coast of equatorial guinea the report also has it that the united states is opposed to the location of a permanent military base near nigerian waters without doubt sino american relationship is not at its best it has been largely fraught with mutual suspicions arising from alleged human rights abuses in china and violations disagreement over the future status of taiwan us belief that covid 19 originated in wuhan china which the beijing authorities have vehemently opposed trade disagreement and emergence of china as another superpower in the eyes of the washingtonian government the most serious security threat to the united states is any permanent military of china on the atlantic ocean the report of the journal also recalled the briefing by general townsend the commander of the us africa command to the us senate in april 2021 that china s most significant threat would be a militarily useful naval facility on the atlantic coast of africa according to general townsend the military base would be a place that they can make port calls and get gas and groceries and where they can re arm with munitions and repair naval vessels if the united states is so much concerned about the alleged chinese threats in far away america should nigeria not also be concerned this question has been asked bearing in mind that the coast of equatorial guinea is only about 144 kilometres from calabar 225 kilometres from port harcourt and 672kilometres from lagos should this concern be considered as another tale by moonlight without jots of doubt equatorial guinea has the sovereign right to invite china to establish any base temporary or permanent base within the international territorial limits of the country however this cannot and must not be detrimental to nigeria s national security interest nigeria s relationship with china is generally good the same is true of nigeria s ties with the united states the issue at stake however is not simply about taking side with anyone of them the fact is that nigeria s territory is within the coverage of any missile attack in the event of a sour relationship in the future nigeria s debts to china are on the increase what happens in the event of financial insolvency will the chinese attach any of nigeria s country s infrastructure with the nearness of a chinese permanent military base to nigeria s territorial waters what are the strategic implications and scenarios which country is friendlier to nigeria in terms of development assistance china or the united states if nigeria s foreign policy interest has been discouragement of foreign military presence in africa if nigeria has been opposed to the establishment of the us africa command what will be the basis of accepting a chinese permanent military base in equatorial guinea indeed the issue goes beyond a tale by moonlight according to the beijing authorities china s military strategy will unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development pursue an independent foreign policy of peace and a national defense policy that is defensive in nature oppose hegemonism and power politics in all forms and will never seek hegemony or expansion china s armed forces will remain a staunch force in maintaining world peace vide china s military strategy the state council information office of the people s republic of china may 2015 published by the foreign languages press to what extent will this strategy consistent with peace making dynamics of pmb s remissness the remissness of pmb in effectively containing insecurity in nigeria can be explained by several factors first is the complicity of muslim followers especially the northern muslims kingsley omonobi in his report entitled gaddafi wanted to break nigeria in saturday vanguard of october 22 2011 gave instances of the many visits of muammar gaddafi to the northern part of nigeria gaddafi had always said that nigeria would break up unless the country was split into muslim north and christian south as reported gaddafi was massively funding the construction of mosques and islamic centres of worship in kano and other cities of the north he was making donations unannounced and perhaps more interestingly omonobi re quoted a confidant that there were also several visits by several top and influential northerners especially those of the islamic faith to libya ostensibly on the invitation of the late libyan leader when he was alive and held sway in tripoli before the revolution against him started which security agencies were aware of and we closely monitored these persons if the security agencies were aware of these developments and aware of gaddafi s destabilization agenda since 2003 why did the government of nigeria keep quiet is it another tale by moonlight when pmb came to power in 2015 impression was given that there would no longer be tales by moonlight and that the issue of jihadist insurrection would be quickly nipped in the bud pmb s many policies have pointed to a change in continuity changing the technique but still sustaining an islamic and fulanisation agenda this is one of the major factors serving as a catalyst of insecurity in the country but which is simply taken as a tale by moonlight when attention is drawn toit government talks about hostility and insults this is most unfortunate a second dynamic is government s disregard for the 1999 constitution as amended and for human rights as explained in section 19 d nigeria s foreign policy objective shall include the respect for international law and treaty obligations as well as the seeking of settlement of international disputes by negotiation mediation conciliation arbitration and adjudication in this case why should a foreign policy objective be the respect for international law and treaty obligations true enough all the member states of the international community are required to comply with the principle of pacta sunt servanda sanctity of agreements in other words respecting international treaties is an obligation respecting it cannot be an aim or objective even if we admit of the respect of international law as an objective how do we explain government s refusal to accept that international law allows for the principle of self determination the yoruba southwest and the igbo southeast are calling for respect for self determination but they are being ruthlessly dealt with pmb argues that nigeria is indissoluble and that national unity is not negotiable this argument is very valid if the people themselves want it so without the people s express consent the argument is myopic and untenable when the 1999 constitution as amended is considered controversial with people suggesting that the constitution is fraudulent and that at best it is a military constitution meant essentially for the military it cannot but be logical for pmb to seek détente rather than imposing the arguments of non negotiability of national unity and indissolubility of nigeria the fundamental truth in this case is that international law and treaty obligations cannot provide for the right of self determination on the one hand and nigeria s 1999 constitution as amended cannot also provide for respect of international law on the other hand and the elected leader of nigeria pmb will be using very brutal force on those calling for the respect for the right to self determination this is a contradiction that can only fuels public anger and insecurity a third dynamic is pmb s don t care attitude towards public complaints especially in terms of allegations of pmb s policies of nepotism and selective corruption targets pmb engages in nepotism even contrarily to the principle of federal character he cares less for whatever opinion anyone holds the problem here is that the fulani who pmb is trying to protect are unnecessarily seen by the non fulani as enemies they are seen to be preferentially protected to the detriment of the collective interests of others this is engendering hostility to the extent that the problem has become a south versus north affair this is most unfortunate a fourth dynamic is the political suspicion of a fulani agenda to dominate the rest of the country this suspicion if not fear dates to the time of independence there have been complaints of preferential treatment for the fulani ethnic stock this is an area that pmb s remissness is so manifest this factor largely influences thinking and unnecessary animosity towards our brothers and sisters in the north pmb ought to have come into the public to debunk such views fifthly the case of the 1978 land use act is another serious problem not because of government s policies of rural grazing area ruga and others but basically because of the belief of the herders that they have the right to graze on any land that every land is terra nullius or land without titles herders destroy farm lands maim and killed the legitimate land owners and are allowed to go away without punishment even when complaints are reportedly lodged with the police there is always no further action based on alleged orders from above even if the police is telling lies public perception is that pmb is making all efforts to advance fulani interests to the detriment of the interests of all others there is no way insecurity would not continue to be deepened fighting insecurity therefore goes beyond the use of arms and ammunitions the policy attitude must be reviewed sixthly why is pmb against restructuring and community and state policing governors are said to be the chief security officer of their state but the commissioner of police in the state does not report to the governor but to the inspector general of police igp the igp does not have the required paraphernal means to oversee all security problems all over the country rather than meaningfully investigating the complaints about the mania of democratic governance in nigeria pmb wrongly believes that nigeria can always be governed by manu militari no true federalism in place over centralisation of policy has been the order of the day thus the reasons for insecurity in nigeria are deep and man made insecurity in nigeria is deepening and pmb s remissness has become a catalytic agent in its deepening insecurity is deepening not because efforts are not being made but essentially because when the people of nigeria tell pmb what the nature of nigeria s problem is all about pmb s lieutenants see them as tales by moonlight public opinion is never taken seriously nepotism is not a big deal in the eyes of pmb public allegations of fulanisation or islamisation agenda does not mean anything for pmb pmb allows everyone the freedom to say whatever one wants to say but he only does what he believes in pmb needs to investigate what prompted muammar gaddafi to have suggested the splitting of nigeria into two he must also investigate the implications of chinese permanent military base in equatorial guinea because shakespeare has it in macbeth that the near in blood the nearer

austin texas construction crews began work on a border wall funded by the state and private donations gov greg abbott said saturday in front of a segment of the wall in rio grande city abbott said the project uses the same material as the 17 miles of barrier constructed while president donald trump was in office texas is taking what truly is unprecedented action by any state ever for a state to build a wall on our border to secure and safeguard the sovereignty of the united states as well as our own state abbott said flanked by texas land commissioner george p bush and officials with the texas department of public safety and texas military department more senate parliamentarian rejects latest immigration proposal in reconciliation bill border security has been a top priority for abbott as he prepares to seek a third term next year he has dedicated state resources toward the border arguing that the biden administration has failed to act to stem the influx of undocumented migrants this unprecedented action is needed for one single reason abbott said that s because the biden administration has failed to do its job as required by the constitution as required by laws passed by congress to enforce the immigration laws of the united states of america in may abbott issued a disaster declaration and announced that he planned to construct a barrier using a combination of state dollars and private donations he said the barrier would be constructed on land volunteered by private property owners the first segment is being built on land managed by the general land office more doj sues texas alleging discrimination against black and latino voters trump who championed construction of a barrier along the southwest border built 453 miles of primary and secondary walls but work was halted after biden took office abbott said saturday the state backed wall under construction is a replication of the border wall that president trump put up using the same design concept and thick steel posts the texas facilities commission oversees five contractors selected to design and build the barrier including one that worked on trump s wall this year state lawmakers allocated roughly 1 billion to construct the wall in addition to 2 billion for other border security initiatives including deploying additional law enforcement personnel to the border and increasing prosecutions of migrants arrested for misdemeanor offenses some state house democrats bristled at the price tag during debate over the spending proposal in august and asked how disbursement by abbott s office would be monitored democrat beto o rourke who is running for governor called saturday s event a photo op border communities are tired of greg abbott hosting photo ops instead of fixing the real challenges facing our border communities today like the abbott tax border families will pay on their utility bills because he has failed to fix the grid o rourke said in a statement more beto o rourke announces campaign for texas governor the governor collected private donations for the border wall effort and said saturday that he had raised 54 million a texas tribune investigation found that 98 of those donations came from one out of state billionaire timothy mellon who gave 53 1 million in stock to the state in august abbott declined to say saturday how much the entire project would cost citing variables such as different terrain along the border or waterways that construction crews will have to navigate we re going to spend as much as it takes to build as much wall as we possibly can he said
midas share tips update potash firm emmerson doubles since march 2019 midas recommended the firm in march 2019 when the price was 3 1p today it s 6 05p the company is valued on the stock market at 55 4million when mining giant anglo american snapped up the yorkshire based potash project sirius minerals for 405million it was a sorry day for the group s band of loyal investors the deal left thousands nursing ruinous losses and many cried foul graham clarke was operations director at sirius from october 2011 until the anglo takeover now he is chief executive of emmerson another potash company this time in morocco for some investors the association may be too much to swallow but clarke is a different animal with a different pedigree from the ebullient sirius frontman australian chris fraser born and bred in yorkshire clarke has worked in the potash industry all his life starting out as an underground miner for cleveland potash on the north york moors he worked his way up to managing director of the business spending 26 years at the company before moving to sirius down to earth and softly spoken clarke has a reputation for getting on with the job trying to keep expenses down and workers motivated along the way he is determined to do just that at emmerson and the early signs are encouraging midas recommended the firm in march 2019 when the price was 3 1p clarke took the helm a year later and today the stock is 6 05p with supportive investors suggesting that it should be worth significantly more emmerson like sirius is at a development stage the potash is there but the mine needs to be built it is however far less costly less complex and less ambitious than its british counterpart the project is expected to cost 400million 300million to construct a fraction of the funds associated with sirius and clarke recently bagged up to 46million towards the scheme from a singapore based investment group a second large equity investor should add further ballast and clarke expects to secure about 250million in bank debt in the next few months emmerson s mine is relatively simple to construct work is already under way and the site should be up and running by 2024 swiftly ramping up to annual production of more than 700 000 tons emmerson is also based less than 100 miles from the moroccan port of casablanca so the potash can easily be shipped overseas there is a huge need for potash in morocco as well most common fertilisers have three key ingredients potash from potassium nitrogen and phosphate morocco is home to the biggest phosphate producer in the world ocp a multi billion dollar state owned company however the country is also a big importer of potash a situation that should be dramatically reversed once emmerson is in production potash prices have risen sharply this year and the outlook is promising as demand for fertiliser increases worldwide midas verdict investors bruised by sirius may have no interest in another pre revenue potash business but emmerson is moving in the right direction clarke has his head screwed on and demand for the end product is rising the company is valued on the stock market at 55 4million but that valuation should rocket as and when clarke secures the funding he needs and emmerson moves into production investors who bought in 2019 may choose to sell some shares and bank a profit but they should not sell out completely at 6 05p the stock is also worth a punt for adventurous new investors traded on aim ticker eml contact emmersonplc com or 020 7236 1177
in the months since president joe biden warned russia s vladimir putin that he needed to crack down on ransomware gangs in his country there hasn t been a massive attack like the one last may that resulted in gasoline shortages but that s small comfort to ken trzaska trzaska is president of lewis clark community college a small illinois school that canceled classes for days after a ransomware attack last month that knocked critical computer systems offline that first day trzaska said i think all of us were probably up 20 plus hours just moving through the process trying to get our arms around what happened even if the united states isn t currently enduring large scale front page ransomware attacks on par with ones earlier this year that targeted the global meat supply or kept millions of americans from filling their gas tanks the problem hasn t disappeared in fact the attack on trzaska s college was part of a barrage of lower profile episodes that have upended the businesses governments schools and hospitals that were hit the college s ordeal reflects the challenges the biden administration faces in stamping out the threat and its uneven progress in doing so since ransomware became an urgent national security problem last spring smaller scale attacks continue u s officials have recaptured some ransom payments cracked down on abuses of cryptocurrency and made some arrests spy agencies have launched attacks against ransomware groups and the u s has pushed federal state and local governments as well as private industries to boost protections yet six months after biden s admonitions to putin it s hard to tell whether hackers have eased up because of u s pressure smaller scale attacks continue with ransomware criminals continuing to operate from russia with seeming impunity administration officials have given conflicting assessments about whether russia s behavior has changed since last summer further complicating matters ransomware is no longer at the top of the u s russia agenda with washington focused on dissuading putin from invading ukraine the white house said it was determined to fight all ransomware through its various tools but that the government s response depends on the severity of the attack there are some that are law enforcement matters and others that are high impact disruptive ransomware activity posing a direct national security threat that require other measures the white house statement said ransomware attacks in which hackers lock up victims data and demand exorbitant sums to return it surfaced as a national security emergency for the administration after a may attack on colonial pipeline which supplies nearly half the fuel consumed on the east coast the attack prompted the company to halt operations causing gas shortages for days though it resumed service after paying more than 4 million in ransom soon after came an attack on meat processor jbs which paid an 11 million ransom biden met with putin in june in geneva where he suggested critical infrastructure sectors should be off limits for ransomware and said the u s should know in six months to a year whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order he reiterated the message in july days after a major attack on a software company kaseya that affected hundreds of businesses and said he expected russia to take action on cybercriminals when the u s provides enough information to do so since then there have been some notable attacks from groups believed to be based in russia including against sinclair broadcast group and the national rifle association but none of the same consequence or impact of those from last spring or summer whole of government effort one reason may be increased u s government scrutiny or fear of it the biden administration in september sanctioned a russia based virtual currency exchange that officials say helped ransomware gangs launder funds last month the justice department unsealed charges against a suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of u s cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that whole of government effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that that s going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure u s officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly it s unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning it s also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the u s following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any drop off in high profile attacks to u s efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on large scale attacks won t work because it s way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they don t even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since biden s discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say they ve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said there s been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why it s hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginia s legislature not if but when the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the school s it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the school s online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if it s going to happen but when it s going to happen
chinese leader xi jiping wears the face of the looming age of china in world affairs inscrutable but amiable in a rather mechanical way xi is a man with a huge world historic mission but few words under his leadership the coming of the age of china has acquired greater traction and urgency than ever but as in xi s facial expression we have no way of knowing everything the chinese are thinking about the future of the world they think in mandarin and communicate directives to 1 4 million citizens i suspect they only translate 25 of what they want the world to know and believe into english and other languages ordinarily then the chinese are an inherently quiescent people a land of everyman as a stoic confucian contemplative philosopher on the contrary the americans think and talk too much in english with the result that nearly everybody can second guess their next set of moves it is america s rowdy politics and talkative diplomacy that is drawing out the chinese to occasionally say some of what they are doing if only to respond to some of the outrageous claims and charges tumbling out of washington daily this contrasting approach is likely to dominate big power relations in the decades ahead all the same feverish rehearsals for a prolonged contest of global pre eminent between the united states and china are gathering steam in many spheres the chinese are literally foraging in unusual backyards for strategic footholds in anticipation of a confrontation that is foretold but may never take place in the asia pacific china has staked an unmistakable claim on what it considers its immediate sphere of influence and interest it is building navel and air bases in the south china sea it has served notice to nations like the philippines that its presence and interests can no longer be ignored it has flexed its muscles in its border areas with india while serving notice to australia new zealand and japan that it intends to contest the influence of the west especially the united states in the areas that matter to china s long term interests in africa the chinese have already established a full scale naval base in djibouti under the understandable pretext of contributing to the safety of the troubled waters in the gulf of aden a major shipping gateway long troubled by somali pirates it was hard to fault their logic as the djibouti facility came in handy when libya unraveled and the chinese rapidly evacuated thousands of chinese workers from libya for nigeria and west africa however a concerning development with long term consequences has just taken place united states intelligence reports as recently confirmed by the wall street journal and subsequently echoed and analysed by the economist to the effect that the chinese have just completed the construction of a deep sea naval port facility in bata equatorial guinea this is china s first effective foothold in the atlantic it is a development that has irked washington making it send a high level emissary in turn it has sent a high level emissary to caution the authorities in the tiny african country on the dangers of facilitating china s global ambitions in addition to equatorial guinea the chinese are said to have their eyes on the ports of angola sao tome and principe and others its strategy is either to have outright naval bases or friendly port access in some of these places china is already involved in the construction or development of a number of port facilities in africa including lagos in an april 2021 assessment presented to the us senate general stephen townsend commander of us africa command asserted that china s most significant threat would be a militarily useful navel facility on the atlantic coast of africa that means a port where they can rearm with munitions and repair naval vessels this is precisely what may have been achieved with the facility at bata in equatorial guinea washington was sufficiently worried about the development to send jon finer its deputy national security adviser on a mission to the tiny republic to register the unease of washington with the development what is significant for nigeria with this development is first the sheer physical proximity of the chinese military presence malabo is a mere 144 kilometers away from calabar 225 kilometers from port harcourt and a little over 600 kilometers from lagos these distances are immaterial in today s world of virtual proximity of everywhere from everywhere what is important is nigeria s strategic interest and stake in the gulf of guinea and the sensitive positioning of equatorial guinea in that mix of course it is well within the sovereign prerogative of equatorial guinea to enter into any arrangements with any other country to locate whatever facilities it considers in its national interest as they have tended to do in recent times the chinese are free to seek out whatever african dictatorships it can find and cajole or bride them into whatever agreement that serves its interest on the surface both china and equatorial guinea may have acted within their rights under international law in the location of the naval facility at bata but as is common with all such sensitive strategic decisions there is nothing in the legitimacy of this action that should deter other nations that are likely to be adversely affected by the action from acting in defense of their own national interests if equatorial guinea ever becomes a theatre for the drama of competing national interests between china and the united states nigeria may not be a disinterested bystander on their part the chinese in choosing equatorial guinea acted well within a predictable model of political behaviour equatorial guinea offers an ideal partner the type of african state that the chinese would opt to deal with the country is an autocracy presided over by a ruthless 79 year old with iron fist since 1979 president teodora obiang nguema mbasogo is one of africa s longest ruling leaders the government in which his son is also the vice president is a famously corrupt family autocracy everything ranging from the oil industry telecommunications and retail trade are controlled by either the president s family or cartels under their direct sponsorship this autocracy is the closest the chinese can get to finding a kindred spirit to their own homegrown communist authoritarianism in an african elected government something needs to be said in favour of the chinese national interest in their foreign forays as at 2020 china controls 15 of total world trade and still rising similarly an estimated 2 million chinese workers and experts are scattered all over the world engaged in various projects this huge expanse of trade and manpower implies a global presence which dictates that the chinese develop a maritime capacity around the world to guarantee the safety of their goods and personnel and in any event the west must understand that the rise of china as an economic competitor on the world stage has an inevitable military consequence it is understandable if the united states and the west get unduly jittery over the prospect of chinese military competition that is in the nature of the contest for global power pre eminence ordinarily however nigeria s strategic interests can hardly find comfort with the military presence of an anti western power right inside its strategic armpit the chinese may have designed a foreign policy of non interference in the internal politics of african countries where they choose to conduct their business in that regard nigeria may naively assume that chinese presence in equatorial guinea does not necessarily concern us and may not constitute a credible threat after all china is a friend and development partner they have lent us nearly 3 5 billion in concessionary loans they are building us shinny new railway tracks with rolling stock to ferry our millions around the country some of our high public officials have not disguised their love and admiration for the chinese and their suppression of civil and democratic rights mr lai mohammed is enamored of the chinese control and censorship of the social media and their over regulation of conventional media all this is costly naivety it is convenient to trade with china as even the united states does if we find that their loans come at a concessionary rate let us borrow from them but make sure that we match our appetite for copious borrowing with a plan for responsible repayment otherwise the shrewd chinese will enforce forfeiture and repossession clauses in those loan agreements which are almost always written in mandarin nonetheless we cannot wish away the fact that we remain one of the west s most important and long lasting allies and investment destinations in africa the united states britain and france would be hard put to trifle with nigeria s alliance and support in the event that the showdown with the chinese assumes a loud international scope it is significant in this regard to point out that the new chinese naval facility in equatorial guinea is the first effective physical presence of a major power so close to nigeria as a matter of national pride and reflex nigeria has habitually rejected the presence of military bases by contending powers either in its territory or too close by older nigerians will recall that soon after independence the first major elite uprising against the government of the newly independent nation was against an attempt to sign a defense pact with the british government this would mean the establishment of british military bases in nigeria this was roundly rejected similarly in the heat of the niger delta militancy hints by the governments of the period to invite friendly countries to establish amphibious special forces facilities in the niger delta were similarly rejected even with the upsurge of the boko haram insurgency international effort to contain the insurgency were treated as part of the global fight against international terrorism the united states specifically suggested the location of a base in nigeria to host the drones it was deploying to aid the operations in the sahel those drones would enable it maintain surveillance and target boko haram and iswap movements but nigeria rejected the suggestion instead the us unit is currently based in chad from where it supports french troops in their sahel anti terrorism operations rewind to the late 1980s and early 1990s in the desperate dying days of apartheid south africa the racist regime came to see nigeria as its most consequential adversary nigeria with its then vast resources and considerable diplomatic and military clout was the most lethal front line state standing in opposition to the apartheid regime but nigeria was too far away and could not be easily destabilised the way it had done with its immediate neighbours so south africa went shopping for pliant client states near enough to cause nigeria some sleepless nights equatorial guinea and cameroun presented themselves for divergent purposes both being located in the soft underbelly of nigeria were attractive to a determined adversary first equatorial guinea was cajoled into the location of a south african military outpost with sensitive listening facilities second the cameroun government was encouraged by south africa to ratchet up pressure on nigeria by rekindling its claims on the bakassi peninsula the government of ibrahim babangida recognized the credibility of the strategic threats and communicated its displeasure to both countries in response to equatorial guinea the babangida administration s response was a classic carrot and stick approach in addition to securing a bilateral air services agreement that enabled nigeria airways to frequently fly into equatorial guinea nigeria undertook a number of assistance development projects in equatorial guinea these ranged from schools to health facilities as a stick component the nigerian navy activated a forward presence in the atlantic sea board with an operational base at the calabar port and surveillance oversight stretching through much of the gulf of guinea the nigerian navy s flagship nns aradu was stationed around the waters off calabar mostly as a psychological deterrence the nigeria air force activated a combat strike fighter squadron in the same vicinity in response to cameroun s irritations over bakassi nigeria reinforced its troops presence in the border areas in response to some skirmishes across the border the nigerian army displayed strength with restraint while diplomatic efforts at the united nations sought to arbitrate the border issues nigeria was not done yet on the diplomatic front nigeria engaged with the government of f w deklerk which was already prepping to dump the apartheid system very quickly apartheid ended mandela was released from prison south africa became a free and democratic country it no longer needed outposts for trouble making in our backyard nigeria s response then was a mixture of some carrots a dangling stick nearby and measured diplomatic engagement that was the old nigeria at the height of its power and influence as an emerging regional power that was the world as it was then fast forward to 2020 2021 china is in equatorial guinea not as an adversarial force but it is close enough to cause us strategic concern the question is whether the sensitivity of nigeria was at any time considered in the sighting and execution of the bata facility regrettably what we are witnessing is the erosion of whatever diplomatic and military clout nigeria ever had as a former emergent regional power our domestic economy is in a free fall whatever remains of our military clout is bogged down in internal security engagements with a cocktail of non state trouble makers we have lost strategic foreign policy focus having run a government for close to 10 years without a word about a foreign policy review nigeria has literally disappeared from the radar of significant international strategic calculations this is the context for understanding why developments like the chinese bata naval base are likely to feature more in the years ahead

when thinking about next year s federal election australians should consider the incalculable damage scott morrison has done to australian democracy during his first full term as elected prime minister writes george grundy as parliament closes out for 2021 the morrison government is taking steps to set the agenda for next year s federal election scott morrison will be hoping for no major bushfires this summer and a return to pre covid normality so the battle can be fought around perceived lnp strengths such as the economy national security and culture war issues like social media trolling to that end morrison continues to champion the reopening of international borders and an end to lockdowns and travel restrictions irrespective of health outcomes and peter dutton plays to type by irresponsibly scaring everybody with talk of a war with china australians do not benefit from a war with china recent rhetoric on war is more about supporting the highly lucrative defence industry as it is about countering the rise of china writes dr rashad seedeen yet governments can only do so much when it comes to the focus of the electorate if the election is held in may next year as seems likely it will be more than eight years since the coalition took power and history suggests that a national mood for change is difficult to overcome no matter the issues at hand so as the warmth of christmas comes into view australians should consider the breadth of scott morrison s first full term as elected prime minister because beneath the daily headlines there are warning signs that all is not well with australian democracy the decision to be made in 2022 is one of the most consequential in the nation s history first the economy voters most important issue in 2019 s election these are strange times on the surface annual gross domestic product gdp growth of 3 9 looks like success even allowing for a lockdown induced contraction of 1 9 in just the last three months but despite josh frydenberg s repeated promises of a return to surplus the budget remains badly in deficit as has now been the case for a decade and sovereign debt has soared to the stratosphere from roughly 250 billion when kevin rudd left office australia s national debt has ballooned passing 830 billion this august and appearing inevitably on course to reach 1 trillion this fundamental of taking on enormous debt in order to maintain acceptable economic performance should place the coalition s record in perspective just as a man who spends lavishly on a credit card may not actually be rich other economic indicators show near catastrophic underlying change manufacturing as a percentage of gdp has collapsed as has construction investment in social housing is through the floor and as house prices and rents have increased exponentially affordability has cratered household debt is approaching record levels and as ever the poor are suffering the most homelessness crisis turning australia into nomadland the lives of van dwellers as portrayed in the film nomadland provide a reminder of our government s ignorance towards the homelessness crisis funding for social and indigenous housing has been slashed under the lnp government about 600 000 queenslanders now live in poverty and many australian cities are experiencing record homelessness these outcomes are not an accident but the result of deliberate political decisions nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars of national debt taken on and still people can t afford a roof over their head although the unemployment rate is a respectable 5 2 under employment is up hours worked are down the poor are getting poorer the gap between rich and poor wider this is a consistent theme across every level of the morrison government it s in this environment that scott morrison has also squeezed household budgets from the other end quietly cutting 900 items from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and increasing medication costs often for those suffering life threatening diseases such as cancer the national disability insurance scheme ndis and those with disabilities have not escaped the scythe and many families living in the most difficult circumstances imaginable have just had their lives made even harder pensioner poverty in australia is already one of the worst in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd but should morrison win next year the indue card cashless welfare card hugely profitable for its privately owned operator will likely be rolled out to all aged pensioners and recipients of social security meaning 80 of social benefits will be tightly controlled by the government more regulation less freedom tougher lives another term for morrison will mean more cuts to medicare and a government more committed than ever to punching down at the weak vulnerable and poor internationally australia s image has been tarnished by blundering diplomatic belligerence and climate policies that make this nation the world s carbon pariah australia remains the worst co2 emitter per capita on earth among major nations one of the world s largest exporters of coal and natural gas and firmly at the back of the field when it comes to emissions reduction whatever sympathy australia engendered during the 2019 bushfires is gone at this year s united nations climate change conference cop26 morrison delivered his keynote address to a virtually empty room a stunning show of disrespect and irrelevance for one of the world s leading economies after betraying the french and having emmanuel macron publicly call scott morrison a liar australia s relationship with the nation about to take charge of the european union is in tatters and must quickly be repaired given the next round of free trade talks are due in february if as seems likely morrison fails to apologise and offer detente the disastrous mismanagement of the new aukus alliance and ditching of the french submarine deal is likely to significantly hamper australian industries wishing to trade freely with europe meanwhile peter dutton rattles the sabre of war pitting australia against china a nation with an army significantly greater than ours china also happens to be australia s biggest trading partner with a sensitive centrally administered government holding enough economic power to crush australia at a stroke dutton s loose talk is a danger to national security given our current stock of just six submarines pitted against a country believed to have 250 350 ballistic nuclear missiles the eye popping 90 billion submarine deal with the u s is still 20 years away yet dutton continues to recklessly suggest that war with china should not be discounted choosing anzac day of all days to amplify this madness the australian government is playing with fire in the hope of reaping short term electoral benefit by bringing national security to the fore despite these blunders it s the issue of climate change that most often gets australia into world headlines ten months after taking office tony abbott s government became the first on earth to repeal active pricing legislation on carbon emissions since then it s become difficult to track emissions reduction performance given the kind of shonky governmental accounting practices that allow morrison to claim a reduction in emissions because less land is being cleared than originally forecast whatever the true picture it s not good in 2020 coal still accounted for 54 of the nation s electrical generation australia continues to spend more than 10 billion annually on fossil fuel subsidies and was ranked last of 60 countries for climate change policies at cop26 it would be bad enough that australia has a prime minister who has to be dragged kicking and screaming on every little step towards climate action but the coalition isn t just standing in the way of progress it is actively undermining state efforts to reduce emissions this intransigence is made flesh in the form of angus taylor the hysterically titled minister for emissions reduction who appears not to have seen the sign on his office door when he recently waved through woodside s 12 billion scarborough liquefied natural gas project that will release 1 36 billion tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere there are reasons to be optimistic south australia is now regularly generating 100 of its power requirements from wind and solar queensland s renewable sector has trebled in size in four years the u s uk japan and canada have all pledged to slash emissions this decade piling pressure on australia and the private sector appears to be ignoring or outpacing this government with battery and solar panel prices plummeting yet there is much greater reason to be concerned the paris climate target of 1 5 degrees warming appears to be gone neither major political party has committed to anything like the emissions reductions required to avoid what scientists are unanimous in describing as a calamity once in a century heatwaves and floods are becoming commonplace and even the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro says that climate change is behind an 800 increase in bushfires in the past 32 years one in six australian birds are now under threat and it s not unfair to suggest that it is government policy that will kill the great barrier reef scott morrison is a threat to the great barrier reef by failing in climate policy prime minister scott morrison is also failing in protecting the future of the great barrier reef when the sheer scale of this catastrophe to come finally seeps into australian minds we will look back on scott morrison s climate vandalism and judge him one of modern history s great criminals that australia in 2021 with all the overwhelming evidence to hand continues to greenlight massive new fossil fuel projects well it beggars belief the national security moral and even existential implications of climate change dwarf any other threat to this country yet our government focuses its resources on the need to regulate mean tweets much of the government s climate intransigence is because it is so utterly beholden to special interests and big business there has never been a more corrupt australian government than the one headed by scott morrison the list of scandals is exhaustive incredible even transparency international s recent corruption perceptions index suggests australia has significantly declined since 2012 with the corrosive influence of money in politics unchecked and having broken a promise to establish a federal integrity commission there are precious few ways to stem the rorting except voting the coalition out of government this will prove more difficult after the billions lavishly splashed around in coalition held seats but should labor win government and have the courage to establish a powerful and retrospective icac the corruption these last few years may rise to the level of criminal charges for some coalition figures losing the 2022 election carries more than just political consequence killing competition and a federal icac courtesy of the coalition the morrison government is about to pull one of its best ever scams it s not just the corruption that is unseemly morrison and his government have a profoundly uneasy relationship with people who aren t white privileged males just like them scott morrison has a woman problem and just can t seem to find a way to act decently around them australians have reluctantly learned that there is such a thing as training for empathy and may have struggled themselves to feel empathy when discovering that 190 000 of their tax dollars was spent teaching members something that might otherwise be expected to come naturally it didn t seem to work parliament house has become as no less than the new york times described it a young woman was raped in a federal minister s office and the prime minister s staff appear to have backgrounded journalists against her partner before the pm s wife stepped in to remind him that rape is bad sex in the prayer room wanking on ministers desks as the jenkins review confirmed australia s parliament is often a dangerous misogynistic zoo any chief executive officer of a major corporation presiding over a workplace in which one in three staff reported experiencing sexual harassment would be out of a job by sunset yet regarding such reports morrison said i wish i found them more surprising it may be a leap to connect a prime minister who lacks the good grace not to regularly turn his back on women speaking in parliament to a country in which a woman is killed by her partner every week but the prime minister sets the tone scott morrison is responsible for one of the worst workplaces in the country for women and a parliament where incredibly over half of the people working there have experienced bullying sexual harassment or assault alleged rape by cabinet member deflected by coalition government rocked by another horrific scandal the coalition government has again attempted to avoid confronting the issue of an alleged rape in 1988 writes dr jennifer wilson since 2006 australia has dropped from 15th according to the latest global gender gap report from world economic forum to 50th losing six places in the last year alone we re just above the tropical rainforest nation of suriname this is not good enough and morrison appears to lack the character or will to fix it but if anything this sexist shit show is overshadowed by the savagery inflicted on the truly vulnerable with each passing year australia s offshore concentration camp policies have become more squalid and untenable revelations of the conditions on nauru should in any rational world engender prison sentences for those involved in its administration guards trading cigarettes for sexual favours children as young as ten raped guards filming themselves in sexual encounters with detainees then sharing the videos with each other a woman gang raped then doused in petrol and set alight this is a national historic shame peter dutton was the minister responsible for much of the time when this was happening many think him a monster it seems a footnote after such horror but nauru is also now almost unbelievably uneconomic each refugee costs about 4 3 million a year to detain that s 11 780 per person per day it s insane it is hard not to conclude that racism plays a significant role in the government s approach to asylum seekers especially when considering other aspects of race in australia of australia s prison population 29 is indigenous despite aborigines making up just 3 3 of the population fifteen of the 22 deaths in custody between july 2019 and june 2020 were indigenous sadly indigenous mistreatment by police and the justice system isn t something new for australia but it s hard not to spot a pattern especially in the behaviour of peter dutton it was dutton who lied that victorians were afraid to go outside because of african gangs dutton who tried to fast track white south african farmers visa applications saying they need help from a civilised country like ours and it was dutton who notoriously ripped an integrated and adored tamil family from the town of biloela and imprisoned them at a deserted processing centre at which one of the young children nearly died this year vicious virulent cruel racism courtesy of australia s minister for defence and leader of the house scott morrison s right hand man racial inequities are found in nearly every aspect of australian society not least with the covid vaccination rollout last month just 54 5 of aboriginal and torres strait islander people were fully vaccinated compared to 81 1 across the country despite indigenous people being among the first to be eligible for the vaccine australia s distant geography and ocean borders have largely spared us from the ravages of covid experienced in europe and the u s but our relative success has been almost exclusively due to the actions of state premiers rather than scott that s a matter for the states morrison the federal government is clearly responsible for quarantine aged care vaccinations and international borders and it s a tale of failure at every turn nearly two years into the pandemic as the omicron variant causes fresh concern and europe deals with its worst surge in cases scott morrison has yet to build a single dedicated quarantine facility despite overwhelming evidence that hotels are simply not fit for purpose and despite a number of outbreaks coming directly from hotel quarantine breaches kevin rudd asked to save australia from scott morrison after the australian government s botched effort to vaccinate the country business leaders have turned to former pm kevin rudd for help minister for health and aged care greg hunt recently had the chutzpah to boast that australia is one of the most recently vaccinated nations on earth but that s because of a botched federal vaccine rollout earlier this year that we were promised would put us at the front of the queue but wasn t a race and at one point missed it s four million vaccinations target by 3 4 million doses and as with everything under scott morrison it s the poor who have suffered the most with low income earners 2 6 times more likely to die from covid than their wealthier counterparts by may next year some voters may have forgotten about the 655 aged care residents who died from covid in victoria last year and sydneysiders might find someone else to blame for 107 days of lockdown caused in great part by another liberal seemingly ignoring medical advice but covid management and the vaccine rollout has been a debacle richard denniss at the monthly put it succinctly there is competition for the title the australian arts sector has been decimated during covid and was under attack until the very last sitting days of parliament the abc s budget continues to be slashed and chairwoman ita buttrose has accused the government of political interference and intimidation all while murdoch s sky news australia spreads its insidious influence tertiary education has shed 40 000 jobs nearly one in five during the pandemic an unprecedented disaster for learning in this country curiously that s almost exactly the same total number of people employed in coal mining whose jobs are apparently vital to the survival of the nation just ask matt canavan disdain for the arts education social welfare and human rights scapegoats corporate media and corruption these are underlying indicators of the health of a nation s social fabric all have suffered under scott morrison curiously they also fit well with political scientist laurence britt s famous list of 14 characteristics of a fascist nation it s uncomfortable to use the f word but look at the list the 14th fascist characteristic you will note is fraudulent elections when australians go to the polls next year it s unlikely that democratic breakdown will feature in their top ten issues but scott morrison has often barely noticed waged an unprecedented war on the mechanics and institutions of australian democracy in a way that suggests genuine danger for the federation if given another term we ve seen the rise of political prosecutions secret trials where the defendant isn t allowed to see super secret evidence against them and deportation laws allowing the state to use secret evidence people who have lived in this country their whole lives have been deported without notice or explanation we ve witnessed widespread and unnecessary secrecy hiding matters like breaches of ministerial standards and corruption and just this month climate warnings that are of vital and urgent public interest mass surveillance legislation allows the government to hack your computer and online life without a warrant there s a push to make voting harder through identification laws despite the australian electoral commission confirming just 24 prosecutions from 2 102 electors out of 15 million identified as having multiple marks against their names at the last election there s more charities have been relentlessly attacked and stripped of their advocacy rights in a way that has been described as an abandonment of parliamentary debate with the lower house scheduled to sit for just ten days between now and august 2022 and the senate for just five days five days as morrison seeks another term of office the coalition has signalled that it has no new legislative agenda no laws to pass just a will to power there s still more a new law that gives the government the power to detain refugees indefinitely maybe for the rest of their lives a splinter nationalist party somehow able to send all of us political texts on our phones whose leader is permanently banned from facebook for spreading misinformation but has somehow just been appointed to a parliamentary committee looking into online safety and social media the rise of the far right death threats becoming commonplace state premiers not safe in their homes gallows and nooses in the street and hard line fringe mps flirting with the mob defamation trials launched by the powerful against members of the public because of a mean tweet the silencing of dissent this is a five alarm fire for australian democracy a dangerous moment for this nation and what of the character of the individuals legislating this never ending drift to the right we ve seen a former attorney general accused of the anal rape of a teenager complete with an acceptance of 1 million from anonymous backers to fund a defamation trial have the government close ranks around him backbencher andrew laming was accused of a series of scandals and abuse allegations involving women there s george christensen frequenter of a philippines adults entertainment bar and poster of violent gun imagery who nevertheless fancies himself as a moral guardian to protect women s uteruses a member of the nation s government who advocates civil disobedience also there s alan tudge the education minister who stepped down after an accusation of physical abuse we have a senator accused of making dog noises at female speakers and an embarrassment of a deputy prime minister who shall we say often appears tired and emotional it s a rogue s gallery a zoo and at the top of it sits scott morrison a profoundly religious evangelical man who somehow interprets the message of christ in a way that allows him to act with cruelty and basically accept the lack of safety for women in his workplace as de rigueur scott morrison s religious delusions are dangerous our prime minister s religious faith has often come under criticism which seems justified when it s linked to extremism and child abuse australians may forgive morrison membership of his strange extremist ponzi scheme of a church but it remains incredible that a prime minister who has downplayed white supremacy and extremism in australia has nevertheless maintained a close friendship with tim stewart one of the country s most prominent qanon conspiracy theorists q let s not forget believes that the world is run by satan worshipping infant sacrificing blood drinking paedophiles and in america is linked to violent acts like kidnapping and murder the fbi has come close to designating qanon a terrorist group and is conducting threat assessments amid concern about q inspired political extremism take a step back think about this again scott morrison prime minister of australia is friends with someone a hairs breadth from being called a member of a terrorist group this perhaps overshadows a lot of other frankly weird stuff that just hasn t been true of other prime ministers morrison has referred to social media as the work of the devil he believes that god made him pm and that when he puts his hands on people he is passing on some kind of holy spirit one wonders what he is capable of if perceiving that an election loss is also not god s will next year all this corruption all the lies and the cruelty scott morrison is a dreadful christian bringing shame to a noble faith and punishing the poor and the vulnerable the opposite of christianity it s been clear for some time that morrison cares about just one thing winning re election the pm has shown a darker side a mendacious quick temper when under pressure behind in the polls it will be worth watching scott morrison as the thing he desires most of all comes into view it s become popular in america to frame every election as the most important in history this time it s actually true in australia if scott morrison somehow secures another term in office the incalculable damage he has already done to australian democracy may be completed another morrison government will be a catastrophe for this country australia faces an existential election in 2022 australians would do well to dwell on that this christmas season george grundy is an english australian author

in the months since president joe biden warned russia s vladimir putin that he needed to crack down on ransomware gangs in his country there hasn t been a massive attack like the one last may that resulted in gasoline shortages but that s small comfort to ken trzaska trzaska is president of lewis clark community college a small illinois school that canceled classes for days after a ransomware attack last month that knocked critical computer systems offline that first day trzaska said i think all of us were probably up 20 plus hours just moving through the process trying to get our arms around what happened even if the united states isn t currently enduring large scale front page ransomware attacks on par with ones earlier this year that targeted the global meat supply or kept millions of americans from filling their gas tanks the problem hasn t disappeared in fact the attack on trzaska s college was part of a barrage of lower profile episodes that have upended the businesses governments schools and hospitals that were hit feeling out of the loop we ll catch you up on the chicago news you need to know sign up for the weekly chicago catch up newsletter here the college s ordeal reflects the challenges the biden administration faces in stamping out the threat and its uneven progress in doing so since ransomware became an urgent national security problem last spring u s officials have recaptured some ransom payments cracked down on abuses of cryptocurrency and made some arrests spy agencies have launched attacks against ransomware groups and the u s has pushed federal state and local governments as well as private industries to boost protections yet six months after biden s admonitions to putin it s hard to tell whether hackers have eased up because of u s pressure smaller scale attacks continue with ransomware criminals continuing to operate from russia with seeming impunity administration officials have given conflicting assessments about whether russia s behavior has changed since last summer further complicating matters ransomware is no longer at the top of the u s russia agenda with washington focused on dissuading putin from invading ukraine the white house said in a statement that it was determined to fight all ransomware through its various tools but that the government s response depends on the severity of the attack there are some that are law enforcement matters and others that are high impact disruptive ransomware activity posing a direct national security threat that require other measures the white house statement said ransomware attacks in which hackers lock up victims data and demand exorbitant sums to return it surfaced as a national security emergency for the administration after a may attack on colonial pipeline which supplies nearly half the fuel consumed on the east coast the attack prompted the company to halt operations causing gas shortages for days though it resumed service after paying more than 4 million in ransom soon after came an attack on meat processor jbs which paid an 11 million ransom biden met with putin in june in geneva where he suggested critical infrastructure sectors should be off limits for ransomware and said the u s should know in six months to a year whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order he reiterated the message in july days after a major attack on a software company kaseya that affected hundreds of businesses and said he expected russia to take action on cybercriminals when the u s provides enough information to do so since then there have been some notable attacks from groups believed to be based in russia including against sinclair broadcast group and the national rifle association but none of the same consequence or impact of those from last spring or summer one reason may be increased u s government scrutiny or fear of it the biden administration in september sanctioned a russia based virtual currency exchange that officials say helped ransomware gangs launder funds last month the justice department unsealed charges against a suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of u s cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that whole of government effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that that s going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure u s officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly it s unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning it s also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the u s following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any drop off in high profile attacks to u s efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on large scale attacks won t work because it s way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they don t even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since biden s discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say they ve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said there s been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why it s hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginia s legislature the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the school s it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the school s online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if it s going to happen but when it s going to happen in 2019 a ransomware attack wiped out 750 government computers across texas in less than 90 minutes as hospitals local governments agencies and businesses increasingly become the targets of ransomware attacks here s what you should know about the threat ___ suderman reported from richmond virginia associated

kuala lumpur dec 19 labour shortage was the biggest hurdle faced by the palm oil industry this year with losses for the country running into billions of ringgit but the global economic reopening has resulted in pent up demand for the versatile oil advertisement palm oil and rubber are the two biggest contributors to the nation s coffers under the agriculture sector which ranked second in terms of trade surpassing mining products in 2020 india consumed 40 per cent more palm oil for the period between january and october 2021 notching up 2 8 million tonnes from 1 97 million tonnes for the same period last year while the labour crunch affected production it nevertheless helped to push up crude palm oil cpo prices by 65 6 per cent from rm1 728 50 to rm4 363 00 per tonne in january november 2021 versus rm2 634 50 per tonne a year ago advertisement plantation companies such as sime darby plantation bhd sdp also saw its net profit triple to rm610 million in the third quarter ended sept 30 2021 from rm190 million a year ago while revenue surged to rm5 06 billion from rm3 18 billion previously cpo production stocks and price the malaysian palm oil board mpob revealed on dec 10 2021 that cpo production for the january november period declined by 1 14 million tonnes or 6 4 per cent to 16 67 million tonnes compared with 17 81 million tonnes during the january november 2020 period due to the decline in fresh fruit bunches ffb processed by the mills arising from the lower ffb production advertisement palm oil stocks at end november 2021 was 16 3 per cent higher at 1 56 million tonnes compared with a year ago due to lower palm oil exports and higher palm oil imports during the january november 2020 reference period the export of palm oil and other palm based products declined by 8 8 per cent to 22 14 million tonnes versus 24 27 million tonnes as a result of low cpo production which limited export capacity despite the lower export volume the higher prices of palm oil and other palm based products have influenced total export revenue of these commodities in january november 2021 to surge by 39 9 per cent to rm91 37 billion from rm65 29 billion earned in january november 2020 mpob said palm oil export revenue totalled rm61 26 billion for january november 2021 versus rm43 61 billion in the same period last year which translated to a jump of 40 5 per cent major export markets included india china the european union eu and turkey during the 11th month of 2021 cpo price reached a high of rm5 341 00 per tonne against rm3 748 50 per tonne in january challenges haunting palm oil industry labour shortage was the main obstacle for the industry especially when locals are not keen to work in this so called 3d job dirty difficult and dangerous the labour crunch resulted in a 56 per cent loss in ffb production and more than 100 per cent compared with 2020 and 2019 the loss in value terms was estimated at rm9 billion and rm6 billion respectively to overcome this the government has agreed to add about 32 000 foreign workers to the plantation sector provided that they are fully vaccinated for covid 19 forced labour issue by the united states us on two malaysian companies sime darby plantation bhd sdp and fgv holdings bhd and the eu s never ending anti palm oil campaign were other hurdles faced by the industry slapped with the ban by the us customs and border protection cbp both sdp and fgv have been taking steps to overcome the situation to recap on dec 30 2020 the us cbp issued a withhold release order wro against sdp s production process based on information indicating that it had gone against all 11 of the international labour organisation s ilo forced labour indicators the issuance of the wro against sdp came on the heels of fgv sept 30 2020 which also involved labour practices both the companies have committed to taking all the necessary steps in order to get the wro lifted in march sdp established an expert stakeholder human rights assessment commission and appointed impactt ltd as a third party assessor to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the group s labour practices across its malaysian operations meanwhile in november fgv appointed independent auditing firm elevate to assess the group s operations against the 11 ilo indicators of forced labour as advised by the cbp at the same time both companies have invested heavily to salvage their image worldwide by upgrading workers facilities the malaysian government has also initiated legal action against the eu members following their anti palm oil measures the ministry of plantation industries and commodities mpic with the cooperation of the attorney general s chambers and the international trade and industry ministry filed a request for consultations under the world trade organisation s dispute settlement mechanism malaysia is not alone in this fight it has joined hands with indonesia the world s largest palm oil producer to counter the international discrimination against the edible oil together they account for 85 per cent of global palm oil production mpic minister datuk zuraida kamaruddin said that she had engaged with a think tank to prepare her case and will attend a dispute proceeding against the eu s alleged discrimination in early january 2022 in her recent interview with the malaysian palm labour facts which was hosted by the malaysian palm oil council zuraida said she was seeking to build a relationship based on trust and fair trade rather than geo political tensions we will also utilise avenues to exchange unambiguous information with the eu on the sustainability of our palm oil industry these include the asean eu joint working group on palm oil and other collaborative projects during the 2022 budget the government announced an allocation of rm20 million for the industry to counter international anti palm activities stockbrokers mixed on sector stockbrokers have mixed recommendations on the sector for 2022 due in part to their house views on the sector s performance and demand supply factors midf research is positive about the sector with a target price of rm3 000 per tonne for cpo it also expects stockpiles to slightly improve to the pre pandemic level but it is concerned that the vegetable oil might be facing lower demand from key importers due to the lower price of soybean oil and higher production cost cgs cimb securities sdn bhd is maintaining its neutral recommendation with cpo prices forecast at rm4 270 rm3 600 rm3 240 per tonne for 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively cpo prices could likely remain high at least for the first three months of 2022 before trending lower when palm oil supply recovers and crushing activities of oilseeds improve the stockbroking house said cgs cimb s top picks are kuala lumpur kepong bhd hap seng plantations holdings bhd and genting plantations bhd meanwhile rhb investment bank bhd is maintaining an underweight call but raised the cpo price assumptions to rm4 000 rm3 700 and rm3 000 per tonne for 2021 2022 and 2023 respectively it believes valuations would be held back by environment social and governance esg concerns resulting in plantation stocks trading significantly below their historical valuations the year 2022 would also see bursa malaysia derivatives continuing with its night trading session for the key palm oil futures contract and other products in order to attract local and foreign market participants what s in store for 2022 the industry would be stepping into 2022 armed with two years of experience operating in the unprecedented pandemic times hence omicron or any other future variant should be manageable as long as they do not impact the arrival of foreign labour it is well understood that covid 19 has severely affected labour supply in the oil palm sector which has greatly impacted production we hope the emergence of the new variant would not cause further delays of the arrival of foreign workers the malaysian palm oil board director general datuk dr ahmad parveez ghulam kadir told bernama as the production is set to increase cpo prices in general would likely average lower according to ahmad parveez details on the 2022 outlook would be discussed during the palm oil economic review and outlook seminar 2022 which is to be held on jan 13 2022 he however opined that the omicron threat would not significantly affect demand which would remain strong even if the variant were to cause another wave on other developments the government has also revealed that it would scale up the use of palm oil based biodiesel under the 12th malaysia plan from the current b7 and b10 biodiesel to b15 and b20 the government plans to fully move on to the use of b30 biodiesel by 2025 bernama

chef tsuyoshi hachisuka grills eel at his restaurant in hamamatsu shizuoka prefecture in april afp photo by mathias cena agence france presse hamamatsu japan tsuyoshi hachisuka gently places skewered eel on a grill preparing a much loved japanese delicacy that is now so endangered it commands eyewatering prices and the attention of international traffickers consumed worldwide eel is particularly

overfishing mean supplies have dwindled dramatically in recent decades while the writhing snake like creature is repellent to some it is a mainstay of japanese cuisine and since the 17th century has

used the same basting sauce base for four decades i adjust it as i go it mustn t be too sweet or too salty he told afp but while his recipe has stayed the same his product has not the annual catch in japan of young known as glass eels has fallen to 10 per cent of 1960 levels that has driven prices sky high even in a country that has battled for years to achieve inflation a dish of unaju is today nearly three times more expensive than when i started said hachisuka there are 19 species and subspecies of eel many of them now threatened in 2014 the japanese eel was listed as endangered by the international union for conservation of nature which cited factors including habitat loss overfishing pollution and migration barriers enduring mysteries protecting the animal is complicated by their complex life cycle which unfolds over a vast area and the many unknowns about how they reproduce the mystery of eel reproduction has fascinated scientists for thousands of years with even ancient greek philosopher and naturalist aristotle puzzling over it he theorised eels must simply emerge spontaneously in mud because he could find no traces of their larvae we think that the eel emerged approximately 60 million years ago near the island of borneo explains mari kuroki assistant professor at tokyo university s aquatic biosciences department as continental drift affected marine currents and the distance grew between the areas where eels lived and laid eggs the creature has adapted she told afp it is now present in every ocean except the antarctic but despite their ubiquity it wasn t until the early 20th century that european scientists discovered that european and american eels are born somewhere in the sargasso sea near cuba with their larvae then carried by currents to different regions and the precise location of eel spawning sites remained an enigma until 2009 when a scientific mission pinpointed the breeding grounds of the japanese eel west of the mariana islands some 2 000 3 000 kilometres from japan s coasts evidence suggests the species mates and lays its eggs at the spot but the process has still never been observed once they hatch into larvae the creatures drift towards coastlines growing on the way into glass eels they swim into estuaries and rivers in japan taiwan china and south korea and live in freshwater habitats for between five and 15 years before swimming back out to sea to spawn and then die white gold eels are vulnerable to a wide range of catastrophic human behaviours and climate change linked phenomenon like el nino have affected the ocean currents that carry them as well as their spawning sites the deterioration of their freshwater habitats including by river development also plays a significant role along with pollution dams can block migratory routes and eels are sometimes caught in hydroelectric turbines a leading cause of death for the species since 2012 scientists in the four territories where the japanese eel is most commonly found have worked together on conservation setting aquaculture quotas in 2015 but restrictions including an eu ban on exports in 2010 have created a flourishing black market with poaching and international trafficking over 99 per cent of the supply in japan consists of caught or imported glass eels raised to maturity on farms in 2020 declared catches and legal imports of glass eels for farms in japan amounted to 14 tons according to japan s fisheries agency jfa but the country s farms reported buying over 20 tonnes of glass eels a gap indicating the role of illicit trade environmental group wwf japan believes the true scale of the problem is even larger estimating between 40 to 60 per cent of eels raised in japan come from illegal sources in hamamatsu the brackish waters of lake hamana near the sea are an ideal habitat for eels and the hunt for the creatures takes place there each year between december and april under a cloak of secrecy the eel is the most valuable fish in this lake says kunihikokako a 66 year old fisherman holding a long net with a conical end that he uses for his catch so we have to be careful the creature is so precious it is sometimes dubbed white gold with prices fluctuating wildly depending on the catch size farms paid an average of 1 32 million yen 11 680 at today s rates in 2020 for a kilo of glass eel according to the jfa after a record of 2 99 million yen in 2018 appreciate each eel with stocks falling and prices rising eel consumption in japan has changed and the dish is now seen as a treat rather than a regular meal a record 160 000 tons was consumed across the country in 2000 but that figure has fallen by two thirds in the past all the meals sold at grill places and local hotel restaurants had eel in them says senichiro kamo a seafood wholesaler on lake hamana it was also in the bento boxes sold at stations but since the price has tripled that s no longer possible adds kamo half of whose sales are of eel eels of all types are notoriously resistant to breeding in captivity and since the 1960s japanese researchers have worked to coax them into the mood but without success in 2010 experts bred two consecutive generations of japanese eels in a lab for the first time a major advance but these artificial eels aren t likely to hit the market anytime soon says ryusukesudo of the japan fisheries research and education agency in the izu region southwest of tokyo the biggest problem now is that the method is very expensive he told afp each eel requires individual human intervention the reproduction rate is low and creatures produced in captivity also grow slower than their wild counterparts he said researcher kuroki believes the best way to protect the species is to make consumers more mindful we need to appreciate each eel we eat she said keeping in mind that this is a precious natural resource

when thinking about next year s federal election australians should consider the incalculable damage scott morrison has done to australian democracy during his first full term as elected prime minister writes george grundy as parliament closes out for 2021 the morrison government is taking steps to set the agenda for next year s federal election scott morrison will be hoping for no major bushfires this summer and a return to pre covid normality so the battle can be fought around perceived lnp strengths such as the economy national security and culture war issues like social media trolling to that end morrison continues to champion the reopening of international borders and an end to lockdowns and travel restrictions irrespective of health outcomes and peter dutton plays to type by irresponsibly scaring everybody with talk of a war with china australians do not benefit from a war with china recent rhetoric on war is more about supporting the highly lucrative defence industry as it is about countering the rise of china writes dr rashad seedeen yet governments can only do so much when it comes to the focus of the electorate if the election is held in may next year as seems likely it will be more than eight years since the coalition took power and history suggests that a national mood for change is difficult to overcome no matter the issues at hand so as the warmth of christmas comes into view australians should consider the breadth of scott morrison s first full term as elected prime minister because beneath the daily headlines there are warning signs that all is not well with australian democracy the decision to be made in 2022 is one of the most consequential in the nation s history first the economy voters most important issue in 2019 s election these are strange times on the surface annual gross domestic product gdp growth of 3 9 looks like success even allowing for a lockdown induced contraction of 1 9 in just the last three months but despite josh frydenberg s repeated promises of a return to surplus the budget remains badly in deficit as has now been the case for a decade and sovereign debt has soared to the stratosphere from roughly 250 billion when kevin rudd left office australia s national debt has ballooned passing 830 billion this august and appearing inevitably on course to reach 1 trillion this fundamental of taking on enormous debt in order to maintain acceptable economic performance should place the coalition s record in perspective just as a man who spends lavishly on a credit card may not actually be rich other economic indicators show near catastrophic underlying change manufacturing as a percentage of gdp has collapsed as has construction investment in social housing is through the floor and as house prices and rents have increased exponentially affordability has cratered household debt is approaching record levels and as ever the poor are suffering the most homelessness crisis turning australia into nomadland the lives of van dwellers as portrayed in the film nomadland provide a reminder of our government s ignorance towards the homelessness crisis funding for social and indigenous housing has been slashed under the lnp government about 600 000 queenslanders now live in poverty and many australian cities are experiencing record homelessness these outcomes are not an accident but the result of deliberate political decisions nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars of national debt taken on and still people can t afford a roof over their head although the unemployment rate is a respectable 5 2 under employment is up hours worked are down the poor are getting poorer the gap between rich and poor wider this is a consistent theme across every level of the morrison government it s in this environment that scott morrison has also squeezed household budgets from the other end quietly cutting 900 items from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and increasing medication costs often for those suffering life threatening diseases such as cancer the national disability insurance scheme ndis and those with disabilities have not escaped the scythe and many families living in the most difficult circumstances imaginable have just had their lives made even harder pensioner poverty in australia is already one of the worst in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd but should morrison win next year the indue card cashless welfare card hugely profitable for its privately owned operator will likely be rolled out to all aged pensioners and recipients of social security meaning 80 of social benefits will be tightly controlled by the government more regulation less freedom tougher lives another term for morrison will mean more cuts to medicare and a government more committed than ever to punching down at the weak vulnerable and poor internationally australia s image has been tarnished by blundering diplomatic belligerence and climate policies that make this nation the world s carbon pariah australia remains the worst co2 emitter per capita on earth among major nations one of the world s largest exporters of coal and natural gas and firmly at the back of the field when it comes to emissions reduction whatever sympathy australia engendered during the 2019 bushfires is gone at this year s united nations climate change conference cop26 morrison delivered his keynote address to a virtually empty room a stunning show of disrespect and irrelevance for one of the world s leading economies after betraying the french and having emmanuel macron publicly call scott morrison a liar australia s relationship with the nation about to take charge of the european union is in tatters and must quickly be repaired given the next round of free trade talks are due in february if as seems likely morrison fails to apologise and offer detente the disastrous mismanagement of the new aukus alliance and ditching of the french submarine deal is likely to significantly hamper australian industries wishing to trade freely with europe meanwhile peter dutton rattles the sabre of war pitting australia against china a nation with an army significantly greater than ours china also happens to be australia s biggest trading partner with a sensitive centrally administered government holding enough economic power to crush australia at a stroke dutton s loose talk is a danger to national security given our current stock of just six submarines pitted against a country believed to have 250 350 ballistic nuclear missiles the eye popping 90 billion submarine deal with the u s is still 20 years away yet dutton continues to recklessly suggest that war with china should not be discounted choosing anzac day of all days to amplify this madness the australian government is playing with fire in the hope of reaping short term electoral benefit by bringing national security to the fore despite these blunders it s the issue of climate change that most often gets australia into world headlines ten months after taking office tony abbott s government became the first on earth to repeal active pricing legislation on carbon emissions since then it s become difficult to track emissions reduction performance given the kind of shonky governmental accounting practices that allow morrison to claim a reduction in emissions because less land is being cleared than originally forecast whatever the true picture it s not good in 2020 coal still accounted for 54 of the nation s electrical generation australia continues to spend more than 10 billion annually on fossil fuel subsidies and was ranked last of 60 countries for climate change policies at cop26 it would be bad enough that australia has a prime minister who has to be dragged kicking and screaming on every little step towards climate action but the coalition isn t just standing in the way of progress it is actively undermining state efforts to reduce emissions this intransigence is made flesh in the form of angus taylor the hysterically titled minister for emissions reduction who appears not to have seen the sign on his office door when he recently waved through woodside s 12 billion scarborough liquefied natural gas project that will release 1 36 billion tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere there are reasons to be optimistic south australia is now regularly generating 100 of its power requirements from wind and solar queensland s renewable sector has trebled in size in four years the u s uk japan and canada have all pledged to slash emissions this decade piling pressure on australia and the private sector appears to be ignoring or outpacing this government with battery and solar panel prices plummeting yet there is much greater reason to be concerned the paris climate target of 1 5 degrees warming appears to be gone neither major political party has committed to anything like the emissions reductions required to avoid what scientists are unanimous in describing as a calamity once in a century heatwaves and floods are becoming commonplace and even the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro says that climate change is behind an 800 increase in bushfires in the past 32 years one in six australian birds are now under threat and it s not unfair to suggest that it is government policy that will kill the great barrier reef scott morrison is a threat to the great barrier reef by failing in climate policy prime minister scott morrison is also failing in protecting the future of the great barrier reef when the sheer scale of this catastrophe to come finally seeps into australian minds we will look back on scott morrison s climate vandalism and judge him one of modern history s great criminals that australia in 2021 with all the overwhelming evidence to hand continues to greenlight massive new fossil fuel projects well it beggars belief the national security moral and even existential implications of climate change dwarf any other threat to this country yet our government focuses its resources on the need to regulate mean tweets much of the government s climate intransigence is because it is so utterly beholden to special interests and big business there has never been a more corrupt australian government than the one headed by scott morrison the list of scandals is exhaustive incredible even transparency international s recent corruption perceptions index suggests australia has significantly declined since 2012 with the corrosive influence of money in politics unchecked and having broken a promise to establish a federal integrity commission there are precious few ways to stem the rorting except voting the coalition out of government this will prove more difficult after the billions lavishly splashed around in coalition held seats but should labor win government and have the courage to establish a powerful and retrospective icac the corruption these last few years may rise to the level of criminal charges for some coalition figures losing the 2022 election carries more than just political consequence killing competition and a federal icac courtesy of the coalition the morrison government is about to pull one of its best ever scams it s not just the corruption that is unseemly morrison and his government have a profoundly uneasy relationship with people who aren t white privileged males just like them scott morrison has a woman problem and just can t seem to find a way to act decently around them australians have reluctantly learned that there is such a thing as training for empathy and may have struggled themselves to feel empathy when discovering that 190 000 of their tax dollars was spent teaching members something that might otherwise be expected to come naturally it didn t seem to work parliament house has become as no less than the new york times described it a young woman was raped in a federal minister s office and the prime minister s staff appear to have backgrounded journalists against her partner before the pm s wife stepped in to remind him that rape is bad sex in the prayer room wanking on ministers desks as the jenkins review confirmed australia s parliament is often a dangerous misogynistic zoo any chief executive officer of a major corporation presiding over a workplace in which one in three staff reported experiencing sexual harassment would be out of a job by sunset yet regarding such reports morrison said i wish i found them more surprising it may be a leap to connect a prime minister who lacks the good grace not to regularly turn his back on women speaking in parliament to a country in which a woman is killed by her partner every week but the prime minister sets the tone scott morrison is responsible for one of the worst workplaces in the country for women and a parliament where incredibly over half of the people working there have experienced bullying sexual harassment or assault alleged rape by cabinet member deflected by coalition government rocked by another horrific scandal the coalition government has again attempted to avoid confronting the issue of an alleged rape in 1988 writes dr jennifer wilson since 2006 australia has dropped from 15th according to the latest global gender gap report from world economic forum to 50th losing six places in the last year alone we re just above the tropical rainforest nation of suriname this is not good enough and morrison appears to lack the character or will to fix it but if anything this sexist shit show is overshadowed by the savagery inflicted on the truly vulnerable with each passing year australia s offshore concentration camp policies have become more squalid and untenable revelations of the conditions on nauru should in any rational world engender prison sentences for those involved in its administration guards trading cigarettes for sexual favours children as young as ten raped guards filming themselves in sexual encounters with detainees then sharing the videos with each other a woman gang raped then doused in petrol and set alight this is a national historic shame peter dutton was the minister responsible for much of the time when this was happening many think him a monster it seems a footnote after such horror but nauru is also now almost unbelievably uneconomic each refugee costs about 4 3 million a year to detain that s 11 780 per person per day it s insane it is hard not to conclude that racism plays a significant role in the government s approach to asylum seekers especially when considering other aspects of race in australia of australia s prison population 29 is indigenous despite aborigines making up just 3 3 of the population fifteen of the 22 deaths in custody between july 2019 and june 2020 were indigenous sadly indigenous mistreatment by police and the justice system isn t something new for australia but it s hard not to spot a pattern especially in the behaviour of peter dutton it was dutton who lied that victorians were afraid to go outside because of african gangs dutton who tried to fast track white south african farmers visa applications saying they need help from a civilised country like ours and it was dutton who notoriously ripped an integrated and adored tamil family from the town of biloela and imprisoned them at a deserted processing centre at which one of the young children nearly died this year vicious virulent cruel racism courtesy of australia s minister for defence and leader of the house scott morrison s right hand man racial inequities are found in nearly every aspect of australian society not least with the covid vaccination rollout last month just 54 5 of aboriginal and torres strait islander people were fully vaccinated compared to 81 1 across the country despite indigenous people being among the first to be eligible for the vaccine australia s distant geography and ocean borders have largely spared us from the ravages of covid experienced in europe and the u s but our relative success has been almost exclusively due to the actions of state premiers rather than scott that s a matter for the states morrison the federal government is clearly responsible for quarantine aged care vaccinations and international borders and it s a tale of failure at every turn nearly two years into the pandemic as the omicron variant causes fresh concern and europe deals with its worst surge in cases scott morrison has yet to build a single dedicated quarantine facility despite overwhelming evidence that hotels are simply not fit for purpose and despite a number of outbreaks coming directly from hotel quarantine breaches kevin rudd asked to save australia from scott morrison after the australian government s botched effort to vaccinate the country business leaders have turned to former pm kevin rudd for help minister for health and aged care greg hunt recently had the chutzpah to boast that australia is one of the most recently vaccinated nations on earth but that s because of a botched federal vaccine rollout earlier this year that we were promised would put us at the front of the queue but wasn t a race and at one point missed it s four million vaccinations target by 3 4 million doses and as with everything under scott morrison it s the poor who have suffered the most with low income earners 2 6 times more likely to die from covid than their wealthier counterparts by may next year some voters may have forgotten about the 655 aged care residents who died from covid in victoria last year and sydneysiders might find someone else to blame for 107 days of lockdown caused in great part by another liberal seemingly ignoring medical advice but covid management and the vaccine rollout has been a debacle richard denniss at the monthly put it succinctly there is competition for the title the australian arts sector has been decimated during covid and was under attack until the very last sitting days of parliament the abc s budget continues to be slashed and chairwoman ita buttrose has accused the government of political interference and intimidation all while murdoch s sky news australia spreads its insidious influence tertiary education has shed 40 000 jobs nearly one in five during the pandemic an unprecedented disaster for learning in this country curiously that s almost exactly the same total number of people employed in coal mining whose jobs are apparently vital to the survival of the nation just ask matt canavan disdain for the arts education social welfare and human rights scapegoats corporate media and corruption these are underlying indicators of the health of a nation s social fabric all have suffered under scott morrison curiously they also fit well with political scientist laurence britt s famous list of 14 characteristics of a fascist nation it s uncomfortable to use the f word but look at the list the 14th fascist characteristic you will note is fraudulent elections when australians go to the polls next year it s unlikely that democratic breakdown will feature in their top ten issues but scott morrison has often barely noticed waged an unprecedented war on the mechanics and institutions of australian democracy in a way that suggests genuine danger for the federation if given another term we ve seen the rise of political prosecutions secret trials where the defendant isn t allowed to see super secret evidence against them and deportation laws allowing the state to use secret evidence people who have lived in this country their whole lives have been deported without notice or explanation we ve witnessed widespread and unnecessary secrecy hiding matters like breaches of ministerial standards and corruption and just this month climate warnings that are of vital and urgent public interest mass surveillance legislation allows the government to hack your computer and online life without a warrant there s a push to make voting harder through identification laws despite the australian electoral commission confirming just 24 prosecutions from 2 102 electors out of 15 million identified as having multiple marks against their names at the last election there s more charities have been relentlessly attacked and stripped of their advocacy rights in a way that has been described as an abandonment of parliamentary debate with the lower house scheduled to sit for just ten days between now and august 2022 and the senate for just five days five days as morrison seeks another term of office the coalition has signalled that it has no new legislative agenda no laws to pass just a will to power there s still more a new law that gives the government the power to detain refugees indefinitely maybe for the rest of their lives a splinter nationalist party somehow able to send all of us political texts on our phones whose leader is permanently banned from facebook for spreading misinformation but has somehow just been appointed to a parliamentary committee looking into online safety and social media the rise of the far right death threats becoming commonplace state premiers not safe in their homes gallows and nooses in the street and hard line fringe mps flirting with the mob defamation trials launched by the powerful against members of the public because of a mean tweet the silencing of dissent this is a five alarm fire for australian democracy a dangerous moment for this nation and what of the character of the individuals legislating this never ending drift to the right we ve seen a former attorney general accused of the anal rape of a teenager complete with an acceptance of 1 million from anonymous backers to fund a defamation trial have the government close ranks around him backbencher andrew laming was accused of a series of scandals and abuse allegations involving women there s george christensen frequenter of a philippines adults entertainment bar and poster of violent gun imagery who nevertheless fancies himself as a moral guardian to protect women s uteruses a member of the nation s government who advocates civil disobedience also there s alan tudge the education minister who stepped down after an accusation of physical abuse we have a senator accused of making dog noises at female speakers and an embarrassment of a deputy prime minister who shall we say often appears tired and emotional it s a rogue s gallery a zoo and at the top of it sits scott morrison a profoundly religious evangelical man who somehow interprets the message of christ in a way that allows him to act with cruelty and basically accept the lack of safety for women in his workplace as de rigueur scott morrison s religious delusions are dangerous our prime minister s religious faith has often come under criticism which seems justified when it s linked to extremism and child abuse australians may forgive morrison membership of his strange extremist ponzi scheme of a church but it remains incredible that a prime minister who has downplayed white supremacy and extremism in australia has nevertheless maintained a close friendship with tim stewart one of the country s most prominent qanon conspiracy theorists q let s not forget believes that the world is run by satan worshipping infant sacrificing blood drinking paedophiles and in america is linked to violent acts like kidnapping and murder the fbi has come close to designating qanon a terrorist group and is conducting threat assessments amid concern about q inspired political extremism take a step back think about this again scott morrison prime minister of australia is friends with someone a hairs breadth from being called a member of a terrorist group this perhaps overshadows a lot of other frankly weird stuff that just hasn t been true of other prime ministers morrison has referred to social media as the work of the devil he believes that god made him pm and that when he puts his hands on people he is passing on some kind of holy spirit one wonders what he is capable of if perceiving that an election loss is also not god s will next year all this corruption all the lies and the cruelty scott morrison is a dreadful christian bringing shame to a noble faith and punishing the poor and the vulnerable the opposite of christianity it s been clear for some time that morrison cares about just one thing winning re election the pm has shown a darker side a mendacious quick temper when under pressure behind in the polls it will be worth watching scott morrison as the thing he desires most of all comes into view it s become popular in america to frame every election as the most important in history this time it s actually true in australia if scott morrison somehow secures another term in office the incalculable damage he has already done to australian democracy may be completed another morrison government will be a catastrophe for this country australia faces an existential election in 2022 australians would do well to dwell on that this christmas season george grundy is an english australian author

in the months since president joe biden warned russia s vladimir putin that he needed to crack down on ransomware gangs in his country there hasn t been a massive attack like the one last may that resulted in gasoline shortages but that s small comfort to ken trzaska trzaska is president of lewis clark community college a small illinois school that canceled classes for days after a ransomware attack last month that knocked critical computer systems offline that first day trzaska said i think all of us were probably up 20 plus hours just moving through the process trying to get our arms around what happened even if the united states isn t currently enduring large scale front page ransomware attacks on par with ones earlier this year that targeted the global meat supply or kept millions of americans from filling their gas tanks the problem hasn t disappeared in fact the attack on trzaska s college was part of a barrage of lower profile episodes that have upended the businesses governments schools and hospitals that were hit get philly local news weather forecasts sports and entertainment stories to your inbox sign up for nbc philadelphia newsletters the college s ordeal reflects the challenges the biden administration faces in stamping out the threat and its uneven progress in doing so since ransomware became an urgent national security problem last spring u s officials have recaptured some ransom payments cracked down on abuses of cryptocurrency and made some arrests spy agencies have launched attacks against ransomware groups and the u s has pushed federal state and local governments as well as private industries to boost protections yet six months after biden s admonitions to putin it s hard to tell whether hackers have eased up because of u s pressure smaller scale attacks continue with ransomware criminals continuing to operate from russia with seeming impunity administration officials have given conflicting assessments about whether russia s behavior has changed since last summer further complicating matters ransomware is no longer at the top of the u s russia agenda with washington focused on dissuading putin from invading ukraine the white house said in a statement that it was determined to fight all ransomware through its various tools but that the government s response depends on the severity of the attack there are some that are law enforcement matters and others that are high impact disruptive ransomware activity posing a direct national security threat that require other measures the white house statement said ransomware attacks in which hackers lock up victims data and demand exorbitant sums to return it surfaced as a national security emergency for the administration after a may attack on colonial pipeline which supplies nearly half the fuel consumed on the east coast the attack prompted the company to halt operations causing gas shortages for days though it resumed service after paying more than 4 million in ransom soon after came an attack on meat processor jbs which paid an 11 million ransom biden met with putin in june in geneva where he suggested critical infrastructure sectors should be off limits for ransomware and said the u s should know in six months to a year whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order he reiterated the message in july days after a major attack on a software company kaseya that affected hundreds of businesses and said he expected russia to take action on cybercriminals when the u s provides enough information to do so since then there have been some notable attacks from groups believed to be based in russia including against sinclair broadcast group and the national rifle association but none of the same consequence or impact of those from last spring or summer one reason may be increased u s government scrutiny or fear of it the biden administration in september sanctioned a russia based virtual currency exchange that officials say helped ransomware gangs launder funds last month the justice department unsealed charges against a suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of u s cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that whole of government effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that that s going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure u s officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly it s unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning it s also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the u s following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any drop off in high profile attacks to u s efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on large scale attacks won t work because it s way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they don t even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since biden s discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say they ve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said there s been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why it s hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginia s legislature the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the school s it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the school s online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if it s going to happen but when it s going to happen in 2019 a ransomware attack wiped out 750 government computers across texas in less than 90 minutes as hospitals local governments agencies and businesses increasingly become the targets of ransomware attacks here s what you should know about the threat ___ suderman reported from richmond virginia associated

when thinking about next year s federal election australians should consider the incalculable damage scott morrison has done to australian democracy during his first full term as elected prime minister writes george grundy as parliament closes out for 2021 the morrison government is taking steps to set the agenda for next year s federal election scott morrison will be hoping for no major bushfires this summer and a return to pre covid normality so the battle can be fought around perceived lnp strengths such as the economy national security and culture war issues like social media trolling to that end morrison continues to champion the reopening of international borders and an end to lockdowns and travel restrictions irrespective of health outcomes and peter dutton plays to type by irresponsibly scaring everybody with talk of a war with china australians do not benefit from a war with china recent rhetoric on war is more about supporting the highly lucrative defence industry as it is about countering the rise of china writes dr rashad seedeen yet governments can only do so much when it comes to the focus of the electorate if the election is held in may next year as seems likely it will be more than eight years since the coalition took power and history suggests that a national mood for change is difficult to overcome no matter the issues at hand so as the warmth of christmas comes into view australians should consider the breadth of scott morrison s first full term as elected prime minister because beneath the daily headlines there are warning signs that all is not well with australian democracy the decision to be made in 2022 is one of the most consequential in the nation s history first the economy voters most important issue in 2019 s election these are strange times on the surface annual gross domestic product gdp growth of 3 9 looks like success even allowing for a lockdown induced contraction of 1 9 in just the last three months but despite josh frydenberg s repeated promises of a return to surplus the budget remains badly in deficit as has now been the case for a decade and sovereign debt has soared to the stratosphere from roughly 250 billion when kevin rudd left office australia s national debt has ballooned passing 830 billion this august and appearing inevitably on course to reach 1 trillion this fundamental of taking on enormous debt in order to maintain acceptable economic performance should place the coalition s record in perspective just as a man who spends lavishly on a credit card may not actually be rich other economic indicators show near catastrophic underlying change manufacturing as a percentage of gdp has collapsed as has construction investment in social housing is through the floor and as house prices and rents have increased exponentially affordability has cratered household debt is approaching record levels and as ever the poor are suffering the most homelessness crisis turning australia into nomadland the lives of van dwellers as portrayed in the film nomadland provide a reminder of our government s ignorance towards the homelessness crisis funding for social and indigenous housing has been slashed under the lnp government about 600 000 queenslanders now live in poverty and many australian cities are experiencing record homelessness these outcomes are not an accident but the result of deliberate political decisions nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars of national debt taken on and still people can t afford a roof over their head although the unemployment rate is a respectable 5 2 under employment is up hours worked are down the poor are getting poorer the gap between rich and poor wider this is a consistent theme across every level of the morrison government it s in this environment that scott morrison has also squeezed household budgets from the other end quietly cutting 900 items from the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and increasing medication costs often for those suffering life threatening diseases such as cancer the national disability insurance scheme ndis and those with disabilities have not escaped the scythe and many families living in the most difficult circumstances imaginable have just had their lives made even harder pensioner poverty in australia is already one of the worst in the organisation for economic co operation and development oecd but should morrison win next year the indue card cashless welfare card hugely profitable for its privately owned operator will likely be rolled out to all aged pensioners and recipients of social security meaning 80 of social benefits will be tightly controlled by the government more regulation less freedom tougher lives another term for morrison will mean more cuts to medicare and a government more committed than ever to punching down at the weak vulnerable and poor internationally australia s image has been tarnished by blundering diplomatic belligerence and climate policies that make this nation the world s carbon pariah australia remains the worst co2 emitter per capita on earth among major nations one of the world s largest exporters of coal and natural gas and firmly at the back of the field when it comes to emissions reduction whatever sympathy australia engendered during the 2019 bushfires is gone at this year s united nations climate change conference cop26 morrison delivered his keynote address to a virtually empty room a stunning show of disrespect and irrelevance for one of the world s leading economies after betraying the french and having emmanuel macron publicly call scott morrison a liar australia s relationship with the nation about to take charge of the european union is in tatters and must quickly be repaired given the next round of free trade talks are due in february if as seems likely morrison fails to apologise and offer detente the disastrous mismanagement of the new aukus alliance and ditching of the french submarine deal is likely to significantly hamper australian industries wishing to trade freely with europe meanwhile peter dutton rattles the sabre of war pitting australia against china a nation with an army significantly greater than ours china also happens to be australia s biggest trading partner with a sensitive centrally administered government holding enough economic power to crush australia at a stroke dutton s loose talk is a danger to national security given our current stock of just six submarines pitted against a country believed to have 250 350 ballistic nuclear missiles the eye popping 90 billion submarine deal with the u s is still 20 years away yet dutton continues to recklessly suggest that war with china should not be discounted choosing anzac day of all days to amplify this madness the australian government is playing with fire in the hope of reaping short term electoral benefit by bringing national security to the fore despite these blunders it s the issue of climate change that most often gets australia into world headlines ten months after taking office tony abbott s government became the first on earth to repeal active pricing legislation on carbon emissions since then it s become difficult to track emissions reduction performance given the kind of shonky governmental accounting practices that allow morrison to claim a reduction in emissions because less land is being cleared than originally forecast whatever the true picture it s not good in 2020 coal still accounted for 54 of the nation s electrical generation australia continues to spend more than 10 billion annually on fossil fuel subsidies and was ranked last of 60 countries for climate change policies at cop26 it would be bad enough that australia has a prime minister who has to be dragged kicking and screaming on every little step towards climate action but the coalition isn t just standing in the way of progress it is actively undermining state efforts to reduce emissions this intransigence is made flesh in the form of angus taylor the hysterically titled minister for emissions reduction who appears not to have seen the sign on his office door when he recently waved through woodside s 12 billion scarborough liquefied natural gas project that will release 1 36 billion tonnes of co2 into the atmosphere there are reasons to be optimistic south australia is now regularly generating 100 of its power requirements from wind and solar queensland s renewable sector has trebled in size in four years the u s uk japan and canada have all pledged to slash emissions this decade piling pressure on australia and the private sector appears to be ignoring or outpacing this government with battery and solar panel prices plummeting yet there is much greater reason to be concerned the paris climate target of 1 5 degrees warming appears to be gone neither major political party has committed to anything like the emissions reductions required to avoid what scientists are unanimous in describing as a calamity once in a century heatwaves and floods are becoming commonplace and even the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation csiro says that climate change is behind an 800 increase in bushfires in the past 32 years one in six australian birds are now under threat and it s not unfair to suggest that it is government policy that will kill the great barrier reef scott morrison is a threat to the great barrier reef by failing in climate policy prime minister scott morrison is also failing in protecting the future of the great barrier reef when the sheer scale of this catastrophe to come finally seeps into australian minds we will look back on scott morrison s climate vandalism and judge him one of modern history s great criminals that australia in 2021 with all the overwhelming evidence to hand continues to greenlight massive new fossil fuel projects well it beggars belief the national security moral and even existential implications of climate change dwarf any other threat to this country yet our government focuses its resources on the need to regulate mean tweets much of the government s climate intransigence is because it is so utterly beholden to special interests and big business there has never been a more corrupt australian government than the one headed by scott morrison the list of scandals is exhaustive incredible even transparency international s recent corruption perceptions index suggests australia has significantly declined since 2012 with the corrosive influence of money in politics unchecked and having broken a promise to establish a federal integrity commission there are precious few ways to stem the rorting except voting the coalition out of government this will prove more difficult after the billions lavishly splashed around in coalition held seats but should labor win government and have the courage to establish a powerful and retrospective icac the corruption these last few years may rise to the level of criminal charges for some coalition figures losing the 2022 election carries more than just political consequence killing competition and a federal icac courtesy of the coalition the morrison government is about to pull one of its best ever scams it s not just the corruption that is unseemly morrison and his government have a profoundly

government s approach to asylum seekers especially when considering other aspects of race in australia of australia s prison population 29 is indigenous despite aborigines making up just 3 3 of the population fifteen of the 22 deaths in custody between july 2019 and june 2020 were indigenous sadly indigenous mistreatment by police and the justice system isn t something new for australia but it s hard not to spot a pattern especially in the behaviour of peter dutton it was dutton who lied that victorians were afraid to go outside because of african gangs dutton who tried to fast track white south african farmers visa applications saying they need help from a civilised country like ours and it was dutton who notoriously ripped an integrated and adored tamil family from the town of biloela and imprisoned them at a deserted processing centre at which one of the young children nearly died this year vicious virulent cruel racism courtesy of australia s minister for defence and leader of the house scott morrison s right hand man racial inequities are found in nearly every aspect of australian society not least with the covid vaccination rollout last month just 54 5 of aboriginal and torres strait islander people were fully vaccinated compared to 81 1 across the country despite indigenous people being among the first to be eligible for the vaccine australia s distant geography and ocean borders have largely spared us from the ravages of covid experienced in europe and the u s but our relative success has been almost exclusively due to the actions of state premiers rather than scott that s a matter for the states morrison the federal government is clearly responsible for quarantine aged care vaccinations and international borders and it s a tale of failure at every turn nearly two years into the pandemic as the omicron variant causes fresh concern and europe deals with its worst surge in cases scott morrison has yet to build a single dedicated quarantine facility despite overwhelming evidence that hotels are simply not fit for purpose and despite a number of outbreaks coming directly from hotel quarantine breaches kevin rudd asked to save australia from scott morrison after the australian government s botched effort to vaccinate the country business leaders have turned to former pm kevin rudd for help minister for health and aged care greg hunt recently had the chutzpah to boast that australia is one of the most recently vaccinated nations on earth but that s because of a botched federal vaccine rollout earlier this year that we were promised would put us at the front of the queue but wasn t a race and at one point missed it s four million vaccinations target by 3 4 million doses and as with everything under scott morrison it s the poor who have suffered the most with low income earners 2 6 times more likely to die from covid than their wealthier counterparts by may next year some voters may have forgotten about the 655 aged care residents who died from covid in victoria last year and sydneysiders might find someone else to blame for 107 days of lockdown caused in great part by another liberal seemingly ignoring medical advice but covid management and the vaccine rollout has been a debacle richard denniss at the monthly put it succinctly there is competition for the title the australian arts sector has been decimated during covid and was under attack until the very last sitting days of parliament the abc s budget continues to be slashed and chairwoman ita buttrose has accused the government of political interference and intimidation all while murdoch s sky news australia spreads its insidious influence tertiary education has shed 40 000 jobs nearly one in five during the pandemic an unprecedented disaster for learning in this country curiously that s almost exactly the same total number of people employed in coal mining whose jobs are apparently vital to the survival of the nation just ask matt canavan disdain for the arts education social welfare and human rights scapegoats corporate media and corruption these are underlying indicators of the health of a nation s social fabric all have suffered under scott morrison curiously they also fit well with political scientist laurence britt s famous list of 14 characteristics of a fascist nation it s uncomfortable to use the f word but look at the list the 14th fascist characteristic you will note is fraudulent elections when australians go to the polls next year it s unlikely that democratic breakdown will feature in their top ten issues but scott morrison has often barely noticed waged an unprecedented war on the mechanics and institutions of australian democracy in a way that suggests genuine danger for the federation if given another term we ve seen the rise of political prosecutions secret trials where the defendant isn t allowed to see super secret evidence against them and deportation laws allowing the state to use secret evidence people who have lived in this country their whole lives have been deported without notice or explanation we ve witnessed widespread and unnecessary secrecy hiding matters like breaches of ministerial standards and corruption and just this month climate warnings that are of vital and urgent public interest mass surveillance legislation allows the government to hack your computer and online life without a warrant there s a push to make voting harder through identification laws despite the australian electoral commission confirming just 24 prosecutions from 2 102 electors out of 15 million identified as having multiple marks against their names at the last election there s more charities have been relentlessly attacked and stripped of their advocacy rights in a way that has been described as an abandonment of parliamentary debate with the lower house scheduled to sit for just ten days between now and august 2022 and the senate for just five days five days as morrison seeks another term of office the coalition has signalled that it has no new legislative agenda no laws to pass just a will to power there s still more a new law that gives the government the power to detain refugees indefinitely maybe for the rest of their lives a splinter nationalist party somehow able to send all of us political texts on our phones whose leader is permanently banned from facebook for spreading misinformation but has somehow just been appointed to a parliamentary committee looking into online safety and social media the rise of the far right death threats becoming commonplace state premiers not safe in their homes gallows and nooses in the street and hard line fringe mps flirting with the mob defamation trials launched by the powerful against members of the public because of a mean tweet the silencing of dissent this is a five alarm fire for australian democracy a dangerous moment for this nation and what of the character of the individuals legislating this never ending drift to the right we ve seen a former attorney general accused of the anal rape of a teenager complete with an acceptance of 1 million from anonymous backers to fund a defamation trial have the government close ranks around him backbencher andrew laming was accused of a series of scandals and abuse allegations involving women there s george christensen frequenter of a philippines adults entertainment bar and poster of violent gun imagery who nevertheless fancies himself as a moral guardian to protect women s uteruses a member of the nation s government who advocates civil disobedience also there s alan tudge the education minister who stepped down after an accusation of physical abuse we have a senator accused of making dog noises at female speakers and an embarrassment of a deputy prime minister who shall we say often appears tired and emotional it s a rogue s gallery a zoo and at the top of it sits scott morrison a profoundly religious evangelical man who somehow interprets the message of christ in a way that allows him to act with cruelty and basically accept the lack of safety for women in his workplace as de rigueur scott morrison s religious delusions are dangerous our prime minister s religious faith has often come under criticism which seems justified when it s linked to extremism and child abuse australians may forgive morrison membership of his strange extremist ponzi scheme of a church but it remains incredible that a prime minister who has downplayed white supremacy and extremism in australia has nevertheless maintained a close friendship with tim stewart one of the country s most prominent qanon conspiracy theorists q let s not forget believes that the world is run by satan worshipping infant sacrificing blood drinking paedophiles and in america is linked to violent acts like kidnapping and murder the fbi has come close to designating qanon a terrorist group and is conducting threat assessments amid concern about q inspired political extremism take a step back think about this again scott morrison prime minister of australia is friends with someone a hairs breadth from being called a member of a terrorist group this perhaps overshadows a lot of other frankly weird stuff that just hasn t been true of other prime ministers morrison has referred to social media as the work of the devil he believes that god made him pm and that when he puts his hands on people he is passing on some kind of holy spirit one wonders what he is capable of if perceiving that an election loss is also not god s will next year all this corruption all the lies and the cruelty scott morrison is a dreadful christian bringing shame to a noble faith and punishing the poor and the vulnerable the opposite of christianity it s been clear for some time that morrison cares about just one thing winning re election the pm has shown a darker side a mendacious quick temper when under pressure behind in the polls it will be worth watching scott morrison as the thing he desires most of all comes into view it s become popular in america to frame every election as the most important in history this time it s actually true in australia if scott morrison somehow secures another term in office the incalculable damage he has already done to australian democracy may be completed another morrison government will be a catastrophe for this country australia faces an existential election in 2022 australians would do well to dwell on that this christmas season george grundy is an english australian author

menafn gulf times just over a decade ago i predicted the arrival of water as an asset class i foresaw a massive expansion of investment in the water sector including the production of fresh clean water from other sources desalination purification storage shipping and transportation of water this would result in a globally integrated market for fresh water within 25 to 30 years once the spot markets for water are integrated futures markets and other derivative water based financial instruments puts calls swaps both exchange traded and otc will follow there will be different grades and types of fresh water just the way we have light sweet and heavy sour crude oil today in fact i believed that water would eventually be the single most important physical commodity based asset class dwarfing oil copper agricultural commodities and precious metals ten years later the future is now though not quite what i expected in december 2020 the chicago mercantile exchange group created the first futures market in water cash settled water futures with a maximum contract period of two years are now traded on the cme globex electronic trading system i view this development as somewhat premature for futures markets and markets for other derivatives like put and call options to function properly the underlying spot market in this case the spot market for physical water or water rights should be liquid and transparent cme group s futures market is based on the nasdaq veles california water index which tracks the cash price of physical water rights in california based on transactions in surface water and in four groundwater markets because the local and regional water supplies often are not connected let alone fully integrated the spot market underlying the futures market is too segmented it does not represent a single homogeneous commodity or asset today s spot markets for water and water rights thus are too illiquid and non transparent to support an economically and socially useful futures market but there is hope the regional and global integration of physical water supplies and the associated spot markets for water and water rights is making spectacular progress two ongoing developments stand out one is project greenland created and sponsored by thomas schumann capital in partnership with north atlantic research and survey ltd under its iceberg management and water extraction program suitable free floating north atlantic icebergs weighing 1 2 1 4 million tonnes are towed to an operational location in scotland where the ice and water are prepared for international transportation the target markets are in the water deprived middle east and north africa the project is scalable and relies on established technologies and infrastructures being deployed in an innovative and disruptive manner given time additional technological advances and proper spot water pricing icebergs from antarctica also could become viable sources of fresh water a second fascinating entrant to the global water markets is skyh2o s atmospheric water generation awg system a proprietary technology that extracts clean fresh water from the atmosphere the business model here is flexible and scalable because awg capacity can be deployed in a distributed manner to reach the ultimate customers be they governments households or industrial commercial and agricultural users its cost effectiveness relative to alternatives like desalination and distillation depends on atmospheric humidity and the price of energy in the proximity of the customers the future of water as a significant asset class depends on the willingness of governments and ultimately of society at large to price water at its long run social marginal cost as a scarce renewable resource including the cost of addressing the negative environmental externalities associated with its production and distribution globally over 70 of fresh water is used in agriculture and most of this usage is either free or heavily subsidised households in many countries also pay but a small fraction of the long run social marginal cost of the water they use i hope and expect that both these anomalies will soon end there is growing recognition of deepening freshwater scarcity crises around the world as well as a greater willingness on the part of policymakers to price negative environmental externalities appropriately to recognise water as a scarce renewable resource a tradable commodity and a marketable asset is not to diminish its unique significance as a good that is essential to life and viewed by many as a gift from god when socially efficient water pricing creates economic hardship an appropriate fiscal response through targeted income support is required if this fails perhaps because the state cannot identify who is adversely affected by proper water pricing a two tier tariff may be required while a social subsistence level of water should be provided for free or at a heavily subsidised price all additional water usage could be priced at its full long run social marginal cost to preserve the right incentives water is indeed becoming an asset class

inflation skyrockets as trucks slow down clifford bennett chief economist at acy securities clifford bennett chief economist at acy securities 13 12 2021 02 00 pm stocks inflation in the usa is at 6 8 gosh that is a disaster that is already here it is the case that we warned inflation was not transitory and would become a major problem in june when absolutely every investment bank and economists was sure it was transitory part of the justification was because the fed said so that is the only reason the rba said it too why do we pay for a research department at the rba now many of those investment banks are saying exactly what we said all along but they still do not understand the process as we have outlined here numerous times not only did we tell you inflation was here to stay and would get much worse but we have maintained an explanation made well in advance of these figures as to what was exactly happening put simply price gouging as a function of the re established freedom of pricing not seen since before globalisation us consumer sentiment continues to languish at truly uninspiring levels low confidence high inflation does not a pretty picture make add what all around the world diesel trucks everywhere are keeping pollution down with a process that requires the addition of a product called adblue there is a lot of noise around this at the moment and while it may be challenging to sort the facts from the conjuring it is clear there is a significant problem ahead reports that china has banned the export of this product essential for diesel trucks to operate highlights the depth of the situation if it is not available some say australia could run out as soon as mid january other countries are scrambling to find supplies as the trucks will default to crawl speeds of 5km to 20km per hour then either a workaround has to be devised or diesel pollution allowed to erupt globally overnight in case you are unaware diesel fumes are highly carcinogenic and this is why cities like london have banned diesel vehicles if you were sold the green value of diesel think again while it is highly unlikely our trucks will stop operating there is risk of a workaround slow down as trucks are taken off the roads temporarily assuming adblue actually runs out or begins to be rationed despite being a low level of probability should it eventuate a further global slow down in ground transport is something that could severely impact stock market sentiment could a reverse pandemic of adblue be upon us us inflation leaps and bounds annual inflation reached 6 8 in november and is likely to keep going remember when all the banks were already surprised and told you 5 4 was definitely the top us consumer sentiment doldrums these are very poor numbers indeed again highlighting the disparity between wall street and main street mood levels new zealand services sector remains in contraction nz is headed in one direction fast and these is no sign of a turnaround

via international man the fundamental consequence of 30 years of fed fueled financial asset inflation is that the prices of stocks and bonds have way overshot the mark that s why what lies ahead is a long stretch of losses and investor disappointment as the fat years give way to the lean these will hit hard the bullish investor herd and aggressive buyers of calls who can t imagine any other state of play they will be shocked to learn but only after it is way too late that the only money to be made during the decades ahead is on the short side of the market by buying puts on any of the big averages the fangman s p 500 nasdaq 100 the dow and any number of broad based etfs the reason is straightforward the sluggish debt ridden main street economy has been over capitalized and it will take years for company profits and incomes being generated to catch up to currently bloated asset values accordingly even as operating profits struggle to grow valuation multiples will contract for years to come owing to steadily rising and normalizing interest rates we can benchmark this impending grand reversal on wall street by reaching back to a cycle that began in mid 1987 that s when alan greenspan took the helm at the fed and promptly inaugurated the present era of financial repression and stock market coddling that he was pleased to call the wealth effects policy at the time the trailing p e multiple on the s p 500 was about 12x earnings a valuation level that reflected a main street economy and wall street financial markets that were each reasonably healthy the us gdp in q2 1987 stood at 4 8 trillion and the total stock market was valued at 3 0 trillion as measured by the wilshire 5000 back then wall street stocks were stably capitalized at 62 of main street gdp over the next 34 years a vast unsustainable gulf opened up between the main street economy and the wall street capitalization of publicly traded stocks during that three decade period the wilshire 5000 market cap rose by 1 440 to 46 3 trillion that s nearly four times the 375 gain in nominal gdp to 22 7 trillion accordingly the stock market which was barely three fifths of gdp on greenspan s arrival at the fed now stands at an off the charts 204 of gdp if we assume for the moment that the 1987 stock market capitalization rate against national income gdp was roughly correct that would mean that the wilshire 5000 should be worth 14 trillion today not 46 trillion hence the 32 trillion of excess stock market valuation hangs over the financial system like a sword of damocles we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us in fact we believe that the gulf between gdp and market cap has been growing wider and more dangerous since the fed sped up money printing after the lehman meltdown to wit since the pre crisis peak in october 2007 the market cap of the wilshire 5000 is up by nearly 32 trillion while the national income to support it gdp is higher by only 8 trillion the stock market s capitalization should be falling not soaring into the nose bleed section of history after all since the financial crisis and great recession the capacity of the us economy to generate growth and rising profits has been sharply diminished the real gdp growth rate since the pre crisis peak in q4 2007 for instance is just 1 5 per annum which is less than half its historical trend rate of growth back in october 2007 the stock market s capitalization was 106 of gdp and in just 14 years it has soared to the aforementioned 204 so even as the growth rate of the us economy has been cut in half stock market capitalization has doubled given that the stock market has gotten way way ahead of the economy the longer range implication is a long spell during which financial asset prices will stagnate or even fall until they eventually recover the healthy relationship to national income looking at this from a different angle the current 46 trillion market cap of the wilshire 5000 would not return to 62 of gdp until us gdp reaches 75 trillion at an average of 3 3 per annum increase in nominal gdp since q4 2007 it would take 38 years to get there that s right the massively over valued stock market is currently capitalizing an economy that might exist by the year 2060 if all goes well editor s note did you know that that united states government has unleashed the most dangerous experiment in its entire history in fact what s been unleashed is trillions of dollars of stimulus with no end in sight when any government goes on an uncontrollable money printing spree it impacts everyone that s precisely why ny times best selling author doug casey just released this urgent new video on the biggest imminent threat and what you can do about it click here to watch it now

the clae is looking for several thousands of works at any one time some come with extensive documentation of their journeys while others have little more than the title and the name of the artist to go on the clae s latest success story is illustrative of some of the obstacles to restitution efforts that have persisted since 1998 earlier this year it was announced that an important lost work of the polish avant garde had been recovered a 12 minute experimental futurist film titled europa created by the artist couple stefan and franciszka themerson in warsaw in 1931 32 the polish jewish couple both died in 1988 believing that europa was lost for ever they had deposited it along with four other works in a film lab in paris before enlisting to fight alongside the allies during the war when they returned the lab s owner informed them that the five works had been seized by the nazis and probably destroyed one film later surfaced in the soviet union but the others remained missing until two years ago when the themersons niece jasia reichardt received a tip off from the polish government s pilecki institute a researcher had found a reference to europa in an index in a printed catalogue indicating that it was held in the bundesarchiv in berlin the clae was drafted in beginning a correspondence with the bundesarchiv establishing exactly what the film in its collection was how it had got there and what to do about it it took extensive research to confirm that the copy of europa in the bundesarchiv was indeed the cellulose nitrate version deposited in the lab in paris including a lengthy back and forth with the archives who did not have a record of it in their online database despite this anne webber of the clae explains anything that is in a public collection in germany that could be problematic is supposed to be recorded and listed on a government website and yet there are still thousands of looted works of art not just in germany but also elsewhere only a fraction of which have been published europa was not one of them the bundesarchiv agreed to return europa to the themerson estate and the family donated the original copy to the british film institute in london a happy if belated ending then but things aren t always so easy one problem as webber tells me is the inadequacy or more frequently total absence of national claims processes for heirs seeking the return of works that have been identified in public collections since washington only five countries including the uk have set up such processes many more including poland spain and switzerland have not the kunstmuseum bern recently decided to return a number of works with murky provenance from its controversial gurlitt bequest but this was entirely at the swiss museum s discretion there is also the issue of nazi confiscated material that appears in private collections in any claim as webber explains whether an artwork is returned depends on the accident of where a looted work of art is found the big auction houses such as christie s and sotheby s are pretty good on this with dedicated restitution departments that research the provenance of works before consignment this isn t necessarily bad for business witness for example the deal brokered by christie s new york of a van gogh watercolour which sold last month for 35 9 million a record for a watercolour by the artist the proceeds were split by the estate of its most recent owner and the two jewish families who had owned the work before it was looted
coronavirus testing was a breeze when j d schroeder traveled to abu dhabi and mexico this fall not so much at home in pennsylvania when he felt sick wednesday and found out he had been exposed the mechanical engineer started looking for an over the counter rapid test because the earliest antigen test appointment he could find in his pittsburgh area community was almost a week away rite aid would only let him order online the closest cvs pharmacies were all out of stock he nabbed the last box at a walgreen s which came back positive when he traveled to the united arab emirates for work last month he paid roughly 13 for lab tests and got results within two hours a hotel in mexico where he vacationed over thanksgiving had ample rapid testing kits for guests i m 31 and i m pretty tech savvy i can t imagine someone who doesn t have access to a computer or isn t comfortable searching different places to figure this stuff out because it can be confusing said schroeder who is now quarantining at home easy access to coronavirus tests both rapid at home kits and pcr tests analyzed in labs is uneven across the united states as the nation faces the prospect of explosive outbreaks linked to holiday travel and the highly transmissible omicron variant connected to sharp surges in cases globally government officials and public health experts have urged americans to get tested before they attend big events like holiday parties and gather for christmas it s a way to break chains of transmission by nipping outbreaks at the bud especially in places declining to reinstate mask mandates or social distancing measures but some americans trying to be good pandemic citizens are having a hard time finding tests some are turning to facebook or group chats for leads on which stores still have rapid tests in stock some are waiting in their cars for hours for pcr tests new york city again emerging as an epicenter with infections skyrocketing announced plans thursday to distribute 500 000 at home tests and expand testing sites as residents report waiting in line for hours to get tested others may decide the hunt is not worth the hassle because the testing system is decentralized and spread out across public and private labs clinics and providers there s no clear systemic data on the availability of testing but health officials and experts say capacity is a problem as demand surges daily testing is averaging above 1 5 million a day for the first time since october according to the johns hopkins university tracking the vast majority of states and counties report nearly all people tested in their community are still receiving results within three days according to federal data but that data doesn t capture those who attempted to find tests and gave up challenges accessing testing are not insurmountable and americans can generally find a rapid or pcr test combing through various public and private institutions offering them public health experts warn each hurdle from the price tag of a rapid test to a several day wait for a pcr test makes it harder to battle a winter surge a person with the sniffles who forgoes a rapid test because it s too expensive could end up spreading to others at a holiday party a college student who tried to find a kit at three pharmacies before giving up could end up infecting a grandmother with a weak immune system at christmas testing shouldn t be just the gold ring at the end of an obstacle course said adriane casalotti chief of public and government affairs at the national association of county and city health officials it should be easily accessible it should be something that doesn t burden or take too much out of your day because that s the only way it becomes routine casalotti said testing capacity is under major strain as exposures to positive cases grow schools workplaces and travel destinations require proof of negative test results and government agencies recommend testing before holiday gatherings local public health officials often have to decide whether to use their limited staff and resources on shoring up vaccine sites or testing sites she said the biden administration has taken steps to increase the availability of rapid testing including streamlining the review process to authorize kits and ensuring supply of about 200 million for december but critics say the u s has still failed to make tests as readily accessible as they are in other countries such as the united kingdom and singapore president joe biden also moved to require insurers reimburse rapid test kit purchases which typically run about 25 for two tests but it will not take effect until after the holidays and places the burden on the consumer white house press secretary jen psaki dismissed a question about sending free testing kits to households as costly earlier this month although several states are already doing so colorado has distributed nearly 1 3 million free rapid tests to about 180 000 residents this year making them widely available in late september residents can place an order online for up to four tests twice a week justin mccammon a 36 year old software engineer in the boulder colo area already made rapid tests a staple of pandemic life since he and his wife started buying them at walmart in august and using them weekly after sending their toddler to day care when colorado started free shipments he would request them weekly online to save money mccammon and his wife used rapid tests after attending concerts in october his wife used one after returning from a trip to san francisco over thanksgiving when he started feeling cold like symptoms this week he quickly got negative test results using the rapid kits they have even more on hand for when his relatives start flying in for christmas over the weekend it s just part of our routine and it s just what we do and it gives us a little bit of peace of mind mccammon said in a phone interview while in his car undergoing a pcr test to confirm the results especially after a year plus of having so much anxiety around everything covid related and the ebbs and flows and the waves and any little sniffle you get making you wonder oh my god is this it free test giveaways have not been a panacea for testing problems new hampshire republican gov chris sununu touted his administration s efforts to make rapid tests available for online order in late november as his state battles one of the nation s worst coronavirus surges but the supply ran out within 24 hours state health officials did not immediately return requests for comment on whether they would offer more customers are instead turning to retail stores where kits sell out quickly after arriving and access is spotty after unsuccessfully trying three pharmacies in west lebanon n h kathy brice found a flowflex antigen home test on display near the pharmacy section of a cvs about a 10 minute drive north in hanover brice 72 wanted the negative test result before visiting her 4 year old granddaughter who is too young to be vaccinated i ve taken all the boosters all the shots but i traveled to the virgin islands for the birth of my granddaughter and then naples to see friends said brice who lives just over the border in vermont one of the cvs stores where brice struck out in the morning received a new shipment later in the day they were kept out of view by the cash register and limited to one per customer rachael ringenberg of bridgewater vt left with a box in hand after asking the cashier if they had any in stock she described rapid tests as the ticket to a semi normal life in vermont which has been reeling from a recent surge despite being the most vaccinated and boosted state in the united states i have four kids and it s starting to feel like if you have the test then you can do stuff said ringenberg 37 people are asking to do it before they meet up i m going to go to a play tonight and they want to see the negative tests before that for the kids because they re not vaccinated yet her children all tested negative in time to marvel at the fake snow and beautiful costumes in an evening performance of the lion the witch and the wardrobe rapid tests are not always accepted as a proof of a negative test result for travel school or events leaving some people jostling to find pcr appointments chris patterson called a local pharmacy in his hudson river valley community and was quoted 150 each for a pcr test after his two daughters developed cold symptoms and couldn t go to school as cases surged in new york the closest site that accepted insurance was 25 miles away at an old drive through bank in a strip mall he waited more than an hour and said staff told him they were surprised by how many people showed up they tested negative and were able to return to school the next day but patterson was surprised at the obstacles along the way and is on guard for insurance denying his claims we are trying to do everything right by getting tested to know we are not spreading the virus and so we can have a normal holiday said patterson 39 we were hoping to have a little more sense of normalcy this year but it just seems fleeting with the uptick in cases and it s a financial burden to get tested so you feel like you are penalized for doing the right thing patterson noted he was fortunate to be in a position to step aside from his finance job for several hours on short notice experts said many people will not go out of their ways to get tested especially if they lack flexibility with their jobs or have child care obligations michael mina chief science officer of emed and a former public health professor at harvard university has criticized the biden administration for not taking more steps to authorize rapid test kits that have been used extensively abroad and expand the nation s supply we are still blind mina said another unfortunate consequence is the people who are most blind are the people who are most at risk who are already disenfranchised and poor and can t take time out of their work schedule to just go and take three hours of their day just because they woke up with a scratchy throat those people are going to wait until they are coughing by that point the virus has already tore through their lungs
question marty would you comment on david stockman s insistence that the fundamental consequence of 30 years of fed fueled financial asset inflation is that the prices of stocks and bonds have way overshot the mark thank you hw answer david stockman was the director of the office of management and budget 1981 1985 under president ronald reagan he is very old school and such a statement in economics is like pretending we are still in the world of horse buggies and you must pull your new fangled car off the road if it frightens the horses the statement presumes everything in the economy is driven exclusively by domestic events it s not his fault they still teach these theories in universities it is all based upon the old world of austrian economics which dates back to when the exchange rate among nations was based solely on the metal content of their coinage at that point in economic history no single nation truly provided the dominant monetary system there were coins that emerged such as the anglo saxon sceats but they did not carry a premium because of their economic power it wasn t until the 8th century that the french developed the silver denier copying the roman silver denarius this became the main coinage of europe but once again it did not carry a premium because of its economic power we find that the english king offa copied the french and created what became known as the english silver penny this really established forex exchange rates based entirely upon the metal content not the military power or dominance of any one nation state by the 13th century this is where we begin to see the dominant gold florin of florence become the more recognized high value denomination that became a recognized monetary unit of europe other nations then began to issue imitations of the gold florin indeed we begin to see other nation states imitate the gold florin copying the design this illustrated that the coin itself became the dominant monetary unit in international commerce they were not counterfeits but imitations we can see that 600 years later england issued a silver florin which represented 24 pence florence achieved its independence in 1250 and began to issue the first gold coin for europe post dark age the gold florin was worth 20 silver grosso so we can see the gradual inflation whereby the 19th century an english florin was 24 pence equivalent in value of the english florin was 10 florins equaled a pound even the hungarian forint was a reference to the gold florin of florence home of the medici bank the german bankers the fuggers emerged as the leading augsburg merchant banker who then provided loans to local rulers secured with the silver produce of their mines eventually by 1525 the joachimsthaler of the kingdom of bohemia was the first thaler ideally with a weight of 31 grams or one troy ounce this too became the standard and other nation states adopted this metal standard issuing one ounce silver coins this became the standard even in spain with the 8 reales which was adopted in america the wealth of spain was consumed by europe but it did not become the dominant currency in america the spanish coinage became dominant and the one ounce silver coin modeled on the thaler 8 reales became the model for the us dollar which was a rejection of the british monetary system the austrian school was based upon gresham s law whereby the debasement of the coinage of henry viii drove the higher silver content coinage out of circulation these ideas were entrenched in a period where there was no dominant financial capital of the world what is missing from this view of money is that of the economic power of the state it is this flaw that has made austrian economics outdated there are imitations of ancient greek and roman coins where the metal content is on par and sometimes even heavier this proves that gold in the form of a roman coin carried a premium to simply raw gold or had that peripheral state issued gold or silver coinage in its own name this is the same human reaction in imitating the gold florin of florence here we have an athenian silver tetradrachm which became a world currency imitated by egypt for external trade when egypt did not issue their own coinage until they were conquered by alexander the great more than 100 years later even the celts of europe imitated the coinage of macedonia what is missing from the entire austrian school is that a currency can emerge to be worth more than its metal content based upon its economic power it was the british pound that emerged as the dominant world currency because of its economic power and imperialism we then find bonds issued by even china in british pounds just as today nations issue debt in us dollars denominations it was britain that stumbled into the same facts which made rome the glorious empire in both cases the lands that they had conquered were able to sell products to the core economy they both spread culture and created an economic empire that benefited all member states today in the realm of paper money fiat is no longer a viable theory japan germany and china all rose from the ashes to become major world economies without gold or tangible resources what has emerged is the value of a currency is based upon the economic productivity of a nation that is what backs a currency nothing else this keynesian view of interest rates and money supply are no longer key factors when the dollar is used around the world and even 70 of the paper dollars circulate outside the usa obvious ancient macedonian coins circulated in celtic europe just as roman gold coins were in asia the rise in the stock market has nothing to do with this nonsense of the fed this statement entirely ignores the fiscal spending that the fed cannot control capital rushes around the world and concentrates at times in a country for a profit when it does it increases the domestic money supply when a foreigner buys stocks bonds or property in your country the roaring twenties took place because of world war i the capital fled europe seeking safe harbor in the usa that increased the dollar and dollar investments the inflows peak with the peak in real estate in 1927 so sorry this idea that the market is up solely because of the creation of money is just absurd the propaganda of the socialists that capitalism was evil following the great depression which they did not understand led to investment concentrating on bonds and equities were speculative evil things of gamblers this led to the take over boom of the 1980s which i was blamed for because i was advising takeover buyers based on these charts that showed the low in the book value of the dow in 1977 yes i was advising several takeover tycoons if you could buy a company sell its assets and triple your money obviously the market was way undervalued following the end of the public wave in 1985 we have to look at the entire world not just isolated domestic policy austrian economics is from an age long gone when forex was based solely upon the metal content there was no major economic power when sir thomas gresham established his

a pandemic in residence essays from a detroit hospital by selina mahmood belt us isbn 978 1948742931 176pp sometimes a pandemic in residence essays from a detroit hospital opens it takes the collapse of a system to see things clearly clarity amid collapse this is the theme that runs through pakistani american doctor selina mahmood s recently published debut collection of essays and it couldn t be timelier the world we live in is the world covid 19 made for us as the biggest human disaster since the last world war as a modern plague that has turned all our lives upside down as a private pain that affects how we feel and touch and breathe but amid its wreckage the problem we face is an old one how to lend words to a change so vast up against a global crisis it s fitting that the answer comes from a neurology resident late of lahore and now working at the henry ford hospital in detroit michigan a debut collection of essays is a medical resident s coronavirus diary as well as a book of big ideas about family migration creation and loss though mahmood s book feels global without affecting to be global it s hard not to think of what american writer susan sontag said on something of the same subject everyone who is born holds dual citizenship in the kingdom of the well and in the kingdom of the sick this holds more than true for the author a dual national of several kingdoms where the sickness in question is fresh brittle and exhausting reviews tend to overreach when they say good books are about the human condition but a pandemic in residence points a high iq laser at the human mess thrown in stark relief by the coronavirus and makes sense of it these essays were written during the same days as the contagion s rise and rise and it shows what the west has since written off as a bad dream is made real again the rush to stock up on toilet paper the rogue advisories the bill gates conspiracy theories march 2020 already one of history s most awful months is also when mahmood s hospital records its first fatality from covid 19 it s the young deaths that take you by surprise the author writes though the same danger extends to the hospital s medical residents more than most mahmood s courage is authentic and unconscious i don t think any of us are actually contemplating that we may die from this that worry is still reserved for others but it gives you pause lines like these tend to bring home just how much of the universe we demand from our doctors that they be stoic enough to battle illness and organ failure each day and yet be humane enough to push the needle in to tell us that those we love won t make it far from clinical detachment however mahmood s own story of family migration and larger questions of creation and loss weaves through her essays as the daughter of former medical residents she retraces her parents footsteps with skill and feeling the earliest memories of my father are blue she writes as he approached from the hospital in seafoam scrubs it s also where she finds herself some 20 years later whenever i see my father in the fluorescent undertones of the hospital he calls a second home brisk in place eyes bright i am reminded i can be better human a human it amazes me as much as it breaks my heart to see how happy it makes him to see me here that said these essays don t make for light reading doctors tend to duke it out with disease and death is never far from the scene trips to the autopsy room devastate the reader as much as the writer from an intricate infinite creature spent years learning reaching not even a fraction of reality to end like this how to live life constantly on the brink of this where were their souls all my eyes impressed upon me was death at the same time the book has plenty of compassion places such as delivery rooms are handled with empathy the author is there in the intensive care unit in lahore when a pregnancy leads to haemorrhaging while the family outside keeps screaming if it s a boy the answer is complicated the author is in a similar room in detroit some time later assisting with a 13 year old girl s harrowing delivery i d nodded assent to the attending who d asked but continued feeling lightheaded and asked to step out one of the nurses got me a glass of ice chips as i sagged down a wall between repairing souls in the east and west there also comes the inescapable question of borders unlike the usual diaspora tropes the author has the good sense not to wish them away borders are necessary mahmood writes borders of the self family nation etc now that they exist they exist though the question of their porosity remains do you gash them open or slit them shut as her obvious affection for lahore makes plain it s a question that weighs heavy i flew out of lahore for new york after i graduated from med school and this time there was no forever in the past no back in sight we re also reminded that second generation children are projected to live in a dream that they never dreamt yet mahmood s decision echoes her father s i ve often wondered what memories my father lives for his family his childhood it was a rare moment at dinner in lahore with my baby sister that he recounted how he first moved away after graduating from medical school i looked out the airplane window and just knew i knew i was leaving forever to call this collection just a corona diary then wouldn t be doing it justice it s also a book of big ideas and it names the brains behind them austrian neurologist viktor frankl on the quest for life s meaning irish poet and dramatist william butler yeats on the poetry of memory and american screenwriter graham moore on the line between the great and the good with the author s own reflections in between that lends what could have been a period piece the story of a medical resident on the edge of the plague a touch of the forever a pandemic in residence is written with heart humanity and the kind of intellectual horsepower that made it possible to end up with a vaccine in record time because as devastating as the previous year was it took a triumph of the will by medical professionals and the state functionaries sympathetic to them to drag us all back from the abyss these diaries not only bear witness to the fight they also speak of the sort of search for truth that made that fight so necessary in the first place to close on a note of caution one already evoked in the title it s a pandemic that s still very much in residence covid 19 is a running exercise in intellectual humility it s a chance to turn to each other and say we really don t know per the book s very last line if it feels like the end it isn t the end that s as much a diagnosis of the pandemic as it is of anything

the fed forecast calls for inflation to significantly subside even as the economy sustains 3 5 per cent unemployment a development without precedent in us economic history the fed believes this even though it regards the sustainable level of unemployment as 4 per cent this only makes sense if the fed is clinging to the idea that current inflation is transitory and expects it to subside of its own accord in fact there is significant reason to think inflation may accelerate the consumer price index s shelter component which represents one third of the index has gone up by less than 4 per cent even as private calculations without exception suggest increases of 10 to 20 per cent in rent and home prices catch up is likely more fundamentally job vacancies are at record levels and the labor market is still heating up according to the fed forecast this portends acceleration rather than deceleration in labor costs by far the largest cost for the business sector meanwhile the pandemic related bottlenecks central to the transitory argument are exaggerated prices for more than 80 per cent of goods in the cpi have increased more than 3 per cent in the past year with the economy s capacity growing 2 per cent a year and the fed s own forecast calling for 4 per cent growth in 2022 price pressures seem more likely to grow than to abate this all suggests that policy will need to restrain demand to restore price stability how much tightening is required no one knows and the fed is right to insist that it will monitor the economy and adjust we do know however that monetary policy is far looser today in a high inflation low unemployment economy than it was about a year ago when inflation was below the fed s target and unemployment was around 8 per cent with relatively constant nominal interest rates higher inflation and the expectation of future inflation have led to dramatic reductions in real interest rates over the past year this is why bubbles are increasingly pervasive in asset markets ranging from crypto to beachfront properties and meme stocks to tech start ups the implication is that restoring monetary policy to a normal posture let alone to applying restraint to the economy will require far more than the three quarter point rate increases the fed has predicted for next year this point takes on particular force once it is recognised that contrary to powell s assertion almost all economists believe there is a lag of about a year between the application of a rate change and its effect failure to restore policy neutrality next year means allowing two more years of highly inflationary monetary policy advertisement all of this suggests that even with its actions this week the fed remains well behind the curve in its commitment to fighting inflation if its statements reflect its convictions this is a matter of serious concern to be fair though there is another possibility perhaps the fed s restraint reflects less conviction about what ultimately will be necessary than a desire to avoid being itself a source of economic shocks we should hope that what we have seen is just the first part of what will be if necessary a more radical policy redirection time will tell washington post lawrence summers is a professor at and past president of harvard university he was treasury secretary from 1999 to 2001 and an economic adviser to president barack obama from 2009 through 2010 washington post
something went wrong please try again later invalid email something went wrong please try again later never miss a mansfield story and read the latest headlines with our free email updates something went wrong please try again later never miss a mansfield story and read the latest headlines with our free email updates as the downfall of the murderous couple christopher and susan edwards is depicted in a drama on sky atlantic in the uk portraying how the couple came to kill susan s parents the wycherleys in mansfield legal affairs correspondent rebecca sherdley compares how accurate the four part miniseries is to their trial in nottingham in 2014 as dramas based on real life events go landscapers is compelling edge of your seat stuff as it plays out events with some artistic licence as the edwards eventually fled to france after christopher edwards shot susan s parents together they had buried the reclusive wycherleys in the back garden of their semi detached home at 2 blenheim close forest town in mansfield and kept up the lie they were still alive how the edwards then lived with that dark secret for 15 years one will never know a make believe world landscapers starring oscar winner olivia colman as susan edwards and david thewlis as her husband christopher transports viewers into a make believe world where they are living an idyllic life in france speaking some french and getting by until one day 15 years later they return to face the music by eurostar to london with police waiting for them on british soil colman as susan edwards is chatty bright optimistic funny and eccentric while her husband is more serious and sobering troubled and jobless the jury at the edward s trial in nottingham for the murders of patricia wycherley 63 and her 85 year old husband william saw a very different couple to those depicted in landscapers the pair sat in the dock at the city s crown court on separate seats staring blankly ahead with not a glimmer of remorse as their lives and the terrible thing they had done was laid bare by the prosecution they heard about a background of debt of stealing the wycherley s money callously selling their home as they lay dead in the ground and of susan s father who had sexually assaulted her when she was young the abuse stopped when she was 11 she left home in her early 20s the judge had told her that background may well explain why you hated him which you did and why you have no remorse about killing him prosecutors disputed mrs edwards version of events that the couple had lain dead for a week or that mr edwards had been in london at the time of the killings image sky they believed that in all likelihood it was experienced former gun club member mr edwards who pulled the trigger with a 38 revolver shooting the wycherleys twice each and then helping his wife cover up the killings for the next 15 years by lying forging signatures sending christmas cards to relatives and collecting benefit and pension money owed to the wycherleys credit controller mr edwards had told how they decided to sell the wychereys home in 2005 after he was shocked to discover his wife had run up a considerable level of debt they created documents purportedly signed by the wycherleys and the money from the sale 66 938 09 was paid into a joint account which was opened after the couple had been killed davis howker qc had asked mr edwards was susan living in the real world do you think mr edwards he replied probably not no mr howker asked did you agree to go along with the sale of the house mr edwards replied i wasn t happy to do it because we were no longer in control of the grave site the sale only reduced their debts of some 160 000 finally there was the memorabilia and the couple s love of westerns played out in dream like scenes in landscapers of them both in a romantic clinch mr edwards in full cowboy costume or in one scene where they galloped off on a horse together certainly not scenes heard at the trial as the judge told them you were a completely self contained couple so far as you were concerned only the two of you mattered the jury heard christopher edwards blew 14 000 in two years on signed photographs and other mementoes of the hollywood star gary cooper edwards who was interested in military history and had an interest in and expertise in firearms insisted he was buying the items online for his wife who had an interest in celebrities and claimed to have a long running pen friendship with french actor gerard depardieu as she did not have a computer he bought a signed document in cooper s name relating to the purchase of stock for just over 4 000 on november 7 2011 when the couple were deeply in debt and paying off an iva individual voluntary agreement at 25 of what they owed apart from the one euro they had left to their names and claiming they had run out of money when they surrendered to police among their clothes in suitcases were the valuable gary cooper memorabilia an autographed frank sinatra photo and strips of stamps of the american singer and film great image nottinghamshire police pa wire the couple were each convicted of two offences of murder they pleaded guilty to obstructing the coroner and to theft on each count of murder they received life imprisonment with a minimum term to be served before they are considered for parole of 25 years for the offence of obstructing a coroner five years imprisonment for the offence of theft four years imprisonment all those sentences will run concurrently the judge had told them mr wycherley was 86 mrs wycherley was nearly 64 they were living a quiet reclusive life in mansfield they knew no one they had as little contact as possible with other people you knew they wouldn t be missed if they disappeared and they weren t landscapers is a sky hbo co production broadcast in the uk by sky atlantic

going to all cash in your portfolio to avoid a crash can be just as costly as the crash itself a recent cnbc article quoted a 200 billion money manager suggesting every stock market investor should be ready to go to cash the comment was from ashbel williams who retired from the florida state board of administration you never want to be a forced seller of risk assets at reduced prices because of market turmoil that locks in permanent capital impairment there always has to be liquidity when equity markets go down the no 1 way to protect capital is to follow investment policy and rebalance back into equities while at depressed prices regular readers of our columns are already well aware we agree with ashbel on raising cash to avoid drawdown risk however there is an essential distinction between going to all cash and raising cash to manage risk the psychology trap the biggest battle for all investors is their own psychology from herding to anchoring to confirmation bias individuals exhibit the same set pattern of responses through the entire investing cycle such was a point we discussed recently in during a bull market people tend to forget about bear markets as far as human recent memory is concerned the market should keep going up since it has been going up recently investors therefore keep buying stocks feeling good about their prospects investors thereby increase risk taking and may not think about diversification or portfolio management prudence then a bear market hits and rather than be prepared for it with shock absorbers in their portfolios investors instead suffer a massive drop in their net worths and may sell out of stocks when the market is low selling low is of course not a good long term investing strategy morning star when it comes to going completely to cash in portfolios such action triggers numerous emotional behaviors that negatively impact portfolio outcomes over the past decade i have met with numerous individuals who went to cash in 2008 before the crash they felt confident in their actions at the time however that confidence gave way to confirmation bias after the market bottomed in 2009 nevertheless they remained convinced the bear market was not yet over and continued to seek out confirming information as a consequence they remained in cash the fear of being wrong the cost of sitting out on a market advance is evident as the turned from bearish to bullish many individuals remained in cash worrying they had missed the opportunity to get in even when there were decent pullbacks the fear of being wrong outweighed the necessity of getting capital invested the problem with being completely in cash is that it becomes increasingly difficult to break those psychological barriers to getting capital invested as the market advances the market has already run up too much what if i buy in now and the market crashes i ve already missed so much i will just wait for the next crash the cost of waiting while being entirely in cash certainly has psychological freedom it also has negative financial consequences the chart below shows the impact more clearly we assume an individual invests 100 000 at the turn of the century they ride the market down and back up to their original value in 2007 then having learned their lesson they see the signs of an impending market crash and go to cash while they avoided the 50 decline in 2008 remaining in cash has put them significantly behind their 6 annualized return needed to meet financial goals this is certainly a more extreme example however there are many individuals who remain out of the markets today due to fear of suffering a mean reverting event however is there a better way you cannot over the long term effectively time the market being all in or out of the market will eventually put you on the wrong side of the trade however you can manage risk and protect investment capital when it comes to managing risk there are many sophisticated methods for doing so and entire books have been written on the subject but risk management doesn t have to be overly complicated even a very basic moving average crossover can be a valuable tool over the long term holding periods will such a method always be correct of course not however will such a method keep you from losing significant amounts of capital absolutely let s use our basic example from above we will assume our investor understands market risk but is very slow at making transitions in this example we assume our investor puts 50 of his capital in 2000 and immediately gets swept into the dot com crash being concerned about the decline they remain 50 invested until mid 2004 finally investing the rest of their capital they participate with the market before selling down by 50 in 2008 they don t increase back to 100 equity exposure until late 2010 from 2010 they remain fully invested until reducing to 50 cash in 2017 they remain 50 cash until the end of 2020 before going back to full equity exposure as shown even though our hypothetical investor was late exiting and re entering the market they still substantially outperformed a buy and hold investor over the same time frame never go 100 into cash our inherent human biases make us extremely fallible creatures when investing inherently we will all do precisely the opposite of what we should do first we will buy high as greed overtakes our base logic then we will sell low as panic over mounting losses but we can do better but understanding our essential behavioral traits and learning that we can manage the amount of risk that we take in our portfolio management strategies avoid the herd mentality of paying increasingly higher prices without sound reasoning do your own research and avoid confirmation bias develop a sound long term investment strategy that includes risk management protocals diversify your portfolio allocation model to include safer assets control your greed and resist the temptation to get rich quick in speculative investments resist getting caught up in what could have been or anchoring to a past value such leads to emotional mistakes realize that price inflation does not last forever the larger the deviation from the mean the greater the eventual reversion will be invest accordingly despite the inherent belief that we are long term investors we all consistently get swept up in the market s short term movements of course with the media and wall street pushing the you are missing it mantra as the market rises who can blame the average investor for panic buying market tops and selling out at market bottoms it s never easy the problem with going to all cash in a portfolio is that it becomes psychologically challenging to redeploy that cash in the future to better navigate markets over time choose a base level of exposure that you will never go below no matter how bad it gets in the market we utilize a base of 25 of total equity allocation targets the benefit of having a base level of exposure is that as the market begins to recover it becomes psychologically easier to buy into an existing allocation that is beginning to recover however since invested capital got protected from the decline that capital gets quickly reallocated to equity risk at depressed levels while it may seem logical to go to cash to avoid crashes the risk of mistiming the event can have the same negative impact on financial goals as the crash itself notably managing risk is not the same as avoiding risk we can t invest capital without the acceptance of risk however we can take actions to minimize the impact of risk when things don t work out as anticipated

the richest countries are vaccine hoarders try them in international court millions more people will die from covid 19 in the coming year and most will be unvaccinated the vaccines that could save millions of lives are not reaching the poor majority of the world s population the contrast is stark the current share of people fully vaccinated in high upper middle income lower middle income and low income countries is 69 68 30 and 3 5 respectively the uk canada germany and other eu states have supported a deliberate policy to withhold vaccines from the poorest countries in the world and defended an immoral and unethical economic system which places big pharma patents ahead of millions of lives in this context is the only option left to ask whether the states facilitating this might be prosecuted in the international criminal court on the grounds of a crime against humanity first let s consider the impact so far the official statistics of global covid deaths 5 2 million greatly underestimate the real figures which may already be more than 20 million deaths in india for example analyses suggest that the real death rates are 10 times higher than the official figure of 400 000 meanwhile another study has found that more than 1 5 million children have been orphaned by the pandemic the situation is dire and yet one year after the discovery of multiple effective vaccines we still face a vaccine apartheid patent protected vaccines are sold at great profit to wealthy countries by a few pharmaceutical companies the global vaccine price ranges from 2 for astrazeneca to 37 per dose with mrna vaccines such as pfizer biontech and moderna the most expensive between january 2020 and december 2021 the market capitalisations of moderna rose from 6 9bn to 134bn pfizer from 206bn to 314bn and biontech from 6 6bn to 84bn it is clear that the existing efforts to distribute vaccines to poorer countries are not working the covax advanced market commitment was set up in september 2020 by the global alliance vaccine initiative in alliance with the world health organization to accelerate the development and manufacture of covid 19 vaccines as well as diagnostics and treatments and to guarantee rapid fair and equitable access to them for people in all countries donor countries would thereby fund guaranteed volumes of vaccines from manufacturers to supply low and middle income countries the covax scheme s target was to deliver 2bn doses by the end of this month and yet by 5 december well over a year since its launch the covax scheme had shipped only 669m doses to 144 countries with just 250m donated to the poorest 95 countries at time of writing not only is it way off track millions of vaccine doses donated to african countries have passed their expiry dates and have either been sent back or destroyed in april 2021 the who established a covid 19 mrna vaccine technology transfer hub to try to speed up global manufacturing all three mrna vaccine manufacturers have refused to take part if we want the world vaccinated with three doses it will require the distribution of at least 20bn doses pfizer biontech whose vaccine requires ultra cold storage that makes it difficult to distribute in low income settings predicts it will expand production to 4bn doses at best by the end of 2022 what can the world do when massive financial interests are placed before the survival of millions of men women and children there are several options one is a patent waiver a year ago india south africa kenya and eswatini among others called for one so

pharma bill gates a major donor to covax also defended patent rights after months of wrangling the wto has failed to broker an agreement another option put forward by dr peter singer senior adviser to the who director general is to appeal to the moral and ethical values of the big pharma board members and investors many of these people have led institutions committed to global public goods and equity one would think they might also have religious or moral principles that would make them think again but there is little historical precedent when stocks are booming for such a display of altruism a more effective line may be to take action against states such as germany canada the uk et al over what is arguably an infringement of human rights there is little doubt that their policies break the un convention on the rights of the child which requires states to combat disease and malnutrition the application of readily available technology with particular attention paid to the needs of developing countries likewise the un guiding principles on business and human rights unanimously endorsed by the un human rights council calls for business enterprises to comply with all applicable laws and to respect internationally recognised human rights and describes the state duty to protect against human rights abuses by businesses through policies regulation and adjudication sadly neither of these conventions have much teeth and they are regularly broken with impunity this leaves the nuclear option prosecution in the international criminal court for crimes against humanity in article 7 1 of the rome statute these are described as a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population and inhumane acts intentionally causing great suffering or serious injury to body or to mental or physical health international lawyers should consider this option and act quickly we cannot let this carnage drag on we could see another 12 million deaths in the next year people across the world want justice they should have a right to vaccine access especially when many of the vaccines in question were researched and developed largely by government scientists trained and employed at taxpayers expense anyone standing in the way of saving lives in the name of private profits should be held responsible
washington afp argentina has long had a stormy relationship with the international monetary fund which many in the country see unfavorably even though it has provided a credit lifeline after decades of what experts call very poor management of public finances advertising read more twenty years after an economic political and social crisis that shook the country and was felt around the world argentina is now traversing a tense financial patch having never fully regained the confidence of world markets with four in 10 argentines still living in poverty the country is anxious to avoid a replay of the 2001 debacle argentina finds itself struggling to refinance its latest loan contracted with the agency in 2018 amid economic recession with yearly inflation surpassing 50 percent and with depleted monetary reserves the country has gone to the imf 21 times since it became a member in 1956 so the new program supposedly being negotiated to restructure a credit of 44 billion will be the 22nd in 65 years said arturo porzecanski a researcher with the center for latin american and latino studies at american university in washington it s like saying that a bar owner has had to call the fire department 22 times over the last 65 years he said a serial defaulter rather than control its own general indebtedness argentina has for years borrowed excessively at home and abroad said mark sobel us chairman of the official monetary and financial institutions forum omfif the central bank is forced to finance deficits which generates inflation and public distrust in the government and the currency unable to pay its foreign debt argentina is a serial defaulter he added experts agree that blaming the imf for argentina s financial woes would be a mistake the cost the terms and the amount of any new program the imf approves for argentina will be much more favorable than the government could hope to obtain from the financial markets or from other multilateral entities porzecanski said afterall the fund s interest rates are low now it is two percent and in the case of high debt it could hit four percent but keep in mind that the interest rate at which argentina could borrow in the market is perhaps 15 percent said claudio loser a former imf director for the americas and ceo of the centennial group latin america consultancy resentment against the financial agency is widespread among argentina s population of 45 million including president alberto fernandez who has demanded more time to pay back the debt the villain although the imf has rescued argentina repeatedly it is a villain to many argentines said benjamin gedan deputy director of the latin american program at the wilson center in washington who said the agency is blamed for imposing painful budget cuts and precipitating the economic collapse of 2001 last weekend thousands of protesters chanted out with the imf in the streets of buenos aires argentines always focus on the fund and blame it for the problems of argentina said sobel but the decades and decades of bad economic policy for argentina were made in buenos aires not in washington dc gedan agreed saying argentina s fundamental problem is overspending and the imf cannot ignore the country s failure to responsibly manage its national budget 2021 afp

in the months since president joe biden warned russia s vladimir putin that he needed to crack down on ransomware gangs in his country there hasn t been a massive attack like the one last may that resulted in gasoline shortages but that s small comfort to ken trzaska trzaska is president of lewis clark community college a small illinois school that canceled classes for days after a ransomware attack last month that knocked critical computer systems offline that first day trzaska said i think all of us were probably up 20 plus hours just moving through the process trying to get our arms around what happened even if the united states isn t currently enduring large scale front page ransomware attacks on par with ones earlier this year that targeted the global meat supply or kept millions of americans from filling their gas tanks the problem hasn t disappeared in fact the attack on trzaska s college was part of a barrage of lower profile episodes that have upended the businesses governments schools and hospitals that were hit the college s ordeal reflects the challenges the biden administration faces in stamping out the threat and its uneven progress in doing so since ransomware became an urgent national security problem last spring smaller scale attacks continue u s officials have recaptured some ransom payments cracked down on abuses of cryptocurrency and made some arrests spy agencies have launched attacks against ransomware groups and the u s has pushed federal state and local governments as well as private industries to boost protections yet six months after biden s admonitions to putin it s hard to tell whether hackers have eased up because of u s pressure smaller scale attacks continue with ransomware criminals continuing to operate from russia with seeming impunity administration officials have given conflicting assessments about whether russia s behavior has changed since last summer further complicating matters ransomware is no longer at the top of the u s russia agenda with washington focused on dissuading putin from invading ukraine the white house said it was determined to fight all ransomware through its various tools but that the government s response depends on the severity of the attack there are some that are law enforcement matters and others that are high impact disruptive ransomware activity posing a direct national security threat that require other measures the white house statement said ransomware attacks in which hackers lock up victims data and demand exorbitant sums to return it surfaced as a national security emergency for the administration after a may attack on colonial pipeline which supplies nearly half the fuel consumed on the east coast the attack prompted the company to halt operations causing gas shortages for days though it resumed service after paying more than 4 million in ransom soon after came an attack on meat processor jbs which paid an 11 million ransom biden met with putin in june in geneva where he suggested critical infrastructure sectors should be off limits for ransomware and said the u s should know in six months to a year whether we have a cybersecurity arrangement that begins to bring some order he reiterated the message in july days after a major attack on a software company kaseya that affected hundreds of businesses and said he expected russia to take action on cybercriminals when the u s provides enough information to do so since then there have been some notable attacks from groups believed to be based in russia including against sinclair broadcast group and the national rifle association but none of the same consequence or impact of those from last spring or summer whole of government effort one reason may be increased u s government scrutiny or fear of it the biden administration in september sanctioned a russia based virtual currency exchange that officials say helped ransomware gangs launder funds last month the justice department unsealed charges against a suspected ukrainian ransomware operator who was arrested in poland and has recovered millions of dollars in ransom payments gen paul nakasone the head of u s cyber command told the new york times his agency has begun offensive operations against ransomware groups the white house says that whole of government effort will continue i think the ransomware folks the ones conducting them are stepping back like hey if we do that that s going to get the united states government coming after us offensively kevin powers security strategy adviser for cyber risk firm cybersaint said of attacks against critical infrastructure u s officials meanwhile have shared a small number of names of suspected ransomware operators with russian officials who have said they have started investigating according to two people familiar with the matter who were not authorized to speak publicly it s unclear what russia will do with those names though kremlin spokesperson dmitry peskov insisted the countries have been having a useful dialogue and said a working mechanism has been established and is actually functioning it s also hard to measure the impact of individual arrests on the overall threat even as the suspected ransomware hacker awaits extradition to the u s following his arrest in poland another who was indicted by federal prosecutors was later reported by a british tabloid to be living comfortably in russia and driving luxury cars some are skeptical about attributing any drop off in high profile attacks to u s efforts it could have just been a fluke said dmitri alperovitch former chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm crowdstrike he said asking russia to crack down on large scale attacks won t work because it s way too granular of a request to calibrate criminal activity they don t even fully control top american officials have given conflicting answers about ransomware trends since biden s discussions with putin some fbi and justice department officials say they ve seen no change in russian behavior national cyber director chris inglis said there s been a discernible decrease in attacks but that it was too soon to say why it s hard to quantify the number of attacks given the lack of baseline information and uneven reporting from victims though the absence of disruptive incidents is an important marker for a white house trying to focus its attention on the most significant national security risks and catastrophic breaches victims of ransomware attacks in the past few months have included hospitals small businesses colleges like howard university which briefly took many of its systems offline after discovering a september attack and virginia s legislature not if but when the attack at lewis clark in godfrey illinois was discovered two days before thanksgiving when the school s it director detected suspicious activity and proactively took systems offline said trzaska the president a ransom note from hackers demanded a payment though trzaska declined to reveal the sum or identify the culprits though many attacks come from hackers in russia or eastern europe some originate elsewhere with vital education systems affected including email and the school s online learning platform administrators canceled classes for days after the thanksgiving break and communicated updates to students via social media and through a public alert system the college which had backups on the majority of its servers resumed operations this month the ordeal was daunting enough to inspire trzaska and another college president who he says endured a similar experience to plan a cybersecurity panel the stock quote from everyone trzaska said is not if it s going to happen but when it s going to happen

by tisaranee gunasekara one day i was in kelaniya with the thero of misisawetiya then you mahinda rajapaksa came like a lion misiawetiya thero said look there s a lion coming i said not a lion mahinda rajapaka is a culture mahinda rajapkasa is a civilisation medagoda abeytissa thero lanka news web 24 8 2020 independent lanka experienced three waves of weaponsation of buddhism the first was when swrd bandaranaike embraced the buddhist commission report ds senanayake had refused on constitutional grounds a request by the all ceylon buddhist congress to appoint a royal commission to study buddhist grievances the acbc appointed its own commission in 1954 the commission released its report in february 1956 swrd bandaranaike who needed to defeat the unp while outflanking a left strengthened by the successful hartal embraced the report an overtly sinhala buddhist election campaign ensued with the eksath bikkhu peramuna united bikkhu front playing a vanguard role the mep won though its national average was only 39 5 swrd bandaranaike realised his heart s desire of becoming prime minister and was assassinated 3 years later by a monk the killing created a popular backlash against sangha in general in one of his political novels peraliya transformation tb illangaratne mentions that monks had to stop going in buses or on pindapatha for a while due to public opprobrium the violent end to that first attempt at creating a nexus between religion and politics had somewhat of a sobering effect on the political class politicians would continue to use religion tactically but a major weaponisation of buddhism would not happen for almost 45 years the second wave was unleashed early in the new millennium gangodawila some thero had begun his political preaching by targeting lankan muslims when he was trounced by mhm ashraff in their widely watched television debate he shifted targets focusing his fire on christians catholics his unexpected death caused by exposure to russian winter gave rise to a wave of hysterical grief and anger a group of sinhala buddhist extremists led by champika ranawaka with udaya gammanpila as his sidekick saw an opportunity and moved in with aggressive determination they renamed their party sihala urumaya as jathika hela urumaya jhu and donated it to the sangha a monk only slate was nominated for the 2004 general election with the promise of building a dharma rajya in six months the new party scored only 5 97 and fell into acrimonious squabbling almost before the election was over a kidnapping drama and a parliamentary brawl were followed by a bomb attack on a musical show featuring indian artistes in which several jhu stalwarts were implicated once again public outrage at the party s shenanigans reflected on all monks for a while party symbol hakgediya conch shell became a popular slang word for a monk the third wave commenced post eelam war the rajapaksas needed a new enemy after some attacks on churches focus shifted to muslims the bodu bala sena came into divisive life with the anti halal campaign the buddhist flag was flown alongside the national flag at the independence square an actor playing historian gave the rajapaksas a family tree linking them not just to hero king dutigemunu but also to the buddha the third wave crested during the 2019 presidential election as monks became politically mobilised on an unprecedented scale during the parliamentary election the political civic act of voting was turned explicitly into a religious act bringing into play the buddhist concepts of merit and demerit the project to impose first an ethnic and then an ethno religious state on a nation state has reached its apotheosis no other refuge in another infamous first president gotabaya rajapaksa has appointed a buddhist monk to the human rights commission this week fitch ratings downgraded lanka to cc one notch away from bankruptcy the economy contracted by 1 5 in the third quarter the forex crisis and the fertiliser crisis created by gotabaya rajapaksa s hubristic ignorance remain unresolved domestic gas continues to explode having forced the government to agree to pay 67million dollars for a ship of contaminated fertiliser china is fishing in troubled waters this time in the north the chinese ambassador undertook a two day visit to jaffna and mannar worshipping at nallur kovil bare bodied as tradition dictates and distributing largesse to fishing communities at conflict with tamilnadu fishermen poaching in lankan waters the rajapaksas returned to power in 2019 at the head of a saptha maha balavegaya monks physicians teachers peasants workers soldiers and youth within two years their support among five of those forces have plummeted increasing their dependence on the military and the monks for their own survival the rajapaksas must continue weaponising buddhism but the alliance between politicians and monks was never a marriage of equals as prof hl seneviratne pointed out in the work of kings since the lankan monks lack overarching and unifying social structures by its very nature the sangha cannot be a power it can only be a handmaid of power violently racist and obscenity sprouting monk galagoda atte gnanasara is not the problem he is merely a symptom the problem is the weaponisation of buddhism by the rajapaksas in their political and dynastic interests the egregious monk remains in position even after he threatened two fellow monks with lethal violence because the rajapaksas need him if he didn t exist the family would have had to create him which is quite possibly what they did in 2011 2012 turkish scholar mustafa akoyal commenting on the ulema state alliance dominant in most islamic majority countries points out that many religious scholars are happy to justify autocratic rulers as long as the latter pose as defender of faith reopening muslim minds a return to reason freedom and tolerance similarly the rajapaksas are promoting and showcasing monks in the hope of maintaining their self anointed status as the sole defenders of a sinhala buddhist sri lanka if anyone wants to see the danger of this path they need to look no further than pakistan sharia law was introduced in pakistan by a pro american general who came to power in a military coup and began his rule by hanging his elected civilian predecessor after a spurious trial as eqbal ahmed pointed out zia needed a constituency he had none he needed the support of a party no party was willing to support him except jamat e islami which charged a fee islamisation of higher educational institutions during the pro western government of zia ul haq physics professors could not be appointed if they could not name the wives of the holy prophet on empire the result of this bargain was a populace contaminated by the virus of religious extremism in january 2011 punjab governor salman taseer was gunned down by his own bodyguard his crime was defending aasia bibi an impoverished christian woman accused of blasphemy she was subsequently acquitted by the pakistani supreme court mr taseer s killer became an instant hero while clerics refused to perform the last rites for the victim the cleric who eventually did so was forced to flee the country when the killer appeared in court some lawyers showered him with rose petals he was convicted and hung today his tomb in the outskirts of islamabad is a shrine teeming with worshippers when religious killers are venerated it encourages other religious killers the sialkot lynching might not have happened if the murder of salman taseer and many others had given rise to a rational discussion and examination of blasphemy laws instead a vocal minority of religious extremists hogged the stage while the majority either consented in silence or hid their heads ostrich fashion hoping the problem would go away the result was the strengthening of what salman taseer s estranged son aatish taseer called pakistan s parallel morality a morality distorted by faith stranger to history a son s journey through islamic lands as we condemn the sialkot lynching let us remember that religious violence can sprout in other places too when the social soil turns fertile muslim people don t love us i say don t go to those shops don t eat or drink from those shops it is clear that they are a group who gave poison to our people who tried to destroy our people i think that the younger generation who eats from them will not have children in the future also everyone knows what a doctor gentleman did in matale lakhs of our children were destroyed these traitors should not be allowed to live free some upasakammas said they must be stoned to death gal gahala maranna ona i don t say that but that is what should be done laws and regulations won t work this was not the bbs chief but the most venerable maha nayaka of the asgiriya chapter in june 2019 translation and emphasis mine if such ideas are given a free pass the next sialkot might happen in sri lanka whoever dons the saffron robe with mind purged of all defilements restrained and truthful he indeed is worthy of the saffron robe so said the buddha dhammapada yamaka vagga but when buddhism is weaponised for political purposes prominence is often given to those who are defiled unrestrained and untruthful those who are unworthy of the saffron robe according to what the buddha taught they become the public face of buddhism tainting it with their own reek when history reckons with the lethal legacy of the rajapaksas the debasement of a great teaching may well head the list glimmers of hope omicron is here exposing namal rajapaksa s claim of an app that can identify and stop the new strain from entering sri lanka for what it is an idle boast totally devoid of facts this is nothing new unreason and anti factuality coloured the rajapaksa response to the pandemic from the beginning instead of focusing on obtaining vaccine stocks the rajapaksas encouraged the public to place their faith in religious cures and mystical nostrums for instance in october 2020 pm mahinda rajapaksa was the chief guest at a week long ceremony to chant ratana sutta at abhayarama to save sri lanka from corona the second wave still came soon followed by the deadly third one in this context a historical analysis of the practice of seeking supernatural protection from natural illnesses made by prof mmj marasinghe former vice chancellor and head of the department of pali and buddhist studies in the kelaniya university makes interesting reading it is buddhaghosa who claims in his commentary on the ratana sutta that it was first chanted by the buddha to heal the city of vesali of the devastating epidemic and affliction by non humans it must be noted here that buddhaghosa s claim of an epidemic is not supported by any other literary or historical source further the vajjian tribal oligarchy was an exemplary tribal state too strong for the neighbouring magadhan emperor to wage war as clearly stated in the maháparinibbána sutta of the dìigha nbikáya thus the story of an epidemic is another of buddhaghosa s fairy tales used to make new rites and rituals acceptable by giving them religious sanction the great betrayal of theravada buddhism sri lanka guardian 21 5 2014 a current of reason moderation and tolerance always existed in modern lankan buddhism but it was never the dominant one for neither politicians nor the media had any use for it since it could not be manipulated for political power or commercial profit it was sidelined another example of this moderate current is a series of discussions organised by the rahula centre and galkande dhammananda thero based on a contextual analysis of buddhist texts both primary and secondary uduwahara ananda thero uses the buddha s words to provide a fascinating glimpse of a teaching that is liberal and progressive one that possess a strangely modern sensibility as the rajapaksa rule sinks dragging political buddhism with it a space might be created for the rational currents to gain greater visibility and play a bigger role in healing wounds made by successive efforts to imprison a pluralist lanka in a mono ethnic religious mould politicians of whatever ilk will not be interested in such a positive change the opposition dreams of making tactical use of religion in its own quest for power for example when muruttetuwe ananda thero started to criticise the government many presidential hopefuls including ranil wickrmesinghe and sajith premadasa hastened to abhayarama against such blatant opportunism the principled stand taken by a group of colombo university students and academics provide a stark and a hopeful contrast management faculty student and staff refused to attend a convocation presided over by the university s new chancellor muruttetuwe ananda thero their refusal compelled university administration to change tradition the vc awarded degree certificates relegating the robed chancellor to the role of a glorified onlooker such societal responses firm and civilised determined and non violent indicate the possibility however slim of a post rajapaksa future that is free of the worst rajapaksa practices starting with the weaponisation of buddhism
