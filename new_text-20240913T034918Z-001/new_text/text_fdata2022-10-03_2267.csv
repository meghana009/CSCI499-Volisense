munich inflation is galloping in the eurozone as the euro tumbles in august 2022 annual eurozone inflation reached 9 1 per cent and rates exceeding 20 per cent are now being registered in the baltic countries in may 2021 a euro would have cost you more than 1 20 on september 27 you could buy one for 0 96 is the european central bank ecb to blame loss of confidence in the euro jeopardises the monetary union s stability because it can fuel an inflationary spiral and lead to capital flight the united kingdom is currently grappling with these dynamics and the eurozone could well be next recent inflation news from the eurozone s largest member germany is particularly alarming in august producer prices which measure what is happening at the preliminary stages of industrial production were a whopping 46 per cent higher than in the same month last year given the long term correlation between the growth rate of producer and consumer prices this suggests that the latter could soar to 14 per cent in november price stability which is supposed to be the ecb s uncompromising goal per the maastricht treaty is no longer perceptible the ecb denies that it bears any responsibility for the eurozone s current inflation struggles after all it could not control the pandemic or russian president vladimir putin s decision to invade ukraine but pointing to these exogenous events is nothing more than a diversionary tactic in fact there is good reason to believe that the ecb contributed significantly to current inflation probably even more than other central banks have done in their respective economies since the 2008 global economic crisis the ecb has allowed the central bank money supply to increase twice as fast relative to economic output as the us federal reserve has of that growth 83 per cent was the result of the ecb s purchases of government bonds from eurozone countries with those purchases which totaled an estimated 4 4 trillion euros the ecb pushed interest rates on government bonds to around zero this spurred countries to disregard european debt rules and accumulate debt at a breakneck pace in 2020 the european commission joined the ecb in its expansionary endeavor the european union s 750 billion euros in additional borrowing was presented as an effort to help all eu countries cope with the effects of the covid 19 pandemic in reality it was intended primarily to support the weaker economies of the mediterranean region as a result of these measures the eu s overall government debt including debt held at the eu level will be pushed well beyond 100 per cent of gdp since government debt increases aggregate demand this has had a clear impact on inflation while pandemic related supply chain bottlenecks and the energy crisis induced by the ukraine war were the sparks sovereign debt was the tinder without it the inflation fire would not have spread at such a rapid pace the ecb has further contributed to inflationary pressures by weakening the euro while the fed began sending clear signals in june 2021 that it would begin raising interest rates in the foreseeable future the ecb aggressively defended its ultra loose monetary policy until july 2022 when it implemented its first rate hike in 11 years which was followed by a somewhat more substantial hike in september as a result the interest rate differential between the us and the eurozone continued to grow spurring investors to flee europe for america in droves in the three weeks after the rate increase in september the dollar rose 4 per cent above parity with the euro since the fed s first announcement in june 2021 that it might raise rates the dollar has appreciated by roughly 20 per cent against the euro as the euro weakened prices for imported goods and services rose and european exporters were able to raise prices without losing market share although the prices of goods and services that are not traded internationally were not immediately affected it is only a matter of time before they will follow suit meanwhile energy prices in particular are soaring the revaluation of the dollar alone increased oil prices expressed in euros by 25 per cent in addition to the increase in the dollar price resulting from supply shortages even the prices of natural gas were affected by the revaluation which represents a notable shift from the past when european gas prices were set largely independently of global markets the difference now is that as putin has turned off europe s tap liquefied natural gas traded on world markets has become the marginal source of supply capping the price hike in terms of euros at a level that is higher the more the euro depreciates the ecb has tried to exculpate itself by pointing out that the increase in energy prices accounts for a good third of european inflation but it has yet to own up to the fact that it bears significant responsibility for even this component owing to its role in driving the euro s depreciation when it comes to eurozone inflation including energy prices the ecb shares the blame with putin and opec hans werner sinn professor emeritus of economics at the university of munich is a former president of

las vegas it s been five years since carnage and death sent his family running into the night leaving them separated and terrified as a gunman rained bullets into an outdoor country music festival crowd on the las vegas strip the memories don t fade they sharpen william bill henning said as he prepared for ceremonies in las vegas marking the date of the oct 1 2017 massacre chaotic and unreal he recalled a human stampede people were bleeding and screaming and running we all got separated we didn t know who was alive that was the most difficult he s now part of a survivor community thousands strong one that s helped him sort through the horror of what happened during the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history fifty eight people were killed and more than 850 were injured among a crowd of 22 000 in the years since the grim drumbeat of mass shootings has continued schools in uvalde texas and parkland florida grocery stores in buffalo new york and boulder colorado bars in dayton ohio and thousand oaks california a city building in virginia beach virginia a walmart in el paso texas meanwhile the debate over gun laws in the u s rages on including a renewed challenge to the federal regulation sparked by the las vegas shooting nevada u s rep dina titus on saturday called again for a federal law banning bump stocks the devices used by the las vegas shooter that allow a semi automatic rifle to fire repeatedly with just one pull of the trigger they were outlawed by rule by the trump administration but face court challenges ap photo john locher file file people visit a makeshift memorial honoring the victims of the oct 1 2017 mass shooting in las vegas on nov 12 2017 five years after a gunman killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more at a country music festival in las vegas in the deadliest mass shooting in modern u s history the massacre is now part of a horrifying increase in the number of mass slayings with more than 20 victims according to a database of mass killings maintained by the associated press usa today and northeastern university ap photo john locher file and president joe biden also called for renewed efforts to tighten firearms laws saturday while mourning the victims and praising residents who came together in the aftermath of the shooting the president noted executive action he s taken to crack down on ghost guns and rogue gun dealers and the passage of the first significant firearms legislation in 30 years that bipartisan law signed by biden in june in part boosts protections for domestic violence victims funnels cash to states for firearms crime prevention and has money for mental health services but we re not stopping there biden said in a statement i am determined to seize this momentum and work with congress to enact further commonsense gun violence prevention legislation including banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines which have enabled shooters to slaughter so many innocents the las vegas massacre is part of a horrifying uptick of shootings with especially high numbers of people killed said james alan fox a professor of criminology law and public policy at northeastern university in boston five of the nine mass shootings in modern u s history with more than 20 people killed have taken place since 2016 starting with the pulse nightclub in orlando and continuing through the elementary school shooting in uvalde texas the severity of public mass shootings has increased in the past few years that s clear fox said and worrisome fox oversees a database maintained by the associated press usa today and northeastern university that tracks mass killings involving four or more people slain not including the perpetrator the information is drawn from media reports fbi data arrest records medical examiners reports prison records and other court documents watching the steady stream of shootings in the u s is tough for survivors said tennille pereira director of a clark county recovery and support program called the vegas strong resiliency center i know when it keeps happening people often express feelings of hopelessness pereira said i think the big thing for las vegas is to be able to share with those other communities that healing does occur and that there is hope for people like henning part of that hope has been the bond formed with other survivors the retired computer technician was celebrating his 71st birthday at the route 91 harvest festival with friends his wife daughter and three teenage grandchildren when the gunfire began he suffered a knee injury while escaping that required surgery but his group made it out without being struck by gunfire at first the first few years it s not really sinking in he said the more we organize ourselves the more that we see each other it actually brings us back to how serious this situation was many in las vegas who won t name the man who police said fired 1 057 bullets from 32nd floor windows of the mandalay bay resort during a span of time now memorialized in a paramount streaming service documentary called 11 minutes we don t want to give him any more power credibility infamy pereira said in this survivor population words matter we don t use the word anniversary we use remembrance we try not to use the word victims we try to use the word survivor police and the fbi spent months investigating and concluded that gunman stephen paddock acted alone meticulously planned the attack and intentionally concealed his actions he amassed an arsenal of 23 assault style rifles in his hotel room including 14 fitted with bump stock devices that help the weapons fire rapidly caches of weapons also were found at paddock s homes in reno and mesquite nevada but he killed himself before police reached him and local and federal officials said they never identified a clear motive for the attack shortly after the shooting the administration of then president donald trump banned bump stocks under the same federal laws that prohibit machine guns gun rights advocates sued saying the weapons didn t qualify as machine guns and it would take an act of congress to ban them the ban has survived several court challenges but a federal appeals court in new orleans revived a case there in june the same day the u s supreme court handed down a ruling expanding gun rights that case marked the high court s first major gun decision in more than a decade and has sparked a wave of court challenges to gun laws around the country meanwhile in las vegas survivors are working toward a permanent memorial on a corner of the former las vegas strip festival ground a sunrise remembrance ceremony is scheduled saturday at the clark county government center and the names of those killed will be read 10 05 p m the time the shooting started at a downtown las vegas community healing garden survivor sue nelson 67 said she fled from her front row seat and hid for hours on the las vegas strip forming deep bonds with others who escaped she declared she has survivor sorrow not survivor guilt because she didn t do anything wrong nelson drives two hours to las vegas from her home in lake

economist says the bond market has been a poor predictor in the past of when the federal reserve is ready to start cutting interest rates according to research from joseph lavorgna chief economist at smbc nikko securities looking at the past three tightening cycles 1999 2000 2004 06 and 2015 18 investors expected the fed to hold rates higher for longer only to miss the mark when the central bank was forced into cutting much sooner than expected historically the bond market does not anticipate a fed pivot lavorgna said in a client note while there is a small pivot priced into the eurodollar

within manufacturing as the surging u s dollars helps bat down inflation one economist said manufacturers are reporting a growth in order books for the first time in four months in september while experiencing lower costs according to chris williamson chief business economist at s p global market intelligence input costs rose at a slower pace in september and providers raised prices at a slower rate than earlier in the year while the strong dollar is curbing exports a beneficial effect from the greenback s strength is being seen via lower import costs williamson said with supply chain delays also easing substantially again in september and shipping costs falling upwards pressure on firms costs has moderated sharply which will feed through to lower goods prices to consumers but

by megan delaire click here for updates on this story oct 1 2022 ctv network the covid 19 pandemic has generated significant short and long term changes to the way people live play and especially work while some aspects of pre pandemic life like socializing indoors without a mask and travelling have made a comeback offices across the country have yet to return to their pre pandemic occupancy rates whether companies will abandon the remote and hybrid workplace models that became popular during the pandemic is to be determined but two things are clear office vacancy rates have been rising since the beginning of the pandemic and office to residential conversions are becoming more common in mid size and large canadian cities in its latest national market snapshot investment management company colliers took stock of office vacancy rates in 12 canadian cities during the third quarter of 2022 according to the report the average office vacancy rate across canada is 13 per cent compared to just over 8 per cent at the start of the pandemic calgary has the highest vacancy rate with 27 5 per cent of offices sitting empty edmonton s rate sits at 19 per cent regina s at 17 5 per cent montreal s at 14 7 per cent saskatoon s at 14 5 per cent halifax s at 14 1 per cent waterloo s at 13 3 per cent winnipeg s at 12 7 ottawa s at 10 6 and toronto s at 10 1 vancouver boasts the lowest vacancy rate at 5 8 per cent penny gurstein is a professor at the university of british columbia s school of community and regional planning who specializes in real estate and housing she believes what s happening is the acceleration of a trend that began before the pandemic i think covid really just sped up the trend toward more flexible working arrangements that s been going on for a while she told ctvnews ca in an interview over the phone on wednesday businesses that are trying to attract a younger workforce have recognized that something their employees want is more flexibility so they don t need as much office space as office vacancy rates creep building owners developers and city planners are increasingly warming to the idea of converting empty and outdated office spaces into homes this saves them from needing to demolish and rebuild underused assets and fills demand for housing this concept isn t new either for decades developers have transformed banks schools factories and churches into condominiums and apartments and there are several examples of office conversions in canada prior to the pandemic an advantage of repurposing existing buildings is that it reduces some of the environmental impact of construction between three office to residential conversion projects completed since 2019 and an upcoming fourth project alberta based strategic group estimates it will have saved 56 000 tonnes of building materials and 17 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions that s the equivalent of taking 37 000 vehicles off the road each year ken toews strategic group s senior vice president of development said in a phone interview with ctvnews ca on wednesday toews explained that construction accounts for 11 per cent of global climate emissions according to the world green building council so part of the appeal of repurposing existing buildings is to help bring that number down of course there are also financial considerations once a building s vacancy rate creeps up to 20 per cent it starts to lose money explained steven paynter principal at gensler architecture and design there s a lot of buildings at that point now he told ctvnews ca in a phone interview on wednesday in the last six months as the vacancy rates have climbed up and people are not renewing their office leases all of a sudden everyone wants to talk about it and wants to get these projects moving gensler saw this coming at the beginning of the pandemic and created a scoring system to help developers determine which buildings are well suited for conversion and which aren t buildings with a small floor plate are ideal because it s easier to design residential units in a space with an elevator to window depth of around 35 feet than for example 80 feet buildings from the 1970s tend to have these smaller floor plates buildings with plenty of windows and pre existing parking are also an asset since it s difficult and costly to retrofit these features we ve done a lot of work on this paynter said we ve studied over 350 buildings around north america now and what we ve found is if you re lucky about 30 per cent of the time these projects will make economic sense nevertheless paynter expects to see office to residential conversions in every major north american city before long though it ll take more time to happen in some cities than others mostly due to municipal zoning and approval policies cities need to approve applications for office to residential conversions and some cities have zoning rules that protect office space for example paynter said toronto has designated employment zones where the amount of office space is protected this adds another barrier to making conversions at the moment it s hard to do these types of conversions in toronto because of the city rules paynter said the federal liberals are aware of this barrier and in the 2021 election campaigned on a promise to commit to 600 million to support office and retail to housing conversions and to work with municipalities to create a fast track system for permits to allow faster conversions paynter said he hasn t noticed any movement on those promises yet but in the meantime some municipalities have taken up the mantle through its downtown calgary development incentive program the city of calgary offers a grant for office to residential conversions of 75 per square foot the program launched in august 2021 and has approved five conversions with two more likely to receive approval soon calgary has also made progress speeding up the zoning approval process for office to residential conversions said toews since 2019 strategic group has completed three office to residential conversions in edmonton and calgary creating more than 200 new residential units and is about to break ground on a fourth we ve been pretty excited about conversions for quite a while he toews said i knew we were on the right track when we were working on adaptive reuse for buildings but i didn t realize it was that big a deal toews said it took only a month to receive zoning approval for one of its calgary conversions it s pretty cool he said calgary has taken a different approach and it s refreshing because a lot of developers get disenchanted with low approvals calgary s city council sees office to residential conversions as a solution to excess office space and a way to develop more vibrant downtown neighbourhoods the federal government sees them as an opportunity for property owners and communities to trade excess space for market based rentals gurstein sees them as a potential opportunity to create affordable housing one she hopes won t be wasted if they ensure at least some affordable units geared to income those kinds of things i think that s totally reasonable she said but unless there is sort of something in place to ensure there would be affordability in there i don t really see it as addressing affordability please note this content carries a strict local market

economist says the bond market has been a poor predictor in the past of when the federal reserve is ready to start cutting interest rates according to research from joseph lavorgna chief economist at smbc nikko securities looking at the past three tightening cycles 1999 2000 2004 06 and 2015 18 investors expected the fed to hold rates higher for longer only to miss the mark when the central bank was forced into cutting much sooner than expected historically the bond market does not anticipate a fed pivot lavorgna said in a client note while there is a small pivot priced into the eurodollar curve next year the recent past suggests that a shift in policy could be dramatic hence interest rates could be on the cusp of a big rally if the fed pivots sooner than many investors expect in may 2000 the benchmark fed funds rate topped at 6 5 with investors expecting 7 25 the fed started cutting later that year amid a pop in the dotcom bubble again in 2006 investors priced in a fed leaving rates around 5 25 but the financial crisis forced the central bank s hand finally in late 2018 markets were pricing in a funds rate of 3 by the end of 2019 but the fed had to cut that year due to economic weakness traders currently are pricing in 1 percentage point or 100 points of rate increases through the end of this year then the fed leaving rates at that level into early 2024 however

experiencing lower costs according to chris williamson chief business economist at s p global market intelligence input costs rose at a slower pace in september and providers raised prices at a slower rate than earlier in the year while the strong dollar is curbing exports a beneficial effect from the greenback s strength is being seen via lower import costs williamson said with supply chain delays

economist says the bond market has been a poor predictor in the past of when the federal reserve is ready to start cutting interest rates according to research from joseph lavorgna chief economist at smbc nikko securities looking at the past three tightening cycles 1999 2000 2004 06 and 2015 18 investors expected the fed to hold rates higher for longer only to miss the mark when the central bank was forced into cutting much sooner than expected historically the bond market does not anticipate a fed pivot lavorgna said in a client note while there is a small pivot priced into the eurodollar curve next year the recent past suggests that a shift in policy could be dramatic hence interest rates could be on the cusp of a big rally if the fed pivots sooner than many investors expect in may 2000 the benchmark fed funds rate topped at 6 5 with investors expecting 7 25 the fed started cutting later that year amid a pop in the dotcom bubble again in 2006 investors priced in a fed leaving rates around 5 25 but the financial crisis forced the central bank s hand finally in late 2018 markets were pricing in a funds rate of 3 by the end of 2019 but the fed had to cut that year due to economic weakness traders currently are pricing in 1 percentage point or 100 points of rate increases through the end of this year then the fed leaving rates at that level into early 2024 however

within manufacturing as the surging u s dollars helps bat down inflation one economist said manufacturers are reporting a growth in order books for the first time in four months in september while experiencing lower costs according to chris williamson chief business economist at s p global market intelligence input costs rose at a slower pace in september and providers raised prices at a slower rate than earlier in the year while the strong dollar is curbing exports a beneficial effect from the greenback s strength is being seen via lower import costs williamson said with supply chain delays also easing substantially again in september and shipping costs falling upwards pressure on firms costs has moderated sharply which will feed through to lower goods prices to consumers but

lead plaintiff deadline november 7 2022 medtronic is a medical device company among its products is the minimed insulin pump system for the treatment of diabetes the systems include the minimed 600 series models and the minimed 780g model medtronic is currently seeking regulatory approval for the minimed 780g model which uses an advanced hybrid closed loop system during the class period medtronic repeatedly assured investors that the minimed 780g model was on track for approval by the u s food and drug administration fda and would provide medtronic with the edge it needed to close a growing gap with its competitors in the diabetes market medtronic made these representations despite known issues with the minimed 600 series models indeed in november 2019 the company issued a warning that certain minimed 600 series insulin pumps might have damaged pump retainer rings which could cause the system to release too much insulin and instructed customers with damaged rings to contact the company for replacements on february 7 2020 the fda classified medtronic s november 2019 notification as a class i recall the most serious type of recall problems with the minimed 600 series mushroomed in october 2021 when the company expanded its recall to all minimed model 630g and 670g insulin pump systems whether or not any retainer ring damage was actually visible despite these serious issues with the 600 series medtronic assured investors that they expected the minimed 780g to drive growth consistent with these optimistic statements medtronic again assured investors

stock declined 6 75 per share or approximately 6 from a close of 111 69 per share on december 14 2021 to close at 104 94 per share on december 15 2021 the financial fallout from the fda s findings continued to surface on may 26 2022 when medtronic reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 and provided guidance for fiscal year 2023 notably medtronic disclosed that as a result of the company s need to improve its quality control system and its expectation that the minimed 780g model which defendants had repeatedly identified as crucial to future growth would not be approved in 2023 the company expected revenues from its diabetes group to decline between 6 and 7 in fiscal year 2023 on this news the price of medtronic common stock fell 6 10 per

had failed to comply with numerous regulations regarding risk assessment corrective and preventive action complaint handling device recalls and reporting of adverse events 3 these failures increased the risk of regulatory investigation and action 4 as a result of the company s misconduct the fda would delay the approval of additional medtronic minimed devices including the minimed 780g 5 these delays in product approvals as well as the company s need to improve its quality control systems would negatively affect medtronic s financial performance and cause it to fall further behind its

an offer in january 2016 to buy sinovac for approximately 350 million li supported a competing group that sought to buy sinovac for a higher price rather than provide this support in an open and transparent manner li and 1globe used deceptive practices to advance their position after sinovac adopted the rights agreement on march 28 2016 which contained a poison pill that limited the amount of sinovac stock that a shareholder could acquire defendants made many intentionally false and misleading statements and violated their statutory disclosure obligations under section 13 d of the securities exchange act of 1934 section 13 d in order to conceal the extent and purpose of li s and 1globe s ownership of sinovac stock in addition to misrepresenting the amount of sinovac stock that li and 1globe owned defendants misrepresented their secret plan to act in concert with other shareholders to try to take control of the company while sinovac knew that li and 1globe were acting in concert based on the company s private communications with them during the battle for control of the company this information was not known to public shareholders plaintiff and the class are sinovac shareholders that have been caught in the middle of this battle between sinovac s management and 1globe for control of the company while plaintiff and the class also seek to receive fair value if sinovac is taken private defendants behind the scenes scheming impeded this effort instead defendants have caused plaintiff and the class substantial harm by making them lose their ability to collect at least millions of shares they would have otherwise been entitled to under the rights agreement even the purchase of a single share of sinovac stock above the rights agreement s 15 thresholder constitutes a trigger event under the rights agreement all of li s and 1globe s purchases of sinovac stock that they made or directed to be made on their behalf after march 28 2016 therefore triggered

agreement to be delayed by several years if li had fully disclosed his ownership of sinovac stock as he was required to do under section 13 d it would have been clear as day that the rights agreement was triggered by may 2016 at the latest while sinovac knew enough information starting in 2016 largely based on private correspondence to determine that 1globe and li triggered the rights agreement defendants hid the full extent of their ownership of sinovac stock and their agreements in connection with the battle for control of the company defendants therefore also tortiously interfered with sinovac s contractual obligations to its shareholders under the rights agreement if 1globe and li s actions were disclosed publicly as they were required to be under section 13 d plaintiff s rights would have been exercisable based on that disclosure and an exchange would have occurred based on that date by misrepresenting the true nature of their ownership of sinovac stock defendants caused that date to be delayed almost three years until february 22 2019 resulting in plaintiff and the class losing their rights to acquire additional shares of sinovac stock for all of their shares that they sold in the interim while sinovac should have implemented the rights agreement in 2016 based on the information available to it at the time 1globe and li exacerbated the problem by violating

bloomberg the us dollar is expected to extend its gains increasing speculation that governments will stage unusual market interventions to drive up the value of the currencies on the losing end of the trade about 45 of 795 respondents to the latest mliv pulse survey expect an orchestrated attempt by major world powers to weaken the dollar even though the us has moved to tamp down talk of such a move nearly as many said they expect japan to step up its pricey efforts to shore up the yen by itself without the support of others two thirds of respondents see the bloomberg dollar spot index climbing to new highs over the next month the dollar has surged as international investors seize on higher us interest rates or seek a haven from market turmoil including in crisis ridden uk and emerging markets the rally is exaggerating the economic difficulties of nations around the world by pushing up prices of imported food and fuel that s putting further pressure on many central banks which have been raising interest rates in an effort to tamp down the surge in consumer prices the unstoppable dollar is also a drag on american corporate earnings by reducing the value of money made abroad almost 90 of survey respondents expect third quarter earnings to show more impact from the dollar than a quarter before the dollar s uptrend in the near term is going to persist said joseph lewis head of corporate hedging and fx solutions at jefferies llc in the long term the world will shift and some of the other currencies will bounce back but human behavior tells me that it feels like being in the us is just a better place now the dollar has been pulled higher by the federal reserve s most aggressive policy tightening since the early 1980s which has pushed up us bond yields the bloomberg dollar index has risen 14 this year with the currency gaining even more against the pound and yen the pound collapsed to a record low in late september due to the concerns over the uk s deep tax cut plans japan spent 19 7 billion on its first intervention since 1998 to bolster the currency but the surprise move didn t bring long lasting results on monday the yen weakened past 145 per dollar nearing the level where japanese authorities intervened to support the currency last month unlike the fed the bank of japan has been keeping interest rates low there s a big divergence between central banks monetary policy with the fed being very hawkish and some others actually dovish such as the bank of japan and people s bank of china said nancy davis founder of quadratic capital management it s making the dollar incredibly strong president joe biden s administration has little incentive to weaken the dollar since it could put further pressure on us inflation and white house national economic council director brian deese said he doesn t expect any agreement among major economies to counter the currency s strength but mliv survey respondents said a sharper runup could spark such a move the last time there was a major round of coordinated action to weaken the dollar was in the 1980s when the uk france west germany japan and the us agreed to act in concert in the effort dubbed the plaza accord japan in 2011 was able to secure group of seven support for intervention after the tsunami and during the asian financial crisis g 7 members also cooperated to shore up the euro in september 2000 any potential coordinated currency intervention could lead to significant bounces in most currencies versus the dollar in the two months following the plaza accord the dollar fell by over 10 with the total decline over the next two years peaking at almost 50 currently many investors have taken long positions in the dollar and an intervention to weaken it would trigger a wave of selling the pound and the euro are already in a semi currency crisis and eventually we might even need some central banks coordination if this continues adrian zuercher head of global asset allocation at ubs global wealth management told bloomberg tv in an interview read more how and when japan intervenes in currency markets quicktake the strong dollar is also causing harm

something they can ignore but a 20 move is something they kind of have to contend with some mliv pulse respondents also listed emerging markets debt crisis refinancing and liquidity issues as

scharfsinn86 istock via getty images note i have covered ballard power systems nasdaq bldp previously so investors should view this as an update to my earlier articles on the company last week leading canadian fuel cell systems developer ballard power systems ballard or ballard power announced plans to deepen its global manufacturing footprint in europe the united states and china to support global market demand growth through 2030 as part of this new local for local strategy the company has entered into an investment agreement with the government of anting in shanghai s jiading district to establish its new china headquarters membrane electrode assembly mea manufacturing facility and r d center at a site strategically located at the jiading hydrogen port located in one of china s leading automotive industry clusters over the next three years ballard plans to invest approximately 130 million with the target of establishing large scale mea production capacity sufficient for 20 000 fuel cell engines which would be more than double the recently expanded capacity of its vancouver facility with the new mea capacity coming online in china ballard now expects its global mea capacity to support total demand requirements through the second half of the decade this investment is expected to reduce mea manufacturing costs align with china s fuel cell value chain localization policy and position ballard more strongly in the hydrogen fuel cell demonstration cluster regions and for the post subsidy market please note that this latest move is already ballard s fourth attempt to gain traction in the chinese market but in contrast to its previous strategy of protecting core ip by supplying meas solely from its vancouver facility the company will soon manufacture its core product in china which apparently bears the risk of ballard actively contributing to its future obsolescence in the chinese market in fact this is what the chinese government s most recent subsidy policy framework is all about as it replaced the previous direct subsidy scheme on fuel cell electric vehicle fcev sales to reward eligible city clusters for the development of a more comprehensive fcev value chain over a multi year demonstration period ihs markit since the subsidy scheme on vehicle sales has not produced significant results the government shifted its approach to incentivizing breakthroughs in key core technologies and industrialization of basic materials to improve economics across the fcev entire value chain clearly ballard didn t have much of a choice anymore as the company s much touted joint venture with weichai power has largely failed to produce tangible results partially due to the fact that it is located in shandong a province that has not been selected for the first batch of hydrogen city clusters but even with ballard power now apparently willing to share its core ip with chinese partners the new facility is not expected to commence operations before 2025 as the chinese fuel cell market remains in its infancy moreover with the new subsidy approach apparently directed towards establishing a complete domestic fuel cell technology and hydrogen supply chain over time any near term impact on fcev adoption is likely to remain limited keep in mind that ballard s recently expanded vancouver facility remains underutilized so increasing total production capacity by more than 200 looks aggressive even when assuming the chinese fcev market gaining traction over time in addition at the current sales pace the joint venture with weichai power won t have to order additional meas from the company for another three years bottom line ballard power has been caught between a rock and a hard place in china with the government s latest subsidy framework more or less requiring the company to establish domestic manufacturing operations for its core mea product with the apparent risk of being crowded out of the chinese market over the long term by domestic competitors after successfully accessing the company s ip in addition there won t be any short and medium term benefits to ballard s top and bottom line in fact the required 130 million investment will consume approximately 15 of the company s cash balance and increase operating expenses quite meaningfully but even when assuming the project to increase the company s annual cash burn rate to approximately 250 million ballard power s liquidity of close to 1 billion should still carry the company well into 2026 quite frankly only the company s large cash balance of approximately 3 35 per common share is keeping me from downgrading shares to sell on this latest headscratcher

medtronic repeatedly assured investors that the minimed 780g model was on track for approval by the u s food and drug administration fda and would provide medtronic with the edge it needed to close a growing gap with its competitors in the diabetes market medtronic made these representations despite known issues with the minimed 600 series models indeed in november 2019 the company issued a warning that certain minimed 600 series insulin pumps might have damaged pump retainer rings which could cause the system to release too much insulin and instructed customers with damaged rings to contact the company for replacements on february 7 2020 the fda classified medtronic s november 2019 notification as a class i recall the most serious type of recall problems with the minimed 600 series mushroomed in october 2021 when the company expanded its recall to all minimed model 630g and 670g insulin pump systems whether or not any retainer ring damage was actually visible despite

continued to surface on may 26 2022 when medtronic reported its financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022 and provided guidance for fiscal year 2023 notably medtronic disclosed that as a result of the company s need to improve its quality control system and its expectation that the minimed 780g model which defendants had repeatedly identified as crucial to future

the risk of regulatory investigation and action 4 as a result of the company s misconduct the fda would delay the approval of additional medtronic minimed devices including the minimed 780g 5 these delays in product approvals as well as the company s need to improve its quality control systems would negatively affect medtronic s financial performance and cause it to fall further behind its

the parallels between 2008 and 2022 just keep getting stronger 14 years ago the collapse of lehman brothers sent a massive wave of panic through global financial markets and is widely considered to be the key event that plunged us into a horrifying financial crisis that we still talk about to this day well now an even larger bank appears to be on the brink of collapse and analysts all over the world are deeply concerned about what that will mean for the global financial system if it does fail right now credit suisse is one of the most important banks in the entire world if you are not

important bank credit suisse is also primary dealer and forex counterparty of the fed credit suisse is truly one of the central hubs of the entire international banking system if it were to fail the ripple effects would be felt very deeply in literally every nation on the planet unfortunately it is being reported that credit suisse could be on the verge of collapse and we are being warned that if it does collapse it could cause a shock similar to that caused by the bankruptcy of the u s bank lehman brothers in september 2008 speculation surrounding the future of the swiss banking giant has been going on for several months in the markets in business and political circles as well as on social networks the no 2 swiss bank and one of the largest banks in the world is in deep trouble and is currently fighting for its survival a negative outcome is likely to cause a shock similar to that caused by the bankruptcy of the u s bank lehman brothers in september 2008 this event triggered one of the most serious financial and economic crises since the great depression when lehman brothers collapsed in 2008 it had 639 billion dollars in assets in late 2022 credit suisse currently has 1 5 trillion dollars of assets under management the collapse of credit suisse would create a wave of panic that would be unlike anything that we have seen since the last financial crisis but new ceo

be cut with assets sold off some analysts are saying it won t be enough however according to a bloomberg report credit suisse is estimated to need a further 4 billion swiss francs even after asset sales to fund the restructuring with a capital raise touted as the most likely option are the markets buying what koerner is selling nope credit suisse credit default swaps just keep going the wrong

that it has ever experienced the bond market is starting to go bonkers and now giant financial institutions such as credit suisse are being greatly shaken martin armstrong was recently interviewed by greg hunter and he boldly declared that a crisis in banking will start in europe so could europe suck the rest of the world down the tubes armstrong says oh absolutely europe is the problem the crisis in banking will start in europe the debt is collapsing they have no way to sustain themselves the debt market over there is undermining the stability of all the banks you have to understand that reserves are tied to government debt and this is the perfect storm yes the u s stock market will go down short term we are not facing a 1929 event or a 90 fall here europeans probably by january of 2023 as this crisis in ukraine escalates anybody with half a brain is going to take whatever money they have and get it over here i am not as optimistic about u s financial markets as armstrong seems to be yes europe is currently in worse shape but things are starting to unravel quite rapidly here too in fact we just witnessed the worst month for u s stocks since the very early days of the pandemic september was a horrible month for stocks the dow fell nearly 9 its worst monthly drop since march 2020 when pandemic lockdowns started in the united states the index ended friday deeply in the red too overall this is the very first time that the dow jones industrial average has been down for three quarters in a row since 2015 and it is the very first time that the s p 500 and the nasdaq have been down for three quarters in a row since 2009 a lot of people out there still seem to think that things will return to normal very soon and unfortunately all of those people are very wrong the truth is that we are right on the precipice of the sort of historic meltdown that i have been relentlessly warning was coming our leaders kicked the can down the road for a long time but now they are

on sunday morning the michigan nurses association mna the parent union of the university of michigan professional nurse council umpnc which represents 6 200 nurses at michigan medicine announced the ratification of the tentative agreement reached late last month between union negotiators and negotiators for the university of michigan based hospital system the union claimed that 95 percent of nurses who cast ballots voted to ratify the agreement however as of this writing it has not provided vote totals michigan medicine is the hospital system affiliated with the university of michigan the largest public university system in the state with 30 000 total employees a 2 1 billion endowment and 5 5 billion in annual revenue notwithstanding its status as a non profit health care system michigan medicine had an operating margin of 233 million in its most recent fiscal year on september 22 the mna umpnc announced that a tentative agreement had been reached it then proceeded to push through the deal by means of a completely undemocratic process union officials declared the agreement a victory and claimed it met the nurses basic demands for mandatory staffing ratios to end unsafe under staffing and an end to mandatory overtime the impossible working conditions for nurses have been intensified since the outbreak of the covid pandemic with the hospital system eliminating hundreds of positions and driving other nurses to leave due to overwork and burnout the union released only its contract highlights which sought to present the agreement in the best possible light but in fact demonstrated that the deal failed to meet any of the nurses demands union officials only posted the actual 167 page contract on tuesday night september 27 having scheduled ratification meetings to being the next day wednesday september 28 rank and file nurses were given no time to study the agreement which will largely dictate their work lives for the next four years or prepare questions to be addressed by union officials at the ratification meetings these anti democratic procedures were consciously implemented by the union to dissipate the militant determination of the nurses to fight for decent staffing levels and working conditions as well as wage increases to meet soaring inflation that militancy was expressed in a 96 percent vote by nurses to authorize a strike at the beginning of september already two months after the expiration of the previous contract the strike vote was part of a wave of struggles by nurses and health care workers across the country and internationally including strikes in northern california and minnesota and a strike vote by nurses in western new york state a reading of the agreement demonstrates that none of the issues of concern to nurses have been resolved michigan medicine nurses discharging patient most significantly nurses had insisted that they could not provide adequate patient care and their own safety was impacted by the untenable ratio of patients to nurses the intransigence of hospital management on this point insisting that such ratios were its prerogative and that it was not legal to even bargain over them led to the umpnc filing a charge of unfair labor practices with the michigan employment relations commission merc in august the negotiator for hospital management claimed that the ratios of patients to nurses in various departments constituted non mandatory and illegal subjects of bargaining the tentative agreement does in fact list ratios of patients to nurses for various departments but makes abundantly clear that such ratios are only guidelines and that he parties agree that a process to determine staffing levels to provide nursing care for the projected nursing workload in the patient care units is necessary what is this process to be first it should be noted that the sentences immediately preceding the call for a process state that staffing levels should permit the delivery of safe transformative patient care emphasis added then the document abruptly indicates that the university will maintain current levels of staffing these are the levels however that have led to overwork burnout and resignations throughout the hospital system in these passages management is making clear that it has no intention of hiring a significant number of nurses to establish the proper ratio of patients to nurses furthermore management retains the right to make significant changes to the staffing model and is required only to notify the union the union may object but this merely triggers a workload review committee to call a meeting with the associate chief nursing officer and chief nursing officer matters unsettled there can be escalated to the chief nurse executive and a joint implementation team should any complaint about staffing miraculously survive this nightmarish bureaucratic process it is then sent to arbitration and mediation where the odds are stacked in management s favor there is a similar byzantine process to handle disputes concerning compliance with the already compromised staffing model complaints about compliance differ however in that they end up going before a tripartite panel comprising a representative of the union a representative of hospital management and an arbitrator jointly selected by the union and management the tripartite panel is empowered to award 200 to each nurse during the period of the shift that is in dispute even were such damages to be awarded in a break with the current experience of nurses who have found their assignment despite objection grievances overwhelmingly shelved there is no requirement for the hospital to hire more nurses as for the issue of mandatory overtime the michigan nurses association says that it is ended by the new agreement except in select emergency situations just what are these situations and what does the contract say on the subject the agreement states p 37 that overtime assignments should be filled by volunteers two pages later it explicitly states the parties agree that in the operation of a tertiary care medical care facility some overtime over appointment is unavoidable management is required only to provide an explanation for ot oa greater than 5 percent of all hours worked in that pay period if ot oa is greater than 7 5 percent for three consecutive four week periods then a penalty is paid of 100 per nurse on a unit up to a maximum of 7 500 rather than being used to hire more staff the penalty money is to be used for educational professional or patient care related unit needs it is far from clear how this supposed penalty redresses the staffing shortage or how it differs from spending management may already be planning notwithstanding these passages the agreement argues that the university and the association agree to eliminate mandatory overtime except in cases of emergency situations among possible examples enumerated is a hospital emergency which is unforeseen and could not have been prudently planned for or anticipated by the hospital and that substantially affects the delivery of medical care or increases the need for health care services perhaps concerned that this definition is so vague as to permit nearly any set of events being designated an emergency situation the paragraph says that holidays and typical levels of absenteeism do not constitute such an emergency but what about covid 19 monkeypox the next pandemic from the definition provided above any of these would be considered emergency situations thus the supposed prohibition on mandatory overtime is little more than window dressing to conceal the continued ability and intention of management to impose overtime on nurses as it sees fit based on considerations of profit not the safety of either nurses or patients as for pay increases the 7 5 percent increase in the first year and 6 percent 5 percent and 4 percent in the following three years fall well below the current rate of inflation and will mean a cut in real pay and purchasing power the lump sum bonuses 5 000 this year and 2 000 to those still employed in 2026 are intended to coerce a vote for the agreement from nurses with immediate and pressing financial needs including student debt among the newest hires median debt is more than 40 000 for nurses beginning their careers today the michigan medicine nurses contract dispute marked a critical element of a broader wave of militancy among health care workers in the us and internationally and throughout the global working class of particular note 15 000 nurses carried out a three day strike in minnesota last month 2 000 mental health workers remain on strike in northern california against kaiser permanente nurses at chris o brien lifehouse a hospital in new south wales in australia have just rejected a contract that offered a mere 3 percent pay increase a massive cut in real terms nurses at henderson hospital in nevada refused to clock in on august 28 due to under staffing the determination of the nurses at michigan medicine to fight coming so close to the midterm congressional and gubernatorial elections frightened the union officials and spurred the hurried announcement of a tentative agreement that varied little in fundamentals from the previous positions of hospital management going back to expiration of the contract on july 1 the world socialist web site called on nurses to reject the agreement based on the previously released highlights the ratification of the agreement does not signify the end of the struggle by nurses at michigan medicine it will on the contrary set the stage for an intensification of attacks by hospital management under conditions of falling stock prices rising interest rates and imminent recession it makes all the more urgent the construction of a rank and file committee of nurses and other health care workers in the hospital system independent of the pro corporate union to enforce staffing and safety standards and link their struggles with those of other health care workers across the us and around the world fighting for high quality care for all and an end to for profit medicine

bloomberg bloomberg bloomberg the world economy is showing signs of a rapid downshift as it contends with a series of shocks some of them self inflicted by policymakers increasing the likelihood of another global recession and the danger of major financial disruptions we re living through a period of elevated risk former us treasury secretary lawrence summers told wall street week with david westin on bloomberg television for whom he is a paid contributor in the same way that people became anxious in august of 2007 i think this is a moment when there should be increased anxiety at the heart of the strain the fallout from the most aggressive hiking of interest rates since the 1980s having failed to foresee the surge in inflation to multi decade highs the federal reserve and most peers are now lifting rates at speed in a bid to restore price stability and their own credibility evidence of the impact and of the blow to consumers purchasing power from soaring prices is mounting quickly in the past several days nike inc reported a surging stockpile of unsold product fedex corp shocked with a warning on delivery volumes and key chipmaker south korea saw the first drop in semiconductor output in four years as demand retreats apple inc is backing off plans to boost output of its new iphones bloomberg reported the turn is coming even before the full thrust of monetary tightening is felt the fed and many counterparts are pledging to keep going with steep rate hikes as they attempt to rebuild credibility quantitative tightening programs where central banks remove liquidity by shrinking bond portfolios are also just getting going inflation data showcase the need for as fed vice chair lael brainard put it friday avoiding pulling back prematurely on tightening she spoke shortly after the fed s preferred measure of prices jumped more than forecast earlier data showed euro zone inflation has punched into double digits layered on top of continuing reverberations from the russian invasion of ukraine the spreading economic gloom is sowing fear in financial markets creating its own worrying dynamic a rapidly appreciating dollar supercharged by the fed may help cool us inflation but it drives it up elsewhere by weakening other currencies pressuring authorities to restrain their own economies the global economy is in the eye of a new storm reserve bank of india governor shaktikanta das said friday after lifting rates again prospects for a second global recession so soon after the 2020 downturn triggered by the pandemic were hardly apparent a year ago but europe s russian induced energy crisis and china s deepening property slump and continued covid zero approach weren t part of the consensus outlook not all is dark with us job market resilience a notable feature but the plans by facebook parent meta platforms inc for the first reduction in headcount ever illustrate how that may still change and britain s experience in recent days showcases how investors are in a mood to punish policymakers pursuing approaches deemed unsustainable the bank of england was forced to intervene in its bond market after the new uk government announced 45 billion of unfunded tax cuts markets are concerned about fiscal policies becoming even looser despite inflation or the dollar getting excessively strong said cui li head of macro research at ccb international securities ltd nike s troubles showed how the dollar s appreciation is causing issues not just for developing nations that issued debt in the us currency sri lanka pakistan and argentina are among those turning to the imf for help but also for american multinational companies the athletics wear giant on thursday downgraded its outlook citing foreign exchange effects and higher freight costs which are a symptom of supply chain delays and port congestion that s besides the need to embrace price markdowns given unsold stock north american inventories climbed 65 in the three months through august housing markets are also turning walloped by surging mortgage rates the us in the past week saw the first decline in home prices in a decade the question is how low growth will go and for how long it will stay down said s p global chief economist paul gruenwald perhaps the biggest x factor is the potential for financial turmoil as the dollar which has appreciated almost 14 this year as measured by the bloomberg dollar spot index exerts pressure across markets combine that with rapid increases in borrowing costs and it spells the potential for trouble summers the ex treasury chief said you can never be certain about what the consequences of that will be that has echoes of the summer of 2007 when the impact of the collapsing us housing market first began showing up in the financial system with the closure of a number of funds and sudden liquidity shortfalls among banks things eventually morphed the following year into the worst financial crisis since the great depression rising anxiety across global markets can be seen in the bank of america merrill lynch gfsi market risk indicator a measure of future price swings implied by options trading on equities interest rates currencies and commodities the gauge has jumped to the highest since march 2020 when markets were in full blown pandemic panic given the need to address inflation diminished fiscal space in the wake of record spending on the pandemic and varying priorities across major economies the potential for joint action to address challenges may be in question the incoherent macro policies within countries and absence of policy coordination across countries are both problematic said cui li at ccb it all makes for a potentially tension filled gathering of global finance chiefs next week for the annual international monetary fund and world bank oct 10 16 in washington

menafn jordan times wellington there are many legitimate complaints about work in the gig economy but in time many of the gigs will be automated eliminating a significant source of work for immigrants and the less educated and as these jobs disappear so too will social contacts between socioeconomic classes and between immigrants and natives the broader question then is the impact of the impending loss of involuntary social mixing on diverse multiethnic societies consider uber which provides work to many immigrants according to the company s website uber is keen to foster happiness and inclusiveness by means of global cultural and community events to increase and enhance cross cultural learning and understanding but while that people centered message certainly sounds nice uber has placed its hopes and its future profitability in automated vehicles avs in anticipation of its disappointing 2019 initial public offering uber disclosed losses of 1 8 billion for the previous year owing partly to its payout of 1 billion in driver referrals and other incentives to gig workers since the ipo the company s stock has struggled because it has yet to demonstrate that it can turn a profit with its human driver model avs are an obvious potential solution to this problem as uber s founder travis kalanick foresaw back in 2013 viewing a google driverless car prototype he concluded that the minute your car becomes real i can take the dude out of the front seat i call that margin expansion needless to say gig work in the sharing economy has disappointed earlier expectations that it would produce an explosion of micro entrepreneurship driving an uber is no one s dream job and the company s drivers have found themselves locked in a protracted battle for better pay and work conditions nonetheless we should bear in mind the social interactions that will be lost when all ubers indeed all transportation become driverless the same concerns apply to retail work which amazon plans to eliminate through its amazon go cashier less convenience stores again retail is nobody s dream job not least because it does not pay well but if we eliminate all these positions what occasions will we have to interact with others unlike ourselves humans are naturally gregarious animals our happiness depends on being with other humans but this fundamental trait combines awkwardly with another feature of our evolved psychologies suspicion of strangers this makes perfect sense when one considers that the forager bands of our pleistocene ancestors had around 50 100 members many of whom were related in fact humankind s crowning achievement is not the moon landing or the invention of the computer it is that we the descendants of xenophobic hunter gatherers have built sprawling diverse societies comprising tens of millions of strangers though many students who attend diverse colleges say they enjoy meeting new kinds of people research shows that even these social butterflies tend to stick with their own only when they join the working world do they find that they have no option but to get along with strangers who look sound and act unlike themselves but even then our shy occasionally murderous inner apes will reassert themselves in times of stress or political and economic uncertainty in recent years some of us have found it disturbingly easy to imagine that all immigrants are bringing drugs crime and disease into our countries and social media s biased sampling of our online expression has aggravated this problem as well as deepened social partisan and other divisions how will we form social connections and develop empathy in an economy where teachers baristas cab drivers and retail clerks have all become highly efficient machines we certainly cannot count on social platforms like twitter where our murderous inner apes reign supreme let us return to the example of uber when you hail a ride you can act insultingly or simply sit sullenly but this may affect your rating in the future nearby drivers may skip over you for higher rated passengers but if you engage your drivers in interested and polite conversation you will most likely maintain a good rating better yet these incentives generally lead to enjoyable exchanges you might just learn something interesting from someone you would not otherwise have met as for retail clerks there has been much discussion about the growing social divide between workers in san francisco s flourishing tech industry and all those who perform traditional services for them store clerks do not get to rate google software engineers as customers but at least when they come face to face each gets a glimpse of the other when an initiative proposing a higher minimum wage or more spending on affordable housing appears on the ballot those software engineers may be more likely to support it because they can picture whom it will benefit if amazon go eliminates such encounters san francisco already has four stores will they still support social policies that do not help them directly to be sure commentators in 2030 will probably look back at the introduction of amazon go as the beginning of the end of the human store clerk but as citizens of diverse democracies we should recognise what is at stake when we use technology to disintermediate economic interactions there may come a time when we need to subsidise expensive less efficient work much as we do now with renewable energy the fact is that we need other humans in our lives to avoid despair and we need encounters with those unlike ourselves to sustain our diverse democracies automating service jobs may solve some problems but it will create plenty of new ones will the tradeoff be worth it nicholas agar is professor of ethics at

it is the kind of thing that one typically finds in developing countries with weak institutions not in the issuer of the world s reserve currency and the custodian of the world s most sophisticated financial markets where many other countries and companies entrust their savings the comparison is even more troubling when one considers what the recent market turmoil implies for starters markets see a central bank that as hard as it tries is still struggling to catch up with both market expectations and what is needed to contain cost of living pressures having been consistently pushed by markets to do more and for good reason given that core inflation is running at 6 3 percent and still rising the fed s latest policy actions duly caused another sharp reduction in prices for both stocks and bonds second markets see a central bank that expects to cause more collateral damage as it tries to meet its inflation target fed chairman jerome powell said as much this month when he continued to distance himself from the possibility of a soft or softish landing as he once put it powell has now repeatedly signalled more pain ahead implying an uncomfortably high probability of recession advertisement the market appears to agree with this outlook the yield curve is inverted with the yield on ten year treasury bonds having fallen to around 40 basis points below that on two year bonds ominously these market signals indicate that the us economy and therefore the global economy lacks both a monetary policy anchor and a sufficiently credible central bank as a result the us needs more monetary policy tightening than it would have if the fed had reacted in a timely and credible fashion that will indeed produce pain in the form of foregone growth actual and potential and higher unemployment which will hit the most vulnerable segments of society the hardest for the global economy this will translate into even greater growth fragility at a time when europe is heading into recession china s performance is increasingly lagging its economic potential and little fires are burning across the developing world despite this increased fragility many other central banks will have no choice but to follow the fed in raising interest rates beyond what would have otherwise been needed in order to avoid importing more damaging inflation and unsettling financial instability advertisement now that the fed finds itself in such an uncomfortable situation one mostly of its own making it may be inclined to eschew further rate hikes particularly given the growing criticism that it is tipping the economy into recession destroying wealth and fuelling instability yet such a course of action would risk repeating the monetary policy mistake of the 1970s saddling america and the world with an even longer period of stagflationary trends instead the fed should be doing much more to contain the adverse spillovers of its policy mistake including through innovative thinking about its monetary policy framework and more proactive collaboration with other policymaking entities domestic and abroad sadly it is too late to avoid all the detrimental economic and social consequences of the damage the fed has caused to its own credibility the central bank was notably late with its response to inflation but it is not too late to contain the harm doing so is crucial project syndicate project syndicate
menafn jordan times munich inflation is galloping in the eurozone as the euro tumbles in august 2022 annual eurozone inflation reached 9 1 per cent and rates exceeding 20 per cent are now being registered in the baltic countries in may 2021 a euro would have cost you more than 1 20 on september 27 you could buy one for 0 96 is the european central bank ecb to blame loss of confidence in the euro jeopardises the monetary union s stability because it can fuel an inflationary spiral and lead to capital flight the united kingdom is currently grappling with these dynamics and the eurozone could well be next recent inflation news from the eurozone s largest member germany is particularly alarming in august producer prices which measure what is happening at the preliminary stages of industrial production were a whopping 46 per cent higher than in the same month last year given the long term correlation between the growth rate of producer and consumer prices this suggests that the latter could soar to 14 per cent in november price stability which is supposed to be the ecb s uncompromising goal per the maastricht treaty is no longer perceptible the ecb denies that it bears any responsibility for the eurozone s current inflation struggles after all it could not control the pandemic or russian president vladimir putin s decision to invade ukraine but pointing to these exogenous events is nothing more than a diversionary tactic in fact there is good reason to believe that the ecb contributed significantly to current inflation probably even more than other central banks have done in their respective economies since the 2008 global economic crisis the ecb has allowed the central bank money supply to increase twice as fast relative to economic output as the us federal reserve has of that growth 83 per cent was the result of the ecb s purchases of government bonds from eurozone countries with those purchases which totaled an estimated 4 4 trillion euros the ecb pushed interest rates on government bonds to around zero this spurred countries to disregard european debt rules and accumulate debt at a breakneck pace in 2020 the european commission joined the ecb in its expansionary endeavor the european union s 750 billion euros in additional borrowing was presented as an effort to help all eu countries cope with the effects of the covid 19 pandemic in reality it was intended primarily to support the weaker economies of the mediterranean region as a result of these measures the eu s overall government debt including debt held at the eu level will be pushed well beyond 100 per cent of gdp since government debt increases aggregate demand this has had a clear impact on inflation while pandemic related supply chain bottlenecks and the energy crisis induced by the ukraine war were the sparks sovereign debt was the tinder without it the inflation fire would not have spread at such a rapid pace the ecb has further contributed to inflationary pressures by weakening the euro while the fed began sending clear signals in june 2021 that it would begin raising interest rates in the foreseeable future the ecb aggressively defended its ultra loose monetary policy until july 2022 when it implemented its first rate hike in 11 years which was followed by a somewhat more substantial hike in september as a result the interest rate differential between the us and the eurozone continued to grow spurring investors to flee europe for america in droves in the three weeks after the rate increase in september the dollar rose 4 per cent above parity with the euro since the fed s first announcement in june 2021 that it might raise rates the dollar has appreciated by roughly 20 per cent against the euro as the euro weakened prices for imported goods and services rose and european exporters were able to raise prices without losing market share although the prices of goods and services that are not traded internationally were not immediately affected it is only a matter of time before they will follow suit meanwhile energy prices in particular are soaring the revaluation of the dollar alone increased oil prices expressed in euros by 25 per cent in addition to the increase in the dollar price resulting from supply shortages even the prices of natural gas were affected by the revaluation which represents a notable shift from the past when european gas prices were set largely independently of global markets the difference now is that as putin has turned off europe s tap liquefied natural gas traded on world markets has become the marginal source of supply capping the price hike in terms of euros at a level that is higher the more the euro depreciates the ecb has tried to exculpate itself by pointing out that the increase in energy prices accounts for a good third of european inflation but it has yet to own up to the fact that it bears significant responsibility for even this component owing to its role in driving the euro s depreciation when it comes to eurozone inflation including energy prices the ecb shares the blame with putin and opec hans werner sinn professor emeritus of economics at the

the colorado workforce center on galena street is pictured on april 2 2020 in frisco the town has approved the purchase of the property to turn it into more local workforce housing liz copan summit daily news archive the town of frisco has approved the purchase of 602 galena st to turn it into more local workforce housing the property in the past has been the colorado workforce center the town has eyed the property for several months and during that time frisco staff have negotiated with state staff on terms of the sale agreement which include property purchase lease back to department of labor and employment during project development design temporary office space for the department during construction and a permanent department office the new development this is actually a fairly momentous step on a long road to get to this point but it s also just the very start of another really long process frisco community development director don reimer said but the result will be that we ll have a great workforce housing product project at the location where we currently have an underutilized building in downtown frisco in october 2021 the property which is about 0 72 acres and includes a 4 153 square foot building that currently houses 11 employees was appraised at 3 million and according to the contract the cost was finalized at just over 2 49 million the purchase contract includes provisions that deed restrict the availability of future units to individuals or households whose gross annual household income does not exceed 125 of the area median income for summit county as of april the current area median income for one person was a salary of 91 625 and the income is 117 875 annually for a three person household rental rates for one two and three bedroom units at that range would respectively max out at 2 454 2 946 and 3 403 the state also has a desire to include some future workforce housing and workforce center offices on this site so the contract represents that and acknowledges that as well and also provides consideration for reduced future lease rates which is why the purchase price rather than the appraised value of 3 million is 2 5 million dollars because there s some consideration with that reimer said so we save half a million dollars in future revenues in august of this year summit county entered an intergovernmental agreement with the town to provide 1 5 million for the purchase council members voted unanimously to approve the purchase staff estimates that the space could create several dozen housing units for the town s housing stock once a project is completed at this time a potential development program for the property has not been created however with a parcel of this size up to 40 dwelling units could be constructed by utilizing bonus density a memo from reimer and housing program manager danelle cook reads preliminary costs to create 28 36 units at 400 to 550 per square foot would be on the low end at 13 44 million and on the high end at 21 03 million

industry said many of the new names on the list are entrepreneurs in the manufacturing and technology sectors and the list will only increase with schemes like the pli edited excerpts it s practically impossible to predict markets with any degree of accuracy in the short term having said that several factors could indicate a downward trend in the immediate future a recession in the us is a strong possibility so the heavyweights like tcs and infosys could be affected if american firms cut back on expenses additionally the ukraine war shows no sign of ending this will continue to be a drag on international markets especially europe on the other hand the indian manufacturing sector continues its robust growth pmi data is positive inflation seems to be broadly in control and the domestic economy is chugging along quite nicely so there are things pushing the market down and pulling it up but the india story is very much intact while market sentiment is likely to stay volatile owing to macroeconomic conditions we retain a bullish outlook for the medium to long term we expect companies to turn in good to stellar results but there are some dark clouds on the horizon companies with high imports could take a hit because of the falling rupee according to the rbi s financial stability report for june about 44 of the overseas funds raised by corporates are unhedged nevertheless a weaker rupee is good news for exporters especially it companies at this point i think we should remember that some sectors are doing exceptionally well fmcg companies have returned to double digit growth this year the auto sector is booming with demand for new vehicles going through the roof maruti suzuki has a reported 377 000 pending bookings we do expect some pleasant surprises when the september numbers are announced gold prices have been on the downswing for the last few months but with the marriage season around the corner this could change indeed there was a pent up demand for gold and many people had to defer their marriages because of covid 19 but now the pendulum has swung the other way while we re optimistic about gold prices in the near future you shouldn t lose track of the fact that gold is a defensive investment and should remain a small percentage of any investment portfolio the pli scheme could be a game changer for many industries we expect to see its positive impact in solar electronics pharma special steel and auto among others and this will have an impact on the stock prices note that the indian stock market has been consistently performing for decades over the last 32 years stocks have generated a 12 percent annual return in dollar terms that s an excellent record by any standards and we see this trend continuing the pli scheme will only

could be a good option if you re conservative but if you re more adventurous a mix of a nifty 50 fund a small cap fund and a mid cap fund may give you better returns in fact buying individual small or mid cap stocks can provide you with higher returns however this is considered a higher risk approach as i mentioned earlier in this interview there s no ideal portfolio mix it depends on your risk appetite small cap funds make sense for investors with high tolerance for volatility some may opt for mid caps that could become large caps but if you re risk averse stick to large cap mutual funds one big reason for investing in a small cap stock is that most investors are on the lookout for the next great growth company small cap stocks can give better returns compared with large cap stocks investors must not lose sight of the risks involved do your research and be extra careful about the claims the company or people in the know are making be especially watchful about pump and dump

as of close of business friday the bond market was tipping that australia s official cash rate ocr would peak at 4 10 in mid 2023 which is 1 75 above its current level of 2 35 under the bond market s ocr forecast australia s average discount variable mortgage rate would climb to 7 45 well over double the 3 45 that presided immediately before the reserve bank of australia s rba first rate hike in may and the highest discount variable mortgage rate since october 2008 advertisement the impact on australian mortgage holders would be devastating with average monthly repayments on a typical variable rate mortgage soaring by 56 versus their level immediately before the rba s first rate hike for a borrower with a 500 000 mortgage this would represent an increase of 1 248 in monthly repayments a vicious blow advertisement i have said from the get go that i believe the bond market s ocr forecasts are too hawkish and would push australia into a painful recession if they came to fruition this is primarily because household consumption is by far the economy s strongest driver and consumption would collapse through the combined impacts of 1 australian households having far less disposable income at their disposal and 2 crashing housing values alan kohler has given a similar assessment describing the bond market s ocr forecast as more psycho than psychic and warning that further aggressive rate hikes from the rba would be reckless heartless and dangerous kohler therefore is calling on the rba to halt rate hikes forecasts for the decline in house prices now range between 20 and 30 per cent which would be the biggest fall in history a 20 per cent fall in values means that hundreds of thousands of families will be living in a house worth less than they paid for at least five years possibly 10 what s more many of them will owe more on the house than it is worth so they ll have zero equity while scrimping to meet repayments and worrying about keeping their job is it necessary in the united states perhaps but not in australia in australia wage growth is about 3 per cent half the rise in consumer prices and inflation here is due to an energy price shock increased demand from the pandemic cash flood supply problems and rising profits not wages there are three reasons the rba has done enough already first as discussed apra s mortgage repayment buffer has been absorbed and house prices have begun their biggest ever crash second immigration has been rebooted and cheap labour is starting to flood back into the country and third commodity prices have already fallen 20 per cent including a 35 per cent fall in the oil price in anticipation of recessions in the us europe and china the rba has done enough it would be reckless heartless and dangerous to keep raising interest rates advertisement hear hear australian wages are growing well below the 3 5 level the rba previously nominated as consistent with keeping inflation within the target band over the medium term moreover the federal government has just launched the largest immigration program in the nation s history which will add a huge amount of labour supply next year and crush any prospect of accelerating wage growth the rba should ignore the bond market and focus on the local economy because it risks breaking it if it hikes too far too quickly advertisement

new york ny oct 02 2022 globe newswire gtii otcqb global tech industries group inc gtii or the company www gtii us com announced today that management after further market study and input from its legal team has decided that it is in the best interest of the shareholders of the company to keep the original exercise price of the warrants it distributed last year the warrants such decision was made because the common stock underlying the warrants were registered with the securities and exchange commission the sec in a registration statement on form s 1 the s 1 that was declared effective on august 26 2021 with an exercise price of 2 75 a change to that exercise price would require an amendment to the s 1 which could cause the shares common stock issued pursuant to a new exercise price to not be registered at the time of issuance as the warrant distribution was originally instituted to reward loyal shareholders and allow them to trade the registered shares of common stock underlying the warrants the change to the exercise price has been abandoned and the warrants will remain priced as registered for resale by the named selling shareholders in the s 1 therefore such shareholders are eligible to exercise their warrants at the initial exercise price and receive shares of common stock registered for resale in the s 1 by contacting liberty stock transfer inc liberty the company s transfer agent please contact liberty stock transfer inc liberty for more information at the following address gtiiwarrants libertystocktransfer com

it was not cheery news on the trading floor of the nigerian exchange limited ngx as activities on the stock market took a negative turn last tuesday following the increase of the monetary policy rate mpr for the third consecutive time to stabilise prices indeed aggressive monetary policy tightening by the central bank of nigeria cbn which has pushed the mpr from 14 per cent to 15 5 per cent to curtail rising inflation has ripped the stock market off over n96 billion within three trading sessions the capitalisation of listed equities which stood at n26 547 trillion on the eve of the pronouncement on monday september 26 2022 depreciated by n96 billion in three trading sessions to close at n26 451 trillion on friday while the all share index asi which measures the performance of quoted companies slumped by 194 19 points or 0 4 per cent from 49 218 35 to 49 024 16 in a sharp reaction to the pronouncement the equities market reversed previous gains to close the market with n15 billion loss consequently most of the blue chip stocks pushing market capitalisation nestle bua cement mtn nigeria and gtco have been on a downtrend since the pronouncement weighing the index through massive sell off in very high traded volume and negative market breadth indeed the low valuation of ngx high earnings and dividend yields on improved earnings released so far in the year coupled with the expectation of third quarter corporate earnings have failed to push the market indices as sell offs in large company shares dragged the key performance indices amid inflation hitting 20 per cent and 17 years high the development has caused investors to stay on the fence waiting to confirm market direction before jumping in as the outlook for the economy remains unpredictable chief research officer of investdata consulting ambrose omordion confirmed that the rate hike adjustment has further triggered another round of selling pressure in the market as a result of aggressive hawkish monetary policy across the globe he argued that the policy stance may not necessarily curb inflationary pressure given that the pressure is not coming from monetary factors alone but from high costs of petroleum products electricity and insecurity as well as the rising exchange rate therefore he suggested that the economic managers should influence some fiscal moves to tackle the rising insecurity and problem of food shortage in nigeria as the nation s high debt profile would not survive this rising rate especially as the world bank and imf continue to warn central banks to rethink and avoid pushing the global economy into recession we see that is already happening in the uk china japan and others it is time for the nigerian central bank and its monetary policy committee to have a rethink before things go out of hand he warned a look at market activities in the corresponding period when investors were taking a position for the third quarter earnings and interim dividend declaration in 2021 showed that the stable interest rate which was in favour of the equities market triggered a massive mop up in shares in the stock market and caused massive price appreciation across sectors for instance the shares of gtco united bank for africa uba and unity bank which stood at n27 90 kobo n7 60 kobo and 52 kobo as at september 29 2021 depreciated to n17 80 kobo n6 95 kobo and 43 kobo as at september 29 2022 similarly the shares of aiico axamansard sunu cornerstone and lasaco in the insurance sector declined from 95 kobo n2 43 kobo 45 kobo 58 kobo and n1 19 kobo to 52 kobo n1 67 kobo 32 kobo 56 kobo and 90 kobo respectively within the period under the agro allied subsector ella lakes and ftn cocoa suffered the same faith as the stocks depreciated from n4 25 kobo and 48 kobo to n3 60 kobo and 29 kobo price appreciation within the same period in 2021 may be attributed to the prevalent low interest rate and high inflation environment 2021 which caused real return on equities to be 10 91 per cent and debt to be 10 65 per cent recall that after the expansionary monetary policy of h2 2020 drove the yields on debt instruments to low single digit the yield on the 364 day treasury bills was around 5 34 per cent and 10 year bond hovered around 12 5 per cent at the end of q3 2021 with the attractive yield on bonds and impressive corporate fundamentals the secondary market segment of the stock market from q3 2021 became very bullish the positive outlook extended into the first quarter q1 2022 causing improved corporate performance and impressive scorecards churned out by quoted companies to lift market capitalisation by n3 02 trillion in the first quarter of 2022 according to data obtained from the ngx within the period market capitalisation soared by n3 02 trillion to close on march 31 2022 at n25 312 trillion higher than the n22 297 trillion it opened for trading activities on january 4 2021 the asi also advanced by 9 95 per cent to close at 46 965 48 basis points in the first q1 2022 sectoral performance was also upbeat as most indices closed the period on an upward note the ngx oil and gas index appreciated the most by 28 12 per cent it was closely followed by the ngx banking index which recorded a gain of 8 55 per cent while the ngx premium board index rose by 6 34 per cent others were the ngx pension ngx industrial goods ngx 30 and ngx lotus ii that went up by 6 34 per cent 5 63 per cent 5 39 per cent 4 37 per cent and 1 18 per cent respectively however after the first hike in interest rates on may 2022 the ngx sustained losses for the third consecutive session to commence trading for june on a downward note yesterday as market capitalisation dropped further by n9 billion at the re opening of transactions for june the all share index fell by 16 13 absolute points representing a decrease of 0 03 per cent to close at 52 974 15 points accordingly investors lost n9 billion in value as market capitalisation declined to n28 559 trillion on market performance gti securities predicted a market downturn as fixed income rates continue to be appealing to investors in the near term also vetiva dealings and brokerage said the month of june kicked off on a relatively tepid note as investors continue to trade cautiously given the higher yields in the fixed income space and current bearish sentiment in the equities market the hike in interest rate in june 2022 also caused equities to lose 3 4 per cent in that month although the market finished the half year h1 in an upbeat appreciating by n5 64 trillion or 25 3 per cent to close at n27 935 trillion in h1 2022 from the n22 297 trillion it opened for trading activities on january 4 2022 occasioned by bargain hunting and investors repositioning ahead of the 2021 full year dividend declarations but the market subsequently plunged into a downturn in july 2022 with the announcement of the second interest rate hike the asi which increased by 0 9 per cent between july 1 and 19 2022 subsequently dipped by 2 8 per cent at the end of july 2022 from 51 829 67 recorded at the beginning of the month july 1 2022 to 50 370 25 the downturn extended to august 2022 as sell offs in most highly capitalised stocks especially bua cement dragged capitalisation by n227 billion the index decreased by 419 93 absolute points representing a decline of 0 83 per cent to close at 49 since then the market has continued on a decline shedding 5 6 per cent between august 1 and september 27 2022 even as analysts predict a gloomy outlook amid rising insecurity in the country and other macroeconomic challenges coupled with uncertainty in the global economy segun ajibola a former president of the chartered institute of bankers of nigeria cibn and professor of economics at babcock university argued that the hike in mpr is a direct reaction to the inflationary pressure in the economy and the increase in money demand by manufacturers and importers to procure the needed foreign exchange he pointed out that if more naira is needed to sustain the level of economic transactions both local and foreign it will reduce investible funds in the economy and constrain activities in the capital market a professor of economics at olabisi onabanjo university ago iwoye sheriffdeen tella said raising the interest rate implies that cost of borrowing from banks will rise according to him this can send businesses listed on the stock exchange to seek expansion funds from the stock market thus raising activities in the market however he stated this cannot resort to more capital inflow because of the devalued nature of the nation s currency also contributing chief executive officer of wyoming capital and partners tajudeen olayinka said investors initially reacted adversely to two quick successions in mpr hike by holding back further investment in equity on one hand and repricing existing securities across markets and instruments on the other hand the essence was to see how the mpc of cbn would react to an aggressive rise in inflation 22 52 per cent in august 2022 which subsequently attracted a further hike to 15 5 per cent in september so investors will exercise caution at this time waiting to see what will become of yields in the fixed income space after the third hike in quick succession we are in a period of extended repricing of instruments and assets including loans and advances and given the fact of low prices it will not be long before the market begins to recover gradually to more appreciable levels he said
government policy mistakes raise the prices of the things that americans buy an average american household can expect to pay an extra 4 440 each year thanks to just 12 such policy mistakes that have large costs and few benefits local state and federal governments are all guilty of enforcing costly laws and regulations at the federal level the biggest costs come from vehicle fuel efficiency standards which cost consumers 55 billion a year and the requirement to use corn based ethanol in gasoline which costs 31 billion per year occupational licensure at the state level costs consumers 127 billion per year local land use restrictions drive up the cost of housing by 209 billion per year altogether the 12 policy mistakes quantified in this paper cost americans 546 billion per year or 4 6 percent of total consumption that is comparable to the department of defense budget and 18 times the budget of the national institutes of health it is more than half as much as americans spend on groceries and more than the rent paid by every renter in america it is three times the budget of the state of california it is more than what 14 million average americans spend in a year and we pay it again and again year after year the ban on crude oil exports is a typical policy mistake that costs americans while most economists would initially guess that banning exports leads to lower domestic gasoline prices but also lower income recent analyses concluded that the opposite is true american consumers would pay 12 cents less per gallon of gas if the ban were lifted section 3 discusses 12 such costly policies and appendices a b and c give details on the calculations assumptions and references behind each estimate the smiths of westerville ohio are a typicalamerican family although unlike most americans they are fictional they own a 180 000 house and visibly spend 74 000 a year due to costly and unnecessary government policies they spend an extra 200 on food 145 on utilities 251 on gasoline 486 on cars 1 169 on housing and 1 713 on consumption in general that is 3 964 per year that the smiths cannot spend on college tuition their leaky garage roof or the 30th anniversary trip that they keep delaying policymakers at all levels of government can correct policy mistakes by repealing unnecessary regulations undoing policies that primarily benefit narrow industries and streamlining bureaucratic processes that impose delays policy theory policy mistakes hurt the u s economy in several ways they lower productivity increase monopoly power decrease employment opportunities shrink incomes make investment less promising and raise prices although all of these effects are important this paper focuses on only the impacts on the prices of consumer goods and household budgets and it considers only 12 policy mistakes the total cost of failed policymaking is undoubtedly much larger prices and incomes are opposite sides of the same coin what kind of house can a consumer afford on an income of 60 000 per year it depends on what prices are is a 3 cup of coffee a luxury it depends among other things on how much money coffee drinkers earn generally average prices and average incomes rise together i e inflation as technology increases worker productivity average incomes rise a little bit faster than average prices real wage growth in many cases prices are higher than they need to be thanks to poorly designed laws and regulations with freer markets prices would fall and consumers could buy more with every dollar how policy influences prices policies lead to higher prices when they restrict supply protect monopolies add extra requirements to supply or impose delays on production as is taught in economics 101 lower supply leads to higher prices some things are naturally in short supply beachfront property in san diego is limited so land prices there are high but restrictions on building make prices even higher if property owners could legally turn their three story apartment buildings into 30 story apartment buildings living at the beach would be cheaper incidentally land values would rise as unit costs fall because each owner would have the option of building up in other cases there is plenty of supply but government grants monopoly powers to favored corporations which use their privileged positions to raise prices on consumers and increase their profits for example the u s sugar program puts strict limits on sugar imports as a result american sugar growers can charge higher prices enriching themselves at the expense of american consumers and killing jobs in the broader food industry some costly laws directly add unnecessary steps to the production process when corporations pay income taxes they do not just write a check they must also gather reams of records the complexity of the tax code has a lot of drawbacks and one is that corporations must hire battalions of lawyers and accountants just to file all of the paperwork correctly those costs are passed on to customers as higher prices finally some regulations impose costly delays delays often sound harmless to outsiders what is the problem with waiting a few weeks for the state to process the application for a commercial driver s license but for individuals and businesses delays are very costly whether they are weeks of lost earnings or months of waiting for a building permit delays thus reduce supply by discouraging work and the added costs are passed on to consumers as higher prices levels of government washington often creates regulations that have large unforeseen consequences but policy mistakes at the state and local levels are just as costly in fact the federal government the states and localities are each responsible for approximately one third of the cost of poorly designed policies covered in this report each level of government has its own characteristic vice at the federal level it is cronyism corporate tax complexity is a result of a forest of hometown favors and special exceptions the sugar program subsidizes one powerful industry federal milk marketing orders fmmos another the costly ethanol mandate probably survives only because of iowa s outsized role in picking presidential nominees state lawmakers have given in to the temptation to require approval for even the most basic economic activities for all sorts of economic activities a person cannot just go about his or her business legally he or she must first receive permission permission to drive a commercial vehicle permission to cut hair permission to sell cars or permission to be a school teacher each permission slip requirement makes markets more monopolistic and less competitive thus raising prices lowering quality and stunting innovation local governments are suckers for the status quo they pay lip service to job growth and lower prices but in practice they block jobs and raise prices when they set strict zoning laws and drag their feet on permitting in big cities taxpayer funded stadiums often seem to be the only major building projects that can be completed quickly who pays higher prices everybody who buys goods and services in the u s is paying something but the impact is greater for some the most heavily impacted are those who live in cities and suburbs especially those with strict land use regulations housing is a large share of most budgets and in high cost cities housing is often 15 percent more expensive than it would be with more modest land use regulation for many families this means thousands of dollars per year in extra costs due to restrictive local laws and bureaucracy high prices strongly impact those who consume a high percentage of their income the poor the retired and young adults tend to consume as much or more than they earn and their consumption is often focused on categories that show up prominently in this report housing cars energy and food consumer surplus versus higher prices economists might object that measuring only the impact of higher prices misses the additional deadweight loss due to regulations after all the high price of rent in seattle affects not only those who pay it but also those who cannot pay it and must turn down a job offer or spend two hours a day commuting from cheaper suburbs deadweight costs are real and important but difficult to measure in the cases of fuel efficiency standards and cement regulation published cost estimates directly reported the loss as a decline in consumer surplus which i used elsewhere the costs are only the visible ones and thus understate the loss to consumers this report shows that the costs of policy mistakes are large if future work takes more policy mistakes into account and can accurately incorporate deadweight loss the results could be much larger than 546 billion twelve costly policies for each quantifiable policy this paper reviews some of the recent research on its costs choses a modest estimate of the size of the cost and adjusts for inflation to june 2015 appendix a explains technical details behind the choices and gives full citations for the references costly federal policies federal policy mistakes are felt by families across the country cafe standards cars and trucks sold in the u s are subject to the corporate average fuel economy cafe standards a set of byzantine gas mileage regulations the recent round of gas mileage regulations added about 10 percent to the cost of vehicles costing the average household 448 per year given their high cost cafe standards remain one of the least efficient means of controlling pollution thanks to a 2009 regulatory change spearheaded by president barack obama automakers had to increase the fuel efficiency of their fleets by 9 miles per gallon over five years not surprisingly the automakers passed the costs along to car buyers quality adjusted new vehicle prices declined from 1997 to 2008 after bottoming out in the recession vehicle prices rose 9 5 percent in six years if the pre 2008 trend had continued for another seven years prices would have been 14 8 percent lower in 2014 than they actually were the average new vehicle costs around 32 500 about 4 500 more than if the price trend had continued researchers anticipated the price increase in papers written before the changes took full effect this paper uses the median estimate from several models the loss in consumer surplus is 61 billion per year which works out to 3 800 per new vehicle adding the assumption that businesses pass on only 75 percent of their higher vehicle costs to consumers further attenuates the estimate presented here renewable fuel standard the renewable fuel standard rfs mandate to include corn based ethanol in gasoline hurts u s consumers at the gas station and the grocery store to the tune of 255 per year for the average household by requiring that corn be used inefficiently as fuel the federal government has raised the prices of fuel and food stephen holland et al estimated that the ethanol mandate would raise gas prices 19 cents per gallon by 2022 the congressional budget office cbo estimated that the mandate would raise gas prices 13 cents to 26 cents by 2017 when global food prices spiked in 2008 causing food shortages in very poor countries and hurting consumers worldwide ethanol mandates drew attention as a potential culprit richard perrin estimated that the ethanol mandate contributed to a rise of 1 percent to 2 percent in food prices arguing that it was responsible for less than half the spike in global food prices in 2008 tax complexity and compliance costs the federal government levies a wide variety of taxes some of which are obscenely complicated the time that individuals and businesses spend saving receipts filling out forms and reading 100 page irs instruction booklets is time not spent on work or leisure the complexity of the corporate income tax alone costs 113 billion per year suppose that tax reform eliminated deductions replaced depreciation with expensing and lowered the marginal tax rate such that compliance costs were cut in half we do not have estimates of how much of that cost is passed through to consumers as higher prices and how much is absorbed by lower wages or lower profits but if half of the cost is passed through to consumers reform would save the average household 230 per year with the rest of the benefit going to investors and workers corporate tax reform would have economic benefits that far exceed the mere static effect on consumer prices the distortions introduced by the current system in which the marginal tax rate is much higher than the average tax rate misallocate resources and talent and depress investment crude oil export restriction u s oil producers are largely prohibited from exporting crude oil many initially assume that the ban lowers u s prices of petroleum products however the u s produces and refines a different mix of oil products than it consumes as a result economists at the brookings institution and economic consulting firm ihs argue that the crude oil export restriction actually raises consumer prices for gasoline refineries in the gulf coast were built to handle heavier crude oil which is largely imported the u s is now producing higher quality crude oil but the old refineries cannot handle all of the new u s oil in a cost effective way if the export ban were lifted u s producers could sell their high quality crude for a better price on world markets u s crude oil would be refined more efficiently and gasoline prices would fall globally including in the united states removing the export ban would expand production and save american consumers 12 cents per gallon of gas which adds up to 227 per year for the average household including savings passed on by businesses sugar program the u s sugar program sets minimum prices and production controls for u s sugar producers and imposes quotas on sugar imported from abroad american agribusiness benefits at the expense of consumers sugar growers in poor countries and american businesses that use sugar the sugar program costs consumers 3 6 billion per year for the average household that comes to 29 a year milk marketing orders fmmos are part of a broader u s dairy policy intended to maintain the status quo in dairy markets at the expense of consumers the marketing orders divide the country into regions setting different prices for wholesale milk in each region some dairy farmers benefit others lose like the sugar program fmmos cost 29 per year for the average household the impact is largest on families with small children cement production regulation in theory environmental regulation should balance costs and benefits in practice cost benefit analysis is only as good as its assumptions which are often tilted to produce a preferred result the environmental protection agency s systematic imposition of regulation on coal power is well known and could significantly affect the price of fuels but even minor sounding regulations on smaller industries can raise prices for example stephen ryan estimated that the 1990 amendments to the clean air act docked consumers 1 7 billion by raising costs and encouraging monopoly power in the cement industry the average household may not buy cement directly but the increased costs of buildings and infrastructure are passed through to them totaling 14 per year for an average household this report does not attempt to incorporate the full cost of environmental regulation cement was included as an example because ryan subjected it to rigorous scholarly review a rare practice costly state policies bad state policies can cause as much economic damage as bad federal policies occupational licensure thirty percent of americans now need a license to work legally in their professions in a few cases mostly in medical professions there is clear argument for preventing newcomers from practicing without going through a rigorous pre examination however for most other professions from barbers to sign language interpreters to schoolteachers that argument does not apply occupational licensure costs the average american household 1 033 per year making it one of the most promising areas for reducing prices the high cost of licensure is borne out by detailed studies in a rigorous study morris kleiner et al estimated that prices of well child exams are 3 percent to 16 percent lower in states that allow nurse practitioners to prescribe medication than in states that allow only a doctor to prescribe medicine since most well child exams do not involve any prescription at all even a 3 percent additional cost is quite high their research found no difference in health outcomes between states with more rigid regulation and states with more flexible regulation licensure is not exclusively a mistake practiced at the state level both localities and the federal government license some professions and contribute to higher prices auto dealership monopolies to sell bicycles a person can order merchandise from bike manufacturers and open a shop to sell new cars being born into a family that owns dealerships is helpful every state has a phalanx of rules and regulations designed to protect the existing auto dealerships from additional competition nor may the car manufacturers sell directly to consumers they must give the local dealerships a big cut as a result of the lack of competition middlemen jack up the prices of cars by 6 percent or more for the average new car this policy adds 1 950 to the price most americans do not buy a new car every year but over a decade these monopolies will cost the average household an extra 2 880 renewable energy mandates many states mandate that some percent of the state s electricity be generated from renewable sources since most renewable energy sources are not cost effective the result is higher prices for consumers these renewable portfolio standards rps mandates will soon cost the average household 108 per year the price effect varies by state depending on the stringency of the rps and the local availability of water power wind and sunlight several states allow renewables to compete on their merits instead of introducing a mandate incurring no cost at all even according to president obama s advisers a typical 2010 government subsidized wind power project was more than six times too expensive to justify on climate change grounds medical tort reform health care is riddled with inefficiencies and redundancies one example is medical malpractice liability through which potentially devastating awards increase the use of unnecessary procedures the cbo estimated that tort reform would save 0 5 percent of all medical spending 82 a year for the average household since medical costs are often paid indirectly through insurance premiums and taxes the savings would work through the system in different ways costly local policies local land use regulations can cost families even more than bad federal or state policies the city council has as much influence on a person s cost of living as the federal government local governments regulate housing which is the largest expense for most families in total americans pay about 209 billion a year extra for housing due to overregulation of land use for the average household the cost is 1 700 a year but the cost is distributed very unequally rural families and those living in less regulated cities are unharmed those in expensive metro areas are taken to the cleaners frequently for over 5 000 per year land use regulation land use regulation is not the only mistake that local governments make but it is certainly the most costly in the past half century local governments have internalized the harmful ideas that cities and suburbs ought to be planned by experts and that new construction generally imposes a net cost on other residents as a result zoning boards planning boards town councils environmental review boards neighborhood commissions historic preservation societies and even concerned neighbors routinely delay or block much potential construction in high cost cities and suburbs land use regulation takes several forms zoning laws zoning laws regulate how land can be used commercial residential or industrial and how dense it can be e g height and lot size zoning laws are usually designed to preserve the past and block the natural transitions among different uses of land some types of use impose major burdens on neighbors e g chemical factories but all sorts of development have generally positive effects on the surrounding area by lowering prices and creating job and commerce opportunities zoning should only restrict uses that clearly fail a cost benefit test for most other uses such as apartment buildings warehouses and offices government restrictions are inappropriate nimbyism local governments often face pressure from citizens who do not mind construction in theory but want it not in my back yard neighborhood review is appropriate for government projects that propose to alter public spaces such as roadways but neighbors should not be allowed to veto private building projects simply because they dislike them bureaucrats empower nimbyists by enacting complex approval processes for projects and setting zoning requirements so that any economically feasible project needs to receive a variance from the written requirements each additional permit and paperwork barrier allows opponents of affordability to keep rent high private arrangements such as homeowners associations often have the same effect giving homebuyers the choice of agreeing to burdensome rules or writing off a desirable neighborhood environmental review delays a primary cost of environmental review which often involves state and federal agencies is the delay it imposes on construction projects while a delay may appear trivial to outsiders it represents time that funds must sit earning nothing waiting for the right signatures the delays add costs to some projects and forestall others altogether decreasing the supply of structures and raising rents environmentally motivated restrictions on construction often have consequences that are the opposite of their intent when cities are artificially expensive more farmland is turned into residential developments than would be the case in a free market where building is difficult prices rise sharply when demand rises those prices make life more expensive for homebuyers renters and businesses businesses pass the costs on to customers as higher prices ed glaeser and joseph gyourko noted that there is as much land per household in san diego as there is in cleveland but prices are much higher in san diego thanks to zoning and other land use restrictions in another paper with raven saks they showed that housing prices in new york city far outpaced construction costs only after 1980 until then housing prices were kept in check by a much higher rate of permitting keith ihlanfeldt found that the addition of each new form of regulation added 7 7 percent to the price of houses in florida haifang huang and yao tang found that higher regulation led to stronger boom and bust housing cycles which is to be expected when supply cannot respond to demand in an eye popping study chang tai hsieh and enrico moretti estimated that if just three cities new york san francisco and san jose adopted more modest but typical u s land use regulations national income would rise 10 percent about 1 7 trillion as people moved from low productivity to high productivity cities calculations presented in appendix b show that residents of a typical city in the high cost coastal areas of the u s would pay 9 percent less in rent and 20 percent less for the costs of homeownership if the city adopted regulatory policies that are typical of the rest of the country on the flip side if cities with modest regulation add more they can anticipate rising prices this paper does not consider how higher commercial real estate costs are passed on to customers as higher prices but anyone who has gotten a sandwich in new york knows that those costs are real if they could be accurately estimated the total estimated damage done by overregulation of land would be substantially higher results the costs add up taken together these 12 policy mistakes cost the average american household 4 440 per year the costs are split roughly equally between localities 38 percent states 34 percent and the federal government 28 percent the most costly policy mistakes are not surprisingly those that affect the largest markets housing is the largest item in most family budgets so restrictions on housing supply are unsurprisingly the most costly policy mistakes land use restrictions seriously increase housing costs in most american metropolises as well as costs for commercial space although this report does not estimate the latter occupational licensure covers about 30 percent of workers raising wages for insiders and lowering wages for those excluded from the market services in education health personal care and many other areas are more expensive due to the costs of licensure cafe standards and auto dealership monopolies have large impacts on a large market because transportation is second to housing in most family budgets to make the results accessible and to examine distributional effects appendix table c presents the effects of the 12 policy mistakes on 11 american households the households are fictional but accurately represent american demographics geography and spending the smiths from westerville ohio were introduced earlier in the paper they spend 4 percent of their total consumption on higher prices due to the 12 policy mistakes slightly below average their total consumption equals the national average for households they own an average priced home and live in a metropolitan area columbus with land use regulations near the median the family that paid the least due to bad policies is the mosley family of barnwell south carolina living on a pastor s salary makes them working class the family has a visible consumption of 43 500 per year and qualifies for some government benefits they are only the third poorest family in my sample but with four mouths to feed they live simply since small town barnwell has plenty of land and few restrictions land use regulation does not cost them anything south carolina also has a very mild rps which adds just 12 to their annual electric bill even so the costs of occupational licensure corporate tax complexity the ethanol mandate and other broad policies are passed on to them as higher prices they pay an extra 1 600 a year due to the bad policies 2 7 percent of their total consumption at the other end of the scale are the affluent flanigans of milton massachusetts higher prices due to bad policies eat up 10 5 percent 17 000 of their total consumption the flanigans spend a lot on housing by national standards but not by greater boston standards their 450 000 house was not built to be expensive it just became that way over the past 50 years as demand grew and supply stagnated greater boston s highly restrictive land use laws add 12 000 to the flanigans annual housing costs they face higher electricity prices than the mosleys due to massachusetts 15 percent renewable energy target the smiths mosleys flanigans and the rest of the fictional households are presented in appendix table c policy conclusions policymakers at all levels of government can improve policies to lower prices for consumers even if washington will not act state and local leaders can ease the cost of restrictive laws and regulations in several cases policymakers should simply repeal the misguided or cronyist policies the sugar program fmmos and licensing for most nonmedical professions exist to benefit the few at the cost of the many and should be removed other policies such as licensure for medical occupations can be reformed to fulfil their purposes while imposing less of a cost licenses should be cheap easy to apply for and have minimal bureaucratic turnaround time continuing education requirements can be eased or removed lowering the cost of working for those who are in active practice scope of practice can be expanded such as allowing nurse practitioners to prescribe medication the environmental policy mistakes in this report such as cafe standards are vastly less efficient than market based policies these areas should be reevaluated taking into account a broader range of costs and benefits than were originally considered reforms of local land use laws are close to home and can even become personal local officials often have a great deal of discretion in granting variances from zoning laws and they must live with angry voters local leaders can make life less expensive for their residents by adopting less stringent rules reducing paperwork and giving projects the benefit of the doubt this report has covered merely 12 policy mistakes other similar mistakes have costs as well but those costs have not been quantified as fully for example the maritime jones act makes almost everything more expensive for residents of alaska hawaii and puerto rico but few attempts have been made to measure the full cost small business licensing regimes probably have similar effects on prices as occupational licensure policymakers can benefit consumers whenever they remove barriers to competition and simplify regulation salim furth phd is research fellow in macroeconomics in the center for data analysis of the institute for economic freedom and opportunity at the heritage foundation the author thanks robert arons michael hendrix mark jacobsen morris kleiner daniel sumner and weifeng zhong for valuable comments christa deneault kirby lawrence and max lies provided research assistance appendix a cost estimate details for federal and state policy mistakes cafe standards the market for vehicles is extremely complex and good models are necessarily complicated as well to make estimates comparable i isolated the effect on consumer surplus or welfare estimated in each paper adjusted it to conform to a 1 1 gallons per 100 mile increase in the cafe fuel efficiency standard and adjusted for inflation appendix table 1 shows the astounding range of estimates the methodologies gave few clues as to the reason for the wide variance in estimates even the authors did not seem to have a sense of whether their estimates were large or small for example andrew kleit clearly disliked the cafe regime and seemed to think his estimate was large kate whitefoot et al present their paper as evidence that costs are not very high yielding estimates for compliance costs that are nine times lower than another approach their corporate compliance costs were low because the corporations can pass the costs almost fully to consumers it is clear that the cost estimates are much larger after 2009 when the obama administration s tightening of cafe standards was under way and the marginal gallon per mile was falling in calculating the applied estimates in appendix table 1 i made two choices that biased the findings toward zero i did not adjust the estimates for population growth or economic growth only for inflation i also assumed that each gallon per mile increment in fuel economy is equally costly although increasing marginal cost is a more reasonable assumption for the point estimate i used thomas klier and joshua linn s estimate not because i endorsed their methodology above others but because it was the most modest of the obama era estimates klier and linn s estimate implies a new vehicle price impact of 3 800 five times larger than the impact expected by the obama administration the nominal price index trend reviewed in the main text suggests that it is quite reasonable to believe that new regulations have added 3 800 to the cost of a new vehicle the price trend relative to overall consumer inflation is even more striking in that it implies that quality adjusted vehicle prices are 21 3 percent above trend mark jacobsen whose paper was the clearest and most richly modeled found that the

midpoint of the cbo s range of impacts to allocate the gasoline cost i used 7 percent of expenditure on gasoline and motor oil in the national income and product accounts nipa consumption data this is likely a low estimate because it misses the indirect cost to consumers of higher fuel prices paid by businesses and passed on in higher prices for the food price impact i had considerably less

including state and local taxes impose substantial burdens as well and including their effects and interactions would amplify this estimate i assumed that a simplified tax would occupy half as much time and money as the current code i found little empirical guidance on the pass through of tax compliance costs to prices there is a large literature on the incidence of corporate income taxation which finds that the costs are mostly borne by capital and labor however that literature assumes that corporate tax rates are equal across firms and industries that is a simplification and clearly untrue with compliance costs which are highly idiosyncratic furthermore unlike the literature on universal corporate taxes the literature on firm specific and industry specific costs suggests that pass through to prices is substantial for an industry specific cost the logic is clear the industry is large in its own product market but small in capital and labor markets thus it cannot stiff labor or capital in the long run and must raise prices to pay its factors of production in the case of firm specific costs a firm with above average costs could not survive in a purely competitive market so such costs are indicative of some measure of market power market power enables such firms to pass costs through to consumers at a higher rate than in competitive markets since industry specific and firm specific costs can both be passed through to consumers at substantial rates i used 50 percent as the pass through rate george contos et al estimated the cost of corporate income tax compliance at around 100 billion in 2009 the irs taxpayer advocate estimated that completing corporate and individual income taxes required a total of 6 1 billion hours annually laffer et al estimated that the hours were split almost evenly between the corporate and individual income taxes and they estimated the cost of the corporate income tax at 168 billion in 2008 i directly used contos et al s preferred

cents in its high oil scenario the consultancies estimated price declines of 8 cents and 9 cents in less ambitious scenarios respectively ihs estimated 418 billion in consumer savings over 15 years for aggregate figures i simply divided 418 by 15 for household level figures i computed the percent increase in fuel prices represented by 12 cents per gallon at 2014 prices 3 6 percent and applied it to household expenditures on gasoline and motor oil reporting on nera s findings charles ebinger and heather greenley noted that the price benefit is not expected to be permanent unless oil reserves are larger than those currently contained in their model all studies of the issue noted that the consumer price benefit is a small part of the overall economic benefit a 2015 study by the u s energy information administration eia used the national energy modeling system to estimate the impact of lifting the ban on crude oil exports it surprisingly found that exports do not increase and even decrease very slightly in 2025 if the export ban is lifted there are also no effects on domestic prices in the high resource cases the study did find that exports increase and are accompanied by a drop of 3 cents or 4 cents per gallon in gasoline prices however even in the high resource cases the study predicted that u s production will barely be affected by the availability of export markets

and amina elobeid because sugar costs disproportionately hit poorer families i allocated the cost to households by headcount instead of food at home consumption in a dissenting estimate the u s international trade commission usitc estimated that the program costs consumers only 0 28 billion per year the gap apparently arises because the usitc predicts that liberalization would lead to a 19 percent drop in the price of imported sugar and a 6 percent drop in the price of retail sugar by contrast beghin and elobeid predicted a 33 percent drop in both the commodity market price and retail price as well as smaller price declines in various grocery items that contain sugar it is not clear why the usitc did not think that free trade would equalize u s and world prices which were less than

marketing orders hayley chouinard et al summarized four previous papers on the consumer price impact of federal milk marketing orders averaging across the papers they found that fluid milk is 15 5 percent more expensive with fmmos among processed dairy products the price impacts varied between 1 5 percent cheaper and 3 percent more expensive prices of dairy products fluctuate for various reasons so the price impact may be lower or higher at any given time xiaowei cai and kyle stiegert show that milk margins have fluctuated within the same range from the late 1990s to 2012 for the three states they studied chouinard et al estimated the total consumer burden of fmmos using scanner data however their estimates included implausibly high milk consumption about 4 gallons per week for the average household instead of relying on their very high estimate of the consumer impact i directly applied the 15 5 percent price effect on fluid milk to the fresh milk category in the nipa

licensure morris kleiner estimated that the cost of licensure could be as high as 217 billion given a 15 percent wage premium associated with licensure in three recent papers kleiner and his co authors have used superior data sources to refine their estimates of the wage premium kleiner and alan krueger estimated the wage premium at 11 percent to 19 percent based on a telephone survey that they designed specifically for the purpose maury gittleman and kleiner estimated the wage premium at zero to 12 percent using the national longitudinal survey of youth depending on the specification gittleman mark klee and kleiner further improved on that result by using the survey of income and program participation which had a specific module on licenses and certification they found that licensure is associated with a 5 percent to 12 percent wage premium i used 8 8 percent equal to the premium that gittleman klee and kleiner estimated in an appendix specification that distinguished required licenses and certifications from nonrequired ones at the two digit industry level plugging the 8 8 percent premium into the formula from kleiner yields a national cost estimate of 127 billion the components of this calculation are not quite internally consistent the premium estimate is from 2008 and covers a smaller share of workers than the rest of the calculation the calculation is approximate but falls in the middle of the range suggested by the ongoing research program an extensive literature on occupational licensure exists but i refrain from reviewing it here references

using national sampling weights joseph gyourko et al created the wri by surveying local governments around the country and it is subject to survey error in the 300 cbsas that i use the average wri is 0 16 and the sample standard deviation is 0 79 the original wri is normalized so that the average is 0 and the standard deviation across municipalities is 1 since larger cities have higher regulation the population weighted average is 0 20 to avoid omitted variable bias which arises in an ordinary least squares ols regression i used instrumental variables in a two stage least squares approach the primary instrument is the average regulatory intensity in the nine nearest cbsas that are at least 100 kilometers distant center to center my key assumption is that the instrumenting cbsas are far enough away that they are poor substitutes for consumers but sufficiently close that they share the cultural and political traditions relevant to setting land use policy using more or fewer than nine cbsas made no difference in the results or strength of the instrument i chose nine because it maximized the correlation between the instrumental and instrumented variables following albert saiz i also used the share of christians in nontraditional denominations in 1971 which is a good proxy for individualist laissez faire worldview nontraditional christian share is significant only in the absence of the nearby cbsa instrumental variable i did not use saiz s other instrument lagged spending on regulatory activities the latter variable seems to me to be a parallax for the instrumented variable and only temporally exogenous saiz showed that the availability of developable land is an important determinant of housing supply and created a measure of undevelopable land for 95 metropolitan areas based on the share of surface area that is water or steeply sloped land in regressions i find that this is significant but severely limits the sample of cities available i expanded the sample by using the u s department of agriculture topography index and the share of each cbsa s counties that are in a coastal watershed per national oceanic and atmospheric administration definition which includes coastlines of the great lakes in the subsample for which saiz s undevelopable area measurement is available its inclusion has very little impact on the coefficients of interest i included several other control variables that are economically and theoretically linked to the supply and demand for housing the share of cbsa employment in manufacturing in 1975 natural log construction costs in the 3 digit zip code area containing the principal city of the cbsa natural log 1970 population natural log a dummy variable for whether the core of the cbsa is in an area at high risk for earthquakes interacted with the topography score and the coastal share when i include undevelopable land i interact it with earthquake risk as well variables that other researchers have used to predict demand for housing based on amenities did not predict prices significantly january temperatures sunshine hours and annual heating degree days were all insignificant average weekly wages from 1970 natural log were also insignificant i excluded these from my preferred specification in some robustness tests i used dummy variables for census divisions there are nine nationally however the dummies add little explanatory power beyond that contained in the nine neighbor instrument when added to the control variables divisional dummies increase the coefficients of interest in my preferred specification but decrease them in other specifications wealth effects the costs of owner occupied housing are much less intuitive than the cost of renting because an owned home is an asset as well as a consumption good the volatility of the housing market means that the costs of home owning are often swamped by the capital gains or losses due to price volatility as a result many homeowners view their homes primarily as assets and ignore the consumption costs a routine objection to less regulated land use is that it will lower land values of surrounding property that is possible but the opposite is possible as well when landowners are more free to build the price of land rises and the price of structures falls the typical home is a structure on a plot of land so the effect of regulation on the value of each specific home is ambiguous glaeser and ward found that home prices in suburban boston would rise if land use regulation were reduced ihlanfeldt found that regulation in florida raised the price of housing by 7 7 percent and reduced the price of land by 14 percent user cost of housing the cost of owning a home is not the price registered at the county clerk s office rather it represents the direct costs e g mortgage interest and property taxes and the opportunity cost of having one s wealth tied up in that asset as opposed to invested elsewhere antonia díaz and maría luengo prado reviewed the literature on the user cost of housing and report estimates between 4 5 percent and 6 percent of home value however estimates in these ranges could not reconcile the total value of owner occupied housing 21 1 trillion with nipa s imputed rental of owner occupied nonfarm housing which was 1 38 trillion in the same quarter thus i use the ratio of those figures 6 5 percent in order to match both i allocate the cost to households proportionately to home value abstracting from specifics such as home price appreciation and mortgage status aggregation in order to arrive at national estimates i aggregated the wharton regulatory index for 315 cbsas i used american community survey acs 2013 data to estimate the aggregate value of owner occupied homes and the aggregate rent paid annually in each cbsa using the median cbsa that has no atlantic or pacific coast as the benchmark 0 36 i calculated the cost increases to renters and homeowners respectively due to regulation above that benchmark i assumed that non cbsa households 23 percent of the total in the acs faced low regulatory barriers and i incorporated no costs for them the acs only distinguishes residence in 260 cbsas including some such as anniston alabama that are not present in the zillow index sample appendix c the illustrative households aggregate statistics are difficult to interpret and lack distributional information to exemplify the size and distribution of the costs discussed in this paper i created 11 illustrative households if accurate household data on consumer expenditures existed i would have drawn actual households from the data however the consumer expenditure survey is deeply flawed and misses about 35 percent of spending particularly in opaque categories and among rich households even if i had used actual households their selection would have been a matter of art to discipline my choices i matched data across geography household size and various expenditure categories given the wide range of per capita expenditure and income data depending on source i attempted to harmonize per capita expenditure among the sources but did not match a specific data source geography and household size i placed the households in specific communities according to the following criteria 22 percent of americans live in the five largest combined statistical areas 66 percent of americans live in the 100 largest metropolitan statistical areas i placed two households in each of the five areas of equal population according to a map that used census data the 11th household was added to represent a region that i had otherwise missed the pacific northwest 30 percent of households are in central cities 61 percent are in suburbs and 9 percent in rural areas i chose household sizes that represented the u s population 10 percent in single member households 26 percent in two member households 18 percent three member households 21 percent in four member households 12 percent in five member households 6 percent in six member households and 7 percent in households of seven or more 23 percent of americans are children total expenditure and distribution i distributed total expenditure among the 11 households to match per capita consumption implied by the national income and product accounts for 2015 quarter ii since the nipa does not provide distributional information i used several sources to create a plausible distribution across the 11 households in the 11 household distribution 12 percent of the population lives in a pair of households that enjoy 45 percent of total consumption that is probably more concentrated than actual u s consumption and about as concentrated as u s income according to the world top incomes database the top 10 percent of tax units earn 50 percent of all income including capital gains according to cbo estimates the top 10 percent of households weighted by size earn 34 percent of income since wealthier households save more pay higher tax rates and receive little of their income in transfers consumption inequality is substantially lower than income inequality according to one estimate of consumption inequality the ratio of the average consumption of the 80th to 95th percentile of households to that of the 5th to 20th percentiles is around 3 5 comparing the second and third richest households in my distribution to the bottom three households yields a similar ratio 3 6 another estimate of the distribution of consumption among households ranked by income found much lower inequality the top earning 20 percent of households enjoyed only 29 percent of total consumption barely double the consumption of the bottom earning 20 percent perhaps this very equal distribution of consumption was due to retirees consuming out of their wealth housing homeowning households comprise 63 percent of households renters 37 percent the median home value in the u s is about 180 000 the user cost of housing is 6 5 percent i overshot the nipa aggregate expenditure on home rental due to the inclusion of a family paying high rent in manhattan which is atypical and undershot the aggregate expenditure on owner occupied housing to compensate i matched the nipa aggregate expenditure on all housing plus an estimated 1 percent of owner occupied home value in property taxes other expenditures using nipa expenditure shares my 11 households accurately matched aggregate expenditures on food at home food away from home electricity natural gas fuel oil auto purchase gasoline and motor oil and health care visible v total consumption to allow readers to compare their perceived consumption with public consumption figures i defined visible consumption to equal total consumption minus the user costs of homeowning and money spent by insurers on one s behalf consumers wishing to compute their own visible consumption should subtract their annual net savings from their after tax income and should further deduct mortgage payments property taxes and homeowners insurance the concept is closer to what is reported by participants in the consumer expenditures survey than to the nipa measures of overall consumption
americans are starting to realize that their country is in serious trouble after 20 months of president joe biden and his ill advised policies multiple crises are impacting the nation advertisement when biden assumed office the nation s economy was strong there was minimal inflation strong economic growth a robust stock market and low interest rates today we have a 40 year high inflation rate negative economic growth a recession a bearish stock market and the highest interest rates since 2008 biden inherited a county that was energy independent but today we are once again dependent on foreign nations and depleting our strategic petroleum reserve to keep gasoline prices from spiraling out of control biden declared war on our domestic oil and gas industry putting moratoriums on drilling in this country while begging saudi arabia for increased production at the end of the trump administration the southern border was secure and a security wall was being erected after taking office biden immediately ended the construction of the border wall and opened our nation to illegal immigration millions of illegal aliens have crossed the border since january 2021 breaking records it is such a crisis that former president bill clinton noted that the country cannot manage such an influx in a recent cnn interview he said there is a limit to how many migrants any society can take without severe disruption and assistance when bill clinton begins to criticize the biden administration it is an admission that the country is seriously on the wrong track it is a reason so many democratic candidates on the ballot in the midterm election are not interested in campaigning with president biden or vice president kamala harris the reality is that americans are scared and angry and want change incredibly biden continues to insist the economy is strong claiming that the great american jobs machine continues to come back american workers are back to work while a 3 7 unemployment rate is good wages are not keeping pace with the inflation rate the increasing interest rates are supposed to tame inflation but the negative effects include causing both credit card debt and mortgages to skyrocket thereby making it more difficult to purchase a home it is little wonder that the real estate industry is suffering with home sales 20 below last year s level all this negative economic news is souring the mood of investors and the stock market has turned negative on friday the dow jones industrial average fell below 29 000 for the first time since november 2020 this marks an 8 8 decline in just a month of september in contrast to biden s misplaced optimism there is nothing positive on the economic horizon inflation will not be tamed soon especially since the biden administration refuses to instill any fiscal discipline the signature bills passed by congress in the biden administration have been extremely costly adding to our national debt which nears 31 trillion with massive spending bills passed that require more borrowing inflation will continue to be a problem until there is a change in leadership in congress and the white house there will be no appetite for any adjustment in our fiscal policies advertisement on friday biden signed another stopgap spending measure that funds the continued operation of the federal government in the short term and includes another 12 3 billion in aid for ukraine while the united states sends a steady stream of funding to ukraine our borders remain open our cities have become crime hellholes and over 100 000 americans are dying each year from drug overdoses exacerbated by the chinese fentanyl pouring into our country from mexico none of these problems seem to matter to biden and harris they are not worried about the economy but seem to be focused on issues such as abortion and right wing extremism instead there is much more violence committed by unhinged liberals for example in mchenry north dakota a deranged motorist shannon brandt was charged with murder after he used his vehicle to kill a young man cayler ellingson who he believed was a republican extremist sadly biden and harris are not interested in dealing with the harsh reality that their policies have created as americans have noticed for months biden does not have a firm grasp on reality at all on wednesday at a white house conference on hunger nutrition and health he asked where s jackie i thought she was going to be here of course u s congresswoman jackie walorski r in could not be there since she died in an automobile accident in august supposedly biden knew she died and sent a condolence note to her family he forgot about her death in the span of a few weeks advertisement biden s mental incompetence is getting worse often he looks lost after finishing speeches and extends his hand to greet a person only he can see vice president harris offers her own set of problems this week during a visit to the demilitarized zone in the korean peninsula she mistakenly praised our country s alliance with the republic of north korea on friday at a democratic party forum harris asserted that the federal government should be giving resources based on equity this claim in the aftermath of hurricane ian was denounced by florida officials an assistant to florida governor ron desantis christina pushaw blasted harris and noted that fema individual assistance is already available to all floridians impacted by hurricane ian regardless of race or background thus biden is mentally incompetent and harris is the word salad queen some are calling for the removal of biden via the 25th amendment ideally republicans should demand that biden submits to a mental competency test if he fails and is removed he will be replaced by harris a chilling prospect no matter how embarrassing his behavior biden remains in office for the foolish vice president is his best insurance policy unfortunately america is stuck between a rock and a hard place as our troubles continue to mount advertisement jeff crouere is a native new orleanian and his award winning program ringside politics airs saturdays from noon

menafn asia times everyone from political pundits to people on the street have issued forth on the new uk government s tax cut laden growth plan recently but it was a from the international monetary fund imf that really impacted financial markets days after the government made its mini budget announcement the imf that large and untargeted fiscal packages could work at cross purposes to monetary policy referring to current efforts by central banks around the world to fight it also suggested the government should reevaluate its tax measures and provide more targeted energy crisis support at its next budget currently scheduled for november 23 investors by beating an even hastier exit from government bond markets and sending the pound plummeting within hours of the imf statement the bank of england had to try to calm the markets the imf s decision to comment on uk tax policy was significant and clearly had an impact on traders and investors and while the uninitiated may be blissfully unaware of the imf s existence it has played a key role in supporting economies in trouble since the middle of the last century upholding global financial stability the imf was established in 1944 at the bretton woods conference which sought to stabilize global finances after the second world war based in washington dc it is an international organization with from afghanistan to the uk and us right through to zimbabwe its mandate is to uphold international financial stability which it tries to do by monitoring global macroeconomic developments and providing governments with advice and on economic policy management most importantly perhaps the imf frequently acts as a lender of last resort for its members this means it provides countries in dire financial straits with much needed money in the form of loans in return these countries must agree to certain austerity measures depending on the situation this can include hikes and drastic spending alongside other substantial economic in the last few years governments in and among others have hiked interest rates cut back on public spending programs and reduced subsidies on household essentials such as fuel and food to meet the imf s performance criteria as a result the imf has become one of the world s most organizations the international monetary fund is one of the world s most controversial organizations photo since the performance criteria it uses are based on the imf s worldview the question of whether its advice is adequate proportionate and effective is often subject to debate for imf the sometimes draconian measures it mandates are necessary to restore investor confidence boost economic growth and help countries become more competitive in the long run as such the imf can work like a for a country s policy plans helping governments to shore up international confidence in their economies to its critics the imf has used its policy leverage to advance reforms that have increased and leaving countries with deep social and political scars for years after accepting its help for example during the ebola crisis in 2014 15 the imf was for contributing to underfunded health systems that prevented effective government responses to the epidemic moving markets regardless as the recent case of the uk shows an imf verdict on government policy proposals can significantly financial markets for countries with immediate financing needs typically developing economies restoring investor confidence with an imf intervention can be to the successful resolution of financial crises but the imf has also used its magic shield to rescue uk governments from global financial woes in the past in fact since the fund s creation the uk has called upon the imf 11 times its last happened in 1976 when stagflation and political stalemate forced the uk government to ask for a loan to halt speculative pressures on the british pound the imf provided not only financial relief but also stability to a newly elected british administration by helping to calm market nerves about the uk economy this time the imf offered up its thoughts on the current economic situation in britain rather than being invited to intervene but instead of curbing speculation about the uk s financial viability the statement had the opposite effect markets panicked mortgage lenders continued to and investors kept forcing up yields and the cost of government borrowing add the in the mix and the current situation is in danger of becoming a textbook financial crisis but the imf s assessment is in line with and in doubting that tax cuts will help reignite uk economic growth instead it argues that the cuts will further expand the budget deficit without a sound fiscal plan this will increase the need for new government debt at a time of rampant inflation deteriorating global economic conditions and rising interest rates which affect the cost of financing for the government such debts may become unsustainable for the uk taking into account the reaction of market participants to the imf s statement and that the bank of england felt the need to intervene in the bond market afterward the imf assessment seems to have carried weight certainly the uk in debt distress is the last thing the world needs many governments in developing and emerging markets are to keep their own economies afloat right now while awaiting financial relief from western banks and the imf but the uk s means any panic in the city of london can spread quickly to global financial markets from this perspective the imf s recent comments about the uk can be seen an attempt to prevent the world from slipping further into a winter of despair is reader in politics and is associate teaching professor mccourt school of
