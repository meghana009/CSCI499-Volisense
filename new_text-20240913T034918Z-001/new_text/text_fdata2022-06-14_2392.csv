even new buyers may be spending large amounts for alterations and repairs a year after their home purchase according to a new national association of home builders report the average spend for a new home owner has been 11 900 according to the nahb s analysis of three year data through early 2020 from the bureau of labor statistics consumer expenditure survey that spend which on average was roughly twice as high for resale buyers suggests builder home purchases can also play a role in demand for renovation financing while home alterations were attractive earlier in the pandemic due to growth in remote work buyers are now interested in making tweaks due to a new driver inflation that makes commuting for work or play less attractive if you asked me today i d say if that trend is going to continue and i would pin it on gas prices said jim bopp a vice president at planet home lending in an interview people in say new york are thinking do i want to spend 300 on gas and drive to the adirondacks for the weekend or put in a pool homebuyers likely will need financing for such projects because their budgets have been stretched about as far as they can go growth in the three months ending april 30 was a mere 0 3 according to redfin that s the smallest increase since june 2020 also attesting to the strain on buyers from inflation stock market volatility and higher rates luxury home sales saw the largest drop since the pandemic in the three months ended april 30 redfin found sales fell nearly 18 compared to almost 5 5 for non luxury homes redfin defines luxury homes as those in the top five price tier for the local market people are increasingly on the lookout for houses a little bit under market said bopp who is a vp of national renovation lending in planet s correspondent division they re going to try not to overspend while new home alterations such as a pool installation account for some of the demand in his business and can have high price points bopp said it s more repairs on older homes that are more outdated than distressed that are fueling the bulk of renovation lending activity they re houses that could be well maintained and taken care of but where somebody is going to walk in and say i don t want the green cabinets and the orange countertop he said although budgets for work like that are increasingly under strain the persistence of high home equity levels gives a lot of buyers the means to finance said doug perry a strategic financing advisor at online platform real estate bees many existing homeowners have lendable equity they are sitting on that can be tapped to do home improvements which is often more affordable than selling and buying a similarly upgraded home perry said in an email home equity lines of credit and other renovation loans have been on the rise as a result but some studies suggest that if consumer expenses keep rising those gains could slow the level of annual expenditures for home improvements and repairs is set to expand to nearly 450 billion by the first quarter of 2023 said abbe will associate project director of the remodeling futures program at the harvard joint center for housing studies in a press release earlier this year yet the rising costs of project financing construction materials and labor as well as growing concerns about a broader economic slowdown or recession may further slow remodeling growth to date however renovation lending anecdotally seems to be going strong and making up for some slowing in first lien lending bopp said i ve been talking to some credit unions their first mortgage volumes have been off maybe 57 but their equity lending is up 70 said bopp so people are going to tap into that newfound equity and not touch that 30 year 3 fixed rate mortgage they may have unless they really need to because they have to move to another state or something
stan choe and alex veiga ap business writers new york wall street is back in the claws of a bear market as worries about inflation and higher interest rates overwhelm investors the federal reserve has signaled it will aggressively raise interest rates to try to control inflation which is the highest in decades throw in the war in ukraine and a slowdown in china s economy and investors have been forced to reconsider what they re willing to pay for a wide range of stocks from high flying tech companies to traditional automakers big swings have become commonplace and monday was no exception more bear market hits wall street as stocks bonds crypto dive more worry about stagflation a flashback to 70s begins to grow the last bear market happened just two years ago but this is still a first for those investors that got their start trading on their phones during the pandemic thanks in large part to extraordinary actions by the federal reserve stocks have for years seemed to go largely in only one direction up but the buy the dip rallying cry popular after every market slide has grown more fainter a recent rebound in stock prices was wiped out by a furious bout of selling over the past four days here are some common questions asked about bear markets why is it called a bear market a bear market is a term used by wall street when an index like the s p 500 the dow jones industrial average or even an individual stock has fallen 20 or more from a recent high for a sustained period of time why use a bear to represent a market slump bears hibernate so bears represent a market that s retreating said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra in contrast wall street s nickname for a surging stock market is a bull market because bulls charge stovall said the s p 500 wall street s main barometer of health slid 3 9 monday to 3 749 that s nearly 22 below the high set on jan 3 the nasdaq is already in a bear market down 32 7 from its peak of 16 057 44 on nov 19 the dow jones industrial average is more than 17 below its most recent peak the most recent bear market for the s p 500 ran from february 19 2020 through march 23 2020 the index fell 34 in that one month period it s the shortest bear market ever what s bothering investors market enemy no 1 is interest rates which are rising quickly as a result of the high inflation battering the economy low rates act like steroids for stocks and other investments and wall street is now going through withdrawal the federal reserve has made an aggressive pivot away from propping up financial markets and the economy with record low rates and is focused on fighting inflation the central bank has already raised its key short term interest rate from its record low near zero which had encouraged investors to move their money into riskier assets like stocks or cryptocurrencies to get better returns last month the fed signaled additional rate increases of double the usual amount are likely in upcoming months consumer prices are at the highest level in four decades and rose 8 6 in may compared with a year ago the moves by design will slow the economy by making it more expensive to borrow the risk is the fed could cause a recession if it raises rates too high or too quickly russia s war in ukraine has also put upward pressure on inflation by pushing up commodities prices and worries about china s economy the world s second largest have added to the gloom so we just need to avoid a recession even if the fed can pull off the delicate task of tamping down inflation without triggering a downturn higher interest rates still put downward pressure on stocks if customers are paying more to borrow money they can t buy as much stuff so less revenue flows to a company s bottom line stocks tend to track profits over time higher rates also make investors less willing to pay elevated prices for stocks which are riskier than bonds when bonds are suddenly paying more in interest thanks to the fed critics said the overall stock market came into the year looking pricey versus history big technology stocks and other winners of the pandemic were seen as the most expensive and those stocks have been the most punished as rates have risen but the pain is spreading widely with retailers signaling a shift in consumer behavior stocks have declined almost 35 on average when a bear market coincides with a recession compared with a nearly 24 drop when the economy avoids a recession according to ryan detrick chief market strategist at lpl financial so i should sell everything now right if you need the money now or want to lock in the losses yes otherwise many advisers suggest riding through the ups and downs while remembering the swings are the price of admission for the stronger returns that stocks have provided over the long term while dumping stocks would stop the bleeding it would also prevent any potential gains many of the best days for wall street have occurred either during a bear market or just after the end of one that includes two separate days in the middle of the 2007 2009 bear market where the s p 500 surged roughly 11 as well as leaps of better than 9 during and shortly after the roughly monthlong 2020 bear market advisers suggest putting money into stocks only if it won t be needed for several years the s p 500 has come back from every one of its prior bear markets to eventually rise to another all time high the down decade for the stock market following the 2000 bursting of the dot com bubble was a notoriously brutal stretch but stocks have often been able to regain their highs within a few years how long do bear markets last and how deep do they go on average bear markets have taken 13 months to go from peak to trough and 27 months to get back to breakeven since world war ii the s p 500 index has fallen an average of 33 during bear markets in that time the biggest decline since 1945 occurred in the 2007 2009 bear market when the s p 500 fell 57 history shows that the faster an index enters into a bear market the shallower they tend to be historically stocks have taken 251 days 8 3 months to fall into a bear market when the s p 500 has fallen 20 at a faster clip the index has averaged a loss of 28 the longest bear market lasted 61 months and ended in march 1942 and cut the index by 60 how do we know when a bear market has ended

the federal reserve announced a 75 basis point rate hike for the first time since 1994 as it combats the biggest inflation outbreak in 40 years with increased urgency with the latest data pointing to greater risk that high inflation may become entrenched policymakers now expect to raise the fed s key interest rate all the way to 3 8 x the dow jones industrial average after an initial wobble rose strongly during fed chief jerome powell s post meeting news conference before gains somewhat by the close powell said the fed had expected inflation to be flattening out with may s cpi coming in even hotter powell said policymakers thought strong action was warranted he also said that survey data showing that consumer inflation expectations are rising pushed the fed to move faster policymakers are likely to decide between a half point hike and a 75 basis point move at the july meeting powell said markets had been betting strongly on another supersized hike there s no sign of a broader slowdown in the economy powell said though he did note some softening in business investment he continues to see the u s economy as being well positioned to deal with higher interest rate powell broadly addressed financial markets what does powell make of the recent bloodletting that has seen the s p 500 fall into bear market territory while the dow has shed 8 5 over five straight down days powell wasn t asked that directly but he made some related comments we ve seen financial conditions tighten and appropriately so powell said that tightening should help bring demand into line with supply he said asked whether the fed s balance sheet tightening also known as quantitative tightening was a source of market volatility and illiquidity powell said simply markets seem to be ok with it fed rate hike the fed announced a hike in its key overnight interbank lending rate to a target range of 1 5 1 75 the last time the fed hiked by so much at a single meeting was in november 1994 yet the pace of monetary tightening is even faster now since the rate hikes are being accompanied by the shrinking of the fed s balance sheet rate hike outlook economic projections issued by the fed reflecting the median forecast of individual policymakers now show the key policy rate rising to 3 4 this year and 3 8 in 2023 then easing to 3 4 in 2024 in projections issued in march the fed rate was seen rising only to 1 9 this year and reaching 2 8 next however the new set of projections imply fewer hikes than the market has priced in cme group s fedwatch page shows markets expect the key fed rate to rise to a range of 3 75 4 by the end of this year the fed s urgency was surely heightened by friday s may cpi report which showed headline inflation hitting a 40 year high of 8 6 surging food and energy prices are part of the reason but fed officials may be particularly troubled by prices for nonenergy services rising 5 2 the fastest pace in 30 years that includes big spending categories like rent and health care as a result of the ongoing bout of inflation the university of michigan s june survey showed that consumers now expect inflation of 3 3 over the next 5 to 10 years up from 3 a month earlier since psychology plays a big part in inflation dynamics rising inflation expectations add pressure on the fed to act forcefully policymakers now see the fed s preferred inflation gauge based on the core personal consumption expenditures price index easing to 4 3 in the fourth quarter 2 7 by the end of 2023 and 2 3 in 2024 officials project that the unemployment rate will end this year at 3 7 2023 at 3 9 and 2024 at 4 1 that compares to 3 6 currently powell said he would consider 2 inflation and 4 1 unemployment a successful outcome when to sell a stock cutting losses short is the first rule dow jones treasury yield reaction after powell spoke the dow jones surged more than 2 intraday before settling for a 1 gain the s p 500 added 1 5 and the nasdaq 2 5 as of tuesday s close the dow was nearing bear market territory down 17 5 from its all time closing high the s p 500 had fallen 22 1 and the nasdaq 32 6 be sure to read the big picture every day to stay in sync with the market direction and what it means for your trading decisions after the fed policy statement the 10 year treasury yield skidded to 3 31 from tuesday s 11 year high of 3 48 cpi inflation rate shock jolts fed policy outlook federal reserve balance sheet tightening on may 4 the fed announced it would begin gradually unwinding much of its 4 5 trillion in pandemic era purchases of treasuries and government backed mortgage securities starting in june as those securities mature the fed has been reinvesting all of the principal but officials will begin letting that some of that principal run off that balance sheet runoff went into effect today when the fed began to reinvest principal received in june the pace of balance sheet tightening will ramp up to a monthly pace of 95 billion over three months officials have said that the cumulative effect after a couple of years will approximate an additional half point rate hike the federal reserve s most anticipated recession in history may be coming no quick fix for dow jones this isn t the first time that the fed has provoked a steep market pullback by tightening with both fists hiking rates while shrinking its balance sheet but the differences between now and the previous episode at the end of 2018 are telling last time around all it took was a mere flirtation with a bear market major index declines of close to 20 for the fed to begin to reverse course in a matter of days first policymakers hit the brakes on rate hikes and balance sheet tightening but the next fall they were cutting rates and buying more assets this time despite the dow being close to a bear market and the s p 500 and nasdaq already across that threshold policymakers are accelerating their tightening plans federal reserve policy works on the economy indirectly by influencing financial conditions a combination of market interest rates asset valuations credit spreads and the ability of companies to raise capital if the fed is urgently working to cool demand policymakers won t want household wealth to recoup much of this year s losses that implies a fairly low ceiling for any near term stock rally you may also like how to invest in stocks in a

san francisco and suzhou china june 13 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology autoimmune metabolic ophthalmology and other major diseases today announced that the china s national medical products administration nmpa has formally accepted the new drug application nda for tafolecimab injection anti pcsk 9 antibody r d code ibi306 for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in recent years pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody has been gradually recognized by clinicians as a new therapeutic regimen that can potently reduce ldl c levels with favorable safety profiles although there are imported products in the chinese market there is still room for improvement in terms of affordability accessibility and convenience tafolecimab injection which was supported by the national science and technology major project for major new drug development whose new drug application is the first submitted and formally accepted by the nmpa and it is expected to potentially be the first self developed recombinant fully human anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody launched in china the nda submission was based on the study results of three phase 3 registration clinical trials credit 1 credit 2 and credit 4 compared with placebo tafolecimab injection reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c levels by about 57 65 and maintained long term therapeutic efficacy in addition tafolecimab injection also significantly reduced total cholesterol tc non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non hdl c apolipoprotein b apob and lipoprotein a lp a levels with a high percentage of patients achieving lipid reduction goals a long administration interval once every 6 weeks and overall favorable safety profiles tafolecimab injection is expected to be a potent treatment for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia professor yong huo from peking university first hospital stated in china the prevalence of dyslipidemia in adults is increasing annually and has become an important risk factor threatening the health of chinese population elevated tc and ldl c are among the independent risk factors for coronary heart disease or ischemic stroke effective control of dyslipidemia is important for the prevention and control of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd the results from a series of clinical studies of tafolecimab injection in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia are very encouraging it is worth noting that in credit 1 study tafolecimab injection achieved long interval administration and demonstrated significant long term reduction of ldl c levels in chinese population with hypercholesterolemia in addition tafolecimab also exhibited more prominent advantages in reducing lp a over other similar anti psck 9 agents which may result in better compliance and additional cardiovascular risk control benefits we look forward to the approval of tafolecimab injection to provide a better treatment option to the large number of patients with hypercholesterolemia in china professor yujie zhou from beijing anzhen hospital capital medical university stated although the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia is relatively low in china it is still ranked highest in the world due to the large population patients with heterozygous hypercholesterolemia have an early onset significantly elevated serum levels of total cholesterol tc and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c and rapid progression of the disease these symptoms significantly harm the patients health and they may experience severe ascvd and even die at young or middle age our research team has observed the favorable efficacy and safety profiles of tafolecimab injection in the first randomized controlled double blind clinical study credit 2 in chinese population with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia today we are even more delighted to see that as an innovative anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody with proprietary intellectual property rights in china the nda of tafolecimab injection has been officially accepted by the china s nmpa as a clinician i really look forward to the approval of tafolecimab injection to benefit chinese patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated at present cardiovascular diseases caused by hyperlipidemia hypertension and obesity in china are prominent and have seriously affected the national public health the nda submission is based on the results of the credit 1 credit 2 and credit 4 clinical studies which demonstrated that tafolecimab injection can effectively reduce ldl c levels and significantly improve other lipid parameters in chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia among which lp a can be reduced more compared with similar products tafolecimab injection is the first psck 9 antibody that can be administrated at long interval dosing once every 6 weeks which will potentially provide more treatment options for chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia we look forward to the approval and launch to market of the product in the near future hoping to benefit the large number of patients with hypercholesterolemia in china with this high quality medicine as soon as possible about hypercholesterolemia in recent years the blood lipid level of the chinese population has gradually increased and the prevalence of dyslipidemia has increased significantly with an overall prevalence of 40 4 in chinese adults the increase of serum cholesterol level in the population will lead to an increase of about 9 2 million cardiovascular disease events in china between 2010 2030 dyslipidemia characterized by elevated ldl c or tc is an important independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at present the disease management of hyperlipidemia in china is not optimistic according to the 2020 china cardiovascular health and disease report the diagnostic treatment and control rate of dyslipidemia in chinese adults remain low the percentage of patients with dyslipidemia who met the ldl c reduction goal is even more alarming current lipid lowering therapies do not meet the clinical needs in patients with hyperlipidemia anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody has a mechanism of action different from existing lipid lowering drugs and can effectively reduce ldl c levels which is expected to provide a better treatment option for chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia about tafolecimab injection anti pcsk 9 antibody tafolecimab injection developed by innovent is an lgg2 fully human monoclonal antibody that can specifically bind to pcsk 9 and reduce ldl c level by inhibiting pcsk 9 mediated low density lipoprotein receptor ldlr endocytosis subsequently enhancing the clearance of ldl c resulting in a reduction in ldl c level as of now three registration trials of tafolecimab injection have met the primary endpoint the results from phase i ii clinical study have been published in jacc asia an internationally renowned journal of cardiology credit 2 phase iii study results

russia s war on ukraine shows no sign of ending but it is not too soon to start thinking about how to ensure postwar ukraine s stability prosperity and security already two discussions are occurring one about financing economic reconstruction and the other about affirming ukraine s external security the problem is that these discussions are proceeding separately even though the issues are intimately related reconstruction costs are uncertain because the course of the war is uncertain ukraine s pre war gdp was some 150bn given a capital output ratio of three and assuming that a third of the capital stock will be destroyed we are again talking about 150bn as always alternative assumptions yield alternative scenarios but 150bn seems like a reasonable starting point this is not an impossible amount of aid for donors to commit it is one sixth the size of the nextgenerationeu programme on which european union states agreed in july 2020 it is one twelfth the size of the american rescue plan act signed by us president joe biden in march 2021 still it seems wrong to ask the united states and europe to repair what russia has broken so it is tempting to suggest that ukraine s reconstruction should be financed by garnishing russian assets at 284bn the bank of russia s frozen reserves would certainly fit the bill true there is a moral case for reparations russia started an unprovoked war and has almost certainly committed war crimes in prosecuting it there is also an argument grounded in deterrence as ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky put it at davos this year if the aggressor loses everything then it definitely deprives him of his motivation to start a war security guarantees are as vital for economic recovery as they are for the safety of ukraine s population official aid can t finance the economy forever private investment will be required but foreign investment won t flow in if security is uncertain indeed ukrainians themselves won t invest either the west can strengthen ukraine s ability to defend itself by giving it more powerful weapons but as long as russia is nuclear armed and ukraine is not the strategic balance will be tilted a security guarantee from the us and the eu could counter this russian advantage but the west is reluctant not without reason to bear the risks the only durable solution is a russia reconciled to ukraine s political independence and territorial integrity and reparations are the last thing needed to achieve that they would mean additional hardship for a russian population already experiencing hardship with the economy on course to contract by 10 20 this year it is not as if russia is getting off scot free to be sure going too easy on russia risks shading into appeasement and under no circumstances should russian president vladimir putin be rewarded for his aggression but there is also the opposite risk russia must recognise the political and territorial integrity of ukraine punishing it further in the course of peace negotiations will not make this easier we want future russian governments to respect international norms invoking those norms to extract every pound of flesh will not make achieving this more likely there is an obvious analogy with german reparations after world war i and the war guilt provision of the treaty of versailles rightly or wrongly russians now like germans then do not see themselves as solely responsible for the war the treaty s war guilt clause gave nationalistic german politicians a grievance on which to campaign the victors financial demands gave german governments cover to disregard the treaty s disarmament provisions and the prohibition on establishing a customs union with austria and reparations complicated the task of stabilising and reconstructing the international system john maynard keynes anticipated all this and more in his prescient economic consequences of the peace this indictment of post wwi reparations should not be overdone reparations alone did not cause the great depression and germany s depression alone did not lead to hitler and world war ii the analogy to today s circumstances like all historical analogies is imperfect still this experience is a cautionary tale there are still other arguments against reparations the legality of seizing frozen russian assets is unclear western governments could pass enabling legislation although they might then be seen as bending the law to their convenience the united nations could create a commission with the power to seize those assets though countries such as china imagining that they might one day be targeted would oppose the step either way seizing russia s foreign assets will cause other governments to think twice before investing abroad the central point though is that the demand for reparations would make it harder to imagine a russia reconciled to ukraine s independence and territorial integrity with a hostile russia at its doorstep it will be more difficult for ukraine to stay safe much less to sustain sound and stable economic growth project syndicate barry eichengreen professor of economics at the university of california berkeley is the author most recently of in defense of public debt

these days it s a nightmare every time we get to pull into a gas station just to put some gas in the tank but did you notice a trip to the supermarket could be just as frustrating as my last time going down the aisles i experienced a high dose of sticker shock as everything that was affordable also is out of reach yes you guessed it food prices have also seen a major spike in the past few months and we are all wondering when will this end it s just not fair when people who are trying to make ends meet are literally going broke just to survive paulprescott72 the dilemma continues do you use that surplus cash to put gas in your tank or stock up on much needed staples like milk bread and what is put on the table for dinner and what has caused this inconvenience blame it all on the covid 19 pandemic which caused a shortage of supply on all items that you buy at the grocery store the virus also caused a shortage of labor as lockdowns forced a minimal availability for employees who were hired to oversee daily farm operations let s not forget the russian invasion of ukraine is another factor in causing things to go topsy turvy as both countries have the major worldwide surplus of barley wheat and corn believe it or not sunflower oil is also exported from both areas that are entrenched in this conflict that has cause headaches worldwide many countries are not doing business with russia as the conflict seems never ending to say the least flownaksala a box of cereal has also reached it s highest levels in decades as demand for animal feed has hit the roof and to make things worse the recent case of bird flu has seen skyrocketing prices for a dozen eggs as a 15 increase has been reported as an overall 40 rise is attributed to this major rise in prices economists are hoping this should stabilize by next year but we can hope that prediction becomes reality kellogg s bottom line as consumers we need to economize and tighten our belts by just buying what is essential when shopping make a list and stick with it as we are all sticking to a budget what choice do we have this seems to be the only way to get through this setback we are a hearty bunch here in the berkshires and throughout new england we ll band together and overcome these obstacles as inflation numbers are staggering for the first time since 1979 my outlook the less i eat the more opportunity i ll lose more weight which has been rule of thumb from yours truly since last year two more words for everyone good luck
astra space has gone 0 for 2 in its attempts for success from the space coast with the latest supposed to be the first of three launches this summer for nasa to put several hurricane tracking satellites into orbit the failure on sunday saw astra s rocket 3 3 lift off from cape canaveral space force station in what seemed to be a good launch only the be thwarted by its second stage failing to put its payload of two satellites into the desired orbit resulting in their destruction falling back to earth nasa officials though say that all is not lost for the overall tropics project which stands for time resolved observations of precipitation structure and storm intensity with a constellation of smallsats tropics is part of nasa s venture program for lower cost higher risk missions payloads that tolerate relatively high risk and serve as an ideal platform for innovation for tropics four out of six small satellites are needed for the mission to work said thomas zurbuchen nasa s associate administrator for the science mission directorate so while the first two satellites were destroyed astra space officials said they are hopeful they will figure out the problem and be able to fulfill the rest of their 7 8 million contract launching the final four satellites the next two launches need to work said astra cofounder and ceo christ kemp our team understands what is at stake to date the alameda california based company has only achieved successful orbital flights twice both from an alaska spaceport the last time it tried to fly from florida also as part of a nasa mission the company s rocket saw a second stage failure as well resulting in the destruction of the four small satellites it was flying for three universities as well as the johnson space center the company s post launch investigation though identified two issues that it was able to remedy and then successfully carry out in a march flight from alaska although that was for private customers its only other successful flight came last november a demonstration flight for the u s space force the tropics failure was the 10th ever rocket launched for the company founded in 2016 the company s publicly traded stock nasdaq astr which was close to 20 a share in february 2021 has been sliding ever since dropping to its lowest value ever hitting 1 42 in early trading monday before rebounding slightly it closed at 1 54 down nearly 24 for the day both the february failure and this past weekend s were under nasa contracts designed to help new rocket companies other commercial companies that have been awarded contracts to fly nasa hardware on what it labels as high risk missions include virgin orbit rocket lab relativity space and firefly not all have had their first launches yet but both virgin orbit and rocket lab saw at least one early mission deployment failure but none with such high profile loss of payloads even spacex which has not had a mission failure since 2016 was unsuccessful in its first three rocket attempts which nearly ended elon musk s rocket venture the orlando sentinel reached out to nasa to see what the cost was for the lost satellites on both the february and tropics missions and if the taxpayers and other customers would get compensation for the launch failures nasa did not provide answers to those questions instead zurbuchen reiterated that a part of such missions is to give new rocket companies a financial reason to do business even though we are disappointed right now we know there is value in taking risks in our overall nasa science portfolio because innovation is required for us to lead he said i am confident that in the future we will succeed in using this valuable launch capability to explore the unknown and give others the same opportunity to inspire the world through discovery he added on twitter kemp stated his company s commitment to push forward this mission means a lot to our team we are focusing our team s energy on deeply understanding the root cause correcting it and completing the tropics mission he said zurbuchen replied with an encouraging comment we are eager to complete the tropics mission as well good luck

medicines for the treatment of oncology autoimmune metabolic ophthalmology and other major diseases today announced that the china s national medical products administration nmpa has formally accepted the new drug application nda for tafolecimab injection anti pcsk 9 antibody r d code ibi306 for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in recent years pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody has been gradually recognized by clinicians as a new therapeutic regimen that can potently reduce ldl c levels with favorable safety profiles although there are imported products in the chinese market there is still room for improvement in terms of affordability accessibility and convenience tafolecimab injection which was supported by the national science and technology major project for major new drug development whose new drug application is the first submitted and formally accepted by the nmpa and it is expected to potentially be the first self developed recombinant fully human anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody launched in china the nda submission was based on the study results of three phase 3 registration clinical trials credit 1 credit 2 and credit 4 compared with placebo tafolecimab injection reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c levels by about 57 65 and maintained long term therapeutic efficacy in addition tafolecimab injection also significantly reduced total cholesterol tc non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non hdl c apolipoprotein b apob and lipoprotein a lp a levels with a high percentage of patients achieving lipid reduction goals a long administration interval once every 6 weeks and overall favorable safety profiles tafolecimab injection is expected to be a potent treatment for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia professor yong huo from peking university first hospital stated in china the prevalence of dyslipidemia in adults is increasing annually and has become an important risk factor threatening the health of chinese population elevated tc and ldl c are among the independent risk factors for coronary heart disease or ischemic stroke effective control of dyslipidemia is important for the prevention and control of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd the results from a series of clinical studies of tafolecimab injection in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia are very encouraging it is worth noting that in credit 1 study tafolecimab injection achieved long interval administration and demonstrated significant long term reduction of ldl c levels in chinese population with hypercholesterolemia in addition tafolecimab also exhibited more prominent advantages in reducing lp a over other similar anti psck 9 agents which may result in better compliance and additional cardiovascular risk control benefits we look forward to the approval of tafolecimab injection to provide a better treatment option to the large number of patients with hypercholesterolemia in china professor yujie zhou from beijing anzhen hospital capital medical university stated although the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia is relatively low in china it is still ranked highest in the world due to the large population patients with heterozygous hypercholesterolemia have an early onset significantly elevated serum levels of total cholesterol tc and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c and rapid progression of the disease these symptoms significantly harm the patients health and they may experience severe ascvd and even die at young or middle age our research team has observed the favorable efficacy and safety profiles of tafolecimab injection in the first randomized controlled double blind clinical study credit 2 in chinese population with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia today we are even more delighted to see that as an innovative anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody with proprietary intellectual property rights in china the nda of tafolecimab injection has been officially accepted by the china s nmpa as a clinician i really look forward to the approval of tafolecimab injection to benefit chinese patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated at present cardiovascular diseases caused by hyperlipidemia hypertension and obesity in china are prominent and have seriously affected the national public health the nda submission is based on the results of the credit 1 credit 2 and credit 4 clinical studies which demonstrated that tafolecimab injection can effectively reduce ldl c levels and significantly improve other lipid parameters in chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia among which lp a can be reduced more compared with similar products tafolecimab injection is the first psck 9 antibody that can be administrated at long interval dosing once every 6 weeks which will potentially provide more treatment options for chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia we look forward to the approval and launch to market of the product in the near future hoping to benefit the large number of patients with hypercholesterolemia in china with this high quality medicine as soon as possible about hypercholesterolemia in recent years the blood lipid level of the chinese population has gradually increased and the prevalence of dyslipidemia has increased significantly with an overall prevalence of 40 4 in chinese adults the increase of serum cholesterol level in the population will lead to an increase of about 9 2 million cardiovascular disease events in china between 2010 2030 dyslipidemia characterized by elevated ldl c or tc is an important independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at present the disease management of hyperlipidemia in china is not optimistic according to the 2020 china cardiovascular health and disease report the diagnostic treatment and control rate of dyslipidemia in chinese adults remain low the percentage of patients with dyslipidemia who met the ldl c reduction goal is even more alarming current lipid lowering therapies do not meet the clinical needs in patients with hyperlipidemia anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody has a mechanism of action different from existing lipid lowering drugs and can effectively reduce ldl c levels which is expected to provide a better treatment option for chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia about tafolecimab injection anti pcsk 9 antibody tafolecimab injection developed by innovent is an lgg2 fully human monoclonal antibody that can specifically bind to pcsk 9 and reduce ldl c level by inhibiting pcsk 9 mediated low density lipoprotein receptor ldlr endocytosis subsequently enhancing the clearance of ldl c resulting in a reduction in ldl c level as of now three registration trials of tafolecimab

up to one in seven people worldwide may have had lyme disease according to new estimates for decades researchers have been clueless as to exactly how widespread the tick borne illness was the new findings could open up avenues to tackle the bacterial infection which can cause sufferers symptoms such as headaches muscle and joint pain and fatigue that can last for years singer justin bieber and model bella hadid are just two celebrities who have spoken out about their plight with lyme academics from china examined blood sample data from studies involving 150 000 people results showed 14 5 per cent had antibodies indicating lyme disease canadian pop singer justin bieber left has spoken out about suffering from lyme disease while american model bella hadid right has shared that she suffers an irregular heartbeat joint pain and difficulty with breathing due to the condition lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread through a tick bite it causes a round rash and can trigger flu like symptoms but usually gets better with antibiotics within weeks or months pictured stock of tick rates were however just over 20 per cent in central europe an area which usually encompasses germany and poland researchers said a more accurate figure on the global distribution of lyme disease would identify risk factors what is lyme disease lyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread to humans by infected ticks it causes symptoms including a circle or oval shaped rash around a tick bite which usually appears within four weeks of being bitten but may take up to three months to show some people also get flu like symptoms in the days after being bitten including a high temperature a headache muscle and joint pain and a loss of energy and a few of those treated for lyme disease continue to have symptoms such as tiredness aches and a loss of energy that can last for years it s not clear why some suffer from ongoing symptoms and there is no agreed treatment for the disease not all ticks carry the bacteria that causes lyme disease but infected ticks can be found across the uk high risk areas include grassy and wooded areas in northern and southern england as well as the scottish highlands people are advised to remove ticks safely and as soon as possible using tweezers advertisement this they said may inform the development of public health response policies and control programmes before now the most accurate figures suggested that around 900 brits and 30 000 americans were struck down every year however these were widely thought to be an underestimate ticks are second only to mosquitos in terms of the number of harmful microbes they carry some harbour borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato the bacteria which is responsible for lyme disease the infection triggers a circular oval shaped rash around a tick bite that can appear up to three months after being bitten the bacteria can also spread to other tissues and organs potentially affecting the nervous system joints heart and skin for years but it s not clear why some suffer from ongoing symptoms and there is no agreed treatment for the disease researchers from kunming medical university in china examined 89 lyme disease studies involving 158 287 people conducted between 1984 and 2021 each study looked at lyme disease rates from blood test results because it triggers antibodies in the same way as covid this means a blood sample can confirm whether a person is currently infected or has been in the past the team wrote their findings in bmj global health are the most comprehensive and up to date systematic review of the worldwide prevalence of lyme disease a fifth of people in central europe tested positive the highest rate followed by eastern asia 15 9 per cent and western europe 13 5 per cent for comparison rates were lowest in the caribbean 2 per cent southern asia 3 per cent and oceania 5 3 per cent the researchers noted that tick borne diseases have doubled over the last 12 years such pathogens pose a significant and growing public health problem and are a major cause of disease and death worldwide they said ticks have expanded globally in recent years greatly increasing the risk of human exposure the study stated this could be down to longer summers and warmer winters animal migration and increased time spent outdoors a sub analysis showed over 50s men and those living in rural areas were most likely to have lyme disease men were more likely to be working in jobs that make them more exposed to ticks such as farmers police officers and soldiers the team said it is essential to develop new treatments and prevention methods however they noted that a third of the studies used just one type of test to confirm a lyme disease infection these studies reported more cases than those using a second test to confirm a case this may be due to the bacteria behind lyme being similar to other viruses such as epstein barr and they said that some of the studies were conducted in regions where lyme disease is endemic and therefore had much higher rates so the 14 5 per cent figure may be over estimated and non representative of the global population the researchers said a standard testing method worldwide would provide great value in confirming the prevalence of lyme disease as well as information on which groups are most at risk the team said

as u s markets tumbled on monday white house press secretary karine jean pierre made an about face for the white house that had previously brushed off stock losses as something that didn t concern president biden and weren t closely monitored by his administration despite biden s personal bragging about market performance earlier in his administration advertisement as you know we are watching closely jean pierre said of markets on monday while responding to a question on the market crash that wiped out any remaining stock market gains made during the first half of biden s first term we know families are concerned about inflation and the stock market that is something that the president is really aware of she claimed the question an jean pierre s response came as the s p 500 was trading below the level it closed at when president biden was sworn into office while the dow jones industrial average and nasdaq had previously sunk below their january 2021 levels that is market gains made since biden took office are officially gone less than one month ago during the may 18 briefing karine jean pierre had a very different answer about the white house s view of the stock market and what it meant nothing has changed on how we see the stock market she said we do not that s not something that we keep an eye on every day kjp last month the stock market is not something that we keep an eye on every day kjp today following a market crash as you know we are watching closely pic twitter com uhx6vbnxb6 townhall com townhallcom june 13 2022 apparently now something has changed but which is it is biden really aware of and closely watching markets as they fall or is it something he doesn t keep an eye on every day last fall and at other opportunities president biden bragged about stock gains during his first months in office the stock market has gone up exponentially since i ve been president he said last september there were countless pieces from mainstream outlet praising biden for having historic stock market increases through his first 100 days as recently as january of this year in a case of pride coming before a fall one that wiped out americans 401ks biden said the stock market has hit record after record after record on my watch that bragging it seems has been halted at a time when biden and his party desperately need something anything to tout as an accomplishment
these days it s a nightmare every time we get to pull into a gas station just to put some gas in the tank but did you notice a trip to the supermarket could be just as frustrating as my last time going down the aisles i experienced a high dose of sticker shock as everything that was affordable also is out of reach yes you guessed it food prices have also seen a major spike in the past few months and we are all wondering when will this end it s just not fair when people who are trying to make ends meet are literally going broke just to survive paulprescott72 the dilemma continues do you use that surplus cash to put gas in your tank or stock up on much needed staples like milk bread and what is put on the table for dinner and what has caused this inconvenience blame it all on the covid 19 pandemic which caused a shortage of supply on all items that you buy at the grocery store the virus also caused a shortage of labor as lockdowns forced a minimal availability for employees who were hired to oversee daily farm operations let s not forget the russian invasion of ukraine is another factor in causing things to go topsy turvy as both countries have the major worldwide surplus of barley wheat and corn believe it or not sunflower oil is also exported from both areas that are entrenched in this conflict that has cause headaches worldwide many countries are not doing business with russia as the conflict seems never ending to say the least flownaksala a box of cereal has also reached it s highest levels in decades as demand for animal feed has hit the roof and to make things worse the recent case of bird flu has seen skyrocketing prices for a dozen eggs as a 15 increase has been reported as an overall 40 rise is attributed to this major rise in prices economists are hoping this should stabilize by next year but we can hope that prediction becomes reality kellogg s bottom line as consumers we need to economize and tighten our belts by just buying what is essential when shopping make a list and stick with it as we are all sticking to a budget what choice do we have this seems to be the only way to get through this setback we are a hearty bunch here in the berkshires and throughout new england we ll band together and overcome these obstacles as inflation numbers are staggering for the first time since 1979 my outlook the less i eat the more opportunity i ll lose more weight which has been rule of thumb from yours truly since last year two more words for everyone good luck

share this story right from the middle the end of globalization by william o lipinski in recent years americans have seen the foundation of our economy shaken first by the covid 19 pandemic which has taken nearly one million american lives and now the burdens imposed by russia s invasion of ukraine which have fueled dramatic increases in gasoline both have fueled a new wave of inflation and they have raised new issues of security and safety often tied to the growing influence that china has on the development and production of new technologies this poses a serious concern that americans must address has globalization weakened america and given our enemies and rivals a foundation to undermine our freedoms and our lives i believe that globalization is reckless and has made our situation even more serious so there is no misunderstanding this is how i view globalization globalization is the process of integrating financial markets through international trade into a single world market it is about the integration and assimilation of cultures governments healthcare and worse the weakening of the power of the workforce and organized labor in particular because of the pandemic nations have shut down domestically sealed their borders and drastically disrupted the delivery of supplies the pandemic has politicized travel greatly increased the strong opposition to immigration that has always existed and forced many nations to look hard and long at the need to become more self reliant nations have also become less trusting of other countries and thereby has driven many nations and mankind itself further apart this reckless and distractive globalization has permitted a totalitarian nation china with its dreams of world conquest to become the world s factory supplying consumers with much of their retail products china produces and manufacturers half of the world s steel 86 percent of all radios 70 percent of the world s television sets 90 percent of the world s computers and that is just the start of the list countless items that we use and need daily are manufactured and produced in china obviously this gives china an enormous opportunity to hold the world hostage and puts the world in a predicament if the world fails to support china economically and militarily while most if not all of the first world nations have supported ukraine in this war china has supported russia because they are a dictatorial nation no different than russia now china and russia have a sweet heart deal driving up the price of gas and oil they buy from russia and increasing their profits and economic influence it is not in the world s best interest to have a nation like china be in such a powerful position over the rest of the world during the course of the pandemic we have seen how they abuse their own citizens unfortunately because of globalization some other nations have only weakly supported ukraine empowering russia these are nations that have allowed themselves with shortsighted thinking to become dependent on russian gas and oil at the expense of their own independence and the freedom of their citizens if we want a strong free and democratic world nations must become more self reliance and independent we cannot permit one nation particularly a dictatorial nation like china that manufacture 60 of all the products needed and used in this world to control our lives we also must develop other sources of gas and oil as an alternative for all of the european countries who are now buying from russia nations should develop their own nuclear energy our land of liberty the united states of america must increase our oil and gas production to its maximum to free nations from the totalitarian forces in the world that they now depend upon our fortress of freedom and other free and democratic nations must increase the manufacturing of products the world needs we cannot permit two or three or four dictatorial rogue nations to have so much control and influence in this world perhaps one day real globalization that is productive and does not threaten the foundations of nations will be possible but russia s unprovoked attack upon ukraine has proven there is still too much evil in this world for globalization to work for all nations william o lipinski served in congress representing the 5th and 3rd congressional district from 1982 until 2005 email bill at billlipinski hotmail com this column originally appeared in the des plaines valley news newspaper group

ldl c levels with favorable safety profiles although there are imported products in the chinese market there is still room for improvement in terms of affordability accessibility and convenience tafolecimab injection which was supported by the national science and technology major project for major new drug development whose new drug application is the first submitted and formally accepted by the nmpa and it is expected to potentially be the first self developed recombinant fully human anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody launched in china the nda submission was based on the study results of three phase 3 registration clinical trials credit 1 credit 2 and credit 4 compared with placebo tafolecimab injection reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c levels by about 57 65 and maintained long term therapeutic efficacy in addition tafolecimab injection also significantly reduced total cholesterol tc non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non hdl c apolipoprotein b apob and lipoprotein a lp a levels with a high percentage of patients achieving lipid reduction goals a long administration interval once every 6 weeks and overall favorable safety profiles tafolecimab injection is expected to be a potent treatment for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed

james s brady press briefing room 3 42 p m edt ms jean pierre hey good afternoon everyone q hello ms jean pierre hello hello you guys will be very excited i do not have anything at the top for all of you so we re going to go straight to questions darlene want to kick us off q thanks yep i would on the gun framework that was announced over the weekend can you talk a little bit about what specifics the white house would like to see as the lawmakers sit down and try to turn this into a bill specifics on what you want regarding access to juvenile records red flag laws and redefining which gun sellers now have to do expanded background checks ms jean pierre well as you know the text is now going to be written so we re going to allow the negotiators to go through that process what what we do believe and what the president has said is this is a historic agreement and it s the most significant legislation that we have seen to reduce gun violence since more than 20 years and so it s a bipartisan the president is pleased to see this as a step forward as we know you know this is about saving lives and so the president is going to wants to see congress act he wants to see this on his desk as quickly as possible and and that s and that s going to be our focus as it as it relates to his involvement in any of this his team continues to talk to congress on a regular basis as we have been as they have been this past several weeks and we re going to continue talking to negotiators on the hill to congressional members and staff on the hill and and we will continue to have those conversation but we want to the president wants to see this on his desk to sign as soon as possible q will the white house weigh in at all in terms of the final legislative language and text and specific things that you would like you the white house would like to see ms jean pierre i don t have any specifics on on any any you know pieces of the legislation and our involvement there what we will say is we want to see this move quickly the president wants to see this move quickly this is about saving lives and we think again this is a step a step forward in getting that done you know legislating is when you think about legislating it s about negotiating it s about getting to a place where both sides can come to an agreement and this is a bipartisan handshake a framework as you all know and we want to we re pleased by that and we want to get that done q one other question over the weekend before the president left los angeles he was asked whether he had decided to go to saudi arabia and his answer was no not yet and there was a follow up question and then he said that s the reason i m going so can you settle it is he going is he not going just tell us ms jean pierre well i don t have anything to announce for you today q when will you ms jean pierre well let me just say this when the president is ready to make that announcement that s when we will but we continue to plan for a trip to israel and saudi arabia this would be an opportunity for the president to engage with leaders from across the middle east region again i don t have anything to announce for you today you know if you think about the focus what the focus would be and the agenda it s on delivering results for the american people that is what the president when he has these leader leader conversation that is the number one priority those strategic partnership with those leaders and making sure that it indeed delivers for the american people and so in this in this particular case if this were to happen or when we are ready to announce if and when we are ready to announce it s it s would be about about diplomacy leading through diplomacy to bring stability to the middle east region which he has talked about himself and but again i don t have anything to any further anything further to preview at this time q thank you q thanks karine last week you said that when the president met with the parents in uvalde they told him they just wanted to see some action that they wanted to see if congress can quote put their politics aside and come in a bipartisan way and deliver something does this agreement that was announced yesterday deliver on what those parents in uvalde were telling the president that they wanted to see ms jean pierre well let me just make clear what he heard and all of you may have heard from the folks in the community as well is to do something and so the president has called on congress to do something they are doing something now does this framework has everything that the president wants or that everything that the president has called for it does not and the president is going to continue to fight for for for the renew our ban on assault weapons for you know making sure that we confirm steve dettelbach to lead atf right which is something that we we believe is going to happen and so expanding background checks to keep guns out of the hands of criminals so there are things that he wants to continue to see done but but you know again this is about saving lives and this is what s important right now and this is a step towards that direction q you said you said repeatedly now for several weeks that the president was going to give lawmakers time and space and in the statement he said yesterday as you just said that it didn t do everything that he thinks is needed if he had gotten involved is there something now where we are at this point in the conversation and negotiations if he had gotten off the sidelines is there one thing that could have ended up in the agreement that he would have liked to have seen ms jean pierre so i disagree with the framing of that question the president has been involved he has been involved since i would say day one of his administration the first couple of days that he s walked into his administration and what i mean by that is the executive actions that he took very early on and the most executive actions than any president at this time of his presidency when it comes to dealing with a public health epidemic which is gun violence and so he put that forward he did everything at the time that he can from his perch in making sure that we we deal with this epidemic he has said if there s anything more he can do on the executive action side he will take a look his team will take a look he s talked about it most recently state of the union and also the first joint address so he has been vocal he has been talking about this and he also did a primetime a primetime delivery to the american people that as you all know that was about almost two weeks ago so he has been involved and to say that he is not he hasn t been is just not true next q i meant in the negotiations ms jean pierre i m sorry q i meant in the negotiations with this bipartisan group ms jean pierre but no but i m but more broadly he has been involved and he had chris murphy here just last week to to get a to get a download on the negotiations from him directly and i think that shows involvement and that shows him wanting to make sure that we push this forward go ahead q thanks karine on saudi arabia briefly just to circle back on darlene s question the president seemed to say over the weekend that his trip would not focus on energy you said just now that any trip to the region will focus on delivering results for the american people if that s the case why not make energy a major topic of the of the trip considering gas prices are such a big part of what americans care about ms jean pierre well let me let me first say there there s no trip to announce at this point q but he s been talking about inaudible ms jean pierre i m just saying that there s nothing to preview for you at this time but i will say this you know to view engagement with saudi arabia and energy security as asking for oil is simply wrong and a misunderstanding of both the complexity of that issue and our multifaceted discussions with the saudis that said saudi arabia is the chair as you know of opec plus and its largest exporter of course we discuss energy with the saudi government as we do with oil producers around the world and we welcome its leadership in achieving a consensus amongst the group members last week q and just briefly on afghanistan if you could nearly half of afghan afghans are starving or don t have enough food is the administration considering doing more to send direct aid to afghanistan not just the united nations even if that means recognizing the taliban ms jean pierre i don t have anything further on what else we might be doing as ai for aids as aid to the people of afghanistan as you know we have announced humanitarian aid that go directly to the people and not to not to the government but i don t have anything further to share on that q are you sort of in a rock and a hard place position here if the president were to go to saudi arabia would you not see a benefit in embracing the idea that with gas prices at record levels of course you would speak to the kingdom and its role in opec plus in trying to increase supply so why not embrace that because if you re going to go to saudi arabia wouldn t that be a benefit for the president to try to deliver on that even though there are some political downsides to doing that domestically as well ms jean pierre well i think what we re trying to say is that there are more complexities to that issue and it s multifaceted discussions with saudi arabia and it is an array of agenda of agenda that we would we would potentially be talking about look i want to be careful because we don t have i don t have we don t have a trip to preview for you at this time but i also you know as i said saudi arabia is the chair of opec and is the largest exporter so we talk to them like we do with any other oil producers around the world so that is there s no difference there but but again i don t want to go into go into specifics q just on the surface understanding no trip has been announced yet ms jean pierre yeah q we ll get there when we get there but the idea that the president would engage with saudi and not talk about oil production and gas prices when americans are at the highest level they ve been in a long time just doesn t make sense to me it would seem the white house would embrace that as one of the many complex issues you would deal with with saudi arabia and we ve all been covering saudi arabia s relationship which has been fraught on many levels with the united states for a long time so we know there are many issues ms jean pierre yeah q but you re not avoiding saying he s going to be dealing with ms jean pierre well what i what i did say is of course he will be they will discuss energy with the saudi government i think what i m trying to say is to look at this trip as it being only about oil is not it would be simply wrong to do that so we just wanted to be very clear on that on that regard go ahead q thanks karine president biden once bragged about the stock market hitting record after record after record on my watch how about now ms jean pierre meaning the stock market q all the gains from president biden s time in office have been wiped out ms jean pierre so as you know we are watching we re watching closely we know families are concerned about inflation and the stock market that is something that the president is is really aware of and so look we face global challenges we ve talked about this this is we re not the only country dealing with what we re seeing at the moment as it relates to inflation you know putin putin s price hike inflation coming coming out of a once in a generation global pandemic all of those things play a factor and you know but the thing the way that we see this is that the american people are well positioned to face these challenges because of the economic historic gains that we have made under this president under this president in the last 16 months q okay so as you say that americans are well positioned to weather this stock market decline what is the president s message to somebody who might want to retire but their 401 k is getting wiped out ms jean pierre so we know we know that the that high prices are having a real effect on people s lives we get that and we are incredibly focused on doing everything that we can to make sure that the economy is working for every american people but we are coming out of the strongest job market in american history and that matters and that a lot of that is thanks to the american rescue plan which only democrats voted for that republicans did not and it led to this economic boom this historic economic boom that we re seeing with jobs q didn t it also lead to historic inflation ms jean pierre no that is not q no ms jean pierre that is that is that is not that is not how we re seeing the american rescue plan look the president came in we have to remember what the president walked into when he walked into this administration the economy was at a standstill schools were closed businesses were shutting down twenty million people were on unemployment insurance benefits that is what he walked into and he took action he got the american rescue plan done democrats only democrats voted for it and it helped turn the economy around including getting more than 200 million people vaccinated having a comprehensive vaccination plan that that was not in place when he walked into the administration q okay and then quickly is the president running for reelection ms jean pierre he has first of all let s let s reset for a second i cannot talk about elections i cannot be a political analyst from here or you know or the midterms or anything like that or including 2024 the president as you know has been asked that question many times and he has answered it his answer has been pretty simple which is yes he s running for reelection i m i can t say more than that q okay ms jean pierre go ahead q karine thank you back on the discussions about the gun framework you said he spoke with senator murphy you say negotiators continue to talk to people here at the white house has the president himself spoken with any of the republicans engaged in the negotiations ms jean pierre i i hear the question i don t have any any calls to preview or read out to you at this time q did he i know he was flying this morning during the latest january 6th hearing but has he had a chance to go back and watch any of it or is somebody keeping him updated on developments what does he make of it all ms jean pierre so as you know the president is very busy today and so he won t be catching it blow by blow but he ll get updates from from his staff q do you know who s been giving him the updates ms jean pierre i i don t have a person to to share with who s been giving his up an update q and has he been briefed on the arrests of the 31 men found inside a u haul truck near a pride event in idaho on saturday ms jean pierre yes he s been yes he s been briefed q oh okay thank you laughter q karine ms jean pierre okay all right laughs we ll move on then go ahead q hi karine i wanted to switch gears to brexit for a moment britain i guess vo boris johnson s party published today plans to override some of the post brexit trade rules for northern ireland i know blinken told foreign secretary truss that to continue good faith negotiations with the eu to resolve reach a solution that preserves the belfast good friday agreement but i know that boris johnson characterized the changes as relatively trivial and i wanted to know if the white house agreed with that ms jean pierre so the u s priority remains protecting the gains of the belfast good friday agreement and preserving peace stability and prosperity for the people of northern ireland we have welcomed the provisions in the eu uk trade and cooperation agreement and the northern ireland protocol as a way to manage the practical challenges of preserving distinct eu and uk markets while preventing the return of customs infrastructure on the land border we recognize there have been challenges over the implementation of the northern ireland protocol we urge the uk and the eu to return to talks to resolve these differences we support a strong and close eu uk partnership transatlantic peace security and prosperity are best served by a strong uk a strong eu and the closest possible relationship between the two q thank you and if i could just follow up quickly will this become an impediment to the u s uk trade dialogue talks in boston or a potential future u s uk trade deal ms jean pierre no i don t believe it will be q okay thank you ms jean pierre go ahead q karine just back on the saudi issue for a second does president biden believe that crown prince mohammed bin salman was responsible for kamal jamal khashoggi s death ms jean pierre i mean we ve spoken to this before i think he was asked this question directly recently last week so look the president is focused on getting things done for the american people that is engagement leader and le leader to leader engagement around the world he takes that very seriously and he takes delivering for the american people very seriously if he determines that the interests of the united states to engage with a foreign leader and that such an engagement can deliver results then he ll do so and so as we as you have heard her say as you have heard us say saudi arabia has been a partner to the united states for more than 80 years an important partner on a host of initiatives that we are working on both in the region and around the world q on the question that i asked though does he believe that mbs was responsible for khashoggi s death ms jean pierre so we issued when the president when the president walked came into office you know the murder of jamal khashoggi was something that we and so many others around the world took very very seriously he he issued an extensive report on khashoggi s murder and we instituted the so called khashoggi ban to make sure that any country that seeks to use tools of repression against people abroad who criticize their government will pay a price we ve used it multiple multiple times since and we imposed sanctions or visa restrictions on over 70 saudi individuals and entities including the saudi royal guard s rapid intervention force as we emphasized then it was also important to reorient but not rapture relations with saudi arabia so we took that incredibly seriously and the po the president spoken to this before and i m going to just let his word stand go ahead q does he believe ms jean pierre i i m i ve already answered the question go ahead q karine regarding all the trapped agriculture exports in ukraine there s been some reporting that there was a cable sent from the biden administration kind of warning african nations to not buy grain from russia under the pretenses that it may be stolen from ukraine is the white house warning african nations like senegal to not buy any grain from russia right now ms jean pierre i i can t speak to the wire that you re speaking of right now but what i can say is we are working with other countries to prevent the sale of grain that has likely been stolen from from ukraine q would there be any consequences for nations if they do buy grain from russia at this time inaudible ms jean pierre that s a hypothetical that i m just not going to answer from here q can i have one more question ms jean pierre sure q recently the family of emad sharghi told cbs he s an american iranian citizen who was detained in iran four years ago his family told our colleague margaret brennan that they ve requested a meeting with the president numerous times but has not received a response from the white house their latest request was a couple of weeks ago they also haven t received requests from the state department is there any update on when this meeting may take place ms jean pierre i don t have an update for you i m happy to check with the team that is also a question for state department as they handle those types of engagements situations as you know the president is committed to bringing home u s nationals that are being held abroad and that is a commitment that he has made to the american people q does the president think the fed is running the risk of hiking rates too quickly as it tries to tame inflation there are some reports suggesting that there s going to be a larger rate hike than we expected on wednesday ms jean pierre the president believes as you heard from him directly multiple times and even in his op ed most recently that the federal reserve is needs to have their independence and he leaves he wants to give them their space to make their own decision monetary decision on how to deal with inflation they have made that the fed has made that a priority and so that is what the president believes and i ll leave it as that q just one more follow up question the u s ambassador to beijing nick burns said over the weekend that the u s china relationship is at its lowest moment since 1972 given the aggressive comments by china s defense minister on taiwan is the does the president have any plans to speak with president xi jinping ms jean pierre so let me just say this since you asked a question about about china the national security advisor jake sullivan met today with chinese communist party politburo member and director of the office of the foreign affairs commission in luxembourg the meeting was about four and a half hours long this meeting which followed their may 18th phone call included candid substantive and productive discussion of a number of regional and global security issues as well as key issues in u s china relations sullivan understood the importance of maintaining open lines of communication to manage competition between our two countries to your question on a potus potus xi meeting nancy interactions are planned at a range of officials across the u s government but nothing to announce on a potus xi meeting at this time as you know they last talked on the phone as i just mentioned on march 18th we will continue to maintain open lines of communication with china q but what about even just a phone call not even ms jean pierre i don t have anything to preview at this time q i mean just building on nancy does the president want to talk to xi jinping by the end of the year ms jean pierre i just don t have anything to preview as you know and i said this moments ago leader to leader conversations and communication is important to the president as we deal with you know important issues across across the globe i just don t have anything for you right now q on roe vs wade when the president was in california he spoke to jimmy kimmel and he said that there were some executive orders under consideration if roe v wade was overturned can you share a little bit about what is being considered ms jean pierre i don t we don t have anything to preview at this time yes i remember i was there i remember the president saying that we just don t have anything to share at this point q are there any like specific areas where the administration feels that they ms jean pierre no the team q have had some space ms jean pierre the team is looking into it we just don t have anything for you at this time q and just one more at the summit of the americas the argentine president alberto fernández he he invited biden to speak at the next plenary of celac where he s the pro tem president is that an invitation that the president is considering ms jean pierre we don t have anything to to preview or announce at this time q karine i had a question about china and tariffs with inflation still an issue there has been some pressure on president biden to lift some of the tariffs on china but it s also meeting some resistance from union members as he heads tomorrow to the afl cio what does he want to see done as it relates to china and tariffs ms jean pierre so as you know the president has asked his team to look at that particular issue he will make a decision on that i don t want to get ahead of it so that is going to be for the president to to speak to when he s when he s ready q and what s the timeframe on that ms jean pierre i don t have a timeframe q and just to follow up on mbs i heard you mention the report but does the president believe that mbs is responsible for khashoggi s death i didn t hear you sort of engage with that part of the question ms jean pierre i mean the president has talked about that i ve been asked about words that comments that he s made during the campaign he he stands by those comments what i m trying to say is that you know the president said this last week he s not going to change his view on human rights and he ll let me quote him right now but as president of the united states my job is to bring peace if i can and that s what i m going to try to do and that s how he answered the question when he was q i know but that s a generalized statement i mean this is a very specific question about what he believes ms jean pierre look we put we put measures in place we put out a report last year on that particular the serious nature of what happened and we take that very very seriously the president has spoken to it himself and you know i m going to leave his words as he has said himself leave his words stand go ahead q thanks karine i want to follow up first on the chinese goods and tariffs question how quickly does the white house anticipate it would take for americans to feel the effects on the price of goods if it lifts tariffs on some of these products ms jean pierre i mean the president hasn t made a decision on that so i that s a hypothetical that i actually can t can t answer q does the white house feel that it would have a significant effect on inflation ms jean pierre again i mean that is a decision that is going to be put together and by his team and the president is going to make a decision i that s a hypothetical i literally cannot answer q and one last thing on the january 6th hearings based on the evidence that lawmakers have presented so far does the president believe that attorney general merrick garland should prosecute former president donald trump ms jean pierre look the president has said this before in voicing his support for the vital work of the bipartisan january 6th select committee and as kevin mccarthy said just days after the attack we cannot sweep this under the rug we agree all americans should watch and remember the horrors of one of the darkest days in our history but this is up to the department of justice this is the department of justice and the president has been very clear the department of justice is inde is independent the president chose attorney general garland because of his loyalty to the law and our constitution and to restore the independence and integrity of the justice department and this that s exactly what the attorney general is doing so we leave it up to the department of justice go ahead q has the president spoken to senator schumer since the agreement on guns was reached ms jean pierre i don t have a call to read out for you q and on the arrests in idaho over the weekend what was the president s reaction when he was briefed and what if anything has the administration done in response ms jean pierre so that s still under investigation i can t speak to that from here q karine ms jean pierre i ll go to some people i haven t gone to no one up here okay laughs go ahead q thanks karine a question on gas prices they hit the an average of over 5 00 this weekend so i was wondering is the administration reconsidering the idea of a federal gas tax holiday and what other things are you guys thinking about are on the table ms jean pierre so don t have anything new for you we don t have anything new for you to announce on gas prices or the gas tax but as you know gas prices are up nearly 2 00 and that has been the case per gallon that has been the case since putin started to threaten the borders of ukraine with with the troop enforcement at the border the u s is on track to produce a record amount of oil next year we re releasing a record 1 million barrels of oil per day from the stra strategic petroleum reserve that has been for six months we ve rallied our partners to join us releasing an additional 240 million barrels of oil and that has been because of the president s president s leadership we ve also expanded access to e 15 which will lower prices for thousands thousands of gasoline stations including people families in the middle east so that was an important move and as i mentioned before we welcomed the production increase announced by opec plus to increase global supply and if the president had not taken these actions we would not have been able to blunt the to blunt what we re seeing now the prices it would have been even worse and so but as far as anything new to share we don t have anything new to share on that q let me ask you the president expressed some real frustration with exxon last week is he reaching out to these ceos is there talk about having a meeting with them is there anything like that on the table ms jean pierre so in just the first three months of this year just to give you a little bit of why the president made those comments last week exxon made 8 8 billion in profits that s triple what they made during the same year the same time last year and the most they ve made in nearly a decade those record profits aren t because they produce more oil in fact exxon produced less oil this quarter than any quarter this since 1999 oil companies making their largest profits in years have a choice to put money into producing and refining oil or to put in to put it into the pockets of wealthy sha stakehol shareholders while american families suffer at the pump exxon made that choice they made the choice this quarter exxon announced that it is tripling its buybacks to 30 billion so look we re on track as i just mentioned to to reach record levels of production next year but oil companies also need to do their part as well and that s why the president was was very very clear about what he said last week go ahead q thank you karine a couple of questions please ms jean pierre sure q so as the ukraine war drags on and the food cris the resulting food crisis is clearly not going away it s only just getting worse there seems to be pressure growing in europe from some of the u s allies to get ukraine to a point where they re going to make some kind of deal with the russians or at least some sort of ceasefire anything primarily for the food situation so ahead of the president s trip to europe this month would you say his emphasis remains on helping ukraine fight or is it starting to shift into a place where the u s is going to be asking ukraine to find a way to stop it ms jean pierre well i mean the president has been very clear nothing about ukraine without ukraine right that i mean he s been very clear about that he wrote an op ed in the new york times saying reiterating those comments we are going to continue to assist ukraine in helping to defend their democracy again you know we ve said this many times is this is putin s war this is putin s aggression unprovoked aggression onto another country s sovereignty this is putin s war to end and not ukraine ukraine needs to defend its country and they have done that in in an incredibly impressive of way and you know we hoped that it would end with negotiations but right now we don t see that coming from the kremlin and so we want to make sure we put ukraine in the strongest possible place so that if that time comes they can do that when it comes to grain exports and what you re asking me about food insecurity this is a priority for the president he s spoken to this you know again russia has been repeatedly damaging grain storage facilities in ukraine stealing ukrainian grain and actively blocking the export of food from ukrainian ports increasing world hunger russia could immediately cease its war in ukraine which is devastating global food security and allow the free flow of ukrainian food and agricultural exports q and a quick domestic one please most presidents i m guessing would say they don t pay attention to the polls but does president biden feel any concern that his approval rating is really pretty amazingly low and consistently low i believe today it went under the average went under 40 percent for the first time ms jean pierre the president is focused on delivering for the american people that s his focus right now q karine thank you inflation has been above 5 percent for an entire year now why did the president wait until almost december to decide who would be leading the federal reserve ms jean pierre the president has taken taken the economy as a whole and inflation very seriously especially these past several months in making sure that he does everything he can when it comes to as we know inflation is is increasing is increasing costs in two important areas for the american people food and gas i have listed out the things that the president has done and so that you know that hasn t changed it has been a priority that s why we see the economy in a in a strong stronger place than it s been a historic place than it s been in decades and so the president is going to continue to do that to do that work we do have a federal reserve you know the chair and others in place we re going to leave that and make sure that they re independent leave the work to them they have the strongest tools in dealing with inflation they have made this a priority and so we re going to leave it to them all right go ahead q the experts now suggest that ms jean pierre i m going to move on go ahead q thank ms jean pierre yeah go ahead q thank you karine over the weekend a crisis pregnancy center in oregon was firebombed that s the fourth one so far and then last weekend of course a would be assassin was arrested outside the home of justice kavanaugh i know that the administration condemns violence and you ve said as much several times previously but i m wondering is there anything that the president is doing to cool passions before the dobbs decision drops ms jean pierre you mean in with as it relates to abor the decision so i want it to be really clear you know the department of justice as it relates to kavanaugh has u s marshals providing support to the supreme court marshal and the president supports legislation to fund increased security for court and judges and it is how it has now been reported that the marshals our administration assigned to help protect judges were instrumental in the person not accomplishing the horrible deed that he set out to do this is the threat that we saw against kavanaugh and so we have taken this very seriously like you said we have condemned condemned it the president has and we will continue to do so any int intimidation or threats against judges is something that we take very seriously and so you know one of the reasons again one of the reasons the the act did not happen last week was because the department of doj took that very seriously from the beginning when we were when we were hearing the threats and the intimidation and put u s marshals there q and then with regard to some of the arson that we ve been seeing around the country ms jean pierre well that s something clearly the doj is looking into and you know they ve taken that very seriously we have seen an uptick of that type of arson and bombing and or attempt to bomb as we saw just recently over the weekend and so again that s for doj is taking that very seriously and they re going to continue to do so q and then just one quick follow up an aide sneezes ms jean pierre bless you chris q jen was asked about some of these protests that were occurring outside of supreme court justices home homes and she reiterated that the administration wants them to remain peaceful but does the president believe that there should be any type of protesters picketing outside of judges homes when there s a case pending before them ms jean pierre so you know we have not weighed in on where people should or should not protest we have said that all americans have the right to peacefully protest whatever their point of view but that but that attempts at intimidation and violence are totally unacceptable and that they need to be condemned at any time they happen regardless of who does it q thank you karine ms jean pierre go ahead q yeah thank you the president signed the bipartisan infrastructure bill on november 15th of last year for supply chains phone alarm goes off time is not up yet laughter ms jean pierre yeah time is up ed your time is up q i know we heard at that that point that wait until year and then the sli supply chains will start to work themselves out well it s june seven months later and we re still waiting for supply chains to work themselves out so what s happening ms jean pierre so let me just say that we re funding major new initiatives on the docks and on dock rail systems the port of long beach to move goods more quickly so we re making those investment right now an example that i want to give because the president was just at a port in los angeles as you know the port of los angeles to be specific and announced may cargo volumes there he announced that may cargo volumes landed at approximately 970 000 container units the third best month in ports in a 115 year history the port set a new record averaging 12 000 units loaded off and back on each vessel and half shelved availability is at 89 percent just a tick below pre pandemic so we have seen the investments are are out there and we have seen some improvements q but when is relief coming because when he signed it inflation was 6 8 percent it s now 8 6 percent so when is that relief coming ms jean pierre look we re going to continue to expand capacity of our ports and that s going to be thanks to the bipartisan infrastructure law so we re again we re seeing investments now i just gave an example of how we saw an uptick uptick in the you know container units which is very important as we re talking about supply chain and what the bipartisan infrastructure law has been able to do and we think we ll continue to see that go ahead q and can i ask you can i ask you a question on q thank you karine ms jean pierre well i was calling him and then we can yeah q yeah can i ask you a question on q thanks karine ms jean pierre yeah go ahead q so there s a coalition of civil rights groups that have been calling for president biden to sign an executive order that would do essentially what h r 40 is which is create a commission to study enslavement in the united states and consider reparations they ve renewed these calls in the aftermath of the buffalo shooting saying that this is a symptom of the u s their inability the failure to respond or have to sort of reparatively respond to this issue i saw i talked to members of the congressional black caucus including congresswoman sheila jackson lee they are in support of president biden signing this order given the inability to get h r 40 passed in congress in this session and probably not in the next session i know you were asked about reparations previously earlier this month in relation to the california reparations task force that president biden s position has not changed on this however considering the fact that president biden did sign an executive order that created a commission to study reforming the supreme court would he sign an executive order to create a permission for reparations ms jean pierre i look again the president s position has not changed on this you know we ve been asked this question many times i haven t checked in with him on this new kind of new ask from congressional members because as it s connected to buffalo but the president s position just hasn t changed i don t have anything more for you to share on that go ahead you can go i i sorry q yeah thank you ms jean pierre i accidently q that s okay ms jean pierre yeah q so president zelenskyy has been pressing for a quick ukraine submission into the european union does the president biden support granting ukraine accelerated path to the eu ms jean pierre well that s not up to us we re not part of the eu the european union that is something that the members have to decide we re we re not going to inject ourselves in something that we just don t belong to q one more please ms jean pierre yeah sure q so ukrainian officials warned that without a rapid increase in military assistance ukraine faces a defeat in a crucial region of donbas is president biden willing to respond to those demands and is the president satisfied with military assistance for ukraine from u s allies in europe especially france and germany ms jean pierre well you know we as it relates to our allies we have seen them get involved in their own way i think it s up to them on how they want to assist ukraine but we have seen a coalition when it comes to nato allies when it comes to our european partners in coming together in a way to help ukraine and that a lot of that is because of this president s leadership so i know that you re you re talking about a specific area in the east right that people have been talking about you know it i don t want to i don t want to speculate with hypo hypotheticals on what might happen there i know the city has been under fierce assault and ukrainians have been fighting bravely under constant bombardment and difficult conditions president zelenskyy has described the fighting as severe as ukrainian forces battle russian s forces for every meter we are continuing to surge security assistance to ukraine to help them defend that area of the donbas so that is something that we re doing every day there s security assistance going into ukraine on a daily on a daily clip if you will secretary austin will be in europe this week holding the next round of meetings of the ukraine ukraine contact group where he will host ministers of defense and chiefs of defense from dozens of countries and ask them to continue to provide weapons and equipment as well so that also answers your question about getting others to get involved q thanks karine ms jean pierre oh oh we re done q do one more ms jean pierre okay laughs q can i can i ask you a question on ms jean pierre oh my gosh who do i want to go to q cross talk by reporters ms jean pierre go ahead you in the corner i haven t ever called on you q thank thank you karine ms jean pierre yeah in the back q thank q thank you so i have two questions on baby formula so first what is the white house what is the latest update the white house has received on the current infant formula situation across the country ms jean pierre yeah let me see if i have anything new for you on that because i think it s been a couple of days since we have asked been asked that question okay i don t have anything new i know we made some announcements last week i don t i just don t have them in front of me but if you want to come back and we ll we ll talk through the things that we have been able to do in the past what the most recent activities that we ve done q and a second question so house appropriations chairwoman rosa delauro sent a letter to the hhs inspector general asking the fda to or asking the inspector general to investigate the fda s recent policy to use enforcement discretion for certain importation of infant formula so but she expressed concerns that the rapid pace that they re making these approval decisions with only nine full time staff members so is the president confident that the fda is being able to make these decisions to make sure infant formula that is being imported is safe and ms jean pierre so first i haven t seen the letter so that s number one so can t really speak to the letter if you re asking me if the president has confidence in the fda he does okay thanks everybody 4 27 p m edt

their portfolios can be devastating as they don t have the time to wait for the market to recover plus they are withdrawing money to live on during their retirement and selling stocks when the market is down is the exact opposite of the investing truism buy low sell high some investors no matter what their age have a great fear of losing money in the market they just can t stand to see the value of their portfolio decline they seek out investments that are very low risk treasury bonds can be a good investment for either of these types of investors and can be a solid choice for part of your retirement plan no matter how old you are here is what you need to know to learn if they are right for you how does a treasury bond work treasury bonds sometimes called t bonds are debt instruments issued by the united states government when you buy a treasury bond you are essentially lending the government money in return the government agrees to pay you interest twice a year for the life of the bond once the bond matures the government will pay your back the money you loaned it when you buy a treasury bond you will know how long you will need to hold the bond t bonds are issued in terms of 20 or 30 years and what the interest rate is treasury bonds are offered in multiples of 100 this is the bond s face value if you wanted to invest 1 000 in treasury bonds you would buy 10 bonds the price of bonds is determined at auction and may be greater than equal to or less than the face value sometimes called par the interest rate is also determined at auction since it is a function of the bond s price each bond has a coupon rate which is the rate of interest it is expected to pay in some circumstances investors will bid up the interest rate because they want that particular bond in this case the bond would be sold at less than par resulting in a greater return for the investor than the coupon rate would indicate the interest rate the bond actually pays is referred to as yield to maturity here s an example suppose a 30 year bond has a coupon rate of 4 25 investors think this bond is actually worth 4 35 this is its yield to maturity in order for the investor to make 4 35 on the bond they have to buy it for less than par value so a 100 treasury bond would be sold for 98 33 instead of 100 the investor earns 4 25 in interest each year payable in two payments of 2 12 each every six months in 30 years the bond matures and the investor gets back 100 not the 98 33 they paid the difference between the price of 98 33 and the par value of 100 is what represents the additional 0 10 in the interest rate conversely if investors think this bond should only be paying 3 99 ytm they will pay more than par when they buy the bond instead of 100 the investor would pay 104 51 the investor will still get 4 25 in interest each year two payments of 2 12 each every six months in 30 years the bond matures and the investor gets back 100 not the 104 51 they paid the difference represents the reduction of 0 26 in the interest rate how often are treasury bonds issued treasury bonds are originally issued four times per year in february may august and november scheduled reopenings when additional amounts of previously issued bonds are sold occur in january march april june july september october and december reopenings have the same interest rate and maturity date as the original issue but may and usually do have a different purchase price you can also make a competitive bid for treasury bonds specifying the interest rate you want to get your bid may or may not be accepted or may be accepted for only part of the number of bonds you specify to place a competitive bid you must do so at a bank or a broker what are treasury bonds paying now the interest rates on treasury bonds rise and fall along with the fed funds rate although they may not operate exactly in tandem 30 year treasury bonds issued on june 15 2022 have a coupon rate of 2 87 the high yield or auction rate is 3 18 so these bonds will sell at a discount to par 20 year treasury bills issued on may 31 2022 have a coupon rate of 2 50 and a high yield of 3 29 so these bonds will also sell at a discount to par can you make money on treasury bonds treasury bonds earn a fixed rate of interest the interest rate is set when the bonds are issued and it is expressed as an annual rate and paid in two semi annual payments so if you purchase a 30 year treasury bond with an interest rate of 5 00 you will receive 60 payments of 2 50 each for a total of 150 over the life of the bond if you purchased the bond at a discount that is for less than the 100 face value you will get 100 back when the bond matures so the difference between what you paid and the par value is another way bond investors make money when bonds are purchased at a discount how can i buy treasury bonds you can buy treasury bonds online at treasurydirect gov or from a bank or a licensed broker if you purchase bonds through treasurydirect gov you agree to accept the interest rate that is set at auction you cannot enter a competitive bid on the website can i cash in a treasury bond early 20 or 30 years is a long time to hold a single investment for this reason many investors seek to sell their treasury bonds before they mature so there is an active secondary market for treasury bonds like other investments they are only worth what someone is willing to pay for them so you will need to determine if selling is a good idea at the particular time you re looking to do so just like buying bonds you can sell them through a bank broker or at treasurydirect gov are treasury bonds a good investment because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the united state government treasury bonds are one of the safest investments you can buy because there is so little risk that you will lose money they don t usually pay a very high return so if you re young not afraid of risk and investing for your retirement in 40 or 50 years treasury bonds should probably be a very small part of your portfolio if any but if you re looking retirement in the face or can t sleep at night because you re worried about losing money in the stock market treasury bonds could be a very good choice for you for most investors treasury bonds can make up a part of their portfolio but how much will depend on your particular situation information is accurate as of june 13 2022

there are conflicting views on what impact a third consecutive la nina weather event will have on crops in india and australia advertisement read also coming canola crush capacity delayed saskatoon canada s canola crush buildout is not going as smoothly as planned according to the u s department of agriculture many weather models anticipate ongoing la nina conditions throughout 2022 according to presenters at the international grains council s grains conference 2022 la nina years typically result in better than average monsoon rainfall for india said fahad vaipei vice president of olam a singapore based agribusiness company india s wheat exports tend to surge during la nina periods like they have the last couple years exports are estimated at 4 5 to five million tonnes in 2022 23 which is about half of what was initially forecast due to a government ban caused by excessive heat during harvest the last time india had a stretch of solid exports was during the la nina years of 2011 12 through 2013 14 exports topped six million tonnes in 2012 13 these high production years during la nina have helped india export and is helping cap world wheat prices during years with high wheat prices said vaipei with la nina forecast to remain in place through 2022 he is forecasting another bumper crop will be harvested in india in april 2023 and another strong export program to ensue advertisement it would also boost india s pulse production which wouldn t be good for canadian pea and lentil farmers however according to drew lerner president of world weather inc this year s la nina will be many times weaker than the previous two events its influence on world weather is going to be meagre at best he said in a phone interview lerner believes india s weather will be dictated instead by the indian ocean dipole which is in a negative phase that means cooler temperatures in the indian ocean and less water vapor feeding the southwest monsoons that is why he believes the summer monsoon season will be disappointing despite la nina being around carlos mera head of agro commodity research at rabobank said that la nina is usually associated with poor wheat crops around the world advertisement that is why he is calling for a third consecutive deficit in global wheat production in 2022 23 especially when adding in the problems caused by the war in ukraine this year s deficit will be the largest of the three at over 10 million tonnes the last time there was a deficit that large was 2012 13 following two consecutive la nina years where are we going to find more stocks he said in a pre recorded presentation for the conference i think it s going to be a difficult task both winter wheat and spring wheat crops are in trouble in the united states and there is dryness in other key exporting regions like the european union and argentina mera noted that while la nina is bad news for many wheat producing regions of the world it is good news for australia preliminary estimates call for 32 6 million tonnes of production in that country that would be down from the record 36 3 million tonnes harvested in 2021 but would still be the third largest crop in australia s history advertisement a third consecutive la nina is also expected to boost production of other grains oilseeds and pulses in australia lerner is once again skeptical of that forecast because he believes it is going to be a weak la nina that may have completely fizzled out by the time australia s spring and summer season rolls around in the september through march period however he did note that while a negative indian ocean dipole typically cools the indian ocean it also results in warmer ocean temperatures off the coast of sumatra that in turn can result in more rainfall in central and southeast australia during the country s winter months that means south australia victoria and new south wales could get a good drink of water leading up to spring planting if la nina hangs around and is strong enough it would also enhance precipitation in queensland and new south wales during the summer months but he doubts that will happen for now lerner is forecasting normal moisture conditions for australia s summer crop advertisement contact sean pratt producer com
on may 5 2022 senate bill 284 was introduced in the delaware general assembly proposing amendments to the delaware statutory trust act dsta 1 these amendments include the addition of new subchapter iii control beneficial interest acquisitions cbia subchapter the cbia subchapter would apply to all registered closed end funds and business development companies bdcs that are organized as delaware statutory trusts and have a class of equity securities listed on a national securities exchange 2 the cbia subchapter would implement a control share statute for registered closed end funds and bdcs and would contain provisions comparable to existing control share statutes in other states 3 generally control share statutes provide a company with the right to prevent or restrict certain changes in corporate control by altering or removing voting rights of a person that acquires directly or indirectly the ownership of or the power to direct the vote of control shares as defined in the specific state control share statute control shares are shares of stock that are equal to or exceed specified percentages of the company s total voting power holders of control shares cannot vote their control shares unless the company s stockholders vote to approve the voting rights by an affirmative vote of a specific proportion e g two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast at a special meeting called for such purposes excluding all interested parties 4 the cbia subchapter would differ in some respects from existing state control share statutes by virtue of its design to complement the unique regulatory and corporate governance considerations applicable to registered closed end funds and bdcs under the investment company act of 1940 1940 act and would restore delaware to a state of parity with maryland as a jurisdiction for organizing registered closed end funds and business development companies application of the cbia subchapter many closed end investment companies registered or regulated under the 1940 act covered funds are organized as delaware statutory trusts and are subject to the dsta the cbia subchapter would automatically apply to all covered funds without any action on the part of the covered fund or its board of trustees 5 consistent with the general approach of the dsta to give maximum effect to the principle of freedom of contract 6 the cbia subchapter permits a covered fund s board of trustees through a provision in the covered fund s governing instrument or by board action alone to eliminate the application of the cbia subchapter to the acquisition of beneficial interests in the covered fund specifically generally or generally by types as to specifically identified or unidentified existing or future beneficial owners or their affiliates or associates or as to any series or classes of beneficial interests 7 however the cbia subchapter does not provide that a covered fund can generally opt out of the application of the cbia subchapter to the covered fund the cbia subchapter is forward looking only and any control beneficial interest acquisitions before august 1 2022 the effective date of the cbia subchapter if it becomes law would not be subject to the cbia subchapter the cbia subchapter follows the general structure of existing state control share statutes it defines control beneficial interests by reference to an increasing series of voting power ranges and provides that a holder of control beneficial interests acquired in a control beneficial interest acquisition8 has no voting rights under the dsta or the governing instrument of the covered fund with respect to the control beneficial interests acquired in the control beneficial interest acquisition except to the extent approved by the beneficial owners of the covered fund by the affirmative vote of two thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter excluding all interested beneficial interests 9 this vote generally must be taken at a special meeting requested by the acquiring person pursuant to the procedures contained in proposed section 3885 of the dsta the cbia subchapter provides for an increasing series of voting power ranges considered control beneficial interests whether one of these ranges of voting power is met is determined by aggregating the holdings of the acquiring person as well as those of his her or its associates 10 these ranges are 10 or more but less than 15 of all voting power 15 or more but less than 20 of all voting power 20 or more but less than 25 of all voting power 25 or more but less than 30 of all voting power 30 or more but less than a majority of all voting power or a majority or more of all voting power voting power under the cbia subchapter is the power whether such power is direct or indirect or through any contract arrangement understanding relationship or otherwise to directly or indirectly exercise or direct the exercise of the voting power of beneficial interests of a covered fund in the election of trustees either generally or with respect to any subset series or class of trustees including any trustees elected solely by a particular series or class of beneficial interests under the cbia subchapter once a threshold is reached an acquirer has no voting rights with respect to beneficial interests in excess of that threshold i e the control beneficial interests until approved by a vote of beneficial owners as described above that process is then repeated at each threshold level for example upon a control beneficial interest acquisition resulting in ownership of 12 of all voting power the acquirer would only be able to exercise 9 99 of the covered fund s voting power until the full 12 voting power is approved by a vote of beneficial owners assuming that occurred and the acquirer then executed a control beneficial interest acquisition resulting in ownership of 17 of all voting power the acquirer would only be able to exercise 14 99 of the covered fund s voting power until the full 17 voting power is approved by a vote of beneficial owners the cbia subchapter requires a holder of beneficial interests to disclose to the covered fund any control beneficial interest acquisition within 10 days of such acquisition and also permits a covered fund to require a holder of beneficial interests or an associate of such person to disclose the number of beneficial interests owned or with respect to which such person or an associate thereof can directly or indirectly exercise voting power 11 further the cbia subchapter requires a holder of beneficial interests or an associate of such person to provide to a covered fund within 10 days of receiving a request therefor from the covered fund any information that the trustees reasonably believe is necessary or desirable to determine whether a control beneficial interest acquisition has occurred 12 under the cbia subchapter a member of a national securities exchange shall not be deemed to be a beneficial owner of beneficial interests held directly or indirectly by it on behalf of another person solely because such member is the record holder of such securities and pursuant to the rules of such exchange may direct the vote of such beneficial interests without instruction on other than contested matters or matters that may affect substantially the rights or privileges of the holders of the beneficial interests to be voted but is otherwise precluded by the rules of such exchange from voting without instructions 13 benefits for covered funds the cbia subchapter contains several provisions designed to complement the unique regulatory and corporate governance considerations applicable to covered funds under the 1940 act and to provide benefits relative to the maryland control share acquisition act mcsaa 14 that can apply to registered closed end funds and business development companies organized as maryland corporations many covered funds issue preferred beneficial interests that under the 1940 act are entitled to vote as a separate class to elect two trustees preferred trustees 15 the definition of control beneficial interests would apply to acquisitions of preferred beneficial interests giving a holder voting power in the election of preferred trustees within the above referenced voting power ranges and define that as a control beneficial interest acquisition under the cbia subchapter this recognizes the unique corporate governance dynamics applicable to many covered funds acknowledges the manner in which those dynamics impact corporate control and provides clarity on how to apply the cbia subchapter in this unique context additionally the voting power ranges constituting control beneficial interests are more tailored to the ranges of voting power that can result in undue influence over a covered fund the mcsaa contains thresholds at i 1 10 or more but less than 1 3 of all voting power ii 1 3 or more but less than a majority of all voting power and iii a majority or more of all voting power 16 in light of the generally low overall shareholder participation in covered funds shareholder meetings and the result that a relatively small amount of voting power can influence the outcome of a matter put to a vote by covered funds the increased stratification of voting power ranges in the cbia subchapter could provide greater protection to investors in covered funds for example the difference between an acquiring person owning 11 and 21 of a covered fund s voting power may make a significant difference in the outcome of a vote under the cbia subchapter noninterested beneficial owners will be able to evaluate the intentions and plans of an acquiring person at the 10 15 and 20 level whereas under the mcsaa an approval at the 11 level would remain sufficient until the acquiring person owned 33 33 of the voting power the definition of associate in the cbia subchapter serves to encompass a wide range of parties related to an acquiring person including any investment fund or other collective investment vehicle that shares an investment adviser with the acquiring person this is important because the 1940 act does not otherwise prohibit affiliated private funds with the same investment adviser from acting in concert to acquire a large position in a closed end fund and then exert undue influence on the acquired closed end fund 17 registered closed end funds and bdcs are designed to pursue a stated investment objective by pursuing a stated investment strategy for the long term benefit of beneficial owners the cbia subchapter contains provisions that serve to prevent acquiring persons from disrupting and distracting covered funds in the execution of these long term strategies accordingly the board of trustees is not required to call a special meeting at the request of an acquiring person to present the issue of voting rights to be accorded the beneficial interests acquired in a control beneficial interest acquisition if the acquiring person making such request or an associate of such person has in the three year period preceding such request made a request to have the issue of the voting rights to be accorded the beneficial interests acquired in a control beneficial interest acquisition presented for consideration at a meeting of beneficial owners where the beneficial owners have not approved such acquisition 18 the board of trustees is also entitled to include a vote on the issue of such voting rights at the covered fund s annual meeting rather than call a special meeting if an acquiring person s request is received within 120 days of the anniversary date of the covered fund s proxy statement for the prior year s annual meeting 19 additionally control beneficial interests are not considered outstanding for shareholder quorum purposes until voting rights for such control beneficial interests are approved by noninterested beneficial owners 20 the application of the cbia subchapter is also clear and unambiguous the new legislation would automatically apply to all covered funds without any action on the part of a covered fund or its board of trustees as discussed previously the mcsaa applies to a registered closed end fund only if its board of directors affirmatively opts in to the coverage of the mcsaa as described above the cbia subchapter gives the board of trustees tools to monitor concentrated ownership that may constitute a control beneficial interest acquisition and imposes duties on beneficial owners to cooperate with reasonable requests from covered funds in this regard 21 overall the foregoing unique benefits that the cbia subchapter provides are designed to complement the unique regulatory and corporate governance considerations applicable to covered funds under the 1940 act and to provide enhanced protection relative to comparable provisions in the mcsaa next steps the use of control share statutes and bylaws by registered closed end funds and business development companies has been a rapidly evolving area in recent years the cbia subchapter represents a thoughtful legislative application of the unique 1940 act principles relevant to registered closed end funds and bdcs in the control share context registered fund and bdc sponsors should follow the progress of the cbia subchapter legislation and take it into account along with all applicable legal and regulatory considerations if presently considering a new fund launch or redomesication of an existing fund _______________ 1 see delaware senate bill 284 2 the cbia subchapter does not apply to unlisted registered closed end funds and business development companies and they cannot opt in to the cbia subchapter 3 approximately half of u s states have adopted control share statutes however among the organizational forms most commonly utilized by registered closed end funds and bdcs only one maryland corporate law features a control share statute

by jan larson mclaughlin bg independent news the oil boom era in bowling green brought risk takers hard workers and just plain lucky men to the city in the late 1800s it turned gallant civil war veterans into wealthy citizens and resulted in beautifully ornate homes on the west edge of the downtown on saturday a walking tour through the boomtown area attracted local history buffs and residents curious about the roots of their community the tour which was quickly overbooked with a waiting list was led by marnie pratt local history librarian at wood county district public library and kelli kling director at the wood county museum pratt started by setting the scene for the tour bowling green was a small town of 169 residents when the 1860 census was taken a decade later the town had grown to 906 residents then bowling green was named the county seat in 1875 and oil was struck in 1885 causing the city population to explode to 5 000 residents while the boomtown era brought wealth it was still a town of plank sidewalks and dirt streets on the city payroll was a lamplighter who was tasked with lighting and extinguishing the street lights each night walking tour participants turn onto west wooster street from north grove street the walking tour headed west from the library making stops for the participants to admire still grand homes constructed in styles ranging from italianate queen anne gothic neo colonial and georgian revival it s funny when you walk you see things you never see when you drive by said wil roudebush a member of the city s historic preservation commission chad duffy brought his wife lorene 36 on the tour for her birthday the couple has lived in bowling green for three years it s so fascinating to learn about local history he said katelyn elliott said her family has brushed up on local history taking part in the recent scavenger hunt downtown and learning along with their third grader on the school district s local history curriculum i m here because of my interest in local history she said some participants had close ties to the tour including erin hachtel who found out that her home at the northeast corner of west wooster and north grove streets was part of the tour i didn t know that cool hachtel said as the tour headed toward her queen anne style home for some the ties were decades old margaret montague pointed out the west wooster street home that was previously a hospital her brother was born there in 1943 a little further down the street was the old wood county children s home where montgague s father spent part of his childhood the gothic style building was home to many children whose parents could not care for them due to deaths abandonment abuse poverty or mental health issues it was like a safety net montague said the tour was as much about the people who lived in the boomtown homes as the historic architecture the carter house on north church street behind the library was frequently a meeting place for the shakespeare round table group which still exists today pratt said at one of the women s meetings in 1911 a fundraiser was launched to establish the first public library we were actually born in that building pratt said historic boomtown tour stops at house on north grove street the italianate style brick home at 135 n grove st was built around 1878 for civil war veteran captain jb newton when natural gas was discovered it created opportunities for the glass industry in bowling green and newton became director of the buckeye glass co the ohio flint glass co this house is supposedly the first house in bowling green to have a bathtub and is also rumored to have had a secret passageway i want to believe it s there somewhere kling said the queen anne style home at 226 w wooster st features a variety of colors and texture materials and a corner cut double bay window with twin pyramid roofs it was built around 1889 for another civil war veteran james cunning this was the outskirts of town when it was built kling said some of the grand homes told stories of bold women during the boom era a jeweler and silversmith frederic von kanel came to bowling green in 1877 and opened a store downtown he died in 1893 but his wife and daughter finished the building of their home at 316 w wooster st and built a large brick storefront downtown and continued his jewelry business this was unusual at the time for women to run a large business like this pratt said historical records stated that their success has been almost phenomenal they have carried on the store in an admirable manner having largely increased stock keeping up with latest styles and fancies of the day and have won the admiration and commendation of businessmen throughout the country they are a living illustration of what women with brains force of character and a determined purpose can accomplish in any line to which they devote their energies mrs von kanel was the sister of alex klever who also worked in the jewelry store klever s specialty was watch repair when the von kanel store was sold alex klever opened klever s jewelry which operated downtown for many years another house on the route at 328 w wooster st played a notable role for women in bowling green the italianate style home with broad overhanging eaves ornate window frames and decorated cornices was built in 1878 1881 and purchased by john w canary who was a local merchant and lawyer in 1912 a group of women gathered in the home hosted by celia canary they were joined by a woman named mecca marie varney who had just given a lecture in the area on women s right to vote the wood county suffrage group continued to hold meetings in houses of several other women throughout the city for coming years tour stops in front of dunn funeral home on west wooster street another civil war veteran john hankey built his home at 408 w wooster st which is now dunn funeral home hankey had been struck with typhoid fever and was discharged from the service in 1864 hankey was a true entrepreneur of the oil boom period in wood county kiing said he was a risk taker and he was rewarded handsomely for it he owned a number of properties downtown and in fact one obituary stated that he financed more block buildings downtown than any other single investor she said hankey turned around a deteriorating sawing and planing mill had a hand in glass and oil companies a bank machine shop and politics he was also one of the founders of the bowling green opera house wood county museum director kelli kling talks about house on west wooster street across the street at 403 w wooster st is the neo colonial style built by thomas conley in 1902 reminiscent of homes in his hometown of baltimore maryland conley was a lawyer court reporter and law librarian the house was eventually passed on to his daughter minniebelle conley who was the society page editor of the daily sentinel for 52 years 1927 1980 at 333 w wooster st sits a home built in 1896 by another self made businessman albert royce he reportedly started by working for 75 cents a day in a chair factory in toledo he eventually quit this job and with money he had saved opened his own grocery store in bowling green he later moved into a larger grain buying selling business then into banking investing pretty much everything he got into was either a big success or he was at least in the right place at the right time which was often the case with a lot of these early county residents pratt said he was so successful he didn t need to keep the oil discovered on his land characteristically colorful like other homes of the boomtown era is the home at 327 w wooster st the queen anne style with a three story octagonal tower was built for 9 000 in 1892 by dr charles d yonker who was a prominent physician and druggist he had a very successful drugstore for many years then became a successful insurance salesman the insurance company went through a financial scandal that destroyed the company and the financial security of many associated with it yonker reportedly worried so much about not only his finances but those of the people he had gotten to invest in the company that he suffered a nervous breakdown and took his life in 1919 the newspaper described it as one of the largest attended funerals in recent years and quoted one speaker as saying he knew of no other man who had spent himself for others as had charley yonker local history librarian marnie pratt talks about house on west wooster street the georgian revival style home with roman

revelations about ginni thomas and mike pence would be serious scandals if the u s were still capable of being scandalized as we continue to learn more about the january 6 2021 attack on our democracy i explore whether any of it will matter to republicans or disaffected democrats but first here are three great new stories from the atlantic stubborn denialism spencer platt getty images before we get started i d like to introduce myself my name is tom nichols and for the next month i ll be joining you as the author of the atlantic daily where i ll be sharing thoughts about the day s news and other issues i m a contributing writer at the atlantic where i m also the author of the weekly newsletter peacefield my background is in both american and international politics i taught national security affairs in the u s naval war college for 25 years and worked in the massachusetts house and the u s senate these days i write quite a bit on the precarious state of democracy at home and abroad i also have some quirky hobbies i hope you ll find interesting including cold war popular culture and the music of the 70s and 80s more to come on that in the meantime buckle in for what will likely be a tumultuous week centered on more hearings from the january 6 committee the first hearing last week began to lay out the case not only that january 6 was an attempted coup against the united states and its constitution but that senior figures in washington knew that it was coming they knew that donald trump s arguments of a falsified election were nonsense bullshit according to former attorney general william barr and yet they stood by while trump encouraged a mob to march on the capitol anyway we ll likely see more such evidence this week but even over the weekend the hits kept coming we learned that ginni thomas the wife of supreme court justice clarence thomas was deeply involved in the attempt to get the election overturned and that vice president mike pence issued orders to the military while under siege these are both problems and they would be serious scandals if america were still a country capable of being scandalized in an earlier time ginni thomas s behavior might have been enough for a justice to step down justice thomas apparently couldn t care less he won t even bother to recuse himself from election related court decisions meanwhile we now know that the vice president of the united states was in hiding calling for troops to come to his aid while crowds howled about hanging him and the commander in chief himself sat in the white house saying in effect that maybe pence deserved to be strung up by the way dick cheney did something similar to pence when cheney began issuing orders during 9 11 cheney had no formal authority to do so either but he could at least argue that he was acting with the president s knowledge in order to assist in the defense of the united states against a foreign enemy pence was trying to save his own life and the life of the speaker the majority leader and other senior officials from a crowd sent by the president himself this is all infuriating and even terrifying but the question that worries me most is whether any of it will matter don t get me wrong i m glad the january 6 committee is pursuing this investigation and naming names i want the institutions of american democracy to fight back against the seditionists and others who have failed their duty to the constitution it s good at least to see the former fox news politics editor chris stirewalt tell the house on live television as he did this morning that the winner of the 2020 presidential election was joseph robinette biden jr of the great state of delaware but i wonder if the committee is going to overcome the stubborn denialism of millions of my fellow citizens and the stupefying indifference of millions more americans are being faced with the undeniable evidence that senior members of the united states government either plotted or abetted a coup they have been told that the military chain of command was in chaos for hours this is far beyond watergate or iran contra this is an attack on more than two centuries of constitutional government and

inflation pushes fed to consider biggest rate hike in 28 years washington the federal reserve could respond to the surge in inflation with its steepest interest rate increase since 1994 at its policy meeting on wednesday the central bank may opt to raise rates by 0 75 percentage points rather than the half point that has been signaled for weeks if the fed opts for the more aggressive move wednesday it would amount to stepping away from the slow and steady rate rising campaign and an escalation of the central bank s war against inflation one that is already causing steep drops in asset prices and rising recession risk such a move would diverge from the fed s practice in recent years only taking policy moves that have been telegraphed far in advance to avoid unnecessarily disrupting markets the wall street journal on monday first reported on the possibility 0f an 0 75 percentage point rate hike which triggered a steep rise in bond yields as traders priced in the possibility the news around inflation has worsened even since the fed entered its customary blackout period 10 days ago when officials do not give speeches or interviews discussing monetary policy in the runup to a policy meeting most significantly the consumer price index for may far exceeded expectations with a broad based surge in prices but also notably there have been new signs that inflation expectations are coming unglued which sets off alarm bells among fed officials the university of michigan consumer sentiment survey showed that americans expect inflation of 3 3 annually between 5 and 10 years from now up from 3 in may s p 500 hits bear market territory the s p 500 tumbled on monday pushing the benchmark index into bear market territory as wall street reacted to soaring inflation and fears about how aggressive the federal reserve will need to be in order to arrest it the news underscores the deeply uncertain outlook for the stock market after more than a decade of astronomical growth the s p 500 closed down by nearly 4 off by more than 21 from the high notched on jan 3 blue chip and technology stocks fared just as badly on monday with the dow shedding almost 3 and the nasdaq plunging 4 7 bear markets conventionally defined as a 20 decline from a high are essentially a term of art that describes a gloomy market environment for investors the path of least resistance for share prices is lower as the outlook darkens if the market closes at current levels it means the s p 500 has been in a bear market since it peaked in early january low inflation and interest rates that prevailed for over a decade and the easy money policies they enabled from the federal reserve have been instrumental in supporting share prices since the financial crisis and deep recession that began in 2008 source axios story date june 14 2022

from a comparatively small blaze of just 150 acres to ravaging over 311 000 acres of southern new mexico in just a month the black fire is on the path to becoming the largest wildfire in the state as of monday june 13 at 4 30 p m the black fire burned 311 692 acres it is 47 contained dry weather across the gila and aldo leopold wilderness in the next few days will likely speed the fire s growth though the approaching monsoon season which typically starts mid june could provide relief in the following weeks still with the rains can come floods in burned regions and responders are preparing for that too most uncontained areas remain along the southern edges of the black fire it s expected to expand in the easy canyon the crest of the black range and granite mountain it s not expected to go beyond set fire lines said evan burks spokesperson for southwest area incident management team 3 the crew in command until tuesday morning firefighters continue to make lines breaks in the vegetation with hand tools and bulldozers even existing roads like highway 152 can act as barriers when firefighters remove vegetation change in command the next team will relieve personnel who ve been out there the last couple of weeks incoming firefighters were debriefed sunday and have been shadowing people who ve been on the field it s standard for fire personnel to work for two weeks before they re required to take mandatory days off to prevent extensive fatigue burks said everybody s feeling really positive about where this fire s at feeling good about the work that s been done burks said and there s a really solid plan in place moving forward that we re going to hand off the next crew will continue to build lines on the southeast side to block the spread as well as contingency lines and backup plans he said firefighters are also taking stock of the hillsboro area as a precautionary measure getting information on structures there even if the black fire doesn t get near there the information will be passed on to the local community for future use in wildfire scenarios it s really been a pleasure for us to work here in these communities burks said we ve seen a lot of support from folks all around this fire weather conditions a red flag weather warning was in effect in the fire zone until at least 8 p m on monday to warn of increased fire danger due to heat and single digit humidity levels and strong winds were expected but expected to die down slightly on tuesday smoke has been visible from fuels burning on the interior of the fire scar air quality index levels remained mostly good thunderstorms can actually help a wildfire depending on moisture said gary zell national weather service meteorologist working with the fire personnel there can be a chance of thunderstorms but if there s not quite enough moisture there all you get is strong winds that can come out of any direction he explained such dry storms were a possibility monday and dry weather has been forecasted through wednesday but relief could come later in the week as moisture moves back into the area along with chances for storms that include precipitation obviously as we move into the monsoon season and that moisture starts coming in and doesn t go away then the storms still can produce those gusty outflow winds but they re also bringing rainfall to the fire area zell said the national weather service predicts above average precipitation in southern new mexico in the coming weeks estimates about how much if any rainfall the monsoons might pour onto the fire are difficult to make zell said but rain tends to fall more at higher elevations where much of the wildfire burns everything looks like it s coming together zell said flooding with the monsoon season henry provencio district ranger for the wilderness ranger district brought up the potential for floods the fire is just one element of this he said every time it rains there could be a threat of flooding and that can go on for a year or two and sometimes even longer the emergency response team is working with federal and local county agencies to model and identify those low lying areas where people could be impacted provencio said wilderness and wildlife less than 10 of the fire damage is categorized as high severity but considering the scale even 10 can amount to a lot of severely burned land provencio said high severity areas bare of vegetation could take hundreds of years to recover but in regions categorized as having low or moderate damage recovery can start almost immediately animals in this territory are used to wildfire and will typically move away from it said both burks and provencio wildlife have lived in this area with fire for a long long time burks said so they re well adapted but their food sources and habitats are reshaped by the flames elk may be temporarily inconvenienced food wise if grass is burned provencio said and ranchers can have difficulty if there isn t grass for cows to eat but that resource grows back fairly quickly he said other ecosystem harms take longer to recover from if heavy ash gets in water drainages or burned trees can t provide shade to cool a creek it could take decades to get the trout living there moving back upstream or spotted owls who reside in canyons with tree coverage may become vulnerable if the shade they relied on to regulate their body heat is gone they re able to escape the fire but when they come back provencio said they could starve or get preyed upon the gila is also home to a number of endangered species including gila trout in a relocation mission last week over 80 gila trout were transported out of diamond creek to hatcheries where they can survive until they can be returned to the creeks the impacts are grave to say the least provencio said
jpâ s favorite college story is the night he built an island in the fall of 1993 jp was a junior in stanfordâ s chapter of kappa alpha the brothers were winding down from kappa alphaâ s annual cabo themed party on the house lawn â kaboâ was a stanford institution a day to night extravaganza that would start sometime in the morning and continue long after midnight the girls wore bikini tops and plastic flower leis and the boys wore their best hawaiian shirts that year the brothers had filled the entire main level of kappa alphaâ s house with a layer of sand six inches deep the night was almost over the guests were leaving and the local surf rock band had been paid their customary hundred dollars in beer the only question was what to do with all the sand no one remembers who had the idea to build the island a group of five or six brothers managed the project one rented a bulldozer another shoveled the sand off the floor their house was not far from lake lagunita the mile wide lake on stanfordâ s campus the only holdup was the strip of university owned land between the house and the lake it was jp who talked to stanfordâ s head groundskeeper and convinced him to let the bulldozer pass in the end the groundskeeper admired their spirit â if anybody asks you about it â he said â just send them to me â later that year the brothers installed a zipline from the roof of their house to the center of the island they also built a barge which they would paddle around the lake on weekends and between classes the winds of freedom it is hard to imagine someone at stanford building an island anymore in fact it is hard to imagine them building anything the campus culture has changed today most of the organizations jp remembers from stanford are gone the kappa alpha boys have been kicked out of their old house lake lagunita was closed to student activities in 2001 ostensibly to protect an endangered salamander that had taken up residence in the artificial waters eventually stanford let the lake go dry jp claims you can still see his island though now a patch of elevated ground in a dry dusty basin stanfordâ s new social order offers a peek into the bureaucrat s vision for america it is a world without risk genuine difference or the kind of group connection that makes teenage boys want to rent bulldozers and build islands it is a world largely without unencumbered joy without the kind of cultural specificity that makes college or the rest of life particularly interesting since 2013 stanfordâ s administration has executed a top to bottom destruction of student social life driven by a fear of uncontrollable student spontaneity and a desire to enforce equity on campus a growing administrative bureaucracy has destroyed almost all of stanfordâ s distinctive student culture what happened at stanford is a cultural revolution on the scale of a two mile college campus in less than a decade stanfordâ s administration eviscerated a hundred years of undergraduate culture and social groups they ended decades old traditions they drove student groups out of their houses they scraped names off buildings they went after long established hubs of student life like fraternities and cultural theme houses in place of it all stanford erected a homogenous housing system that sorts new students into perfectly equitable groups named with letters and numbers all social distinction is gone whenever stanford empties out a fraternity or theme house the administration renames the organizationâ s former house after its street number now stanfordâ s iconic campus row once home to dozens of vibrant student organizations is lined with generic unmarked houses with names like â 550 â â 680 â and â 675â in arbitrary groupings with names like â sâ and â d â stanfordâ s motto is die luft der freiheit wehtâ â the winds of freedom blow â but stanford has become a case study of how overzealous bureaucrats can crush natural social expression and how the urge to excise danger can quickly devolve into a campaign to whitewash away anything remotely interesting in the aftermath all that is left is the generic empty walls names scrubbed off buildings and kids safely or not so safely alone in their rooms the west goes global through the late 1990s stanford functioned primarily as a dream school for the children of well off californians it was selectiveâ not the new york times satire selective but a goal worth chasingâ and featured a wacky campus culture that combined collegiate prep with west coast laissez faire stanford was home to a rich patchwork of wild and experimental campus life communal living houses â co opsâ encouraged casual nudity while fraternities threw a raucous annual â greek weekâ and lit their houses on fire until 2013 stanford hosted a fully student run anarchist house where residents covered the walls with eccentric murals on the campus student created co living houses proliferated so rapidly that students once joked about starting a â nonpracticing episcopalian theme house zach a stanford â 81 graduate recalls stanford as weird and wonderful a four year fever dream when i asked zach to describe the campus social life in the eighties he laughed â what kind of drugs do you want to hear about â one boy in zachâ s class built his own generator on the lawn outside his dorm later he claims that same boy went on to become â a very important computer person stanfordâ s support for the unconventional pioneered a new breed of elite student the charismatic builder who excelled at â breaking thingsâ in nearby silicon valley stanford students were aspirational and well rounded confident enough to perform in a bucket hat and floaties and make out with strangers during full moon on the quad for a time stanford experienced a brief golden age when a spontaneous socially permissive culture combined with a class of 5 percent acceptance rate baby geniuses stanfordâ s already formidable reputation grew in large part because of the way these lessons translated into the work and lives of its graduates between 1998 and 2013 stanford students founded google pinterest instagram and snapchat new grads were turning down 350 000 starting salaries to try their hand at changing the world or at least beating their classmates at making their first million soon breathless articles described the mythical school where money grew on trees where americaâ s academic wonderkids went to make their fortune under the california sun starting in 2013 stanford was consistently ranked first by students and parents as â americaâ s dream school â stanford was elite but unlike most elite schools what made stanford the object of such national obsession was that it was also fun stanford had created a global talent hub combined with explicit permission for rule breaking as a result students learned a valuable lesson they had agency they could create their own norms and culture instead of relying on higher authorities stanford had become a global symbolâ of privilege of excellence and of a college admissions process gone mad suddenly the inner workings of stanford were of intense interest to outsiders and the very culture that made stanford uniqueâ including the drugs and naked housesâ became a liability in the eyes of the bureaucracy their presence spawned the salacious articles about stanford traditions and stanford students gained a reputation for â unprofessionalâ irreverence even as they were increasingly judged as representatives of a global brand something had to give in 2013 the administration took over the student run anarchist house and painted over the old murals the next year stanford drained the remnants of lake lagunita where students used to gather to host bonfires and ended the annual anything but clothes party known as exotic erotic and the year after that in 2015 the administration put the notoriously anti establishment leland stanford junior university marching band on â super probation â the culmination of years of increasing restrictions on their antics stanfordâ s decision to sanction the band was a sign of things to come in response to their sanctions which included a travel and alcohol ban the band leadership penned a forceful rebuttal and noted that stanfordâ s signature winds of freedom seemed to have â slowed to a light breeze â they promised to never be silenced and continue â rocking the f ck out â but over the ensuing years the band mostly lost its raucous fraternity esque culture and stopped doing anything particularly controversial once the band mocked stanfordâ s rivals with crass marching formations today the band designs all their pranks based on pre approved themes from the university and clears the final plans with a panel of administrators the university sent a clear message with its treatment of the band spontaneous organizations particularly when they could become chaotic controversial or otherwise a space for breaking rules were now something to be controlled rather than treating freedom and spontaneity as strengths the dynamic became one where students had to justify their projects and ideas while under suspicion from administrators student life was becoming dominated by restrictive bureaucracy the change was only noteworthy as long as people remembered what it had replaced college students necessarily turn over every four years over time students mostly forgot about the band by 2016 stanford had moved on to the white whale of debaucherous student life fraternities encircling the frats one of my first memories at stanford in the fall of 2018 was walking down the row with a sophomore friend we walked by a charming yellow house a greek style manor with a lawn perfect for beer pong i told him that i had just been to a party there at the yellow house called â 550 â â donâ t call it 550 â he snapped â what â â itâ s not 550 itâ s sig chi they tried to scrape the crest off but you can still see it â he pointed and i did see it a faded black square a few feet above the doorway â this is their plan you know â my friend continued â i feel bad for you guys â during my freshman year the cracks in campus social life were already beginning to show one night i was biking home late from the caltrain i made it halfway back to my dorm before i realized that something was missing music it was a friday night but the campus was completely silent unlike harvard which abruptly tried to ban â single gender social organizationsâ and was immediately sued by alumni stanford picked off the greek life organizations one by one to avoid student or alumni pushback the playbook was always the same some incident would spark an investigation and the administration would insist that the offending organization had lost its right to remain on campus the group would be promptly removed over time it became clear that their decisions only ever went one wayâ fewer gatherings fewer social groups the campus spirit waned year by year in the middle of my freshman year i started noticing that students particularly older ones not in a housed greek organization seemed quite aimless and very lonely at stanford students who are not in a housed social organization are sent to one of the dozens of now cultureless dorms scattered around campus students in these dorms tend to slink around campus without a defined community or on campus identity until they graduate if they had more options maybe it would be different but with every unhousing another 150 students who had a home and a culture are pulled apart from each other and for every subsequent year another group of freshmen comes to stanford that would have found their place in that group only to find white walls and locked doors as a result a concerning number of upperclassmen had persistent anxiety that they were being â forgotten about â given the universityâ s anonymization of housing it makes sense when students live together united by a shared identity they tend to look after each other the boys in one fraternity sleep together in a pile on the floor girls in housed sororities leave their doors open and treat their clothes like a communal wardrobe in contrast students in â bad housingâ â the labyrinth of themeless meaningless dorms awaiting most stanford studentsâ rarely bother to learn their neighborâ s names hallways are quiet and doors are locked without a strong existing support network these students can easily bounce from anonymous dorms to lecture halls to cavernous dining halls without anyone acknowledging their presence for days sometimes students come to the conclusion that no one would really notice if they disappeared during my freshman year i overheard one junior boy speculating how long it would take someone to find his body if he died in his room i remember that he settled on a range between four and seven days like many elite universities stanford has a suicide rate far above the national average in the fall of 2017 stanford established a new â committee on residential livingâ corl designed to police the few remaining housed social organizations previously stanford monitored student organizations through an assortment of haphazard bureaucratic arms now with corl all housed organizations could be called in front of a three person committee for one â major violationâ or three â minor violations â violations can be almost anything within the range of normal college life from harboring illegal drugs to subletting your house â of course a bunch of frat boys were going to screw that up whenever an organization ends up in front of corl the committee can vote to kick them out of their on campus housing which they often do within three years following corlâ s founding stanford successfully unhoused three more housed fraternities sigma chi kappa alpha and finally a quirky dissident fraternity called tdx tdx survived all the way through my sophomore year they kept a large stuffed giraffe in their basement and maintained a room with pop art posters of famous dictators since their eviction eight former members have taken up residence together in a themeless house by the lake throwing parties and living out their senior year next year the boys in the lake house will graduate and the remnants of their strange little group will be gone the old house was renamed â 675 â with every additional unhousing it became increasingly apparent that stanfordâ s revealed preference was to rid the campus of all distinct social groups two years after founding corl stanford hired the same harvard administrator who led the campaign to rid the campus of greek life and final clubs harvard had overplayed their hand by trying to purge all major social organizations at once but at stanford they found more success picking them off one by one a golden opportunity with the covid 19 pandemic stanford suddenly had a golden opportunity they could accelerate the process of sanitizing campus life without students being able to react in real time by the time students returned it would all be fait accompli the first thing stanford announced was the introduction of a new housing system designed to promote â fairnessâ and â communityâ on campus under the system new freshmen would be assigned to one of eight artificially created housing groups called â neighborhoods â each containing a representative sample of campus housing to avoid the potential controversy of actually naming them the administration punted the decision and called the neighborhoods s t a n f o r and d an administrator named mona hicks was tasked with explaining the vacuous names to the stanford daily her response was bizarre â there are eight letters in the word stanford and therefore each neighborhood has a letter from stanford â she said and so â while we are uniquely different weâ re all tied together especially now in this time â the reality of the neighborhood system is that it strips students of their ability to form distinct personalities or formal friend groups i am in neighborhood s some of my friends are in neighborhood n it doesnâ t actually matter the neighborhoods are not based on geographyâ many houses in the same â neighborhoodâ are on opposite sides of campusâ and have no personalities outside of their letter name they are distinctions without meaning in order for the neighborhoods to be fair stanford had to divide the remaining row houses equally among all eight letters but the row whose twenty four houses were built by culturally distinct fraternities in the early 1900s has always been a cohesive social center and a neighborhood in itself now each house is defined by some letter an invisible category pulling them all apart to ensure all the neighborhoods were truly equal stanford also had to remove student groups that were too popular or differentiated as greek life had declined in the late 2010s stanford s social scene shifted to a group of four european theme houses clustered near the upper row the french and italian houses in particular were known for hosting elaborate white tablecloth dinners for upperclassmen with pizza and crepes those had to go in fact they all did german and slavic too without so much as an email stanford quietly slashed all four houses overnight the first three were renamed 610 620 and 650 respectively had stanford announced the changes while students were on campus i imagine they might have actually rioted or at least caused a stink but the new freshmen who had never even been to stanford before were far more likely to accept their new numbers when stanford could not remove a student organization for bad behavior they found other justifications one such case was the end of outdoor house an innocuous haven on the far side of campus for students who liked hiking the official explanation from stanford for eliminating the house was that the outdoor theme â fell short of diversity equity and inclusion expectations â the building formerly known as outdoor house was added to neighborhood t next year outdoor house will be reinstated but only because house members promised to refocus their theme on â racial and environmental justice in the outdoors â upholding diversity equity and inclusion is the first of four â resx principlesâ that now govern undergraduate housing stanford reserves the right to unhouse any organization that does not in their opinion uphold these principles one of the houses on the lower half of the row is columbae a vegetarian co op where students cook and eat together i am sure that their house a stately brown manor used to be some sort of fraternity but at least the co op residents are still enjoying themselves groups of them are always out on the lawn reading and sunbathing someone set up a red slackline in the front yard the same boy practices on it every day balancing a worn stack of books on his head in 2025 co ops like columbae are scheduled to go through the corl process and be made to re justify their existence like every other house i try to imagine the brown mansion renamed â 549 â becoming yet another numbered house with an empty lawn today stanford is technically back to normal after covid 19 but it will never be the same sometimes i like to walk up and down the row even in the daytime you can feel the missing energy the ghosts humming in the white columns one weekend last fall there were two parties on the same day just like in the old times one of the parties was kabo the same party that sparked jpâ s island building escapades in the 1990s with kappa alpha on probation the party is technically hosted by the themeless house next door still it was a beautiful day the girls wore bikini tops and carried drinks with plastic umbrellas someone had set up a patch of sand on the lawn we partied outside on the edge of the dry lake i met one current kappa alpha brother who lamented the lime green wristbands we were all wearing â i wish we could invite everyone â he said â but it s too dangerous now â a resident of the host house was checking names at the door much of the excitement of college is cracking a new social scene exploring the nooks and crannies of campus and finding your place within it now everything worth exploring is dark closed or on probation when there are parties they are typically locked up â friends of the houseâ events designed to avoid university scrutiny it doesnâ t always work in october a group of freshmen boys was so desperate to get into an event at sigma nu one of the few remaining housed fraternities that they snuck around the back of the house and smashed through a window with their bare hands lonely frustrated students are less safe than happy ones within four weeks of school starting ten students had to be taken off campus to get their stomachs pumped a stanford record for alcohol related â transportsâ in such a short period of time occasionally my row house is rented for parties which are always overrun with freshman and sophomores theyâ re not particularly good ones still i see freshmen in the corner of the events drinking until they pass out despite the safety rhetoric the new atomized campus culture isnâ t even safer an office for every problem there is a little neighborhood on campus where students never go with four beautiful old buildings clustered around a tiny central square the little neighborhood is only about a five minute walk from the base of the row and hidden behind a line of sycamore trees it felt like home most students barely know about it i only found it because i volunteered at stanfordâ s bridge peer counseling center my freshman year which has an office there every sunday i would walk through the leafy enclave to take anonymous calls from my peers the ones who would call the bridge for support usually only had one or two friends during my counseling shift i sometimes wondered about the other houses in the neighborhood across the street from the bridge there is an international â community center â another building houses five separate administrative offices including the â residential leaseholder officeâ and title ix later i learned that the fraternity that used to live at the international center was kicked out of their house in the 1960s every house was clearly built to be used by students each with its own wide lawns and plenty of extra rooms stanford took the little neighborhood with the most beautiful homes on campus and turned it into office buildings it sounds so good â community center â how could you be lonely on a campus with so many community centers at stanford we have an office for every problem mental health is a big problem in our generation about 71 percent of college students say that they are â very sad â i wonder how many sad kids are just lonely our former fraternity houses have been filled with offices to help us feel better and we are sadder and sicker than any generation before if you are sad stanford has an office building with a number you can call and a series of â community conversationsâ about neurodiversity but what if you are just unhappy spending your days alone in your lettered house and numbered room stanford students live in brand new buildings with white walls we have a 20 million dollar meditation center that nobody uses but students didnâ t ask for any of that we just wanted a dirty house with friends when i tell current stanford students the story about jp and his island i swear their eyes pop out of their heads everything was so different then it sounds like a story from another schoolâ the house the lake and the groundskeeper who let the boys pass but mostly what feels foreign is the spirit expressed by the six brothers the wild unfettered joy as organizations fall away any remaining exuberance feels like an aberration an unnatural imposition on the status quo the fraternity brothers loping around campus for another round of frisbee golfâ look out of place now a taunting symbol of what everyone else is missing without the nudist co ops and wild parties stanford is not a campus more focused on its core mission those things were the fruits of an environment built around student agency and attempting to create your own better social norms fostering that creative environment was stanfordâ s core mission and what made it distinctive from other elite schools we have so many words to describe the ways an institution can be problematic it is easy to find faults scrape crests off walls and feel like you have done a good deed but there are far fewer stock phrases to articulate what is lost when an organization is destroyed there are no parties anymore i want to live with my friends itâ s hard to name the pain of absence an empty house is safe a blank slate is fair in the name of safety and fairness stanford destroyed everything that makes people enjoy college and life today i live across the street from sigma nu the largest fraternity house on campus whenever i look out my dorm room window i can see them playing beer die on their front lawn they never stop i think they are trying to make a point they play like the world is ending blasting music across the empty row editorâ s note names in this story have been changed to preserve privacy

the prediction comes despite contradictory estimates from the federal reserve the us economy is about to tumble into a recession economic experts have forecast dismissing more upbeat predictions from the federal reserve former treasury secretary larry summers warned on sunday that the fed s inflation related forecasts have been much too optimistic and insisted that it confront the recession staring it in the face when inflation is as high as it is right now and unemployment is as low as it is right now it s almost always been followed within two years by recession summers declared during a sunday appearance on cnn countering current treasury secretary janet yellen s claim that nothing suggest a recession is in the works summers pointed to what s happening in the stocks and bonds markets and the recent rock bottom consumer sentiment numbers as proof that there s certainly a risk of recession in the next year and that it s more likely than not we ll have a recession within the next two years things could get even worse depending on the price of oil he added highlighting the risk that it will rise higher gas prices are already at record highs in the us recently surpassing an average of 5 per gallon more than twice what they were when president joe biden entered the white house and the nasdaq and the s p 500 stock indices recorded their worst week of the year earlier this month in the wake of an 8 6 rise in consumer prices even higher than predicted despite the sense of doom permeating markets yellen has insisted that consumer and investment spending are strong enough to avert a recession even as she herself has admitted she was wrong about the galloping inflation that has characterized biden s presidency federal reserve chair jerome powell has also struggled to downplay the difficulties facing the us central bank though he has acknowledged that raising interest rates in an attempt to scupper inflation may cause some pain and kick up unemployment rates a few ticks however he does not appear to be convincing his peers this is not landing a plane on a regular landing strip george washington university economist tara sinclair pointed out this is landing a plane on a tightrope and the winds are blowing the idea that we are going to bring incomes down just enough and spending down just enough to bring prices back down to the fed s 2 percent target is unrealistic indeed 70 of leading economists polled by the financial times on sunday predicted a recession coming by the end of next year and 40 of respondents think it will come before the end of the second quarter of 2023 recessions are officially declared by the national bureau of economic research which defines one as a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months read more us consumer prices spike even worse than expected most americans already believe the us is in a recession according to a poll conducted earlier this month fully 55 of those questioned including 70 of republicans and 43 of democrats believed the recession still being debated by economists has already arrived faced with the soaring price of staples such as food and gasoline their opinions remain unswayed by the biden administration s insistence that the us is actually in recovery mode as the fed hikes interest rates in an attempt to rein in inflation the amount of debt shouldered by the average american will only increase further stretching most families already thin resources and piling on the economic pain few economic experts have presented alternatives to the solution of hiking interest rates though there is debate over whether increasing them quickly or slowly will cause the least amount of suffering rt com
assemblyman phil ting d san francisco chair of the assembly budget committee left is congratulated by fellow democratic assemblyman kevin mccarty of sacramento after the assembly approved the state budget bill at the capitol in sacramento calif monday june 13 2022 california lawmakers approved their own version of a 300 billion operating budget over the objections of gov gabin newsom highlighting the disagreements among democrats about how to spend a second breaking surplus ap photo rich pedroncelli california lawmakers on monday passed a 300 billion operating budget over the objections of democratic gov gavin newsom highlighting disagreements among democrats about how to spend a record breaking surplus that by itself is more than most other states spend in a year while newsom does not support the legislature s spending plan lawmakers sent the bill to his desk anyway because the california constitution requires them to pass a budget by wednesday or else they don t get paid unlike most states california lawmakers are full time and get paid 119 702 per year advertisement newsom and legislative leaders will continue negotiating with the goal of coming up with a spending plan they can all agree on before the start of the fiscal year on july 1 the democratic controlled legislature wants to spend more money than newsom does on education and housing the lawmakers plan would cover college tuition for 150 000 more students than newsom would and lawmakers want to borrow about 1 billion per year and use it to help about 8 000 first time buyers purchase a home by covering 20 of the price the plan could potentially lower mortgage payments by about 1 000 per month in a state where the median home price hit a record high of 849 080 in march advertisement this is the budget that you ran for office for assemblymember kevin mccarty a democrat from sacramento said monday while urging lawmakers to vote for the bill lawmakers say they can afford to do those things because california s revenues have soared throughout the pandemic as the rich have gotten richer and pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to other states this year california s surplus money left over once the state has fulfilled its existing commitments is more than 97 billion but newsom doesn t like the legislature s plan because he says it would spend too much of the state s surplus money that is only available for one year on things that must have more than one year of funding mostly for schools and community colleges the legislature s plan would spend 2 4 billion more for ongoing expenses than newsom s plan a disparity that would grow to 5 6 billion by 2026 advertisement while california has lots of money today the newsom administration fears the economy is showing signs of stress as stock prices fall and inflation keeps going up because of supply chain disruptions and the russian invasion of ukraine given the financial storm clouds on the horizon a final budget must be fiscally responsible said anthony york newsom s senior advisor for communications the governor remains opposed to massive ongoing spending and wants a budget that pays down more of the state s long term debts and puts more money into state reserves lawmakers disagree they say the extra money they want to spend is small accounting for less than 1 of total spending plus legislative leaders noted monday that their plan includes record high reserves about 700 million more than newsom proposed to protect california during future economic slowdowns advertisement this type of disagreement is typical in california where governors usually see their role as stopping the progressive legislature from spending too much money but newsom s plan has its own problems it would leave the state about 25 billion over a constitutional limit on spending over the next two years a situation the nonpartisan legislative analyst s office says could push the state over a fiscal cliff that could force budget cuts even if state revenues continue to grow the newsom administration has downplayed those concerns noting their plan would spend 95 of the budget surplus on one time expenses money that could be pulled back in an emergency advertisement one thing newsom and legislative leaders can agree on is they want to give a portion of the budget surplus back to taxpayers to help them pay for record high gas prices but they can t agree who should get the money and how much they should get newsom wants to send checks of up to 800 to everyone who has a car registered in the state the legislature wants to send 200 checks to people who have taxable income below a certain level 125 000 for single people and 250 000 for couples newsom s plan would cost 11 5 billion and taxpayers might get the checks a little faster because the money would come on a debit card the legislature s plan would cost 8 billion but it wouldn t benefit the wealthy advertisement we should be supporting those families and households middle class and below that would be really struggling from these costs versus those with incomes for whom this would not be as much of a problem said state sen nancy skinner a democrat from berkeley and chair of the senate budget and fiscal review committee republicans don t like either plan instead they favor a suspension of the state s gas tax which at 51 1 cents per gallon is the second highest in the nation there s nothing in today s proposal to bring immediate relief for californians said assemblymember vince fong a republican from bakersfield and vice chair of the assembly budget committee as the state coffers grow family bank accounts are shrinking and californians consistently pay more and more to sacramento and get pennies back temporarily that is not relief advertisement ___ this story has been updated to correct that assemblymember vince fong is from bakersfield not fresno
the three main stock exchanges in the united states all plummeted on monday with the s p 500 officially entering bear market territory amid deepening concern that the country could soon be entering a recession the s p 500 sank 3 9 bringing it more than 20 below the record high it set in january and erasing all of the market gains experienced since president joe biden entered office in january 2021 the dow jones index sank a stunning 900 points on monday as well the declines hit high growth technology stocks and other recent market darlings especially hard tesla slumped 7 1 amazon dropped 5 5 and gamestop tumbled 8 4 the sharp downturn has heralded a period of stagflation economic stagnation coupled with high inflation that economic experts say could soon devolve into a full blown recession which arrives after at least two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth with americans concerned about soaring inflation rising gas prices and shortages of basic good such as baby formula and tampons the white house is also being urged to do more to combat a worsening cost of living crisis exacerbated by the market slide karine jean pierre the white house press secretary said the biden administration was watching closely the market turmoil and blamed the country s declining economic picture in part on energy inflation caused by the war in ukraine a familiar refrain from biden administration officials inflation is still too high and putin s price hike continues to impact food and energy prices biden said in a statement last month after the latest numbers were released there is more work to do and tackling inflation is my top economic priority but critics say that the biden administration is distorting the role government has played in worsening inflation the dow jones on monday closed down 2 79 percent joe biden seen on monday at the white house has said the country s inflation rising gas prices and shortages were due to russia s invasion of ukraine and china s slowing growth wendy edelberg director of the hamilton project and a senior fellow in economic studies at the brookings institution told politico that the war certainly contributed to recent inflation further damaging supply chains and driving up energy prices but the problem began before then what is a bear market a bear market is when an index like the s p 500 the dow jones industrial average or even an individual stock has fallen 20 percent or more from a recent high for a sustained period of time the main three indexes s p dow jones and nasdaq have all fallen 20 percent since january why do they fall markets do not react well to rising interest rates which at the moment are increasing quickly as a result of the high inflation battering the economy low rates act like steroids for stocks and other investments and wall street is now going through withdrawal russia s war in ukraine has also put upward pressure on inflation by pushing up commodities prices and worries about china s economy the world s second largest have added to the gloom is a recession on the way if customers are paying more to borrow money they can t buy as many things so less revenue flows to a company s bottom line stocks tend to track profits over time higher rates also make investors less willing to pay elevated prices for stocks which are riskier than bonds when bonds are suddenly paying more in interest thanks to the fed big technology stocks and other winners of the pandemic were seen as the most expensive and those stocks have been the most punished as rates have risen but the pain is spreading widely with retailers signaling a shift in consumer behavior how long do bear markets last on average bear markets have taken 13 months to go from peak to trough and 27 months to get back to breakeven since world war ii the s p 500 index has fallen an average of 33 during bear markets in that time the biggest decline since 1945 occurred in the 2007 2009 bear market when the s p 500 fell 57 history shows that the faster an index enters into a bear market the shallower they tend to be historically stocks have taken 251 days 8 3 months to fall into a bear market when the s p 500 has fallen 20 at a faster clip the index has averaged a loss of 28 the longest bear market lasted 61 months and ended in march 1942 and cut the index by 60 how do we know when it s ended generally investors look for a 20 gain from a low point as well as sustained gains over at least a six month period it took less than three weeks for stocks to rise 20 from their low in march 2020 advertisement the truth is consumer demand fell off a cliff in the spring of 2020 as the virus hit and as it rebounded it was inevitably going to be messy she said but the ingredients for why the economy has been as strong as it has and the incredibly robust way that demand bounded back ahead of supply completely surprised me other critics blame biden s decision to send stimulus checks to americans during the pandemic and prop up struggling businesses while all countries are struggling with inflation the price hikes in the u s did start outpacing other developed countries last year indicating that the extra spending played some role in speeding up inflation other advanced economies faced similar problems with supply chain disruptions and supply and demand mismatches but the u s has it worse on inflation some critics blame the fed saying they were too slow to move but they faced enormous political pressure from donald trump and others to keep interest rates low when biden took over in january 2021 the picture was very different and stock markets soared to record highs the dow jones was at 31 188 38 on inauguration day but on monday it closed 30 516 74 the s p 500 was 3 851 85 by the closing bell on monday it had fallen to 3 749 63 and the nasdaq on inauguration day closed at a record 13 457 248 on monday it fell to 10 809 23 in one day of trading the s p 500 lost 3 88 percent the dow was down 2 79 percent and the nasdaq lost 4 68 percent the drops represent a 20 percent fall since the january high meaning that the markets are technically considered to be in bear territory retreating into hibernation in contrast they are considered to be in bull territory when they are charging forward some of the biggest bear markets in the past century include those that coincided with the great depression and great recession the last bear market was in early 2020 caused by the onset of covid 19 and the economic contraction that followed march 11 2020 marked the first entry into a bear market in 11 years stocks lost a third of their value in 33 days in early 2020 before that the most recent bear market was from 2007 9 caused by the global financial crisis as the housing market imploded it lasted 1 3 years the federal reserve will meet on wednesday and is expected to discuss making its biggest interest rate increase since 1994 a move that could exacerbate the recent market downturn in an attempt to tame inflation startling data released last week showed that u s consumer prices were rising at their fastest pace since 1981 the may inflation data was so concerning that we think the fed will react even more aggressively in moving rates expeditiously bny mellon strategist john velis said on monday rabobank on sunday warned that the risk of stagflation a period of weak growth and high inflation last seen in the 1970s could give way to the threat of incession a combination of inflation and recession the fed raised rates by half a percentage point in may and officials had suggested for weeks that a similar increase would be warranted at their meetings in june and july if data evolved as expected but the situation has worsened since then they ve made it pretty clear that they want to prioritize price stability said pooja sriram u s economist at barclays if that is their plan a more aggressive policy stance is what they need to be doing a trader is seen working on the floor at the new york stock exchange on monday investors now expect rates to climb by september to a range of 2 5 to 2 75 percent up from their current range of 0 75 to 1 percent the fed hasn t made such a large increase since the early 1990s and that 2 75 percent upper limit would be the highest the federal funds rate has been since the global financial crisis in 2008 despite the market situation monday the white house defended biden s economic record white house press secretary karine jean pierre argued biden had actually made historic economic gains which would help the american people go through these economic challenges she blamed inflation prices in may were 8 6 percent higher than a year earlier marking the greatest increase since 1981 on the covid pandemic and on russian president vladimir putin s war in the ukraine you know with this price high inflation coming coming out every once in a generation global pandemic all of those things play a factor jean pierre said but she argued that america would bounce back under biden the american people are well positioned to face these challenges because of the economic historic gains that we have made under this president in the last six months she noted the white house defended president joe biden s economic record as the nation experienced historic inflation gas prices over 5 a galloon and the stock market dropping the american people are well positioned to face these challenges because of the economic historic gains that we have made under this president in the last six months white house press secretary karine jean pierre argued voters however don t seem to be buying the white house argument and have giving biden low marks for his handling of the economy the administration has consistently blamed high prices of gas food and housing on russia referring to them as putin s price hike we re not the only country dealing with what we re seeing at the moment as it relates to inflation jean pierre said the white house has struggled to show they have the problem well in hand jean pierre said the white house was watching the stock market closely we re watching closely we know families are concerned about inflation in the stock market that is something that the president is really aware of she said biden s average approval rating on gas prices is about 30 percent on inflation it s also about 30 percent we know that higher prices are having a real effect on people s lives jean pierre said we get that and we are incredibly focused on doing everything that we can to make sure that the economy is working we are coming out of the strongest job market in american history and that matters and that a lot of that is thanks to the american rescue plan which only democrats voted for that republicans did not and it led to this this economic growth this historic economic boom that we re seeing she denied the boom also led to the historic records of inflation congressional republicans are hammering democrats on the economy in the run up to midterm elections this fall

when we hear the two words drugs and war used in the same sentence we might think of the war on drugs but what about drugs during war or drugs after war addictive drugs and armed warfare have a long and storied history from the roman legion soldiers drinking too much wine to frenzied viking berserkers on magic mushrooms however the almost unexplored amphetamine addictions of nazi germany in world war ii were literally hitler s drug problems the who defines psychoactive drugs as substances that when taken in or administered into one s system affect mental processes e g perception consciousness cognition or mood and emotions this broad based definition includes many things we consume daily or weekly such as coffee tea tobacco and alcohol just to name a few recent developments in the field of historiography an evolving academic field have produced new ways of looking at war that add to our factual historical knowledge of any one war these new perspectives include how the people of each side suffered or behaved during wartime which could last for a long time these alternate ways of understanding critical events and conflicts also examine the situations and circumstances that drove these people to war how the soldiers lived during war and what drug addictions if any were prevalent drugs and armed conflict a long troubled history drug abuse during wartime is as old as the history of war and some wars have been fought over drugs there is historical evidence of roman legions bringing wine to the french region for their consumption and britain and china went to war over the opium trade in fact opium poppies were being cultivated as early as 3400 bc in lower mesopotamia the sumerians referred to it as hul gul or the joy plant for centuries peruvian elites generously dosed themselves on a cocktail of psychoactive substances and drugs from the andes over 1 000 year old remains have been found from burial sites containing traces of cocaine the legendary ayahuasca harmine and dimethyltryptamine along with benzoylecgonine and bufotenine then there are the famous viking berserkers frenzied warriors who fought in a drug fueled violent rage these warriors may have ingested a specific kind of mushroom with psychoactive properties amanita muscaria or fly agaric to fuel their blood lust in battle alternatively it may have been a substance called henbane used for medications anaesthesis which are known to cause psychoactive effects not to mention delirious states dissociation from reality or dark and realistic hallucinations drugs have also been used as a currency in war for example colombian insurgents and paramilitaries on the left and right side of the political divide use cocaine to fund their wars against each other others say the cia has frequently used cocaine as a tool to cause political instability in south american states it is interesting to note that war and drugs have a new meaning in the context of modern military life for the suffering that results from battle exposure the wars of the last 30 years have sent home countless of survivors that needed drugs and treatment programs to survive the trauma and stress they endured in some instance the drugs to treat contemporary post traumatic stress disorder ptsd are ancient indigenous hallucinogens hitler s drug problems hitler s drug problems must have been enormous given the crimes committed and the long term secrecy that was essential for the nazi war machine to continue drugs like coffee and tobacco would have been essential to keep world war ii soldiers alert however for the nazi elites modern science created even stronger stimulants to complement the expensive powers of opium and cocaine hitler s drug problems which were multiple were also the problems of many of his elite war machine managers foreground left to right führer adolf hitler hermann göring minister of propaganda joseph goebbels and rudolf hess in 1933 or 1934 national archives and records administration public domain stress and need to be alert lead to hitler s drug problems the 2016 bestseller der totale rausch the total rush by german author norman ohler re released in english as blitzed drugs in nazi germany looks at the third reich through the lens of drug usage and stimulant prevalence from the top of society to the bottom and believe it or not the third reich was awash with cocaine crystal meth and heroin these substances were widely used and abused by soldiers factory workers and housewives what s particularly impressive about ohler s research is that it contributes a new perspective on nazi germany one of history s most widely chronicled and detailed periods i guess drugs weren t a priority for the historians said ohler a crazy guy like me had to come along ohler s book explores some of the startling accounts have emerged from the previously unpublished findings of dr theodor morell who was the personal physician of both hitler and his italian counterpart benito mussolini morell s private papers record that hitler used many drugs in total 74 different substances but that he absolutely relied on his daily injections of his favorite wunder drug eukodol eukodol is powerful upper stimulant that renders the user euphoric and makes them incapable of sound judgment hitler s drug problems were literally war problems when it came to his usage of eukodol known as heroin s chemical cousin in one vivid account hitler is hopelessly hopped up on eukodol as he senselessly plans the unnecessary battle of the ardennes in 1944 hitler s drug fueled military offensive towards the western front would be germany s last ending in a bloody defeat and virtually bringing their involvement in the second world war to a close pervitin a methamphetamine brand used by german soldiers during world war ii was dispensed in these tablet containers jan wellen cc by sa 3 0 pharmaceuticals in weimar germany and wwii germany hitler s drug problems also included regular cocaine consumption from 1941 onward he unsurprisingly suffered from a number of ailments including high blood pressure chronic stomach spasms and a ruptured ear drum and german pharmaceutical companies that had already been making synthetic drugs in the weimar republic era continued to aggressively research new ways to numb or stimulate heroin was patented by germany s bayer company while cocaine was a trademark of the merck company of darmstadt germany in the 1930s a company in berlin called temmler developed crystal meth which was branded as pervitin for daily use letters from german soldiers often refer to needing pervitin to stay awake in fact novelist heinrich böll the future nobel laureate wrote these exact words in a letter from the frontline to his parents back at home begging them for pervitin in 1939 by the time hitler came to power a myth of purity had been created around him by his innermost circle the truth was wildly different and came with a double standard certain drug abuses street addicts for example could be punished with imprisonment or even a one way trip to a concentration camp now we know that the seemingly energetic hitler with his endless energy and enthusiasm was a german pharma success story but the pharmaceutical companies of nazi germany also created new things to keep the basic soldiers alert and ready the invention of methamphetamines allowed german armies to seemingly be immune to sleep for days on end as hitler s health problems increased in the 1940s he urged his elite doctor morell to keep pumping his body with what ever it took so that he could keep up public appearances attend military briefings and manage daily operations this abuse would ultimately be a factor in his death at age 56 with most accounts of the time suggesting evidence of advanced parkinson s and rotten mental health the connections between drugs and war maybe as old as the history of war but new holistic wartime perspectives are painting a much clearer picture of how individual soldiers are affected by the stresses of war getmilitaryphotos adobe stock it wasn t just the germans who used methamphetamines in

san francisco and suzhou china june 13 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology autoimmune metabolic ophthalmology and other major diseases today announced that the china s national medical products administration nmpa has formally accepted the new drug application nda for tafolecimab injection anti pcsk 9 antibody r d code ibi306 for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia in recent years pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody has been gradually recognized by clinicians as a new therapeutic regimen that can potently reduce ldl c levels with favorable safety profiles although there are imported products in the chinese market there is still room for improvement in terms of affordability accessibility and convenience tafolecimab injection which was supported by the national science and technology major project for major new drug development whose new drug application is the first submitted and formally accepted by the nmpa and it is expected to potentially be the first self developed recombinant fully human anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody launched in china the nda submission was based on the study results of three phase 3 registration clinical trials credit 1 credit 2 and credit 4 compared with placebo tafolecimab injection reduced low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c levels by about 57 65 and maintained long term therapeutic efficacy in addition tafolecimab injection also significantly reduced total cholesterol tc non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non hdl c apolipoprotein b apob and lipoprotein a lp a levels with a high percentage of patients achieving lipid reduction goals a long administration interval once every 6 weeks and overall favorable safety profiles tafolecimab injection is expected to be a potent treatment for patients with primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia professor yong huo from peking university first hospital stated in china the prevalence of dyslipidemia in adults is increasing annually and has become an important risk factor threatening the health of chinese population elevated tc and ldl c are among the independent risk factors for coronary heart disease or ischemic stroke effective control of dyslipidemia is important for the prevention and control of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd the results from a series of clinical studies of tafolecimab injection in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia are very encouraging it is worth noting that in credit 1 study tafolecimab injection achieved long interval administration and demonstrated significant long term reduction of ldl c levels in chinese population with hypercholesterolemia in addition tafolecimab also exhibited more prominent advantages in reducing lp a over other similar anti psck 9 agents which may result in better compliance and additional cardiovascular risk control benefits we look forward to the approval of tafolecimab injection to provide a better treatment option to the large number of patients with hypercholesterolemia in china professor yujie zhou from beijing anzhen hospital capital medical university stated although the prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia is relatively low in china it is still ranked highest in the world due to the large population patients with heterozygous hypercholesterolemia have an early onset significantly elevated serum levels of total cholesterol tc and low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c and rapid progression of the disease these symptoms significantly harm the patients health and they may experience severe ascvd and even die at young or middle age our research team has observed the favorable efficacy and safety profiles of tafolecimab injection in the first randomized controlled double blind clinical study credit 2 in chinese population with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia today we are even more delighted to see that as an innovative anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody with proprietary intellectual property rights in china the nda of tafolecimab injection has been officially accepted by the china s nmpa as a clinician i really look forward to the approval of tafolecimab injection to benefit chinese patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated at present cardiovascular diseases caused by hyperlipidemia hypertension and obesity in china are prominent and have seriously affected the national public health the nda submission is based on the results of the credit 1 credit 2 and credit 4 clinical studies which demonstrated that tafolecimab injection can effectively reduce ldl c levels and significantly improve other lipid parameters in chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia among which lp a can be reduced more compared with similar products tafolecimab injection is the first psck 9 antibody that can be administrated at long interval dosing once every 6 weeks which will potentially provide more treatment options for chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia including heterozygous familial and non familial hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia we look forward to the approval and launch to market of the product in the near future hoping to benefit the large number of patients with hypercholesterolemia in china with this high quality medicine as soon as possible about hypercholesterolemia in recent years the blood lipid level of the chinese population has gradually increased and the prevalence of dyslipidemia has increased significantly with an overall prevalence of 40 4 in chinese adults the increase of serum cholesterol level in the population will lead to an increase of about 9 2 million cardiovascular disease events in china between 2010 2030 dyslipidemia characterized by elevated ldl c or tc is an important independent risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease at present the disease management of hyperlipidemia in china is not optimistic according to the 2020 china cardiovascular health and disease report the diagnostic treatment and control rate of dyslipidemia in chinese adults remain low the percentage of patients with dyslipidemia who met the ldl c reduction goal is even more alarming current lipid lowering therapies do not meet the clinical needs in patients with hyperlipidemia anti pcsk 9 monoclonal antibody has a mechanism of action different from existing lipid lowering drugs and can effectively reduce ldl c levels which is expected to provide a better treatment option for chinese patients with hypercholesterolemia about tafolecimab injection anti pcsk 9 antibody tafolecimab injection developed by innovent is an lgg2 fully human monoclonal antibody that can specifically bind to pcsk 9 and reduce ldl c level by inhibiting pcsk 9 mediated low density lipoprotein receptor ldlr endocytosis subsequently enhancing the clearance of ldl c resulting in a reduction in ldl c level as of now three registration trials of tafolecimab injection have met the primary endpoint the results from phase i ii clinical study have been published in jacc asia an internationally renowned journal of cardiology credit 2 phase iii study results

if so we can thank the cheap money that usually create asset bubbles and point again to a federal reserve dissenter as a prophet fortune warned this morning that housing prices in as many as 40 markets could sharply drop over the next year as stagflation necessarily turns into recession it won t create as much damage as the housing bubble pop did in the 2008 financial crisis but it will leave the most recent home purchasers without a seat when the music stops advertisement last week moody s analytics gave fortune exclusive access to its updated proprietary analysis of u s housing markets the firm aimed to find out whether fundamentals including local income levels could support local home prices the finding through the first quarter of 2022 national house prices are overvalued by 24 7 that s up from the fourth quarter of last year when moody s analytics determined national house prices were overvalued by 20 9 let s be clear that doesn t mean moody s analytics thinks u s home prices are about to drop by 24 instead what it means is that home prices are historically speaking priced very high relative to household incomes now that we ve reached this level zandi says it will make it harder for home price growth to push upwards indeed zandi is predicting the year over year rate of home price growth will flatline to 0 by this time next year but not every regional housing market will be so lucky while zandi doesn t predict national home price declines he estimates significantly overvalued housing markets places like boise and charlotte could see 5 to 10 home price declines over the next 12 months if a recession actually materializes something moody s analytics gives a 1 in 2 chance of occurring over the next 24 months then zandi says national home prices could fall by around 5 meanwhile if a recession hits zandi says those significantly overvalued housing markets would likely see home prices slashed by 15 to 20 among the 413 regional housing markets measured by moody s analytics the firm deems 96 are overvalued simply put nearly the entire country has house prices that are higher than underlying fundamentals would historically support advertisement this might not matter in terms of bubble popping if flipping and speculative purchases haven t comprised a good portion of this bubble if these prices have gone up on the power of actual homesteading then a drift downward in valuation shouldn t have too much of an impact on financial institutions homeowners can still pay their mortgages at least as long as they maintain their current income levels in a recession an overvalued market isn t a catastrophe in itself except for those who want to sell their home and have lost their positive equity in it however the continuing rapid inflation pace will force the federal reserve to step up its monetary tightening by raising its interest rate they re already planning a series of 0 5 point increases this year and last friday s 8 6 1 0 consumer price index cpi result will likely spur even more intervention if tomorrow s producer price index ppi remains in double digits you can probably bank on an even more aggressive approach to the fed s interest rate and money tightening that will tighten the leash on business investment and that will have an enormous impact on a jobs market that s already looking a little shaky according to goldman sachs add that 14th job to your linkedin profile while the getting is good as the u s labor market is poised to markedly slow down later this year warns goldman sachs softer company level hiring expectations and slower gdp growth in the second half of the year point to slower payroll growth in coming months said goldman sachs chief economist jan hatzius in a new note on friday recent anecdotes of hiring freezes and more selective hiring indicate that companies expect payroll growth to slow and the most recent business activity surveys corroborate these signals hatzius forecasts employment growth of 215 000 jobs per month for the next three months that is that poised to cool to 160 000 jobs added a month for the ensuing six months this slowdown would see the economy s pace of growth job fall more than 50 from current levels through may nonfarm payroll growth over the prior three months has averaged 408 000 advertisement the white house loooves to talk about its record jobs growth but it s not growth it s a jobs recovery and it s still not complete we are still about 900 000 short of the jobs we had in february 2020 before the pandemic forced the loss of over 22 million jobs more than half of those were recovered before joe biden took office and at the current pace it will take another year to make up not just for the loss of the february 2020 jobs level but also for the jobs that would have been created and filled in the two plus years since due to population growth if that jobs loss falls off because business investment dries up then some of those who bought at the tail end of the bubble might truly find themselves squeezed if their homes are overvalued to the extent zandi projects they may not be able to easily downsize and adjust either and if the recession ends up damaging the jobs market to the extent that unemployment sharply rises some of that damage might seep into the financials of lending institutions although thankfully not to the extent we saw in 2008 that jobs bubble of 11 million unfilled jobs could evaporate very quickly and with it any wage pressure that favors workers at the precise time that rapid inflation has undermined their buying power that appears to be one of the concerns in the stock market too at one point today literally every stock on the s p index was in negative territory while the dow jones was down hundreds of points all day long and bitcoin fell 17 the fed is likely to initiate a recession with its interventions because it s very unlikely that we will see a soft landing with incremental monetary adjustments ben bernanke the architect of the post great recession monetary expansions that helped create this mess says he s still fairly certain that the fed can pull off a soft ish landing but bernanke turned out to be terribly wrong in 2009 10 and thomas hoenig turned out to be right i know which way i m betting this time around too advertisement update a fair criticism from chris hayes mainly because i didn t explain what i meant the idea of a jobs market bubble is more than a bit nonsensical chris hayes chrislhayes june 13 2022 we ve had two consistent and parallel issues in the post pandemic recovery a glut of unfilled jobs and a significant part of the potential workforce that s churning or staying entirely out of it the great resignation dynamic as well as the wage pressure on employers rely on that glut of unfilled jobs which is a type of bubble itself once we start sliding into recession that bubble will pop as those jobs simply evaporate without ever being filled and those on the sideline waiting for their optimal entry point back into the workforce may well be left out for a very long time that s the jobs bubble i posited although to chris point it would have been better if i d explained that up front

by maegan vazquez cnn the white house maintained on monday that americans are well equipped to deal with current economic hurdles including us stocks plunging into a bear market because of president joe biden s efforts in office when asked the white house s reaction to the falling stock market including all the gains made since biden took office last year being wiped out press secretary karine jean pierre said the white house is watching the situation closely we know families are concerned about inflation and the stock market that is something that the president is really aware of she said during monday s press briefing adding that the us is not the only country dealing with what we re seeing at the moment as it relates to inflation the press secretary went on to blame the ongoing war in ukraine and inflation caused by the world s emergence from pandemic lockdowns as factors playing into the current state of the economy but jean pierre argued that despite the stock market s drop and a host of other troubling economic indicators it s the white house s view that americans are in better shape to deal with economic problems than before biden took office the way that we see this is the american people are well positioned to face these challenges because of the economic historic gains that we have made under this president in the last 16 months she continued the unemployment rate remains at 3 6 slightly higher than the half century low recorded in february 2020 but americans wallets are getting pummeled by the rising cost of goods and diminishing stock values the average nationwide price for a gallon of regular gas recently hit 5 for the first time ever according to aaa consumer confidence hit a record low data released last week showed and on friday a miserable consumer price index report showed us inflation was significantly higher than economists had expected last month spurring monday s stock market shifts us stocks on monday plunged into a bear market as investors grew increasingly nervous about the prospect of even harsher rate increases from the federal reserve which are meant to take some of the sting out of inflation after raising rates by a half point in may an action the fed hadn t taken since 2000 chair jerome powell pledged more of the same until the central bank was satisfied that inflation was under control at that point the fed would resume standard quarter point hikes he said but after may s hotter than expected inflation report wall street is increasingly calling for tougher action from the fed to keep prices under control pressed on the effect prospective retirees may be feeling as a result of the plunges to in the value of their 401k jean pierre said we know that high prices are having a real effect on peoples lives we get that and we are incredibly focused on doing everything that we can to make sure that the economy is working for the american people but we are coming out of the strongest jobs market in american history and that matters and a lot of that is thanks to the american rescue plan she also pushed back on the notion that the american rescue plan a massive covid 19 relief bill signed into law last year has led to historic inflation even though government spending is known to boost inflation the rescue plan has been cited by critics as one of many factors contributing to the current state of the economy treasury secretary janet yellen said earlier this month that biden s hallmark 1 9 trillion plan which included stimulus checks enhanced unemployment benefits and various other forms of relief contributed only modestly to inflation yellen downplayed the inflationary impact of the stimulus package pointing instead to the economy s miraculously rapid recovery later in monday s press briefing jean pierre also said gas prices would have been even worse had biden not taken action to address anticipated oil supply shocks the president authorized a record release from the country s oil reserves earlier this year but prices have only grown since then the white house is in the midst of a month long effort to signal focus on the economy and inflation but earlier this month the president acknowledged that there is little more he can do to lower the cost of gasoline or food in the immediate term there s a lot going on right now but the idea we re going to be able to click a switch bring down the cost of gasoline is not likely in the near term nor is it with regard to food biden said at the white house the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved cnn s david goldman and chris isidore contributed to this report

by holly yan cnn when a little army of men with shields and other riot gear was spotted near a pride parade in idaho on saturday authorities soon linked the men to a relatively new white nationalist group and charged them with conspiracy to riot it is clear to us based on the gear that the individuals had with them the stuff they had in their possession the u haul with them along with paperwork that was seized from them that they came to riot downtown coeur d alene police chief lee white said among those arrested was thomas ryan rousseau the leader of patriot front the sheriff s office said in total 31 people from at least 12 states were arrested and charged with conspiracy to riot all have been released on bond most of the men arrested had logos on their hats consistent with the patriot front group and some had other clothing associated with the white supremacist group white said here s what we know about patriot front and what makes it different from other groups how did patriot front start patriot front is a white nationalist hate group that formed in the aftermath of the deadly unite the right rally in charlottesville virginia the southern poverty law center said the organization broke off from vanguard america va a neo nazi group that participated in the chaotic demonstration the splc said the rally turned deadly with the killing of anti racism demonostrator heather heyer later that month rousseau who led vanguard america members at unite the right rebranded the group s website and launched a new group called patriot front the anti defamation league said what do patriot front members believe patriot front is a white supremacist group whose members maintain that their ancestors conquered america and bequeathed it to them and no one else the adl said patriot front justifies its ideology of hate and intolerance under the guise of preserving the ethnic and cultural origins of its members european ancestors the group s manifesto claims those in america who are not of european ancestry are not truly american an african may have lived worked and even been classed as a citizen in america for centuries yet he is not american he is as he likely prefers to be labeled an african in america patriot front s website said the same rule applies to others who are not of the founding stock of our people or do not share the common unconscious that permeates throughout our greater civilization and the european diaspora who is patriot front s leader rousseau who grew up in suburban dallas founded patriot front when he was a teenager according to the splc while working for his high school newspaper rousseau frequently wrote opinion columns in support of conservative topics including the controversial campus carry law in texas and north carolina s since gutted bathroom bill he was also an ardent supporter of donald trump during the 2016 election the splc said under rousseau s direct leadership patriot front s texas chapter is its most active relying mostly on flyering banner drops and occasionally demonstrations when the organization ventures off the internet its activities are primarily conducted in the dead of night anonymously after the arrests in idaho on saturday cnn reached out to the patriot front and people believed to be associated with rousseau but did not immediately hear back what are the goals of patriot front i think when you look at the past actions of the patriot front they re varied former fbi deputy assistant director peter strzok told cnn on monday a lot of what they do is designed for image for creating propaganda that they can use to spread their message to recruit more followers strzok said so in the past what we ve seen from a lot of their activities is not so much intent on engaging in violence as much as engaging in protests certainly hateful speech for sure but this is much more a group that s designed for image and for creating a public spectacle but strzok said there s always a key question with such groups is there a trigger point where their intention is to move from simply protesting to violence he said it s not clear what may have happened at the pride parade in idaho the real question in my mind is their intention for what they were going to do that day strzok said how is patriot front different from other white nationalist or white supremacist groups members of patriot front are comparatively young strzok said a central tactic to patriot front is flash demonstrations privately planned and unannounced events that allow groups to promote their beliefs while limiting the risk of individual exposure negative media coverage arrests and public backlash the adl said these flash demonstrations are mainly orchestrated for a quick photo and video opportunity that is then turned into online content and patriot front has declined to participate in large rallies with other hate groups preferring instead to work with small local chapters that allow patriot front to remain the center of attention while controlling their message and presentation the splc said strzok said he s worried the country might be in a new phase of extremism i think there s certainly a lot of personal grievances out there across america and what particularly concerns me right now is you see a lot of people both political leaders as well as some in the media who are tacitly encouraging not violence but certainly these extremist beliefs the former fbi official said whether it s replacement theory which plays into a lot of the white nationalist propaganda whether it s political figures using images of violence i think that s encouraging or accepting behavior that in the past we had moved away from strzok said so i am worried that people who are inclined to violence might be driven to violence correction a previous version of this story incorrectly stated that cnn had reached out to thomas ryan rousseau s legal representative it s unclear if he has legal representation yet the cnn wire 2022 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved cnn s chuck johnston and andy rose contributed to this report
if we re being totally honest lightyear doesn t quite live up to its premise a series of opening title cards explains that in 1995 a kid named andy got a buzz lightyear action figure for his birthday because he adored a movie this movie i was about andy s age in 1995 and i can tell you they didn t make movies this good looking thoughtful or sensitive back then taken on its own merits though lightyear works the impetus to make this film might have been to find a new way to capitalize on people s love of toy story but it s still an entertaining and sometimes surprisingly tender adventure movie it would probably stand fine on its own for someone who s never heard of toy story even if it never matches the magic of toy story or for that matter pixar s recent masterpiece turning red it does provide a very satisfying 100 minutes at the movies pixar it s 100 minutes to us to the characters in the film it s a lot longer as lightyear opens buzz chris evans and his space ranger partner alisha uzo aduba land their ship on a faraway planet the local wildlife proves hostile and in trying to blast off again buzz accidentally crashes their rocket marooning himself and hundreds of colonists amidst dangerous alien terrain evans was a smart choice to play this version of buzz he has to evoke tim allen s beat cop in space energy from toy story without mimicking it allen s bombastic buzz just wouldn t work in a story that treats him as a fallible human rather than an oblivious piece of plastic in the captain america and avengers movies evans proved particularly adept at playing the vulnerability masked by steve rogers puffed up physique and at bringing out the emotional shadings of a rigid do gooder both skills come in handy in lightyear blaming himself for the mission s failure buzz fixates on finding a way to build and test a special crystal that will power their ship s hyperdrive and enable the stranded crew to make their way home but each crystal test dilates time meaning a flight that passes in minutes to buzz actually takes years to complete and the longer buzz tries to successfully achieve hyperspeed the more the other survivors grow accustomed to their new home and alisha and buzz other friends move on with their lives pixar as that description suggests beneath lightyear s upbeat sci fi surface lies the melancholic heart of a pixar movie amidst the escapist thrills and a lot of comic relief much of it provided by buzz s scene stealing robot cat sidekick sox the good dinosaur director peter sohn lies a meditation of mortality the nature of time and the meaning of life this story of isolation from society might also resonate with people emerging from a pandemic none of that material is too heavy handed frankly lightyear might have benefited from more hard sci fi and character study and less of the stock space adventure and the scenes where buzz and his new team of pratfall prone partners including keke palmer as alisha s granddaughter and a bumbling dork played by taika waititi learns to work together those sequences could appear in a lot of films others feel uniquely pixar like the one where buzz mourns the loss of a friend and even cries how many sci fi action movies feature heroes who show that kind of vulnerability pixar again that s not something you would find in a four quadrant family film from the mid 1990s still there s something to be said for the lightyear pixar did make at my press screening i witnessed its power firsthand let me tell you a story a few minutes after lightyear started a mom and a young girl i d guess she was maybe 10 or 11 years old arrived at the theater and sat down right next to me at first i was annoyed because i m a germaphobic weirdo and i like to keep a little space around me at the theater these days if at all possible this mom and daughter didn t even leave me a buffer seat for a minute or two i thought about moving to a less crowded part of the theater i stayed because it quickly became clear that this girl was loving the film and seeing it through her eyes was a special thing to behold she was invested in this story in the way only a kid can be invested in a story she bounced up and down in her seat repeated the dialogue back to the screen in a soft voice and cheered all the big heroic moments during a crucial scene late in the film she whispered don t do it buzz with such intensity i was terrified buzz would do it and break this poor kid s heart forever so maybe lightyear isn t the kind of movie that hollywood would have made in 1995 as a 2022 movie it works just fine rating 7 10 the worst superhero movies ever made we love superhero movies here at screencrush but the genre is not without its share of flops here we rank the worst of the worst
these days it s a nightmare every time we get to pull into a gas station just to put some gas in the tank but did you notice a trip to the supermarket could be just as frustrating as my last time going down the aisles i experienced a high dose of sticker shock as everything that was affordable also is out of reach yes you guessed it food prices have also seen a major spike in the past few months and we are all wondering when will this end it s just not fair when people who are trying to make ends meet are literally going broke just to survive paulprescott72 the dilemma continues do you use that surplus cash to put gas in your tank or stock up on much needed staples like milk bread and what is put on the table for dinner and what has caused this inconvenience blame it all on the covid 19 pandemic which caused a shortage of supply on all items that you buy at the grocery store the virus also caused a shortage of labor as lockdowns forced a minimal availability for employees who were hired to oversee daily farm operations let s not forget the russian invasion of ukraine is another factor in causing things to go topsy turvy as both countries have the major worldwide surplus of barley wheat and corn believe it or not sunflower oil is also exported from both areas that are entrenched in this conflict that has cause headaches worldwide many countries are not doing business with russia as the conflict seems never ending to say the least flownaksala a box of cereal has also reached it s highest levels in decades as demand for animal feed has hit the roof and to make things worse the recent case of bird flu has seen skyrocketing prices for a dozen eggs as a 15 increase has been reported as an overall 40 rise is attributed to this major rise in prices economists are hoping this should stabilize by next year but we can hope that prediction becomes reality kellogg s bottom line as consumers we need to economize and tighten our belts by just buying what is essential when shopping make a list and stick with it as we are all sticking to a budget what choice do we have this seems to be the only way to get through this setback we are a hearty bunch here in the berkshires and throughout new england we ll band together and overcome these obstacles as inflation numbers are staggering for the first time since 1979 my outlook the less i eat the more opportunity i ll lose more weight which has been rule of thumb from yours truly since last year two more words for everyone good luck
sacramento calif ap california lawmakers on monday passed a 300 billion operating budget over the objections of democratic gov gavin newsom highlighting disagreements among democrats about how to spend a record breaking surplus that by itself is more than most other states spend in a year while newsom does not support the legislature s spending plan lawmakers sent the bill to his desk anyway because the california constitution requires them to pass a budget by wednesday or else they don t get paid unlike most states california lawmakers are full time and get paid 119 702 per year newsom and legislative leaders will continue negotiating with the goal of coming up with a spending plan they can all agree on before the start of the fiscal year on july 1 the democratic controlled legislature wants to spend more money than newsom does on education and housing the lawmakers plan would cover college tuition for 150 000 more students than newsom would and lawmakers want to borrow about 1 billion per year and use it to help about 8 000 first time buyers purchase a home by covering 20 of the price the plan could potentially lower mortgage payments by about 1 000 per month in a state where the median home price hit a record high of 849 080 in march this is the budget that you ran for office for assemblymember kevin mccarty a democrat from sacramento said monday while urging lawmakers to vote for the bill lawmakers say they can afford to do those things because california s revenues have soared throughout the pandemic as the rich have gotten richer and pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes compared to other states this year california s surplus money left over once the state has fulfilled its existing commitments is more than 97 billion but newsom doesn t like the legislature s plan because he says it would spend too much of the state s surplus money that is only available for one year on things that must have more than one year of funding mostly for schools and community colleges the legislature s plan would spend 2 4 billion more for ongoing expenses than newsom s plan a disparity that would grow to 5 6 billion by 2026 while california has lots of money today the newsom administration fears the economy is showing signs of stress as stock prices fall and inflation keeps going up because of supply chain disruptions and the russian invasion of ukraine given the financial storm clouds on the horizon a final budget must be fiscally responsible said anthony york newsom s senior advisor for communications the governor remains opposed to massive ongoing spending and wants a budget that pays down more of the state s long term debts and puts more money into state reserves lawmakers disagree they say the extra money they want to spend is small accounting for less than 1 of total spending plus legislative leaders noted monday that their plan includes record high reserves about 700 million more than newsom proposed to protect california during future economic slowdowns this type of disagreement is typical in california where governors usually see their role as stopping the progressive legislature from spending too much money but newsom s plan has its own problems it would leave the state about 25 billion over a constitutional limit on spending over the next two years a situation the nonpartisan legislative analyst s office says could push the state over a fiscal cliff that could force budget cuts even if state revenues continue to grow the newsom administration has downplayed those concerns noting their plan would spend 95 of the budget surplus on one time expenses money that could be pulled back in an emergency one thing newsom and legislative leaders can agree on is they want to give a portion of the budget surplus back to taxpayers to help them pay for record high gas prices but they can t agree who should get the money and how much they should get newsom wants to send checks of up to 800 to everyone who has a car registered in the state the legislature wants to send 200 checks to people who have taxable income below a certain level 125 000 for single people and 250 000 for couples newsom s plan would cost 11 5 billion and taxpayers might get the checks a little faster because the money would come on a debit card the legislature s plan would cost 8 billion but it wouldn t benefit the wealthy we should be supporting those families and households middle class and below that would be really struggling from these costs versus those with incomes for whom this would not be as much of a problem said state sen nancy skinner a democrat from berkeley and chair of the senate budget and fiscal review committee republicans don t like either plan instead they favor a suspension of the state s gas tax which at 51 1 cents per gallon is the second highest in the nation there s nothing in today s proposal to bring immediate relief for californians said assemblymember vince fong a republican from bakersfield and vice chair of the assembly budget committee as the state coffers grow family bank accounts are shrinking and californians consistently pay more and more to sacramento and get pennies back temporarily that is not relief ___ this story has been updated to correct that assemblymember vince fong is from bakersfield not fresno

business bear market hits wall street as stocks bonds crypto dive a screen displays the market results as traders work on the floor at the new york stock exchange in new york monday june 13 2022 ap photo eduardo munoz alvarez new york ap wall street tumbled into what s called a bear market monday after fears about a fragile economy and rising interest rates sent the s p 500 more than 20 below its record set early this year the index sank 3 9 in the first chance for investors to trade after getting the weekend to reflect on the stunning news that inflation is getting worse not better the dow jones industrial average was briefly down more than 1 000 points before finishing with a loss of 876 at the center of the sell off again was the federal reserve which is scrambling to get inflation under control its main method to do that is to raise interest rates in order to slow the economy a blunt tool that risks a recession if used too aggressively advertisement with the fed seemingly pinned into having to get more aggressive prices fell in a worldwide rout for everything from bonds to bitcoin from new york to new zealand some of the sharpest drops hit what had been big winners of the easier low rate era such as high growth technology stocks and other former darlings of investors tesla slumped 7 1 and amazon dropped 5 5 gamestop tumbled 8 4 the best thing people can do is to not panic and don t sell at the bottom said randy frederick managing director of trading and derivatives at the schwab center for financial research and we re probably not at the bottom some economists are speculating the fed on wednesday may raise its key rate by three quarters of a percentage point that s triple the usual amount and something the fed hasn t done since 1994 traders now see a 28 probability of such a mega hike up from just 3 a week ago according to cme group no one thinks the fed will stop there with markets bracing for a continued series of bigger than usual hikes those would come on top of some discouraging signals about the economy and corporate profits including a record low preliminary reading on consumer sentiment soured by high gasoline prices advertisement the economy is still holding up overall but the danger is that the job market and other factors are so hot that they will feed into higher inflation that s why the fed is in the midst of a whiplash pivot away from the record low interest rates it engineered earlier in the pandemic which propped up stocks and other investments amid hopes of juicing the economy wall street s sobering realization that inflation is accelerating not peaking is also sending u s bond yields to their highest levels in more than a decade the two year treasury yield shot to 3 36 from 3 06 late friday in its second straight major move it earlier touched its highest level since 2007 according to tradeweb the 10 year yield jumped to 3 37 from 3 15 and the higher level will make mortgages and many other kinds of loans more expensive it touched its highest level since 2011 the higher yields mean prices are tumbling for bonds a relatively rare occurrence for them in recent decades they re also a particularly painful hit for older and more conservative investors who depend on them as the safer parts of their nest eggs the gap between the two year and 10 year yields has also narrowed sharply a signal of weakening optimism about the economy when the two year yield tops the 10 year an unusual occurrence some investors see it as a sign of a looming recession advertisement some of the biggest hits came for cryptocurrencies which soared early in the pandemic as ultralow rates encouraged some investors to pile into the riskiest investments bitcoin tumbled more than 14 from a day earlier and dropped below 23 400 according to coindesk it s back to where it was in late 2020 and down from a peak of 68 990 late last year on wall street the s p 500 fell 151 23 points to 3 749 63 and dropped 21 8 below its record set early this year to put it into what investors call a bear market bears hibernate so bears represent a market that s retreating said sam stovall chief investment strategist at cfra in contrast wall street s nickname for a surging stock market is a bull market because bulls charge stovall said the s p 500 has lost nearly 9 in just three days that s its worst such stretch since the earliest days of the coronavirus crash in march 2020 the dow lost 876 05 or 2 8 to 30 516 74 on monday and the nasdaq composite dropped 530 80 or 4 7 to 10 809 23 the coronavirus crash in early 2020 was wall street s last bear market and it was an unusually short one that lasted only about a month the s p 500 got close to a bear market last month but it didn t finish a day below the 20 threshold michael wilson a strategist at morgan stanley who s been among wall street s more pessimistic voices is sticking with his view that the s p 500 could fall further to 3 400 even if the u s economy avoids a recession over the next year advertisement that would mark another roughly 9 drop from the current level and wilson said it reflects his view that wall street s earnings forecasts are still too optimistic among other things with soaring price tags souring sentiment for shoppers even higher income ones wilson said in a report that the next shoe to drop is a discounting cycle as companies try to clear out built up inventories such moves would cut into their profitability and a stock s price moves up and down largely on two things how much cash a company generates and how much an investor will pay for it ap business writers damian j troise and elaine kurtenbach contributed
