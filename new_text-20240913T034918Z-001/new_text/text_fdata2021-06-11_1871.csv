washington ap republicans in congress are alarmed by the leak of confidential irs data to the investigative news organization propublica enabling it to reveal that famous billionaires including warren buffett bill gates and mark zuckerberg paid little in u s income tax at times a senior irs official said thursday that a federal criminal investigation into the leak has been requested taking a detour from the debate over president joe biden s tax overhaul plan the gop lawmakers are demanding to know how the private tax data was disclosed and they are pressing the treasury department and the irs to pursue anyone who violated the law taxpayers must have the utmost confidence in federal institutions that house their personal and confidential information a group of republican senators said in letters demanding an investigation regrettably it appears personnel with access to americans personal and confidential information are misusing protected information for political reasons treasury and the irs must hold accountable any and all individuals who broke federal law by inappropriately sharing the confidential tax information and tax returns of multiple americans douglas o donnell a deputy irs commissioner said at a hearing by a house panel that the treasury department which oversees the irs has referred the matter for investigation to the fbi and the u s attorney s office in the district of columbia both getting access to and disclosing the confidential tax data are problems o donnell said we too want to know what happened urgently the law provides for potential criminal penalties for federal employees or other individuals who leak tax information the propublica report published tuesday on the wealthiest people in america was based on irs data long held as sacrosanct delivered by an anonymous source for democrats the revelations affirmed their long standing accusations that the irs gives big corporations and wealthy individuals a free pass while hounding lower income people democrats held up the new report as a prime exhibit in the national dialogue over the vast and widening inequality between the wealthiest and everyone else sen elizabeth warren d mass said in a tweet our tax system is rigged for billionaires who don t make their fortunes through income like working families do the evidence is abundantly clear it is time for a wealthtax in america to make the ultra rich finally pay their fair share the report showed that amazon founder jeff bezos paid no income tax in 2007 and 2011 tesla founder elon musk s income tax bill was zero in 2018 financier george soros went three straight years without paying federal income tax overall the richest 25 americans pay less in tax an average of 15 8 of adjusted gross income than many ordinary workers do once taxes for social security and medicare are included propublica found they all used perfectly legal tax strategies which is why the propublica report stoked the debate over the loopholes shelters and offshore havens available to the wealthy and giant corporations courtesy of the federal tax code the report intruded on the debate over biden s sweeping tax plan which must be approved by congress seeking revenue to finance his multitrillion dollar plan to boost infrastructure families education and job training biden is targeting the wealthy for higher taxes he wants to raise the top tax rate to 39 6 for people earning 400 000 a year or more in taxable income estimated to be fewer than 2 of u s households the top tax rate that workers pay on salaries and wages now is 37 biden proposes to nearly double the tax rate that high earning americans pay on profits from stocks and other investments inherited capital gains would no longer be tax free the plan also would raise taxes on corporations affecting wealthy investors who own corporate stocks as they raise the alarm on privacy of tax data republicans also are denouncing what they see as a related intrusion a new financial reporting proposal that is nestled in biden s tax plan aimed at helping the irs collect taxes it would call for u s banks to report to the agency most flows into and out of personal and business accounts including bank loans and investment accounts banks aren t wild about it either the aim is to give the irs a better view of underreported income by individuals and businesses according to the plan architects wealthier taxpayers earnings from investments and business activities would be reported to the irs the way wages and salaries are republican lawmakers see it as an assault on taxpayers privacy the requirement would bring a drastic increase in the amount of private sensitive information reported to the irs by financial institutions about deposits or withdrawals made by any individual or business in savings checking or other accounts of as little as 600 the senior republicans in tax policy sen mike crapo of idaho and rep kevin brady of texas told irs commissioner charles rettig in a letter taxpayers who are already concerned about having their local banks turned into monitoring and reporting agents of the irs now must also worry about whether data collected and reported to the agency are secure an array of trade groups representing big and small banks and credit unions have objected to the proposal saying their members already provide significant data to the irs and other regulators the proposal would impose cost and complexity that are not justified by the potential and highly uncertain benefits the groups said in a recent

one of the biggest questions that many older workers face when embarking on an international remote working or digital nomad lifestyle is what to do with their single most valuable asset their home in general there are two options rent it or sell it while the best option will vary from person to person depending on your financial circumstances the location of the property and a host of other factors there are a number of issues that everyone should be aware of especially any potential tax obligations my wife rebecca and i faced this rent vs sell predicament back in 2018 when we decided to move from virginia to mexico as a former tax attorney for the internal revenue service irs i was aware of many of the relevant laws but i still learned some important and surprising lessons during this process here i would like to share with you the story of how we tackled the rent or sell dilemma so that it can help inform your decision if you re thinking of relocating overseas an investment in our financial future real estate is a critical element of a well balanced investment portfolio but 20 years ago when rebecca and i were looking to purchase our first home we were more concerned with whether we would be able to afford a house rather than how it would look next to our stock holdings at the time housing in the trendy virginia neighborhoods just across the potomac river from our jobs in washington d c was so in demand that would be buyers were routinely forced to bid more than asking price and forgo home and safety inspections this made us nervous moreover the amount of money the bank wanted to lend us back in those madcap days pre global financial meltdown was more than either of us could ever imagine paying back because we were adverse to being house poor that is we didn t want to spend the majority of our incomes on a mortgage rebecca and i went with our gut and decided on a cheaper option we purchased a 1940 built townhouse on the proverbial wrong side of the tracks for half of what we would have spent on a slightly larger single family house in a more popular neighborhood but we felt safe in the new house and planned to use the money we were not paying to the bank for the travel that we both loved to do it turned out that luck was with us as our realtor had predicted we were on the vanguard of our new neighborhood s gentrification modern housing developments were built on either side of us more shops and restaurants moved in and our area became known as the quaint colonial neighborhood then housing prices in the entire city began to rise when we purchased our home in 2000 the city assessed our land and house at 127 900 ten years later the assessment was 378 420 and by the time rebecca and i decided to move our family to mexico in january 2018 it was 516 168 choosing between two attractive options rebecca and i had a difficult choice to make about the house after deciding to move overseas should we rent it out and use the monthly rental income to help pay our expenses in mexico or should we cash out and take advantage of a federal law eliminating tax on the substantial gain we would realize by selling renting had advantages the monthly rent would provide a steady stream of income to partially replace the salaries we were leaving behind and thereby reduce the amount we would need to draw from savings to meet our daily living expenses the income would cover our rent in mexico tuition for our children s school and as i liked to joke leave a few dollars for tacos as fiscal conservatives at least when it comes to spending our own money rebecca and i liked that rental income would provide a financial cushion until we could develop several business ideas we wanted to pursue another point to consider when moving overseas is that rental income can help you secure a residence visa in your new country while this wasn t relevant to our situation some nations uruguay for instance require a provable stream of income to gain permanent residence rental income can help you meet this requirement there are downsides to renting as well however as we learned in researching our options first the cost of a management company to advertise and oversee the property would bite into our profit these companies often charge a fee equal to one month s rent to find a renter and then 8 to 10 of the monthly rent to maintain the property and respond to issues raised by the tenant while online sites such as craigslist exist as free platforms to help connect landlords and tenants those tools can t manage the property second we would have to report the rental income as taxable further reducing what went into our pockets rebecca and i also found selling to be an exciting option based on conversations we had with several local realtors as well as our independent research using the online tool zillow which uses comparable properties to estimate a home s market value we anticipated we could sell the house for roughly 600 000 in that case we would make a profit of 400 000 after subtracting our initial purchase price and the cost of the capital improvements we had made which totaled 200 000 we could invest the 400 000 profit and use the returns to cover expenses in mexico further under section 121 of the internal revenue code the housing exclusion none of this 400 000 profit would be taxable the housing exclusion allows a married couple to eliminate from income up to 500 000 in gains on the sale of a home a single person can exclude up to 250 000 to qualify for this exclusion and this is crucial to understand if you re considering selling your home married couples and single persons must meet the ownership test and the use test you re eligible for the exclusion if you have owned and used the property as your main home for a period aggregating at least two years out of the five years prior to the sale you can meet the ownership and use tests during different two year periods but you must meet both tests during the five year period ending on the date of the sale if we sold our house we would meet both the ownership and use tests and be able to exclude all of our profit resulting in zero tax without the benefit of the housing exclusion the 10 capital gains tax rate meant we would pay tax of 40 000 on the 400 000 profit forty thousand dollars is more than we anticipated it would cost our family of four to live in mexico for one year that s a lot of money to pay in taxes the reasons we rented several factors contributed to us making the decision to rent out our home first we immediately found a reliable renter on our own whom we could trust to take care of the house and yard we provided her with contact information for local repair people we had previously used eliminating the need for a management company the rent we collect is taxed as ordinary income rebecca and i pay in the 12 tax bracket but rates vary from 10 to 37 based on income and filing status still not incurring the cost of a third party management company meant more money in our pocket second given the nature of the washington d c metro area highly transient with close in housing such as ours in high demand we expected the value of the home to continue to rise further because the housing exclusion use test provides a two out of five year window we didn t immediately have to sell to gain the tax benefit in the simplest application of the test we had up to three years after moving out to sell if our date of sale was in january 2021 the five year lookback period would run from january 2016 to january 2021 and we would have lived in the house as our primary residence from january 2016 to january 2018 and would be able to exclude the gain the final reason we decided to initially rent rather than sell was that we wanted a place to come back to in case things in mexico didn t work out decision time again in june 2020 our tenant informed us that she would be moving out in august by this time we were two and a half years into our mexico experiment and committed to our lives there with no plans to move back to the u s we were ready to re explore our options with regard to the house my first reaction was to sell we were still within the two out of five year window to meet the use test and exclude our gain from taxation realtors we spoke with and the online platform zillow predicted we could now sell the house for 100 000 more than two years previously meaning we would save about 50 000 in taxes and have the entire 500 000 profit in hand to invest rebecca wanted to continue to rent a kombucha business we had started and the spanish language courses she had been running in mexico were intermittently profitable but she liked having the steady rental income another reason rebecca wanted to hang onto the house was to realize additional appreciation that several local realtors predicted after amazon announced it would be building its second headquarters in the area while we were still debating what to do fate intervened i was discussing our dilemma with a friend who has investment expertise and he offered something that rebecca and i hadn t fully understood he explained that the rate of return we earned from renting was more than we would likely get if we sold the house and invested the gain at that time we were clearing approximately 25 000 per year in rental income after paying property taxes homeowners insurance and maintenance expenses we had paid off the remaining mortgage before moving if we were to sell the house and invest the 500 000 gain we would have to find an investment that delivered a 5 return to realize as much as we were getting in rental income while we might be able to find that rate of return in a corporate bond or publicly traded stock those asset types are typically riskier investments than real estate around the same time that i had this conversation with my friend rebecca and i found through word of mouth a family with good careers and who would pay a slightly higher monthly rent than we had previously been receiving this made the decision to rent again easy plus i knew the housing exclusion wasn t completely off the table under the law we could reset the five year period critical to the use test if we decided to move back into the house as our primary residence and stayed there for two years or more if that suited us although it s not in our minds to move back now it s not out of the realm of possibility and why not the house has been good to us ultimately the decision of whether to sell or rent your home is a personal one there is no one size fits all solution however as our story shows a crucial financial consideration that every homeowner should keep in mind is the housing exclusion if you end up selling your home outside of the two out of five year window you may have to hand over a big chunk of the sales price to uncle sam so if you decide to hold onto your home for some years after moving overseas be aware of how this tax could impact your finances down the road related articles the world s best places to retire the best places to live and

getting high from opioids for an entire month there is just one caveat the patient must be sober for a full week before receiving the treatment that is in order to qualify molly has to stay sober for another four days the rest of the film follows molly and her mother as they struggle to keep her clean until she can receive the shot four good days has largely been met with a collective yawn from the critics on rotten tomatoes the film review aggregator it holds an approval rating of just 51 percent based on 74 top critics a new york post reviewer terms the story well worn while another from the tribune news complains that the film s ending offered more questions than answers the lead comment from rotten tomatoes top critics by indiewire s ryan lattanzio laments the fact that the film did not sufficiently vilify molly s mother perhaps the most fascinating aspect of this shallow movie is left unexplored why doesn t deb look in the mirror at her role in molly s addiction contrary to the complaints of the critics perhaps the greatest strength of four good days is its nuanced and compassionate attitude toward all its characters each person is complex with strengths and weaknesses regrets and guilt while some characters are presented with more or less admirable attributes no one is scapegoated as the villain and rightly so no single figure in the film is ultimately responsible for molly s addiction and the havoc it has wrought on her family while the story of an ordinary girl in an ordinary family setting caught up in the throes of addiction may bore the critics it has met with a significantly warmer response from viewers rotten tomatoes audience score registers an 81 percent approval rating drug addiction is a mass phenomenon in the us with an estimated 31 million users almost 10 percent of the population tens of millions more suffer from the scourge as family members and friends great numbers of people will make an emotional connection to one or another character in the film who are all profoundly influenced by molly s addiction the audience eventually comes to learn that deb who found herself in an unhappy marriage left the family when molly was in high school in a particularly emotional scene molly explains to her mother i thought you couldn t stand to be around us around me referring to how her mother s departure affected her deb is clearly hurt she takes her time trying to make molly understand how difficult her marriage and life were for her to endure in the end deb calmly tells her daughter i am so sorry for causing you so much pain but i can t apologize for trying to survive i just can t i would be lying she pauses before anxiously asking molly you think it s my fault that you are an addict molly breaks eye contact with her mother looks down and shakes her head no later we meet molly s father dale sam hennings who has remarried and refuses to interact with his daughter until she is drug free at this point molly has suddenly gone missing deb is in a wild state of anger and concern she shows up at her ex husband s to berate him for not phoning molly the two exchange harsh words blaming each other for molly s addiction when it looks like they may come to blows they stop themselves exchanging apologetic and perhaps even sympathetic looks in a moment of silence before parting ways we also learn more about molly herself a straight a student who never made it through high school she has two kids who live with their father molly no longer has custody her addiction started when she was 17 she hurt her knee and was prescribed 75 oxycontin and never had a refill denied her addiction like so many spiraled into heroin addressing high school students in a health and wellness class she explains i have degraded myself for drugs in ways in ways that you don t want to know one student interrupts molly boasting that she would never let herself get that far into addiction molly responds i have woken up every morning for the last couple years and said that this is it today i am not going to get high and an hour later i am meeting up with my dealer to get high clearly struggling to continue molly stresses i fail every single day molly is consumed by guilt while she may lash out at times at her mother and others it is clear that above all she blames herself four good days grapples constantly with the question of responsibility the characters are collectively burdened with a sea of regret that stem from their love for molly and their desire to help what if more counseling had been available at school what if deb had remained in her unhappy marriage or if her father had just contacted his daughter perhaps things would have turned out differently but more than likely not instead the audience is left with a sense that something more fundamental is wrong here while personal decisions certainly can make a difference in immediate outcomes none of the enormous problems involved in the opioid epidemic can be solved on an individual basis human beings undergo particular experiences and have different physical and psychological susceptibilities however the mass upsurge in opioid addiction points toward a broader cause the coalescence of many ills hammering at people s lives inequality poverty low wages unemployment homelessness and a general lack of confidence in the future that afflicts a considerable section of the population what stands out so starkly and painfully in four good days is that molly s family is left entirely alone to deal with these immense social problems such a burden exacts a staggering emotional toll however as helpless and isolated as the characters or rather the real human beings they are meant to represent may feel they are certainly not alone the wrenching story of molly and her family is currently being played out millions of times across the us and globally over the past year as governments around the world shoveled trillions of dollars into the financial markets and giant corporations while leaving masses of people to suffer through the pandemic the opioid epidemic has only worsened four good days leaves wider questions untouched its narrow focus is a limitation however the film s perceptive and frank treatment of addicts and their loved ones is certainly worth commending

recovered over the course of the year and the potential for substantial deferred acquisition cost write offs never materialized additionally unum continues to experience favorable profitability which is expected to continue into the medium term the favorable earnings trend somewhat offsets the 2 1 billion premium deficiency reserve unum will recognize over the next seven years for its closed long term care block of business the first charge of 229 million is reflected in 2020 results unum s strong balance sheet strength historically has been supported through the retention of strong operating earnings and the favorable performance of its investment portfolio both profitability and premium growth moderated in 2020 as covid 19 drove increased claims in the company s group life and accidental death and dismemberment businesses and covid 19 related economic restrictions limited new business sales net premiums in 2020 were also unfavorably impacted by the one time effect of unum reinsuring its closed individual disability block however despite moderation from historical levels profitability remains strong and am best expects it to return to historical levels as the impacts of covid 19 subside investment income although favorable has shown incremental declines due to the persistent low interest rate environment a trend that is expected to continue as interest rates are at record

zeke miller aamer madhani and jonathan lemire the associated press st ives england ap president joe biden urged global leaders thursday to join him in sharing coronavirus vaccines with struggling nations around the world after he promised the u s would donate 500 million doses to help speed the pandemic s end and bolster the strategic position of the world s wealthiest democracies speaking in england before a summit of the group of seven world leaders biden announced the u s commitment to vaccine sharing which comes on top of 80 million doses he has already pledged by the end of the month he argued it was in both america s interests and the world s to make vaccination widely and speedily available everywhere we re going to help lead the world out of this pandemic working alongside our global partners biden said he added that on friday the g 7 nations would join the u s in outlining their vaccine donation commitments british prime minister boris johnson wrote in the times of london newspaper that it was now time for wealthy countries to shoulder their responsibilities and vaccinate the world his country has yet to send any doses abroad or announce a solid plan to share vaccines johnson indicated britain had millions of doses in surplus stocks french president emmanuel macron welcomed the u s commitment and said europe should do the same i think the european union needs to have at least the same level of ambition as the united states and be able to make a similar announcement he said at a news conference biden said the u s was sharing its doses with no strings attached or pressure for favors we re doing this to save lives to end this pandemic and that s it he said biden had faced mounting pressure to outline his global vaccine sharing plan especially as inequities in supply around the world have become more pronounced and the demand for shots in the u s has dropped precipitously in recent weeks in times of trouble americans reach out to offer help biden said adding that the u s doses would supercharge the global vaccination campaign our values call on us to do everything that we can to vaccinate the world against covid 19 â ³ the u s commitment is to buy and donate 500 million pfizer doses for distribution through the global covax alliance to 92 lower income countries and the african union bringing the first steady supply of mrna vaccine to the countries that need it most a price tag for the 500 million doses was not released but the u s is now set to be covax s largest vaccine donor in addition to its single largest funder with a 4 billion commitment the global alliance has thus far distributed just 81 million doses and parts of the world particularly in africa remain vaccine deserts white house officials hope the ramped up distribution program can be the latest example of a theme biden plans to hit frequently during his week in europe that western democracies and not rising authoritarian states can deliver the most good for the world white house officials said the 500 million vaccines will be shipped starting in august with the goal of distributing 200 million by the end of the year the remaining 300 million doses would be shipped in the first half of 2022 after leading the world in new cases and deaths over much of the last year the rapid vaccination program in the u s now positions it among the leaders of the global recovery nearly 64 of adults in the u s have received at least one vaccine dose and the average numbers of new positive cases and deaths in the u s are lower now than at any point since the earliest days of the pandemic the organization for economic cooperation and development last week projected that the u s economy would grow at a rate of 6 9 this year making it one of the few nations for which forecasts are rosier now than before the pandemic u s officials hope the summit will conclude with a communique showing a commitment from the g 7 countries and nations invited to participate to do more to help vaccinate the world and support public health globally national security adviser jake sullivan told reporters wednesday that g 7 leaders are converging around the idea that vaccine supply can be increased in several ways including by countries sharing more of their own doses helping to increase global manufacturing capacity and doing more across the chain of custody from when the vaccine is produced to when it is injected into someone in the developing world biden harked back to the detroit area workers who 80 years ago built tanks and planes that helped defeat the threat of global fascism in world war ii they built what became known as the arsenal of democracy biden said now a new generation of american men and women working with today s latest technology is going to build a new arsenal to defeat the current enemy of world peace health and stability covid 19 he noted that pfizer s plant in kalamazoo michigan is not far from detroit last week the white house unveiled plans to donate an initial allotment of 25 million doses of surplus vaccine overseas mostly through the united nations backed covax program promising infusions for south and central america asia africa and others officials say a quarter of that excess will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the u s to share directly with allies and partners including south korea taiwan and ukraine china and russia have shared with varying success their domestically produced vaccines with some needy countries often with hidden strings attached sullivan said biden does want to show rallying the rest of the world s democracies that democracies are the countries that can best deliver solutions for people everywhere the u s produced mrna vaccines have also proven to be more effective against both the original strain and more dangerous variants of covid 19 than the more conventional vaccines produced by china and russia some countries that have had success in deploying those conventional vaccines have nonetheless seen cases spike biden s decision to purchase the doses officials said was meant to keep them from getting locked up by richer nations that have the means to enter into purchasing agreements directly with manufacturers just last month the european commission signed an agreement to purchase as many as 1 8 billion pfizer doses in the next two years a significant share of the company s upcoming production though the bloc reserved the right to donate some of its doses to covax global public health groups have been aiming to use the g 7 meetings to press wealthier democracies to do more to share vaccines with the world biden s plans drew immediate praise tom hart acting ceo at the one campaign a nonprofit that seeks to end poverty said biden s announcement was the kind of bold leadership that is needed to end this global pandemic we urge other g 7 countries to follow the u s example and donate more doses to covax he added if there was ever a time for global ambition and action to end the pandemic it s now others have called on the u s to do even more charity is not going to win the war against the coronavirus said niko lusiani oxfam america s vaccine lead at the current rate of vaccinations it would take low income countries 57 years to reach the same level of protection as those in g 7 countries that s not only morally wrong it s self defeating given the risk posed by coronavirus mutations biden last month broke with european allies to endorse waiving intellectual property rules at the world trade organization to promote vaccine production and equity but many in his own administration acknowledge that the restrictions were not the driving cause of the global vaccine shortage which has more to do with limited manufacturing capacity and shortages of delicate raw materials miller reported from washington lemire reported from plymouth england ap writer sylvie corbet contributed to this report from paris

jill biden are greeted and walk with british prime minister boris johnson and his wife carrie johnson ahead of the g 7 summit ap french president emmanuel macron welcomed the us commitment and said

biden said the us was sharing its doses with no strings attached or pressure for favours we re doing this to save lives to end this pandemic and that s it he said mr biden had faced mounting pressure

wowza takes significant investment from boston based private equity firm wowza media systems has taken a significant investment from boston based private equity firm clearhaven partners since the financial terms are not disclosed and clearhaven is a relatively new firm founded in 2019 we really don t have a lot more hard data to share beyond some snippets from the press release and some comments from wowza ceo david stubenvoll pictured above that said this doesn t mean that the investment isn t big news both for what it might enable wowza to do down the road and to celebrate wowza s accomplishments over the last 15 years so we ll spend a bit more time on what you can glean from the press release talk a bit about wowza s colorful backstory and share some of our conversation with stubenvoll scanning the press release in the press release chris ryan managing partner at clearhaven partners shared that among many companies we see each year wowza stood out to us due to its reputation as a technology leader and its ability to deliver market leading video streaming solutions at scale in a market with significant tailwinds the release further states that clearhaven s investment positions wowza to accelerate innovation of wowza s leading solutions known for helping customers solve their complex video workflow challenges hey i told you there wasn t a lot of hard data there the backstory forgive me an indulgence here and let me ramble of all the companies in the streaming industry wowza is the one that feels most personal at least for me and its accomplishments are something that i celebrate like i would those of a nephew or best friend s daughter it s hard to get excited about established tech companies like google or microsoft or behemoths like netflix or amazon but wowza was founded by two of us david stubenvoll and charlie good both adobe alums during wowza s nascent stages they directed one of the most consequential streaming related product pivots of all time launching their company to distribute a video messaging platform then changing their focus to the media server they developed to drive that platform when the media server generated more interest than video messaging thus wowza media systems was born wowza didn t invent transmuxing also called on the fly or dynamic packaging but it was one of the first to commercialize it at scale paving the way for streaming publishers to efficiently support multiple abr packaging formats like hls dash hds and mss they became so successful that they overshadowed the adobe flash media server leading adobe to sue wowza in 2011 but david slew goliath yet again and in 2015 adobe s claims were settled and dismissed with prejudice in short wowza was birthed and grew up right in front of our eyes becoming in the words of the press release the gold standard for live streaming solutions and today powers more than 6 000 active customers with a track record of more than 35 000 deployments worldwide ceo interview by way of background i was not originally scheduled to talk to ceo david stubenvoll i stepped in when editor eric schumacher rasmussen took his cat to the emergency room for a cut paw the cat survived and is doing well i know stubenvoll well enough to shake hands at a trade show but we re not on each other s holiday card list if those are still a thing after stubenvoll described the investment i asked why would clearhaven invest in a company about to be obsoleted by cmaf half joking but genuinely interested in his response for those not up to the millisecond on the common media application format the cmaf container format has the potential to eliminate the need for transmuxing one of the major features of the wowza streaming engine and wowza streaming cloud two of wowza s most significant products stubenvoll laughed and considered and then responded that s partially true cmaf may reduce the need for some product features but we ve innovated far beyond transmuxing in our current products and this investment will allow us to go much further much faster here are some of the other questions we addressed streaming media why take an investment why not go public stubenvoll we never considered going public this investment and partnership gives us flexibility to invest on a much broader scale without the restrictions and hassle of being a listed company streaming media what about employees and their stock options don t companies go public so employees can profit as well stubenvoll clearhaven is purchasing shares and options which allows employees to cash out of their options and stock streaming media what will you use the money for stubenvoll accelerating innovation and growth that means more investment in the cloud to make our saas service a superset of the features offered by wowza streaming engine we ve been investing in this for a while and customers will start to see the benefits this year in the form of a better integrated bundle of products and services that are highly reliable and scalable and the ability to drive more configurations without coding we re also extending the cloud service to better integrate into the customer s data set and workflows processes and to extend features like multiple cloud support with automatic switchover should one cloud fail beyond investing in existing products we re analyzing our enhanced go to market capabilities now this could take the form of company or product acquisitions or could involve opening up new offices if it helps develop and maintain deep relationships with our customers streaming media what s in it for clearhaven stubenvoll wowza s a great investment we ve been growing and profitable for a long time it s no secret that they re going to need an exit strategy which could be a public offering or sale it s too early to say what the proper exit is but there will be an exit at some time streaming media what else do streaming media readers need to know stubenvoll there will be no layoffs every time i bring up private equity investment someone suggests that layoffs or some form of contraction are coming in this case it s the opposite clearhaven is allowing us to invest and accelerate our growth please enable javascript to view the comments powered by disqus related articles companies and suppliers mentioned

their contract stars while some of them were wildly successful mgm s hollywood revue paramount on parade others were colossal flops which soured all of the studios on the genre while revues never went out of fashion on broadway the movies didn t resuscitate them until world war ii as a means of entertaining the troops and the rest of the country with each studio s current roster of talent mgm s thousands cheer warners thank your lucky stars universal s follow the boys paramount s star spangled rhythm and even then the numbers were usually formatted within a flimsy narrative something the early revues didn t bother with but leave it to mgm to go for broke and try once again a plotless revue motivated at first to celebrate the studio s twentieth anniversary in 1944 but with constant retakes and reshuffling of numbers not released nationally until 1946 ziegfeld follies once again tapping into the name of the impresario who had headlined two of their previously successful musicals the great ziegfeld and ziegfeld girl ziegfeld follies is not a great musical revue but there is greatness in it along with a potpourri of middling to lousy comedy sketches and some of the biggest musical stars on the mgm payroll doing things both expected and unexpected of them obviously fred astaire was intended to be the star of the show slotted for six numbers within the running time with cuts and retakes he ended up in four segments all of them wonderful while two of the studio s newest musical acquisitions dancer lucille bremer and tenor james melton were scheduled for multiple appearances within the film bremer s contributions remained for two numbers both the highest points of the movie while melton s four intended sequences dwindled to one the drinking song from la traviata staged rather routinely by director vincente minnelli who had to deal with voluminous forty pound ball gowns on the ladies and little nuance in the singing by melton and soprano marion bell while the comedy spots featured talent both famous at the time red skelton fanny brice victor moore and up and coming keenan wynn whose semi amusing number please skit was the last thing filmed a year

fanny brice hume cronyn william frawley the sweepstake ticket is the bottom of the barrel quality wise but it s almost all aces from that point onward what ziegfeld revue wouldn t begin by celebrating beautiful women and ziegfeld follies is no exception the opening number here s to the beautiful ladies begun by fred astaire and featuring mgm s astounding assortment of glamazon women elegantly gowned and plumed and presided over by flamed haired lucille ball attempting to tame eight panther girls elegantly slinky in black sequins gets the show off to a great start well after a nominal introduction by william powell reprising his ziggie and reminiscing about the follies of old assisted cleverly by bunin s puppets there is a forgettable follow up as love starved virginia o brien seeks male companionship and esther williams performs a negligible water ballet but the best musical stuff comes later in the movie fred astaire s contributions can t be overestimated as he performs two sensational pantomime numbers as celebrity jewel thief raffles in this heart of mine with the elegant lucille bremer inevitably offering him her diamond necklace after he sweeps her off her feet in a delightfully elaborate maze of turntables and treadmills in the elaborate set to the romantic melody of the segment s song music by harry warren lyrics by the film s producer arthur freed and as a dying chinese coolie fantasizing about a romantic encounter with a beautiful chinese streetwalker again bremer in limehouse blues perhaps the high water mark of the entire movie he also dances for the first and until that s entertainment ii only time with fellow hoofer gene kelly to a number fred and his sister adele had introduced many years before the babbitt and the bromide even though at the time of filming gene kelly had only been in hollywood a couple of years with for me and my gal and cover girl as calling cards by the time ziegfeld follies was released he was much better known for his oscar nominated turn in the huge hit anchors aweigh the two men dance to a photo finish and give the film a definite star turn to serve as a true grand finale to the movie since otherwise we d be stuck with the movie s only musical dud the risible there s beauty everywhere with scraps of the out of control soap bubbles footage from the song s first attempt at staging with astaire bremer and melton cut out and kathryn grayson brought in to salvage the segment which she was fully unable to accomplish and speaking of star turns the other two highlights of the movie belong to lena horne in a devastatingly rhythmic paean to love a gloriously tuneful song by hugh martin and ralph blane and to the roger edens kay thompson satire a great lady has an interview sung and danced by judy garland and a cadre of male reporters out to get the latest scoop on the star s next movie role conceived for greer garson but turned down by the lady when it was presented to her judy and her cohorts spoof garson s british accent and affected posturing of her acting in great biographical sagas judy s star is about to film a drama about the inventor of the safety pin as the interview turns into a quasi

last month when i mentioned that the dinner of my dreams a sparkling water came in some readers asked me why i didn t choose white wine with that had long love affair that s why for thirty years i regularly drank alcohol i loved r s rite getting the boys to bed into the quiet kitchen and pouring cold wine into a white wine the high acidity indicated a shift from a work day to a quiet afternoon with adult conversation and perhaps a frasier recovery that niles a glass was a prize for the parents of two walnut children and it was a way to turn off my brain vortex immediately i also loved learning about wine it s exciting to be a fan i taught myself how to navigate restaurant wine lists i learned to distinguish between the grassy sauvingnon blanc and a vermentino peach i befriended the guys at the wine shop and continued to have fun wine columnists also the wine seemed to make for a longer life a glass of rosé on a summer evening a cold grüner before a meal with chips a champagne flute at a friend s wedding what s better people who really love wine think it s an ordinary part of meals like salt or bread he wrote eric asimov in the new york times regular consumption is the most important characteristic of trusted lovers that was me but as time went on his addiction to alcohol became slippery i noticed that i drank two glasses of wine every night more if we went to dinner or a party i felt like the alcohol wasn t under my control but i drove away again and again i tried to rest but i would only spend a couple of evenings before treating myself with a single spill which led to a second maybe a third i reassured myself that at least i wasn t drinking side effects like headaches or hangovers it s also chic and european i come from british stock it s part of my family s larger culture all right cut to 2021 during the winter pandemic wine bottles filled the recycling bin in february however my phone was turned off who s up for the three week health challenge my friend jordan i sent it to us and some other women his proposal was simple eat healthy food take 10k steps a day and cut out the alcohol i put my nerves aside and wrote a response i m in the first night was the hardest around 8pm i wanted a drink i felt angry reading a book in my bedroom and walking away from the fridge i also poured a glass of bright water so i could drink something but really i knew i was responsible in front of the text group every night we would text each other i did it today the team was counting on you on the second night i felt less tempted the third night still less until somehow a week or so later alcohol which was so constant in my adult life until i thought a lot about it that didn t surprise me any more at the same time something else was happening without daily drinking i felt much more alert more energetic and clear headed when the boys came to wake me up in the morning my eyes would open good morning world writer sarah levy he said that not using alcohol feels like waking up on clean sheets every day and he said it was true i suddenly asked myself all the time when i thought alcohol didn t affect me i was actually hanging out every day years today i haven t had much to drink since february sometimes i make exceptions last month my dad visited and we handed out a bottle of italian wine my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood we tasted honey and pineapple flavors and our cheeks turned pink and warm i still love the flavors and feel so i can occasionally eat wine at dinners or at special times but for now for this time in my life the decision feels good i m curious how do you relate to your alcohol how do you feel about that i would love to hear it ps three tasty waters and how quitting drinking changed my life photo by sophia hsin stocksy

vaccines with struggling nations around the world after he promised the u s would donate 500 million doses to help speed the pandemic s end and bolster the strategic position of the world s wealthiest democracies speaking in england before a summit of the group of seven world leaders biden announced the u s commitment to vaccine sharing which comes on top of 80 million doses he has already pledged by the end of the month he argued it was in both america s interests and the world s to make vaccination widely and speedily available everywhere we re going to help lead the world out of this pandemic working alongside our global partners biden said he added that on friday the g 7 nations would join the u s in outlining their vaccine donation commitments british prime minister boris johnson wrote in the times of london newspaper that it was now time for wealthy countries to shoulder their responsibilities and vaccinate the world his country has yet to send any doses abroad or announce a solid plan to share vaccines johnson indicated britain had millions of doses in surplus stocks french president emmanuel macron welcomed the u s commitment and said europe should do the same i think the european union needs to have at least the same level of ambition as the united states and be able to make a similar announcement he said at a news conference biden said the u s was sharing its doses with no strings attached or pressure for favors we re doing this to save lives to end this pandemic and that s it he said biden had faced mounting pressure to outline his global vaccine sharing plan especially as inequities in supply around the world have become more pronounced and the demand for shots in the u s has dropped precipitously in recent weeks in times of trouble americans reach out to offer help biden said adding that the u s doses would supercharge the global vaccination campaign our values call on us to do everything that we can to vaccinate the world against covid 19 the u s commitment is to buy and donate 500 million pfizer doses for distribution through the global covax alliance to 92 lower income countries and the african union bringing the first steady supply of mrna vaccine to the countries that need it most a price tag for the 500 million doses was not released but the u s is now set to be covax s largest vaccine donor in addition to its single largest funder with a 4 billion commitment the global alliance has thus far distributed just 81 million doses and parts of the world particularly in africa remain vaccine deserts white house officials hope the ramped up distribution program can be the latest example of a theme biden plans to hit frequently during his week in europe that western democracies and not rising authoritarian states can deliver the most good for the world white house officials said the 500 million vaccines will be shipped starting in august with the goal of distributing 200 million by the end of the year the remaining 300 million doses would be shipped in the first half of 2022 after leading the world in new cases and deaths over much of the last year the rapid vaccination program in the u s now positions it among the leaders of the global recovery nearly 64 of adults in the u s have received at least one vaccine dose and the average numbers of new positive cases and deaths in the u s are lower now than at any point since the earliest days of the pandemic president joe biden speaks about his administration s global covid 19 vaccination efforts ahead of the g 7 summit thursday june 10 2021 in st ives england photo patrick semansky associated press the organization for economic cooperation and development last week projected that the u s economy would grow at a rate of 6 9 this year making it one of the few nations for which forecasts are rosier now than before the pandemic u s officials hope the summit will conclude with a communique showing a commitment from the g 7 countries and nations invited to participate to do more to help vaccinate the world and support public health globally national security adviser jake sullivan told reporters wednesday that g 7 leaders are converging around the idea that vaccine supply can be increased in several ways including by countries sharing more of their own doses helping to increase global manufacturing capacity and doing more across the chain of custody from when the vaccine is produced to when it is injected into someone in the developing world biden harked back to the detroit area workers who 80 years ago built tanks and planes that helped defeat the threat of global fascism in world war ii they built what became known as the arsenal of democracy biden said now a new generation of american men and women working with today s latest technology is going to build a new arsenal to defeat the current enemy of world peace health and stability covid 19 he noted that pfizer s plant in kalamazoo michigan is not far from detroit last week the white house unveiled plans to donate an initial allotment of 25 million doses of surplus vaccine overseas mostly through the united nations backed covax program promising infusions for south and central america asia africa and others officials say a quarter of that excess will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the u s to share directly with allies and partners including south korea taiwan and ukraine china and russia have shared with varying success their domestically produced vaccines with some needy countries often with hidden strings attached sullivan said biden does want to show rallying the rest of the world s democracies that democracies are the countries that can best deliver solutions for people everywhere related biden warns russia it faces robust response for harmful actions as he begins european visit president joe biden on wednesday began his first trip abroad since taking office by hailing america s unwavering commitment to the nato alliance the u s produced mrna vaccines have also proven to be more effective against both the original strain and more dangerous variants of covid 19 than the more conventional vaccines produced by china and russia some countries that have had success in deploying those conventional vaccines have nonetheless seen cases spike biden s decision to purchase the doses officials said was meant to keep them from getting locked up by richer nations that have the means to enter into purchasing agreements directly with manufacturers just last month the european commission signed an agreement to purchase as many as 1 8 billion pfizer doses in the next two years a significant share of the company s upcoming production though the bloc reserved the right to donate some of its doses to covax global public health groups have been aiming to use the g 7 meetings to press wealthier democracies to do more to share vaccines with the world biden s plans drew immediate praise tom hart acting ceo at the one campaign a nonprofit that seeks to end poverty said biden s announcement was the kind of bold leadership that is needed to end this global pandemic we urge other g 7 countries to follow the u s example and donate more doses to covax he added if there was ever a time for global ambition and action to end the pandemic it s now others have called on the u s to do even more charity is not going to win the war against the coronavirus said niko lusiani oxfam america s vaccine lead at the current rate of vaccinations it would take low income countries 57 years to reach the same level of protection as those in g 7 countries that s not only morally wrong it s self defeating given the risk posed by coronavirus mutations biden last month broke with european allies to endorse waiving intellectual property rules at the world trade organization to promote vaccine production and equity but many in his own administration acknowledge that the restrictions were not the driving cause of the global vaccine shortage which has more to do with limited manufacturing capacity and shortages of delicate raw materials __ miller reported from washington lemire reported

united nations a report issued thursday warns that over 350 000 people in ethiopia s tigray province are facing famine and over 2 million are just a step away blaming the dire situation on the ongoing conflict that has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee limited humanitarian access and the loss of harvests and income the report said the 350 000 people represent the largest number of people facing famine since the 2011 famine in somalia it projects that between july and september the number of people facing famine will rise to over 400 000 the integrated food security phase classification known as the ipc which is a global partnership of 15 u n agencies and international humanitarian organizations prepared the report it uses five categories of food security from people who have enough to eat to those facing famine humanitarian catastrophe in that worst category now confronting more than 350 000 people in tigray at least 20 of households face a complete lack of food and starvation death and destitution are evident in addition acute malnutrition is evident in more than 30 of households and deaths from starvation exceed two people per 1 000 population every day the report says over 2 million tigrayans are just a step below in the humanitarian emergency category characterized by extreme gaps in food consumption acute malnutrition and excess mortality in at least 20 of households and more than 3 million tigrayans in the crisis category are just below that u n humanitarian chief mark lowcock told a virtual high level meeting on the humanitarian emergency in tigray organized by the u s and european union on thursday that there is famine now in the region and warning that this is going to get a lot worse but lowcock told representatives from the group of seven major industrialized nations and eu that the worst can still be avoided if action is taken to help tigray now he said it s crucial to prevent a re run of the 1984 famine in ethiopia which would have wide ranging and long lasting ramifications my message is don t go there lowcock said david beasley head of the u n world food program the world s largest humanitarian organization called the new data alarming and said the lack of data from western tigray in the analysis is deeply worrying forces from the neighboring amhara region have reportedly attacked civilians and taken control of areas in western tigray wfp has mounted an emergency operation and increased food distribution to reach 1 4 million people beasley said yet that is barely half of the number we should be reaching and other agencies are struggling as well countless people especially in rural areas can t be reached because armed groups are blocking access he said the largely agricultural tigray region of about 5 million people already had a food security problem amid a locust outbreak when prime minister abiy ahmed on nov 4 announced fighting between his forces and those of the defiant regional government tigray leaders dominated ethiopia for almost three decades but were sidelined after abiy introduced reforms that won him the nobel peace prize in 2019 no one knows how many thousands of civilians or combatants have been killed more than 50 000 have fled into neighboring sudan though abiy declared victory in late november ethiopia s military and allied fighters remain active including troops from neighboring eritrea a bitter enemy of the now fugitive officials who once led tigray despite claims by ethiopia and eritrea that they were leaving beasley said wfp teams report that in 53 villages they visited 50 percent of mothers and almost a quarter of children they ve been screening are malnourished and without food urgently many of them will die he said three things are needed to prevent hunger from claiming millions of lives in tigray a ceasefire unimpeded access for wfp and partners to all areas and the money to expand our operations to meet the growing numbers of people who desperately need emergency food assistance oxfam one of the partners echoed his appeal for an end to the violence unconditional and safe access to all areas for humanitarian workers and funds for the u n s 853 million appeal for northern ethiopia emily farr oxfam s emergency food security adviser said that after drought locusts losing their property cattle and food stocks the stresses now hitting local economies and livelihoods caused by the covid 19 pandemic are potentially the last straw for many in tigray u s ambassador linda thomas greenfield told the us eu meeting that the united states is the largest bilateral donor to ethiopia for the current humanitarian response which is woefully underfunded and urged additional funding we cannot make the same mistake twice she said referring to the 1984 famine we cannot let ethiopia starve we have to act now

he argued it was in both america s interests and the world s to make vaccination widely and speedily available everywhere we re going to help lead the world out of this pandemic working alongside our global partners biden said he added that on friday the g 7 nations would join the u s in outlining their vaccine donation commitments british prime minister boris johnson wrote in the times of london newspaper that it was now time for wealthy countries to shoulder their responsibilities and vaccinate the world his country has yet to send any doses abroad or announce a solid plan to share vaccines johnson indicated britain had millions of doses in surplus stocks french president emmanuel macron welcomed the u s commitment and said europe should do the same i think the european union needs to have at least the same level of ambition as the united states and be able to make a similar announcement he said at a news conference biden said the u s was sharing its doses with no strings attached or pressure for favors we re doing this to save lives to end this pandemic and that s it he said biden had faced mounting pressure to outline his global vaccine sharing plan especially as inequities in supply around the world have become more pronounced and the demand for shots in the u s has dropped precipitously in recent weeks in times of trouble americans reach out to offer help biden said adding that the u s doses would supercharge the global vaccination campaign our values call on us to do everything that we can to vaccinate the world against covid 19 the u s commitment is to buy and donate 500 million pfizer doses for distribution through the global covax alliance to 92 lower income countries and the african union bringing the first steady supply of mrna vaccine to the countries that need it most a price tag for the 500 million doses was not released but the u s is now set to be covax s largest vaccine donor in addition to its single largest funder with a 4 billion commitment the global alliance has thus far distributed just 81 million doses and parts of the world particularly in africa remain vaccine deserts white house officials hope the ramped up distribution program can be the latest example of a theme biden plans to hit frequently during his week in europe that western democracies and not rising authoritarian states can deliver the most good for the world white house officials said the 500 million vaccines will be shipped starting in august with the goal of distributing 200 million by the end of the year the remaining 300 million doses would be shipped in the first half of 2022 after leading the world in new cases and deaths over much of the last year the rapid vaccination program in the u s now positions it among the leaders of the global recovery nearly 64 of adults in the u s have received at least one vaccine dose and the average numbers of new positive cases and deaths in the u s are lower now than at any point since the earliest days of the pandemic the organization for economic cooperation and development last week projected that the u s economy would grow at a rate of 6 9 this year making it one of the few nations for which forecasts are rosier now than before the pandemic u s officials hope the summit will conclude with a communique showing a commitment from the g 7 countries and nations invited to participate to do more to help vaccinate the world and support public health globally national security adviser jake sullivan told reporters wednesday that g 7 leaders are converging around the idea that vaccine supply can be increased in several ways including by countries sharing more of their own doses helping to increase global manufacturing capacity and doing more across the chain of custody from when the vaccine is produced to when it is injected into someone in the developing world biden harked back to the detroit area workers who 80 years ago built tanks and planes that helped defeat the threat of global fascism in world war ii they built what became known as the arsenal of democracy biden said now a new generation of american men and women working with today s latest technology is going to build a new arsenal to defeat the current enemy of world peace health and stability covid 19 he noted that pfizer s plant in kalamazoo michigan is not far from detroit last week the white house unveiled plans to donate an initial allotment of 25 million doses of surplus vaccine overseas mostly through the united nations backed covax program promising infusions for south and central america asia africa and others officials say a quarter of that excess will be kept in reserve for emergencies and for the u s to share directly with allies and partners including south korea taiwan and ukraine china and russia have shared with varying success their domestically produced vaccines with some needy countries often with hidden strings attached sullivan said biden does want to show rallying the rest of the world s democracies that democracies are the countries that can best deliver solutions for people everywhere the u s produced mrna vaccines have also proven to be more effective against both the original strain and more dangerous variants of covid 19 than the more conventional vaccines produced by china and russia some countries that have had success in deploying those conventional vaccines have nonetheless seen cases spike biden s decision to purchase the doses officials said was meant to keep them from getting locked up by richer nations that have the means to enter into purchasing agreements directly with manufacturers just last month the european commission signed an agreement to purchase as many as 1 8 billion pfizer doses in the next two years a significant share of the company s upcoming production though the bloc reserved the right to donate some of its doses to covax global public health groups have been aiming to use the g 7 meetings to press wealthier democracies to do more to share vaccines with the world biden s plans drew immediate praise tom hart acting ceo at the one campaign a nonprofit that seeks to end poverty said biden s announcement was the kind of bold leadership that is needed to end this global pandemic we urge other g 7 countries to follow the u s example and donate more doses to covax he added if there was ever a time for global ambition and action to end the pandemic it s now others have called on the u s to do even more charity is not going to win the war against the coronavirus said niko lusiani oxfam america s vaccine lead at the current rate of vaccinations it would take low income countries 57 years to reach the same level of protection as those in g 7 countries that s not only morally wrong it s self defeating given the risk posed by coronavirus mutations biden last month broke with european allies to endorse waiving intellectual property rules at the world trade organization to promote vaccine production and equity but many in his own administration acknowledge that the restrictions were not the driving cause of the global vaccine shortage which has more to do with limited manufacturing capacity and shortages of delicate raw materials
on today s installment of our government undoubtedly having their priorities perfectly in check newly minted attorney general merrick garland promised legislators that investigating the source of the alleged billionaire income tax data included in propublica s explosive report earlier this week stands firmly at the top of his agenda i promise you it will be at the top of my list the former supreme court nominee told sen susan collins during a wednesday senate appropriations committee budget hearing per cnbc although the shocking propublica article likely to be the first in a series details how billionaires including jeff bezos elon musk michael bloomberg and george soros allegedly used legal loopholes to pay next to nothing in personal income taxes garland is seemingly more concerned with how exactly the outlet obtained the data than why the ultra wealthy allegedly aren t paying their fair share senator i take this as seriously as you do i very well remember what president nixon did in the watergate period the creation of enemies lists and the punishment of people through reviewing their tax returns garland explained this is an extremely serious matter people are entitled obviously to great privacy with respect to their tax returns despite the ag s evident passion on maintaining the sanctity of the rich s tax returns it seems officials are already on the case namely irs commissioner charles rettig he said that their inspectors were working on it and i m sure that that means it will be referred to the justice department garland explained this was on my list of things to raise after i finished preparing for this hearing mr garland if you re reading this i know i may be a constant source of embarrassment for our mutual alma mater niles west high school but you re really giving me a run for my money with this nonsense advertisement the report which aims to dispel the long running myth that everyone pays their fair share and the richest americans pay the most claims that through a series of legal loopholes namely the fact that intangible assets like stock earnings and increases in property value are not taxable some of america s richest business people have been paying much less than what some say they should to uncle sam while propublica has stayed tight lipped on how exactly they obtained these documents illustrating this phenomenon which they claimed they received in raw form with no conditions or conclusions the information included seemingly passed a reportedly rigorous fact checking process in every instance we were able to check involving tax filings by more than 50 separate people the details provided to propublica matched the information from other sources they explained advertisement that said as tax information is usually meant to stay confidential the individuals who provided the documents to the news outlet could face criminal liability cnbc noted so remember folks evading taxes through legal loopholes right on leaking tax information allegedly depicting billionaires doing allegedly shady things shame on you for more internet nonsense follow carly on instagram huntressthompson_ on tiktok as huntressthompson_ and on twitter tennesanyone
does stability breed or hinder growth numerous papers have tackled various aspects of this question providing opposing answers and conflicting policy implications at the one extreme ramey and ramey 1995 show that in countries where long run gdp growth is less volatile it is also higher on average at the other extreme ranciere et al 2008 show that countries in which long run gdp growth is higher also tend to experience more frequent systemic crises they argue that both development and crises are driven by the same economic force risk taking and that policymakers who clamp down on the sources of instability will pay a price in terms of lower growth in recent research ampudia et al 2021 we contribute to this debate by studying the effect of one well defined stability relevant policy the introduction of centralised bank supervision in the euro area on one well defined growth mechanism corporate investment after the global crisis and sovereign debt crisis of the late 2000s and early 2010s respectively regulators introduced a number of reforms aimed at improving the resilience of european banks the centrepiece of this drive was the introduction of the single supervisory mechanism ssm following an asset quality review as well as stress tests together referred to as a comprehensive assessment a number of significant euro area banks became supervised by the mechanism while others remained under the supervision of their national authorities while previous research has shown that the shift to centralised supervision resulted in stability enhancing actions by the affected banks fiordelisi et al 2017 eber and minoiu 2017 altavilla et al 2020 our research shows the impact of this change in supervisory architecture on the real economy what do the theory and literature suggest on the one hand laffont and tirole 1993 argue that local supervision results in better monitoring of banks colliard 2020 argues that local supervisors might be better able to extract information from banks than a centralised supervisor carletti et al 2021 point to lower incentives for local supervisors to collect information if supervisory decisions are centralised if local supervisors provide more rigorous supervision than centralised supervisors we would expect firms whose lenders change to centralised supervision to increase their investment including into less collateralisable assets such as intangible capital on the other hand because bank supervision exhibits scale economies centralised supervision might be more effective eisenbach et al 2016 centralised supervision might also be better able to reduce the risk of banks arbitraging differences in regulatory stringency across countries dell ariccia and marquez 2006 and can increase supervisory independence rochet 2008 if centralised supervisors are more effective in holding in check banks risk taking banks under their supervision might tighten lending standards and increase collateral requirements with negative implications for investment especially in intangible assets which are less collateralisable the creation of the single supervisory mechanism as quasi natural experiment on 29 june 2012 the heads of government of all euro area countries announced the creation of a single supervisory mechanism underpinned by the necessity to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereign as first element of the so called banking union the ecb would exercise prudential supervision of all banks located in the euro area whether directly by the ecb s own supervisory arm for the significant institutions or indirectly by the national prudential supervisors but under the general guidance of the ecb for the less significant institutions as of 2020 the ecb directly supervises 117 significant institutions the actual supervisory activities are conducted by joint supervisory teams jsts involving both ecb and national supervisory staff an important step in preparing the ssm to become fully operational was the comprehensive assessment between november 2013 and october 2014 this process included an asset quality review and stress test as financial health check of 130 banks in the euro area covering approximately 82 of total bank assets the results were published on 26 october 2014 then on 4 november 2014 the mechanism was born we use the announcement of the ssm in 2012 and its introduction in 2014 as a quasi natural experiment to study the impact of a change in supervisory architecture on the performance of the real economy data we combine firm and bank level data to gauge the effect of the change in supervisory architecture on firm investment patterns our firm level data come from the orbis data set provided by bureau van dijk bvd with financial data for 2010 to 2017 we follow the downloading methodology and cleaning procedure described in kalemli ozcan et al 2019 in order to ensure the database is nationally representative and contains minimal missing information we also limit our sample to ten euro area countries with good coverage in orbis austria estonia france germany lithuania latvia luxembourg portugal slovenia and spain and drop firms in agriculture and mining sectors with high government ownership such as public administration and heavily regulated sectors such as finance in addition to financial statement information the orbis database provides for each company the name of the main bank the company conducts business with this allows us to identify whether a company is related to a bank which became directly supervised by the mechanism when it was established or whether it is related to a bank which is only indirectly supervised we end up with a sample of 188 600 firms that have a relationship with a total of 294 individual banks of these 179 are significant institutions and 115 are less significant institutions we also make use of monthly bank level information from the ecb s individual balance sheet statistics ibsi dataset for 247 individual financial institutions in 18 european countries comprising about 70 of the domestic banking sector we focus on euro area countries with at least one significant and one less significant institution included in dataset where the institutions in both groups are comparable in size this leaves us with 186 banks in 11 euro area countries austria belgium finland france germany greece ireland luxembourg malta netherlands and spain we have information on the stock of total lending as well as on the stock of lending to various classes of customers such as governments non financial corporations nfcs and households main findings we differentiate between the effect of the comprehensive assessment and the introduction of the single supervisory mechanism in a difference in differences set up comparing firms whose lenders came under new supervision mechanism with firms whose banks stayed under the national supervision across three time periods i before the announcement of the ssm 2010 2012 ii during the period of the comprehensive assessment 2013 2014 and iii after the introduction of the ssm 2015 2017 firms borrowing from banks supervised under the ssm experienced a significant reallocation across different types of investment relative to firms borrowing from banks that remained under the supervision of national authorities during the comprehensive assessment period 2013 2014 affected firms relatively increased their investment in current assets i e cash and reduced intangible assets during the period after the mechanism took over 2015 2017 affected firms relatively increased their investment in tangible assets and cash and reduced investment in intangible assets further these results are robust across a number of sensitivity analyses including a placebo test where we apply our empirical setting and estimation to european countries whose banks did not fall under the ssm from 2014 onward we focus on denmark hungary and the uk all of which have reasonable coverage in orbis and apply the ssm s criterion to the banks which the firms have a credit relationship with we do not find any significant differences in investment pattern across the two groups of firms before or after the start of the euro area s ssm we conclude that the main results in our paper are indeed driven by the transition to centralised supervision rather than by a global trend in investment reallocation by firms borrowing from large banks we also test for parallel trends before the announcement of the mechanism and the comprehensive assessment figure 1 shows no evidence of pre trends for any of the four types of assets this means that firms borrowing from significant institutions were investing at the same rate as firms borrowing from less significant institutions after 2012 however tangible assets and current assets increase and intangible assets decline for firms borrowing from significant institutions compared to firms borrowing from less significant institutions the decline in intangible investment is particularly pronounced in innovation intensive sectors especially during the early period of the mechanism as such industries are instrumental in contributing to productivity driven long term growth in modern knowledge based economies this points to a trade off between stability and growth we also find a significant decline in employment during the period of the comprehensive assessment as well as a significant increase in employment during the ssm mechanism period this suggests a strong complementarity between physical capital and employment but no such complementarity between employment and intangible capital we also find a reduction in labour productivity for affected firms after their banks moved to ssm supervision we also show that corporate lending by banks that came under supervision declined both during the transition period and after the implementation of the mechanism compared to corporate lending by banks not subject to ssm supervision we record the same effect with firm and bank level data in the latter case we also find that the decline in lending was larger for banks with relatively low capital before the announcement of the mechanism figure 1 ssm and firm assets over time significant vs less significant institutions note the figure uses annual data for the period 2010 to 2017 the graph plots period by period coefficients and 90 confidence intervals on yearly dummies interacted with a dummy equal to one for firms borrowing from sis the reference year is 2012 conclusions overall our results suggest that centralised bank supervision is associated with a decline in lending to firms which is accompanied by a shift away from intangible investment and towards more cash holdings and higher investment in easily collateralisable physical assets this is an instructive result in light of the fact that in the long run capital investment has a negligible contribution to economic growth while r d investment accounts for the bulk of long term growth fernald and jones 2014 the combination of the two effects we document therefore raises the possibility that centralised bank supervision can slow down the shift from the old capital based to the new knowledge based economy returning to the debate mentioned at the start these findings point to a trade off between stability and growth in this specific incidence references altavilla c m boucinha j l peydro and f smets 2020 banking supervision monetary policy and risk taking big data evidence from 15 credit

following my appointment as ceo of tyme i assembled a group of independent key opinion leaders and industry experts alongside our internal team and launched a comprehensive strategic review my goal was to take a fresh look at the key operating aspects of tyme our pipeline composition and clinical development strategy personnel needs financial management and existing data as a result of the review we believe tyme has expanded its addressable market opportunity offers stakeholders a more diversified clinical pipeline added critical experience to its leadership team is following a more data driven approach to clinical development and will continue to be fiscally vigilant stated richie cunningham chief executive officer of tyme as a result of the review process we announce the following clinical updates announcement of oasis breast cancer trial today we announce a breast cancer trial with georgetown university named oasis this is an investigator initiated prospective open label phase 2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of sm 88 for the treatment of metastatic hormone receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative hr her2 breast cancer after treatment with a cdk4 6 inhibitor this trial is a two stage trial initially enrolling 30 patients with expansion up to a total of 50 patients without standard background therapies the primary endpoint of this trial is recist tumor response collection of cell free dna from patients will also occur at several time points in their treatment the trial will be conducted at georgetown university along with several satellite sites that are part of the medstar medical system hr her2 is the largest subset of breast cancer in the united states representing approximately 73 of diagnoses in the u s we believe the migration of the fda approved cdk4 6 inhibitors to earlier lines of treatment for metastatic breast cancer patients has created an opportunity for effective and well tolerated oral therapies prior to patients advancing to receive various chemotherapy options in the initial studies of sm 88 there were encouraging tumor responses in the hr her2 patients including complete responses or complete resolution of their tumor the oasis trial is aimed to confirm this activity and possibly identify the next step in the development path in this setting for sm 88 focus on second line precision promise pancreatic cancer program we undertook a comprehensive review of the two ongoing trials evaluating sm 88 in pancreatic cancer precision promise the pancreatic cancer network sponsored trial which is evaluating sm 88 as a second line therapy and tyme 88 panc part 2 our clinical trial evaluating sm 88 as a third line therapy the enrollment rates for tyme 88 panc trial have progressed more slowly than the company initially anticipated due in large part to the covid 19 pandemic and our current projections for enrollment for these trials indicate that precision promise is likely to complete enrollment in a similar timeline to tyme 88 panc furthermore we identified higher than expected drop out rates in patients randomized to the chemotherapy control arm which could potentially impact the interpretive and regulatory utility of the data based on the comparable enrollment completion timelines the potential to reach a larger number of patients earlier in their disease in the second line precision promise trial potential impacts on data utility and expected resources needed for third line study success we made the decision to focus our resource allocation and development priorities toward second line treatments with the precision promise trial and portfolio diversification into breast cancer accordingly the company has decided to stop enrollment in tyme 88 panc and to begin the process of closing down the trial we would like to thank the physicians and especially the patients who participated with this study we believe that the market opportunities in hr her2 breast cancer second line pancreatic and soft tissue sarcomas are incredibly compelling and increase the total addressable market of the pipeline based on the data we have chosen to focus on these three categories first moreover we expect our data driven approach will allow us to better understand which target populations may most benefit from sm 88 we are excited about our new path forward and believe it will build more value for our stakeholders and improve the lives of people we endeavor to help concluded mr cunningham recently appointed members to the leadership

united nations ap a report issued thursday warns that over 350 000 people in ethiopia s tigray province are facing famine and over 2 million are just a step away blaming the dire situation on the ongoing conflict that has forced hundreds of thousands of people to flee limited humanitarian access and the loss of harvests and income the report said the 350 000 people represent the largest number of people facing famine since the 2011 famine in somalia it projects that between july and september the number of people facing famine will rise to over 400 000 the integrated food security phase classification known as the ipc which is a global partnership of 15 u n agencies and international humanitarian organizations prepared the report it uses five categories of food security from people who have enough to eat to those facing famine humanitarian catastrophe in that worst category now confronting more than 350 000 people in tigray at least 20 of households face a complete lack of food and starvation death and destitution are evident in addition acute malnutrition is evident in more than 30 of households and deaths from starvation exceed two people per 1 000 population every day the report says over 2 million tigrayans are just a step below in the humanitarian emergency category characterized by extreme gaps in food consumption acute malnutrition and excess mortality in at least 20 of households and more than 3 million tigrayans in the crisis category are just below that u n humanitarian chief mark lowcock told a virtual high level meeting on the humanitarian emergency in tigray organized by the u s and european union on thursday that there is famine now in the region and warning that this is going to get a lot worse but lowcock told representatives from the group of seven major industrialized nations and eu that the worst can still be avoided if action is taken to help tigray now he said it s crucial to prevent a re run of the 1984 famine in ethiopia which would have wide ranging and long lasting ramifications my message is don t go there lowcock said david beasley head of the u n world food program the world s largest humanitarian organization called the new data alarming and said the lack of data from western tigray in the analysis is deeply worrying forces from the neighboring amhara region have reportedly attacked civilians and taken control of areas in western tigray wfp has mounted an emergency operation and increased food distribution to reach 1 4 million people beasley said yet that is barely half of the number we should be reaching and other agencies are struggling as well countless people especially in rural areas can t be reached because armed groups are blocking access he said the largely agricultural tigray region of about 5 million people already had a food security problem amid a locust outbreak when prime minister abiy ahmed on nov 4 announced fighting between his forces and those of the defiant regional government tigray leaders dominated ethiopia for almost three decades but were sidelined after abiy introduced reforms that won him the nobel peace prize in 2019 no one knows how many thousands of civilians or combatants have been killed more than 50 000 have fled into neighboring sudan though abiy declared victory in late november ethiopia s military and allied fighters remain active including troops from neighboring eritrea a bitter enemy of the now fugitive officials who once led tigray despite claims by ethiopia and eritrea that they were leaving beasley said wfp teams report that in 53 villages they visited 50 percent of mothers and almost a quarter of children they ve been screening are malnourished and without food urgently many of them will die he said three things are needed to prevent hunger from claiming millions of lives in tigray a ceasefire unimpeded access for wfp and partners to all areas and the money to expand our operations to meet the growing numbers of people who desperately need emergency food assistance oxfam one of the partners echoed his appeal for an end to the violence unconditional and safe access to all areas for humanitarian workers and funds for the u n s 853 million appeal for northern ethiopia emily farr oxfam s emergency food security adviser said that after drought locusts losing their property cattle and food stocks the stresses now hitting local economies and livelihoods caused by the covid 19 pandemic are potentially the last straw for many in tigray u s ambassador linda thomas greenfield told the us eu meeting that the united states is the largest bilateral donor to ethiopia for the current humanitarian response which is woefully underfunded and urged additional funding we cannot make the same mistake twice she said referring to the 1984 famine we cannot let ethiopia starve we have to act now copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

two of three men charged with stealing tens of thousands of oysters from the pensacola bay oyster co in 2019 while ransacking the oyster farm have been sentenced to prison donnie mcmahon the oyster farmer who owns pensacola bay oyster co told the news journal that after a tough couple of years in addition to the theft he also lost about 600 000 oysters to a runaway skanska barge after hurricane sally last year he felt some relief over the sentences i went to both sentences and oh god yeah it felt good mcmahon said before adding i don t feel completely vindicated i ve never had anybody burn me like this before i felt sick when it happened like i was violated these were people who have no respect for another s hard work so their prosecutions it sends a good ol message three men nicholas mason douglas lowery and lonny teston were charged in late july 2019 for robbing the pensacola bay oyster co of between 30 000 and 40 000 oysters prosecutors dropped charges against a fourth suspect who was originally arrested in the case due to a lack of evidence last week mason and lowery both pleaded no contest to their charges in santa rosa county circuit court and were sentenced stolen oysters thieves take off with 17 000 oysters from pensacola bay oyster co s east bay lease how the case was cracked how officers cracked the case of 40 000 stolen oysters from pensacola bay oyster co lowery pleaded guilty to one count of dealing in stolen property by trafficking one count of criminal mischief and 10 counts of fwc violations that included destroying or trespassing on leased oyster beds possession of undersized oysters and injuring designations of natural oyster reefs or private bedded oyster reefs he was sentenced to three years in state prison followed by one year of probation additionally lowery was ordered to pay 1 110 in restitution after his release from prison according to the santa rosa county clerk s office mason pleaded no contest to three counts of dealing in stolen property by trafficking criminal mischief and 12 counts of fwc violations he was sentenced to four years in state prison followed by 10 years of probation mason will additionally be required to pay 22 090 in restitution upon his release from prison according to the santa rosa county clerk s office teston who has been charged with one count of dealing in stolen property by trafficking had pleaded not guilty and his case is still moving through the court system he is scheduled to appear in court july 6 for a docket day mcmahon said the fact that the florida fish and wildlife conservation commission investigated the theft and pushed for criminal charges sends a strong message this will send a real message to all the other oyster farmers there are a couple hundred of them around florida that this type thing will be investigated by the fwc he said the fwc will prosecute these type of guys theft had ripple effect on oyster farms throughout alabama and florida one of biggest impacts the theft had on mcmahon s business was the loss of his brew stock which is essentially a group of parent oysters the brew stock stolen from the pensacola bay oyster co consisted of a mix of two chromosome and four chromosome oysters that when bred produced baby oysters that mcmahon could sell not only to seafood distributors but also to other oyster farmers we not only spawn oysters for ourselves but for dozens of other farmers around the gulf we were holding the brew stock on the farm and they stole them mcmahon said so it interrupted my hatchery production for the year and it meant that all of these other people were affected too farmers in alabama and florida but while the loss of 40 000 oysters to thieves was bad mcmahon said it was nowhere near as detrimental to his business as what happened during hurricane sally when a skanska barge decimated the better part of the year s oyster crop one of the barges broke loose with one of the big cranes and it went up scenic highway and ran over the farm destroyed everything took the pilings out all the cages and sank them mcmahon said there were a bunch of cages up on scenic highway we had to pick up the barge destroyed several hundred cages and killed about 600 000 market sized oysters according to mcmahon those oysters would have sold for 65 to 70 cents apiece which means a low end estimate for the losses caused by the barge is about 390 000 i sat down after all that and thought well maybe i ll just close this thing mcmahon said but i thought about it and after about the first year i said to myself nah i m not going to do that i ve built a brand and we were selling these things all over atlanta birmingham nashville the oyster farmer said he hopes to have his business operating by next summer at the level that it was before the theft and before the hurricane we ve still got to fully restock and grow them out but we re going to put a million of them in this year and every one of them i can sell mcmahon said selling every single one of a million oysters while that might sound overly confident mcmahon insisted it s not because pensacola bay oysters always sell no matter what oysters have the unique taste of the particular region where they re grown and pensacola grown oysters are particularly creamy and sweet they don t have an aftertaste he said they re real smooth colin warren hicks can

over the last week we ve been outlining the absurdity of treasury secretary janet yellen s belief that higher inflation and higher interest rates would for the u s by quick way of review 1 secretary yellen believes that president biden s 4 trillion spending program would be good for the u s even if it contributes to higher inflation and results in higher interest rates 2 inflation is already roaring in the u s before president biden s 4 trillion spending program higher inflation would not be good at this point as americans are already experiencing rising costs living 3 higher interest rates would also be extremely problematic as the u s now has 28 trillion in public debt this massive debt load requires extremely low interest rates for the u s to avoid a debt crisis the last time interest rates spiked higher in 2018 the corporate debt market froze and the stock market collapsed 20 in a matter of days now yellen is one of the two most important and powerful figures in the financial world as such her views on this are of extreme significance for determining what policymakers will be doing going forward as far as the treasury is concerned inflation will be allowed to rage this leaves fed chair jerome powell as the only potential voice of sanity from a senior policymaker perspective and unfortunately for us powell is likely to prove just as delusional as treasury secretary yellen when it comes to issues of inflation the first sign of this came in 2018 when powell used his first jackson hole symposium to glorify former fed chair alan greenspan s economic insights and considerable fortitude in not raising interest rates back in the late 90s yes powell believed greenspan was a genius for not raising rates in the late 90s if you don t remember what stocks did at that time it looked like this considering this the below quote from powell s 2018 speech is quite revealing the fomc thus avoided the great inflation era mistake of overemphasizing imprecise estimates of the stars under chairman greenspan s leadership the committee converged on a risk management strategy that can be distilled into a simple request let s wait one more meeting if there are clearer signs of inflation we will commence tightening 13 meeting after meeting the committee held off on rate increases while believing that signs of rising inflation would soon appear and meeting after meeting inflation gradually declined source the federal reserve records in this context it is not surprising to see fed chair powell now arguing that inflation is transitory and should be ignored this is practically the exact policy he lionized in hits 2018 speech ignore inflation don t raise rates no matter how frothy the markets become and allow a massive stock bubble to form from powell s q a session in early may we suspect transitory factors may be at work powell said adding inflation should return to the fed s target over time and then be symmetric around its objective powell was commenting at a news briefing following the fed s two day meeting if we did see inflation running persistently below that is something the committee would be concerned about and something we would take into account when setting policy he said source cnbc so what does this mean that both the treasury secretary and the fed chair the two most important figures in finance believe inflation is not an issue or even worse is a good thing neither policymaker believes that they need to tighten monetary conditions if anything treasury secretary yellen believes the government should print and spend even more money we are primarily funded by readers please subscribe and donate to support us so inflation is going to rage and rage until this bubble bursts wiping out trillions in investor capital as i keep warning inflation is going to annihilate investor portfolios however those investors who are properly positioned for it will make literal fortunes on that note we just published a special investment report concerning five secret investments you can use to make inflation pay you as it rips through the financial system in the months ahead the report is titled survive the inflationary storm and it explains in very simply terms how to make inflation pay you we are making just 100 copies available to the public to pick up yours swing by phoenixcapitalmarketing com inflationstorm html best regards graham summers chief market strategist phoenix capital research

washington republicans in congress are alarmed by the leak of confidential irs data to the investigative news organization propublica enabling it to reveal that famous billionaires including warren buffett bill gates and mark zuckerberg paid little in u s income tax at times a senior irs official said thursday that a federal criminal investigation into the leak has been requested taking a detour from the debate over president biden s tax overhaul plan the republican lawmakers are demanding to know how the private tax data was disclosed and they are pressing the treasury department and the irs to pursue anyone who violated the law taxpayers must have the utmost confidence in federal institutions that house their personal and confidential information a group of republican senators said in letters demanding an investigation regrettably it appears personnel with access to americans personal and confidential information are misusing protected information for political reasons treasury and the irs must hold accountable any and all individuals who broke federal law by inappropriately sharing the confidential tax information and tax returns of multiple americans douglas o donnell a deputy irs commissioner said at a hearing by a house panel that the treasury department which oversees the irs has referred the matter for investigation to the fbi and the u s attorney s office in the district of columbia both getting access to and disclosing the confidential tax data are problems o donnell said we too want to know what happened urgently the law provides for potential criminal penalties for federal employees or other individuals who leak tax information advertisement the propublica report published tuesday on the wealthiest people in america was based on irs data long held as sacrosanct delivered by an anonymous source for democrats the revelations affirmed their long standing accusations that the irs gives big corporations and wealthy individuals a free pass while hounding lower income people democrats held up the new report as a prime exhibit in the national dialogue over the vast and widening inequality between the wealthiest and everyone else sen elizabeth warren d mass said in a tweet our tax system is rigged for billionaires who don t make their fortunes through income like working families do the evidence is abundantly clear it is time for a wealthtax in america to make the ultra rich finally pay their fair share the report showed that amazon founder jeff bezos paid no income tax in 2007 and 2011 tesla founder elon musk s income tax bill was zero in 2018 financier george soros went three straight years without paying federal income tax overall the richest 25 americans pay less in tax an average of 15 8 percent of adjusted gross income than many ordinary workers do once taxes for social security and medicare are included propublica found they all used perfectly legal tax strategies which is why the propublica report stoked the debate over the loopholes shelters and offshore havens available to the wealthy and giant corporations courtesy of the federal tax code the report intruded on the debate over biden s sweeping tax plan which must be approved by congress seeking revenue to finance his multitrillion dollar plan to boost infrastructure families education and job training biden is targeting the wealthy for higher taxes he wants to raise the top tax rate to 39 6 percent for people earning 400 000 a year or more in taxable income estimated to be fewer than 2 percent of u s households the top tax rate that workers pay on salaries and wages now is 37 percent advertisement biden proposes to nearly double the tax rate that high earning americans pay on profits from stocks and other investments inherited capital gains would no longer be tax free the plan also would raise taxes on corporations affecting wealthy investors who own corporate stocks as they raise the alarm on privacy of tax data republicans also are denouncing what they see as a related intrusion a new financial reporting proposal that is nestled in biden s tax plan aimed at helping the irs collect taxes it would call for u s banks to report to the agency most flows into and out of personal and business accounts including bank loans and investment accounts banks aren t wild about it either the aim is to give the irs a better view of underreported income by individuals and businesses according to the plan architects wealthier taxpayers earnings from investments and business activities would be reported to the irs the way wages and salaries are republican lawmakers see it as an assault on taxpayers privacy the requirement would bring a drastic increase in the amount of private sensitive information reported to the irs by financial institutions about deposits or withdrawals made by any individual or business in savings checking or other accounts of as little as 600 the senior republicans in tax policy sen mike crapo of idaho and rep kevin brady of texas told irs commissioner charles rettig in a letter taxpayers who are already concerned about having their local banks turned into monitoring and reporting agents of the irs now must also worry about whether data collected and reported to the agency are secure an array of trade groups representing big and small banks and credit unions have objected to the proposal saying their members already provide significant data to the irs and other regulators the proposal would impose cost and complexity that are not justified by the potential and highly uncertain benefits the groups said in a recent statement to a senate panel send questions comments to the editors previous next

illustration by forbes photo us federal government joe biden earned 17 3 million over the four years he was out of office but his net worth is only an estimated 8 million why isn t he richer o n the day america s first billionaire president took office middle class joe biden boarded the amtrak out of washington d c s union station bound for delaware with the kind of modest fortune you might expect from someone who had spent his adult life as an elected official 2 5 million mostly composed of pensions and real estate but biden was about to cash in by the end of 2017 he and his wife jill had earned 11 1 million they raked in 4 6 million the next year followed by 1 million in 2019 and 630 000 in 2020 the story of how biden became a wealthy man in the wake of his vice presidency leveraging his fame to sell books and deliver speeches has been told many times but a closer look at the math prompts a question that hasn t been asked why isn t biden even richer if someone starts with a 2 5 million net worth and earns 17 3 million while the markets are raging you d expect him to be worth more than 8 million so what happened to biden s money well 7 million of it covered taxes another 1 3 million went to charity 180 000 paid for household staff and an estimated 80 000 went toward interest on mortgages take those items out though and you re still a few million above biden s estimated net worth there s a chance that biden who shares his fortune with his wife jill gave some to other family members or perhaps he just spent it all in order to be worth 8 million as an analysis of biden s financial disclosure reports property records and career earnings suggest he is the president would have had to blow an average of roughly some 2 000 per day over the four years he was out of office the white house did not respond to multiple requests for comment about joe biden s money you can learn a lot about how a president might manage the country s finances by how they have handled their own donald trump may have come from a party that prides itself on fiscal conservatism but anyone with a cursory understanding of his financial history with huge debts financing lavish developments many of which failed could have told you at the outset that he wasn t the sort of guy who would be likely to watch the national budget carefully and he didn t deficits ballooned 68 even before the pandemic largely thanks to a massive tax cut that benefitted rich people and corporations biden s priorities are different he seems determined to give money to the middle class rather than the wealthy he has already passed a 1 9 trillion covid relief bill and just suggested a 6 trillion budget a detailed look at his personal finances suggest that he and trump have something in common however both are people who don t mind taking on debt and enjoy spending freely so don t be surprised if the national debt keeps soaring biden vs trump joe biden may be wealthy compared to the average american but his fortune still pales in comparison to his predecessor b iden s grandfather was an executive with american oil his father tried out a number of businesses but they all failed and the family fell on hard times he later landed a job as a car salesman nonetheless joe biden wasn t interested in a safe career path as a student at the university of delaware in the early 1960s asked his friends a question you guys could be guaranteed upon graduation a job at the dupont company with a nice starting salary and a job for life but you would never make more than 40 000 a year some 350 000 today or you could take a job at half the salary no guarantees but there would be no limit to the money you could make which would you take the answer was clear for biden he told his friends he would take the chance after graduating from law school biden bet on himself borrowing money from the bank that financed the cars his father sold to start his own firm in downtown wilmington delaware but he wasn t a big saver after the firm won its first big case biden received a 5 000 check he and his wife neilia a schoolteacher promptly spent it on a four poster bed a dining set and a desk the bill was substantial maybe more than the check but so was the furniture biden wrote in his 2007 memoir promises to keep this was our adventure and neilia was so sure of our future that future quickly included a small collection of real estate in the span of about six months biden acquired three houses including one on 80 acres of land in maryland where he had a grand dream to one day develop a family compound for his parents and siblings to swing it he borrowed some money from his father in law and more from banks while he and neilia found tenants and rented out the properties biden and his wife and young sons lived in a small house rent free in exchange for managing a nearby country club pool even after collecting rent money was still tight biden himself acknowledged in his memoir i was in constant danger of falling behind that didn t stop him from dreaming even bigger after a tragic car accident in 1972 that killed his wife neilia and baby daughter biden bought a new home for him and his boys paying 185 000 equivalent to 930 000 today for a 10 000 square foot dupont mansion in wilmington at the time he bought it biden s salary as a senator was around 43 000 a year over the years he refinanced the home frequently taking on mortgages in amounts far exceeding what he originally paid for the house biden sold it in 1996 for 1 2 million and bought land nearby for 350 000 he built a new house on the plot then proceeded to regularly refinance it as well biden put his three kids through private schools and college with the help of borrowed money home ownership is how most middle class families save how most middle class families build assets and for many it s the way you send your kid to college borrowing against it biden explained at a 2015 event for the department of housing and urban development that s how i got my children to college in 2001 when his daughter ashley was a student at tulane university he was on the hook for at least a half dozen loans totaling more than 700 000 inside joe biden s wallet biden has amassed an 8 million fortune thanks to a few lucrative years on the book and speaking circuit he now owns two houses worth more than 4 million together net debt and keeps at least 950 000 in cash accounts if you look at these moves from a business perspective they don t make much sense biden was stretching himself thin without saving or investing much money but if you look at them from a quality of life perspective they have a little more logic to them middle class joe wanted to live an upper class lifestyle enjoying big homes and sending his kids to pricey schools so he borrowed big what is very common in the united states today is most people even with large incomes are strapped for liquidity says megan gorman an attorney and managing partner at a financial planning firm for high net worth individuals who also serves as a forbes contributor when you look at the bidens tax returns what you see is a couple who over the course of their lives have accumulated things like pensions life insurance some savings and it s not some big calculated plan to be this ultra high net worth individual after biden became vice president he received some extra income to pay for his house in a trumpian move he rented out a cottage on his wilmington property for 26 400 a year reportedly leasing it to the u s secret service in charge of protecting him j ust because you re tight on cash doesn t mean you re broke when biden left office in 2017 he was worth an estimated 2 5 million he had a life insurance policy and a handful of retirement accounts but the majority of his net worth came from his delaware home and his federal pension which guaranteed him annual income of some 160 000 for life more liquidity came fast as joe and jill biden started writing books and delivering speeches the former vice president received a plum professor gig at university of pennsylvania with greater earnings came greater spending in 2017 the bidens paid 8 600 for household labor according to their tax returns by 2020 that number had ballooned to 95 250 a white house spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment about what sort of staff the bidens employed they handed out 1 3 million to more than two dozen charities including organizations like the united jewish federation of chicago and the beau biden foundation for the protection of children they also paid off one mortgage and two lines of credit following through on a longtime promise to his wife biden shelled out 2 7 million in june 2017 for a 4 800 square foot summer home in rehoboth beach delaware it turned out to be a decent investment the house is now worth an estimated 3 4 million up about 25 from what they paid four years ago thanks to surging home values during the pandemic but the bidens don t appear to have done much else to grow their fortune through investments while biden has made pledges to not invest in individual stocks as a way to avoid ethical conflicts in his job he has also shied away from investing even in diversified mutual funds holdings that ethics experts often recommend to avoid conflicts of interest a 2019 financial disclosure shows that the bidens had less than 200 000 in mutual funds held inside a variable annuity with the remainder of their fortune sitting in cash accounts state retirement accounts life insurance policies and holding companies for their writing and speaking endeavors by not participating much in the market they missed out on stock gains that could have added millions more to their fortune on biden s most recent financial disclosure report filed in may the president listed cash and retirement accounts worth somewhere between 1 2 million and 2 9 million if you just take his 17 3 million of earnings and subtract all 11 8 million of known expenses taxes charitable deductions housing costs and so on that would leave you with 5 5 million since biden s disclosure shows cash and retirement accounts worth 1 2 million to 2 9 million far less than the 5 5 million figure that suggests biden parted with at least 2 6 million elsewhere one possibility is gifts to his family federal tax laws allow couples to hand off 30 000 per year to anyone without having to report it if joe and jill biden gave the maximum to their two children hunter and ashley along with their grandchildren that could account for over 200 000 a year biden also could have made additional gifts to charities outside the u s which would not show up on his tax returns in 2018 for example the bidens donated 25 000 to a british charity tied to prince harry or maybe they just spent it all enjoying their money without thinking too strategically about it the bidens installed a new pool at their rehoboth house in 2017 local pool professionals suggested that could cost more than 75 000 in 2019 the washington post reported that the bidens were also renting a 5 bedroom mansion in mclean virginia for an estimated 20 000 a month even if the bidens keep spending freely they re not likely to run out of cash at any point they could spend 2 000 a day for the next eight years and still walk away from a potential second term with more than 2 million just like they did in 2017 once again they d be in position to deliver speeches and write books poised for yet another windfall related

proposed changes in capital gains taxes under the biden administration are worrying investors and their tax advisors especially the possibility of making them retroactive the treasury department released its green book containing the administration s fiscal year 2022 budget tax proposals last friday which would tax long term capital gains and qualified dividends of taxpayers with adjusted gross income of more than 1 million at ordinary income tax rates under the proposal 37 would generally be the highest individual tax rate or 40 8 including the net investment income tax but only if the taxpayer s income exceeded 1 million or 500 000 for taxpayers who are married filing separately indexed for inflation after 2022 the green book said the proposal would be effective for gains required to be recognized after the date of announcement however that announcement could be interpreted as the date when the american families plan was first announced on april 28 see story it s rare for a tax change of this magnitude to apply retroactively and the possibility will make it difficult for tax professionals to advise their clients on what to do more often retroactive tax provisions apply to items like tax extenders that are often assumed will be passed by congress eventually the mere announcement by the president of the desire for an earlier effective date may take off the table proposed transactions said bdo tax partner todd simmens a former legislation counsel for congress joint committee on taxation taxpayers may think if it really would be retroactive maybe we re going to pass on the transaction whatever that transaction is that s an issue because there may be those who were planning to sell or enter into a transaction and relying on the current law rates that may throw a monkey wrench into that thinking going backward i think the real trouble may be those who may have already started going down the road of a transaction or closed on it they may have reached an agreement and closed and a retroactive capital gains increase may directly impact the tax on that transaction the possible retroactivity may be a way of preventing taxpayers from front running their transactions as happened with some earlier tax reforms some of the capital gains stuff is hard to imagine said edward renn a partner on the private client and tax team at the international law firm withers who focuses on wealth preservation income maximization strategies and international tax planning it would really be a tax revolution maybe we do get an increased capital gains rate but i don t know that it s going to be as high as ordinary and top marginal income rates historically retroactive tax increases have been generally disfavored simmens noted i ve always been thinking in discussing biden tax policy assuming we have legislative activity this year we would be looking at an effective date of jan 1 2022 with some exceptions he said and capital gains because they target sales and exchanges each one of those policies may be appropriate for an exception however i do think the president was throwing out a marker letting people know ok you may not be able to get away until january you may not be able to plan around a capital gains increase over the next eight months it s going to come sooner but i m not sure that the end of april is the sooner instead of looking at the april 28 date of the american families plan he suggested the date may be the first committee action such as when the tax writing house ways and means committee first starts to mark up a bill that s sort of the official start of the legislative process so to me that might be a time said simmens while this first committee action hasn t happened yet if you ask me today we re probably looking at the fall but it won t blindside anybody i think that the notion of the end of april would blindside taxpayers who really were not trying to plan around the capital gains increase necessarily but who may have either been in the middle of a transaction they may have reached an agreement in the winter to close in the summer there s just uncertainty with what you do there do you look at a binding commitment or do you look at closing what do you look at for the activity that is subject to the effective date i think that the end of april would make enough key members of congress uncomfortable that some other date would be looked at another option he noted could be for transactions such as sales and exchanges or binding commitments for example to be after the date of enactment step up in basis a related issue of concern is an earlier proposal by the administration to eliminate the step up in basis on inherited assets from a decedent the green book clarifies a number of points allowing an exclusion of 1 million on capital gains indexed for inflation and also excluding transfers by a decedent to a u s spouse or charity the capital gain would not be recognized until the surviving spouse disposes of the asset or dies and appreciated property transferred to charity would not generate a taxable capital gain the proposal would exclude from recognition any gain on tangible personal property such as household furnishings and personal effects excluding collectibles according to the green book the 250 000 per person exclusion under current law for capital gain on a principal residence would apply to all residences and would be portable to the decedent s surviving spouse making the exclusion effectively 500 000 per couple finally the exclusion under current law for capital gain on certain small business stock would also apply in addition to the above exclusions the proposal would allow a 1 million per person exclusion from recognition of other unrealized capital gains on property transferred by gift or held at death the per person exclusion would be indexed for inflation after 2022 and would be portable to the decedent s surviving spouse under the same rules that apply to portability for estate and gift tax purposes making the exclusion effectively 2 million per married couple the recipient s basis in property received by reason of the decedent s death would be the property s fair market value at the decedent s death however the possible changes in the basis rules are still concerning to tax practitioners even with the treasury department s clarifications bloomberg news the other thing in terms of the loss of step up is a very big deal because very often given the complexity of the tax code with networks and partnerships and llcs even with some publicly traded securities from time to time you re not really sure what somebody s basis is said renn the one time you used to have absolute certainty about the value of what something was in terms of a basis number was after you got the estate tax return the presumption is if you can t prove the basis it s zero we re talking about assets that are not going to get stepped up anymore in the traditional sense how are we going to prove that basis when it s something that mom and dad owned for 40 or 50 years he noted that congress did pass a comparable change in the tax reform act of 1976 but found it was unworkable when they were discussing the repeal of carryover basis in the 1970s they actually passed it in the 1976 act and it floated around for three or four years and then it eventually got killed said renn the reason it got killed was it wasn t considered administratively workable nobody had the records i guess computers are better today than they were 40 or 50 years ago but i don t know that they re perfect he also objected to another proposal related to the treatment of trusts the one other thing really high in the bill is this idea of taxing any asset that s been in a trust for over 90 years said renn the idea is that any asset that you put into a trust and you didn t have a recognition event on that asset for 90 years they ll mark it to market in 2030 so anything you put in in 1940 or before you ll be taxed on the appreciation between the date of transfer and 2030 and i guess you ll pay it in 2031 for the 2030 year most clients don t hold assets for 90 years but it would seem to apply to closely held businesses vacation homes ranches art you don t hold onto your ibm for 90 years but you might hold onto a matisse opportunity zones changes in capital gains tax treatment could also affect investors in opportunity zone funds according to renn actually most of my clients yes if we get a 43 4 capital gain rate the opportunity zone will be attractive but my clients that invested in opportunity zones in 2018 2019 and 2020 they re saying hold it maybe i should pull the plug on this investment because in 2026 i ve got to pay capital gains at the rate that s effective at that time right now i d pay a 23 8 capital gain and in 2026 i m going to pay a 43 4 capital gain this project has to do a lot of good things for me to justify doubling my tax rate i actually think initially it will probably have a negative effect on qualified opportunity zones not a positive one he believes the proposed tax changes might favor small businesses the big winner is 1202 stocks small business stocks because they basically told you they re leaving that alone so if you can set up an enterprise and qualify as a 1202 small business stock the first 10 million of gain when you sell it won t be recognized said renn that s a big win the impact of the proposals on opportunity zones is unclear it could have an impact said simmens we have to see what the effective date looks like and who would be impacted and how they would be impacted potential changes in tax rates could actually encourage more opportunity zone investment depending on whether investors are in the program versus whether they re thinking of getting into the program that s going to impact how people react to the potential change in tax rates said jessica millett a partner at the law firm duval stachenfeld who chairs the tax practice group think about it from the perspective of someone say we re in 2022 and somebody sells commercial real estate and they have a capital gain let s assume that 1031s go away 1031 is no longer an option and the capital gains rates are higher maybe they re the same as ordinary income rates then all of a sudden investment into a qualified opportunity zone starts to look pretty good because you re now able to defer paying tax you re deferring a higher amount of tax if the capital gains rates have gone up and the 10 year benefit for an investment in a qualified opportunity fund just got bigger because you re now excluding more gain it s a bigger exclusion because you re completely avoiding a tax that would be higher at the capital gains rate opportunity zones could even help investors ride out the possible tax changes it depends a bit on what happens with the tax rates and what happens with 1031s said millett before the release of the green book if you eliminate 1031s and you eliminate the basis step up at death and the rates go up then opportunity zones become your bag of potential options to mitigate the tax consequences now if one of the benefits is going away at the end of 2021 if you invest in a qualified opportunity fund by dec 31 2021 you essentially get a complete forgiveness of 10 of the amount of gain that you initially invested in a qualified opportunity fund so when your deferral ends at the end of 2026 you only have to include 90 of that deferred capital gain in income so putting aside whatever may happen with the tax rate and whatever may happen with 1031s there s a built in benefit that s expiring at the end of this year and that s always been the case since opportunity zones were first created so the combination of that deferred 1031 deadline with these potential tax changes means that i m not going to be able to take a vacation in the summer still the potential changes in capital gains rates are likely to leave many investors worried for anybody who has previously invested in a qualified opportunity fund i think there is going to be a fair amount of grumbling and unhappiness if the capital gains tax rate goes up said millett let s say hypothetically somebody invested in a qualified opportunity fund last year in 2020 when the capital gains tax rate was down at 20 now when their deferral period ends in 2026 and they have to pay tax at that point they re paying tax at whatever the effective rate is in 2026 so they gave up the ability to pay tax at 20 and now they re going to have to pay double that in 2026 there s a calculus to be done taking into account the time value of money that they got for the deferral and potentially this 10 basis step up that they got lingering uncertainties there are plenty of other issues for tax professionals and their clients to contemplate in the geen book proposals but much remains to be worked out during negotiations between the administration and lawmakers over the legislation that may or may not get passed there s an awful lot of detail we don t have said renn we don t know what kind of charities get a carryover basis one set of charities for gift purposes and another set of charities for estate tax purposes we re not clear on the family investment exclusion what would that look like with the illiquid assets would you actually be able to pay taxes on them over 15 years it s not clear we don t have the details this is just a couple of lines without any detail it s not any different than any other proposal when it s being floated but i think before everybody is worried about mark to market on gift and mark to market on death there are lots of other options we may get carryover basis we may get a 28 capital gain rate we may get things that are seemingly far more middle road than some of the other proposals that are in this green book the green book provides lawmakers with a starting point for negotiation i m not saying there won t be an increase but there are some possibilities that might be negotiated such as effective date said simmens that may be one issue in capital gains that s negotiated one thing that the green book already has is that it would apply the amount of capital gains subject to the new rate to the extent income exceeds a million there s a sort of phased in approach but on the fence members may want a more phased in approach it gives you somewhat of an exemption for the first million and above that may be subject to the new rate some members may say instead of repealing the gains rate for higher income taxpayers maybe instead just add another rate such as 25 or 30 or something else that s negotiated i could see this happening in a conference committee some members are uncomfortable with just simply taking away the capital gains rate another sticking point in the negotiations is the 10 000 limit on state and local tax deductions in the tax cuts and jobs act of 2017 often referred to as the salt cap which democrats have long wanted to repeal i think there are enough democratic members in the house that want the salt deduction put back to what it was that could slow things down on the house side with only a five person majority said simmens on the senate side with an even split between democrats and republicans he sees much bigger hurdles with republicans uniformly opposed to any tax increases and sen joe manchin d west virginia coming out against using budget reconciliation to force through a bill he believes tax professionals should warn clients about the possible changes and uncertainty i think practitioners are doing what they should be doing said simmens at least bring to their clients attention what could happen but it s hard to advise it depends on what your client s scenario is each client has their own individual issues we can t predict with enough certainty to make any client comfortable and they all ask us what s going to happen when is it going to happen when is it going to be effective and we only have what s out there in the press and in the green book and that s it so far we tell our clients these are the things that are being talked about and are priorities of the administration when it comes to tax policy the effective date issue with capital gains is a bit of a monkey wrench because that date has passed so it s really hard to go back in time and fix that if you wanted to hedge your bets and think it s at the first first committee action you can tell your clients it s a gamble or you can be real conservative and say it s going to go up so take it into account he believes an individual income tax rate increase likely wouldn t come until jan 1 2022 if it even got passed by congress in the meantime tax professionals can pass along some traditional advice to clients if you made short term gains they would be subject to ordinary rates anyway said simmens you re not looking at the long term rates so to the extent you can accelerate that income appropriately into 2021 do it if you can push deductions into 2022 appropriately do it that s really the kind of advice we can give now where we are it s frustrating because i do think clients expect their advisors to have all the answers
