the california department of public health updated its covid 19 protocols and one the lompoc unified school district also did the same so we have close contact testing that comes around to every school site that has a positive test and they do the pcr tests in addition we re incredibly grateful that the state has provided us with at home rapid tests said bree valle deputy superintendent of lompoc unified the district will do group contact tracing instead of individual saying it makes it easier on the staff as you can imagine trying to identify any person who has had contact within six feet more than 15 minutes of an individual student over the course of a school day can be quite challenging valla said groups like athletic teams will be notified and given the opportunity to test valla says tests results have been taking two to three days if someone has symptoms they re sent home to quarantine if they do not they are tested twice within the 10 day period so a student who does test positive can then request or through their parents most likely request an at home rapid test and then they would take that test at day seven after testing positive which would then allow them to come back to school valla said lompoc unified does have n95 masks available to both students and staff who want them the district just received a new shipment from united way and plans on keeping a stock if an unvaccinated student is exposed to someone who tests positive they can come back to school day eight after exposure with a negative test that was done no sooner than day five after exposure they also have to be symptom free if a teacher has symptoms and is vaccinated they still have to stay away from work pending test results

there has been lots of breathless commentary in the financial press and the blogosphere over the sec s august 2021 filing of an insider trading case involving so called shadow trading shadow trading as defined in a 2020 academic paper occurs when someone possessing material nonpublic information mnpi obtained from his or her employer uses it to trade in the securities of a competitor or economically linked public company this is in contrast to the more usual insider trading in which the stock being traded is that of the subject company in panuwat the defendant is charged with misappropriating mnpi from his employer and using it to trade in a competitor s securities earlier this week a district court in the northern district of california denied a motion to dismiss the sec s complaint allowing the enforcement action to proceed according to the complaint the defendant matthew panuwat learned of an impending merger involving the company he worked for a mid sized oncology focused biopharmaceutical company within minutes he bought short term out of the money stock options in another mid sized oncology focused biopharmaceutical that investment bankers had identified as a competitor the defendant allegedly deduced that the announcement of the buy out of his employer would lead to a rise in the price not only of his employer s stock but that of its competitor commentators have universally labeled this case the first shadow trading enforcement action following the 2020 academic paper but is it truly unprecedented not exactly in fact a prior case that involved mnpi misappropriated from an employer and used to trade other companies securities went to a jury trial and resulted in liability for the trader in 2015 the sec charged bonan huang an ex capital one data analyst with insider trading in the securities of various retailers the analyst who investigated fraud for the credit card company used credit card sales information obtained in his job to project and predict overall sales numbers for the companies he then transacted securities in those other companies to reap enormous insider trading profits the case went to trial and the sec prevailed huang was found liable for insider trading and ordered to pay 13 5 million in disgorgement and civil penalties based on this prior case it not particularly helpful to label panuwat as advancing a groundbreaking first of its kind theory to be sure the two cases are not identical in the earlier case the defendant huang did not trade in the stock of competitors or economically linked companies that is factually true but legally insignificant panuwat allegedly traded another company s stock based on his company s impending merger while huang used his company s information about other companies to project those companies earnings and obtain illicit insider trading proceeds what difference does this factual distinction make from a legal standpoint none in both cases the defendant faced charges that he misappropriated mnpi from his employer and used it to trade in other companies securities the teaching of both cases is clear don t misappropriate mnpi from your employer and use it to trade in any securities those of your employer a competitor or some other company mihir n mehta et al shadow trading the accounting review sept 6 2020 available at see sec litigation release sec charges biopharmaceutical company employee with insider trading aug 17 2021 available at see jody godoy sec s shadow trading case can move forward judge rules reuters jan 18 2022 available at see sec litigation release sec obtains final judgment against former capital one employee for insider trading feb 26 2016 available at

u s markets are selling off as 2022 faces headwinds but the widespread downturn has pushed many tech stocks down too far stretched valuations coupled with rising interest rates have landed a one two punch on technology stocks to start the year after a long stretch of technology stock outperformance these two factors have sent the popular sector into a downward spiral the technology select sector spdr fund xlk is down 11 8 since its peak hit on jan 3 the fear of rising interest rates that triggered a plunge in technology stocks may be slowing just as several companies now look undervalued growth stocks have sold off across the board thus far this year as the markets contend with a new set of dynamics in our 2022 u s equity market outlook we noted that the tailwinds that had helped propel stocks higher last year have switched direction and are now headwinds to further growth in addition we cautioned investors that according to a composite of the stocks under our coverage we calculated that the markets were overvalued coming into the year in particular we identified that across our sector coverage the technology sector was one of the most overvalued sectors over the past few weeks stocks have sold off as investors incorporate the following dynamics into their projections slowing economic growth rate in the united states tightening monetary policy from the federal reserve rising inflation rate rising interest rates the bulk of the sell off has been a combination of pricing in slowing economic growth and rising interest rates growth and many technology stocks have been hit especially hard because of the long duration of their earnings a significant part of the value of technology stocks is their future earnings profile and as investors lower their growth expectations and or discount those future earnings at a higher rate the present value for these stocks falls further and faster than the broader market in addition market sentiment has turned negative on growth stocks especially after netflix nflx fell off a cliff dropping over 20 in one day following its earnings release last week following sell off here are tech stocks we find undervalued now the stocks we would highlight for investors today are those high quality companies that we rate with a morningstar economic moat rating of wide or those with long term competitive advantages in addition we are currently focusing on those that have strong pricing power and are able to pass along their own cost increases to customers in order to maintain their own margins in this market environment we prefer those companies with both stable cash flows and good near term visibility into their earnings for this year yet still have good prospects for long term growth and large tangible addressable markets a few of the more undervalued technology stocks that fit the profile in this market environment include we also see value in technology stocks that are leveraged to continued economic normalization in the u s for example as consumer behavior reverts back toward prepandemic habits we highlight in addition many stocks that fit the definition of disruptive technology have fallen to levels that we think are appealing for long term investors while many of these stocks were significantly overvalued a year ago and rated with 1 or 2 stars after dropping 50 plus a number of them have fallen to levels that we think are now undervalued examples include however investors must still avoid those technology stocks that are pricing in too much growth for too far into the future even after this sell off these are a few of the stocks that we consider to be significantly overvalued it s not as bad as the headlines proclaim yet while the markets have been brutalized during the past few trading sessions the outlook is not as dire as the market action portends even with the growth rate slowing we are forecasting real u s economic gross domestic product growth of 3 9 this year and 3 5 in 2023 similarly while inflation is running hot and will remain elevated for the next few months we project it will begin to moderate in the second half of this year and continue to decline in 2023 finally as interest rates are set to increase it should be remembered that they are coming off levels that were not that far from historical lows as proponents of a long term investing strategy we do not try to time the market but look to identify undervalued opportunities for investors where the markets are not properly discounting the long term value of a company following the widespread sell off thus far this year we see a number of stocks within the technology sector that have been pushed down too far during this market rout and provide good opportunities for investors today editor s note this version of the article has been corrected with new undervalued technology stocks and technology stocks to avoid tables

media bias browse the media research center s notable quotables with compilations of the latest outrageous sometimes humorous quotes in the liberal media december 26 2022 no liberal media scream this week december 19 2022 liberal media scream martha raddatz lets biden off on border crisis washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features a bizarre line of thinking about the historic border crisis from abc s martha raddatz a trusted media voice who wants to shift the blame to republicans hosting sunday s this week raddatz suggested that since president joe biden never explicitly said that the border is open then he s not to blame for the crisis despite months of signaling that the former trump administration s border closings were being lifted interviewing texas gov greg abbott raddatz said i don t think i ve ever heard president biden say we have an open border come on over but people i have heard say it are you are former president trump are ron desantis that message reverberates in mexico and beyond she doubled down on the impact of republicans acknowledging the reality of the open border smugglers use all those kinds of statements from sunday s this week raddatz you talk about the border wall you talk about open borders i don t think i ve ever heard president biden say we have an open border come on over but people i have heard say it are you are former president trump are ron desantis that message reverberates in mexico and beyond so they do get the message that it is an open border and smugglers use all those kinds of statements abbott it was known from the time that joe biden got elected that joe biden supported open borders it is known by the cartels who have sophisticated information whether or not the biden administration is going to enforce the immigration laws or not is known across the world but most importantly known among the cartels raddatz and how do you play into that what can you do better abbott so we have every level of government doing everything we can to prevent people from coming into the country illegally or repelling them or arresting them and putting them behind bars brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick how ludicrous a line of reasoning president biden s open border policies speak louder than any words he may not have explicitly said and since when does denouncing a policy mean you are advocating for that reality by that reasoning journalists like raddatz were promoting trump policies every time they denounced them rating four out of five screams december 12 liberal media scream msnbc and beschloss democracy wins only if democrats do washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features presidential historian and msnbc regular michael beschloss with the latest spin that only democrats are good and all republicans are bad talking about the georgia victory of sen raphael warnock he even took it a step further the victory secured democracy for another minute this was a really good week for our democracy msnbc s resident presidential historian declared on friday s the 11th hour with stephanie ruhle citing warnock s win in georgia and how donald trump has continued to implode he suggested the gop is on its deathbed for nominating herschel walker in the race at the suggestion of former president donald trump pointing to trump he said if the republicans continue to beat this horse of donald trump and stick to him which they may have to because of presidential primaries the republicans themselves may die too beschloss on friday s the 11th hour on msnbc with substitute host alicia menendez alicia i think this was a really good week for our democracy i have been enjoying almost every minute and i hope that all of our friends watching feel the same way you know beginning with rev warnock you know this is he s been elected to a six year term in georgia martin luther king s church pastor in atlanta well 1960 martin luther king was locked up in a georgia prison that was so dangerous that coretta scott king thought there was a danger that he would be killed in prison look how far things have come this is a week in which donald trump has continued to implode you know let s think about what might have happened this week had the republicans won in those battleground states those election denying candidates they might have losers might have said we really won we should be installed there should be violence in the streets almost none of that happened you know the fact that we are living in a peaceful country that really this last month has resembled the way things used to be in this country in terms of democracy i think we have to pause and enjoy and the other thing is when you are thinking about donald trump and the republican party look at history when parties do not adapt to public opinion they die that happened to the federalists in 1816 war of 1812 they remain the pro british party happened to the whigs they did not adapt to changing views on slavery and if the republicans continue to beat this horse of donald trump and stick to him which they may have to because of presidential primaries the republicans themselves may die too brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our

times was akin to pizzagate or birther charges against former president barack obama well that s exactly what the gray lady did in a video bragging about how smart she thought she was flashback see

idea that the republican party in 2022 would put forth a candidate who among other things is also a black man to kind of usher in more voter repression and more of what the republican party stands for is cynical the thing that makes it though really disturbing to me is just the overall message to voters black and white that one black man is just as good as another one black man is the same as any black man so it doesn t matter if you re barack obama it doesn t matter if you re raphael warnock it doesn t matter if you re herschel walker they re all the same you re all the same and voters should see you that way and it s also just an insult to black americans but to all voters mika brzezinski that s the i mean sort of racist aspect of this is truly insulting brent baker vice president of

sunday s meet the press with biden his challenge is that he hasn t been able to communicate to the american people what he s done she said citing student loan payoffs and his focus on manufacturing she went on to suggest that biden is a policy president and that is a harder sell than former president donald trump s communications about undermining elections though he arrived in washington with a long list of policy initiatives that he acted on including reducing regulations limiting illegal immigration and establishing a basis for middle east peace kumar on sunday s meet the press with biden his challenge is that he hasn t been able to communicate to the american people what he s done i mean we can say that the difference between donald trump and the difference within biden is biden is a policy president so he s going to make fundamental changes for a generation and we re talking about student loan relief we re talking about bringing back manufacturing and the list goes on but the difference with trump is that his consequence is not policy it s his legacy of undermining elections and it s not just him it s not him but he actually has a cadre of individuals right now seeking

caused them any more trauma or agony no one i mean i think everyone understands that the president unfortunately uniquely understands how the family is feeling and i m sure he made that very clear to them when he came to the white house on friday just acknowledge he had a slip of the tongue move on it s unfortunate again life is here he understands and empathizes i think that s what s most

some of them are democrats some are independents and they ve all said the same answer they all think he s too old to run again yamiche alcindor well the key issue will be whether or not them thinking

not sure if i want to back him when they think about the state of our democracy they re like that s the bigger issue here in our nbc poll we saw people say the threats to democracy are their no 1

thinking they use the words unrecognizable distrust and that there should be some compromise those are words that i think are probably worse for republicans especially when you think of while we might have a minority of republicans who don t believe that 2020 was fair they re the people with the loudest voices right they re the people who are still winning the elections that s where the candidates

democracy is true now that s something that s not easy for us as journalists to say we re brought up to believe there s two different political parties with different points of view and we don t take

right now we re going to focus on the 2022 election we want to retake the house we definitely want to retake the united states senate and i think in doing that our goal is to focus on what s going on right now with the american people we re going to focus on the fact that inflation is still over 8 5 we re still talking about gdp which has been going down and as you know sharing breakfast with the chair the former chairman of the federal reserve anytime you got two quarters in a row you are in a recession we want to see us get out of that recession and we certainly want to see gas prices come

party that can stem this continued rise of fascism register and vote work toward an overwhelming majority that can protect your body protect your freedoms and just may save our country she said in a speech that the show aired twice mika brzezinski on monday s morning joe on msnbc i ve been hearing from women all over the country and even around the world this is devastating and you know they asked me what we can do and i ve got two words please vote it was winston churchill who said that democracy is the worst form of government except for all the others that have been tried and the same might be said of the democratic party at this point democrats somehow managed to get the most votes and lose the most elections so they need more even when they win they lose it could be argued that today s democrats are too weak too fragile too woke too elitist too disconnected from the realities of working americans and yet the democratic party is the world s last best hope against fascism against an extreme autocratic anti woman anti gay anti contraception anti freedom collection of fascists who dominate the trump wing of today s republican party a group of fascists who even refuse to investigate the violent riots that their president launched on january 6 to overthrow a legitimately elected president why because they are fascists and now they re claiming control over your bodies your health your life and they ve promised they re coming next to take away your birth control pills and even what you do with another consenting adult in the privacy of your bedroom to call trump s republican party and trump s supreme court extreme understates the danger these institutions pose to american freedom to our democracy they are fascists who have contempt for what 70 of americans believe about roe v wade what 90 of americans believe about universal background checks and what you believe about your right to control your own body and your life so what does donald trump s america look like joe sort of described it there in reality it looks like a 13 year old rape and incest victim being ordered by the state to have a forced birth of her rapist s baby that s where we are in

reelection it s not just sean hannity talking about biden s age it s the atlantic magazine harwood that s right it was an outstanding piece by mark without taking a stand on whether he s too old to run for reelection let me just run through what s true what s false and what gets conflated what s true is the presidency is a hugely taxing job mentally and physically and joe biden is old he doesn t talk or walk as smoothly as he once did that suggests challenges when you get into your 80s which he s about to do the risk of health problems grows with every year on the other hand what s false is that he is not capable of doing the job right now or he s not mentally in tune with the demands of the job anybody any aide who engages with him or reporters we can see this the gears of his mind are working that s an issue pushed by right wing media but it s not correct and what gets conflated is this president biden is in a weak political position right now and because he s old people think he s weak because he s old his biggest political problem right now is 5 a gallon gas gas is not 5 a gallon because joe biden s old his legislative program is not stymied in congress because joe biden is

control on monday s morning joe scarborough went on a rant denouncing desantis for punishing a public enterprise because of their political views he added of the likely 2024 gop primary candidate it s just craziness this is not conservative this is authoritarian it s plain and simple and conservatives know that scarborough a onetime florida house member on monday s morning joe on msnbc setting up guest dave aronberg the state attorney for palm beach county florida if it were just about the sports stadiums he could have vetoed it and said i don t support giving money to sports stadiums or sports outfits when of course marc just pointed out he does for ones he prefers but again there is an authoritarian streak here if you tweet something that a governor doesn t like he will veto your spending and he will tell you that s why he vetoed the spending he could have just vetoed it and said i don t like sports stadiums and leave it there but no he wanted people to know he s punishing a public enterprise because of their political views with taxpayer money same thing again i talked about it before with disney talked about with cruise lines that wanted at the height of covid to keep their people safe to have them wear masks which any doctor sane doctor would have said this makes sense told them they couldn t do that told small businesses they couldn t have mask mandates if that s how they wanted to run their small business told school boards what they could or couldn t do despite the fact there s 67 counties in the huge state of florida i mean it s just craziness this is not

genetically disappearing right he said data of mothers who report having abortions however show that more black people than white 38 33 opt for the procedure but that doesn t fit the left s posture that the hot button issue boils down to racism not religion or fostering life when you tie it all together white replacement theory anti crt argument the insistence that abortion be banned and that white babies in particular be born this is all of a larger piece and that larger piece is the fear of whiteness disappearing in the face of a worldwide global expansion of people of color said dyson vanderbilt university s centennial chairman and university distinguished professor of african american and diaspora studies dyson on the may 18 cnn tonight hosted by laura coates so as odd and as exceptional as the white replacement theory looks there s a newfangled twist to it here the explicit expression that we are fearful of genetically disappearing right we know that in what 20 some odd years white people will no longer be the statistical majority in this country and when you tie it all together white replacement theory anti crt argument the insistence that abortion be banned and that white babies in particular be born this is all of a larger piece and that larger piece is the fear of whiteness disappearing in the face of a worldwide global expansion of people of color and right here in this nation we will not be replaced by jews by blacks by latinos and others that s part of the tragedy that has to constantly be dealt with and seen as a throughline from white supremacy

newly created position at planned parenthood senior director of news content on sunday denied her abortion activism came through in her reporting on cnn s reliable sources she insisted we have standards we have lawyers before anything goes on air there s a thorough review of what s going on showing her hostility to her critics she said i think these people just don t understand how newsrooms actually work they don t have that kind of experience from sunday s reliable sources on cnn brian stelter last year though national review the conservative outlet called you two years ago planned parenthood s ambassador to cbs they said you were posing as a reporter and constructing articles that more closely resemble press releases than news so that was the charge when you were at cbs and now you re at planned parenthood how do you react to the conservatives who said you were biased in your cbs coverage kate smith planned parenthood look if you re a blogger online you might not realize all of the different layers that someone goes through before they publish a piece before they go on air we have standards we have lawyers before anything goes on air there s been a thorough review of what s going on so i stand by every article i write and i would say making that accusation you re playing into the right anybody who doesn t fall by their rules who isn t anti abortion is against them so if you re trying to cover this from a neutral point of view and you re including both sides they automatically think you are against them because they view doctors as anti or excuse me for abortion and they view them as biased even though these are doctors we re talking about so i really reject all that criticism again i think these people just don t understand how newsrooms actually work they don t have that kind of experience but yeah completely reject that criticism brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our

little effort our own media critic brent baker of the media research center asked a question posed all weekend by those worried about the new board what if former president donald trump had proposed a truth department like the one headed by homeland security secretary alejandro mayorkas from cnn s reliable sources on sunday may 1 brian stelter here in the u s there s been an uproar in recent days about the department of homeland security setting up what they call a disinformation governance board this has been mostly a foxworld story it did come up earlier today on cnn s state of the union but i don t think people know what it is and what it isn t and there s just been a lot of right wing uproar without knowing what it is so are you aware of this at all what is this all about moira whelan national democratic institute aware of it and i think the first thing is that it s a board exactly as we say it is meant to bring together people to coordinate a lot of the efforts inside of dhs that means law enforcement that means emergency services like fema they ve all been doing counter disinformation efforts for a while to give us accurate information about human rights abuses but also about disasters and where people can get assistance so coordinating that activity and making it speak with one voice and being a stronger advocate to tech companies and engaging the public and academia that s really what they re after stelter well that sounds like common sense but when i google this all i see is like joe biden s ministry of truth and they re going to you know like it s there s this

desantis and virginia gov glenn youngkin to block explicit sex talk in kindergarten are based on the same motivations of russians who are raping children in ukraine the host said that by framing their actions as on behalf of parental rights the two are hiding how they are really dehumanizing the lgbt community dehumanization is a tactic that s being used right now russians get their soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them dehumanization as a practice is a tactic of war it s being deployed in our politics and people like you and i sometimes lose the plot and admire its effectiveness she said from wednesday s april 20 show during a segment with guest tim miller of the bulwark nicolle wallace you and even i fall into a tradition of or profession of focusing on what works and i think we recently had a conversation about mitch mcconnell and why does he do what he does because it works it s the political reality and i worry that in covering glenn youngkin and his politics of parental choice all the focus was on how well it worked and even in our conversations about desantis it s about how well they re serving him the truth is dehumanization as a tactic for politics is from war dehumanization is a tactic it s being used right now russians get their soldiers to rape children by dehumanizing them dehumanization as a practice is a tactic of war it s being deployed in our politics and people like you and i sometimes lose the plot and admire its effectiveness it s not acceptance but even the analysis of these tactics loses sight of what this speech brings us back to which is that dehumanization has a cost right now right now as it s being deployed there are children and chasten buttigieg made this point when don t ask don t tell was introduced kids will die how do we bring it back to the substance of the harm that is done by any strategy in war and politics of dehumanizing people brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research

abc george stephanopoulos when it comes to inflation there s not much the president can do about it maria elena salinas abc news contributor there s not much that he can do about it but at the same time people s perception and that s what s important they look at the numbers and it doesn t matter that we have low unemployment it doesn t matter that the gas prices are beginning to go down a little bit the perception is things are more expensive and when i go to the market everything is more expensive even if it does start to get a little bit better that s the feeling that people have and that s what motivates people to go out and vote sometimes not necessarily fact but the perception what they re feeling stephanopoulos is this a wedge issue that cuts against democrats salinas i think it definitely does now that you mentioned title 42 what comes to mind to me is that it really depends on who s talking of course republicans are going to say president biden is opening up the border but then critics are going to say it s too little too late why didn t he do this before remember this is a health initiative it s not an immigration policy that was implemented so if the cdc is already allowing kids to go back to school people going back to baseball games and football games why do they continue to have this at the border when they forced these people to put up these camps when the stay in mexico policy why are they not allowing them in before so you re between a rock and a hard place it s really difficult for the administration it s like you re damned if you do and you

i can tell you right now any democrat running statewide in 2022 that has 73 of the black vote has lost full stop there is no path to victory mckinnon wow woodbury i think that we have to put donald trump back on the ballot when you talk to voters this idea that if we don t vote it could lend to a shift in partisan power in congress not motivating to them to all but when we later asked what if i told you if republicans win the house then donald trump will be president in 2024 every single hand went up mckinnon oh really interesting woodbury every single hand now that right there we can t let that happen mckinnon interesting patrick gaspard i m only suggesting that in addition to the affirmative message that we have about successes you ve got to be clear they only win by punching hard you

no liberal media scream this week new on march 28 liberal media scream gop can t quiz a black judge without being dubbed racist washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features an extreme example of the media s portrayal last week of all gop questions to supreme court nominee ketanji brown jackson as racist on tv show after tv show and in liberal newspapers gop senators were called racists if they didn t offer praise for the historic nominee a ridiculous standard especially for a pick with a rookie appeals court record and who wouldn t even define what a woman is but some went further charging that republicans simply don t want black judges on the court which might come as a surprise to senior associate justice clarence thomas the lone black judge on the court and a conservative he was chosen by former president george h w bush who rejected questions that he picked thomas only because of his race as you can see in the above c span clip subsequent democratic presidents bill clinton and barack obama didn t name a black judge to the highest court on real time with bill maher host bill maher actually said of republicans i think they would be thrilled to have no black seats on the court guest john heilemann national affairs analyst for nbc news and msnbc agreed calling the gop questions racist top to bottom through the whole week from friday s real time bill maher we have the first black woman let s go back some of the people who don t remember this also the first black we ve ever had we ve only had two thurgood marshall 1967 when he died it was george bush was president and so they accepted the idea there was now a black seat on the court and that s how we got clarence thomas now i thought it was not exactly cricket to give the black seat to someone who didn t represent the majority of black thinking in america but here s the difference at least they accepted george bush did the idea of at least one black seat on the court right i think today s republicans would not do that i think they would be thrilled to have no black seats on the court ok a lot of them ok so john heilemann judging by the way they treated this nominee which was racist top to bottom through the whole week brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick the casualness with which these two leading media figures accuse an entire political party of virulent racism is in itself astounding confusing a preference for conservative over liberal policies for racism all republicans i know would be

washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features how the left has a simple word to hit critics of president joe biden s first supreme court pick ketanji brown jackson racist on sunday s media panels and last friday s the view on abc liberals declared the rookie federal appeals court judge so qualified that she is perfect thus questioning her can only be racist they said we re featuring the view here and criticism of the first black woman nominated to the high court by republicans such as sen josh hawley co star whoopie goldberg called jackson outstanding and better than the three white judges former president donald trump nominated guest host eboni williams went straight to racism when she said you know what bus is always on time the one that indicts the determinations of the qualifications of black women in this country and so that bus is never late goldberg agreed that s what s scary to them and it s like if you say you want the brightest the greatest that we have she s a perfect representation of that from friday s the view on abc whoopi goldberg just based on the people the last three people they put in you know this is a woman who can who can outshine each and every one of those people eboni williams very literally goldberg her abilities are outstanding i mean she s outstanding so you put in amy coney barrett you put in the other one you know and you re questioning her williams but whoopi let s not pretend we don t know what this is about you know what bus is always on time the one that indicts the determinations of the qualifications of black women in this country and so that bus is never late goldberg it s never late williams it s never late and i want to say this based off the fact that this will be one of the only supreme court justices to your point of that example of the last three we got who will be confirmed by bipartisan nature i m sorry already has been at the appellate level by the united states senate she s overqualified let me go on record in saying that she s overqualified goldberg that s what s scary to them and it s like if you say you want the brightest the greatest that we have she s a perfect representation of that williams yes brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick how tired of an argument instead of addressing the substance of the criticism or simply accepting that some will have a less upbeat interpretation of a nominee s judicial record goldberg and williams jump directly to dismissing the

says trump would have killed nato by now washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features the latest reason why a trump derangement syndrome vaccine for the press should be developed and its use mandated during a meet the press panel focused on the war in ukraine the discussion turned to former president donald trump and the tussle over what he would have done compared to what president joe biden has done new york times pentagon correspondent helene cooper cut to the chase offering to game out trump s move which she said would have been the destruction of nato in two weeks nato at this point would have been completely divided you would see disunity you would see other nato countries peeling off what are we going to do the alliance would be broken she said on the nbc show during his presidency trump demanded that nato allies start paying their fair share of expenses and stop relying on the united states to supply the bulk of money and troops in his game of hardball he also cut troops in germany sending some home and redistributing others we don t want to be the suckers anymore trump said we re reducing the force because they re not paying their bills it s very simple but the times reporter said that was a preview of his plans to kill nato which she then said pentagon generals held off until the election for biden to stop former trump national security adviser turned critic john bolton has also claimed the former president would have pulled the u s out of nato from the march 13 meet the press roundtable new york times pentagon correspondent helene cooper i would love to just game out where we would be right now if donald trump was still president and vladimir putin had invaded ukraine first of all trump who would already have pulled us out of nato because that s what he wanted to do he had already started pulling american troops out of europe the pentagon had kind of stalled that until biden came into office the first thing he would have said is it s not our problem ukraine is not our problem that s it go off and do you know this is not our business and nato at this point would have been completely divided you would see disunity you would see other nato countries peeling off what are we going to do the alliance would be broken so let s make sure when trump is saying this stuff about how much differently just if president trump was president right now we would be in a completely different place brent baker vice president of research and publications for the media research center explains our weekly pick despite all the policy changes from the trump years made by the biden administration which pleased vladimir putin such as ending arms sales to ukraine and making the u s more dependent on importing oil and gas cooper

liberal media scream lester holt fights truth that cops are where crime is washington examiner post this week s liberal media scream features a rare case of a news source pushing back against the bias of a big shot news host this time nbc anchor lester holt s view that minorities are targeted by biased police doing the pushing back was former president donald trump s attorney general william barr who challenged holt s positive view of black lives matter and rejected the liberal statement that police are racists in a special about barr who is pitching his new book one damn thing after another memoirs of an attorney the former attorney general was his typical matter of fact self stopping holt dead in his tracks when he said black men are the subject of three times as many traffic stops by police barr responded that sometimes is a function of where the police are police go where the crime is from the sunday night nbc news special bill barr in the eye of the storm lester holt can we talk about the big lie bill barr which one is that holt well you write about the big lie being black lives matter barr yeah holt what did you mean by that barr black lives matter is based on the premise that the main threat to black welfare in the inner city are out of control police force that gratuitously kill african americans that s simply not borne out by the facts holt narration as the nation s top law enforcement official bill barr always had hard line views on crime and how to fight it in 1992 when barr was attorney general the first time he wrote a memo called the case for more incarceration the kind of tough lock em up policy that s been cited as a leading cause of destabilizing black communities holt to barr 1 in 3 black men will be incarcerated sometime in their lifetime 1 in 17 for white men can you not see how that shapes the perception and makes people want to rally around the idea of black lives matter barr well i understand the perception and i think there s ambivalence that s what i have found on the one hand there is a concern that when they encounter police they re not given the benefit of the doubt and they re treated as second class citizens and there s definitely that concern on the other hand i think they also understand that the police are there to try to make their community safer that it s a very tough job and they want more police crowd black lives matter no justice no peace no justice no peace holt in society do you believe there s such a thing as systemic racism barr i actually think the whole idea is a cop out i think racism exists in people s individual s souls holt by dismissing systematic racism are you not dismissing the pain of african american families that have to sit down with their children and have the talk because they re afraid a simple traffic stop could lead to their deaths barr no i don t you know i don t
on january 14 2022 a federal court in the northern district of california endorsed the sec s novel shadow trading theory of insider trading in sec v panuwat no 3 21 cv 06322 who n d cal jan 14 2022 the court held that a person can violate securities laws by trading in the securities of an issuer based on material nonpublic information misappropriated from a different company unrelated to the issuer the decision effectively expands the scope of the misappropriation theory of insider trading the opinion can be found here in panuwat the sec alleged that defendant matthew panuwat misappropriated information from his employer medivation a mid cap biopharmaceutical company that focused on oncology products according to the complaint medivation brought in investment banks to explore a possible merger in 2016 minutes after medivation s ceo sent panuwat and other company executives an email indicating that pfizer inc expressed overwhelming interest in acquiring medivation panuwat allegedly purchased 578 call options in incyte corp a different mid cap biopharma company that was comparable to medivation in doing so panuwat allegedly violated medivation s insider trading policy which prohibited using nonpublic medivation information to trade in medivation securities or the securities of another publicly traded company after medivation announced the acquisition the stock price of incyte and other mid cap biopharma companies in the same industry increased allegedly generating panuwat 107 066 of ill gotten gains in a complaint filed in august 2021 the sec charged panuwat with violating section 10 b of the exchange act and rule 10b 5 promulgated thereunder section 10 b 15 usc 78j b makes it unlawful for any person o use or employ in connection with the purchase or sale of any security any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in violation of sec rules and regulations in turn rule 10b 5 17 cfr 240 10b 5 prohibits directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of any security using any device scheme or artifice to defraud the making of any untrue statement of a material fact or omission or engaging in any act practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person rule 10b5 1 a moreover defines manipulative and deceptive devices to include in part the purchase or sale of a security of any issuer on the basis of material nonpublic information about that security or issuer in breach of a duty of trust or confidence owed to the issuer or to any other person who is the source of the information as judge rakoff in the southern district of new york has observed given the lack of elements in the statute and rule the prohibition of insider trading in the united states has developed in a somewhat ad hoc manner and in a topsy turvy way based partly on federal common law leaving many unanswered questions united states v whitman 904 f supp 2d 363 367 369 372 s d n y 2012 panuwat raised just such a question namely whether a person can trade in the securities of an issuer based on material nonpublic information unrelated to the issuer obtained from a company other than the issuer panuwat contended that the sec s novel theory did not state a violation of section 10 b or rule 10b 5 and moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and failure to plead fraud with particularity specifically he argued that the sec s complaint failed to adequately plead that information about the medivation acquisition was material to incyte and nonpublic that he breached a duty to medivation or that he acted with intent to defraud he also asserted that the charges violated his due process rights averring the sec has never before attempted to bring an insider trading case against an individual based solely on the purchase of securities of a company about which neither he nor his employer possessed any material nonpublic information or involving an alleged breach of a duty to an employer by trading in the securities of an unrelated company operating within the same broadly defined industry the court rejected these arguments at the outset the court explained that the supreme court has recognized two theories of insider trading that violate section 10 b and rule 10b 5 the traditional or classical theory involves a corporate insider who trades in the securities of the insider s corporation on the basis of material nonpublic information in contrast the misappropriation theory involves a defendant who misappropriates confidential information in breach of a duty owed to the source of the information and then uses the information to trade unlike the classical theory the misappropriation theory extends to company outsiders not insiders the court held that the sec s complaint satisfied the requirements of a misappropriation theory section 10 b and rule 10b 5 cast a wide net the court reasoned and rule 10b 5 does not require that the information about the security or issuer in this case incyte derive from the issuer itself to be material the news of the impending pfizer medivation acquisition was material to incyte the court concluded because there were allegedly a limited number of mid cap oncology focused biopharma companies with commercial stage drugs in 2016 and the acquisition would make others in this category more attractive driving up their stock prices the court further held that as alleged panuwat breached a duty to medivation because its insider trading policy broadly prohibited trading in securities of other companies not just medivation the court also held that the complaint adequately alleged scienter the court also rejected panuwat s due process argument while the court acknowledged that there appear to be no other cases where the material nonpublic information at issue involved a third party as the sec conceded at oral argument according to the court the theory still fell within the general framework of insider trading as well as the expansive language of section 10 b and corresponding regulations the court added scienter and materiality provide sufficient guardrails to insider trading liability the panuwat decision expands the court created ambit of section 10 b and rule 10b 5 by creating liability for shadow trading that is trading in the securities of an issuer based on material nonpublic information obtained from a different company only time will tell whether prosecutors follow the sec s lead and test this theory in a criminal case in any event the decision reinforces that just because nonpublic information a person receives does not involve or derive from a particular issuer it does not mean that it can lawfully be used to trade in that issuer s securities accordingly entities that trade in securities should ensure that their policies and training convey this principle to employees

originally bitcoin was supposed to be a currency then it was supposed to be a hedge against inflation a sort of digital gold but as the great crypto market crash of the last three months has begun to unfold it s started to look like something much more mundane a crappy tech stock digital currencies on the whole have been in free fall lately despite recovering ever so slightly on monday bitcoin has lost about 45 percent of its value since november while other crypto assets such as ether have shed even more during this collapse the wider crypto market has lost more than 1 3 trillion of value roughly the worth of all outstanding federal student debt this clattering monthslong crash is a reminder of why bitcoin has never really worked well as a regular currency despite the vast resources that have been spent trying to make it catch on reliable currencies tend to have relatively stable values it s considered a big deal if the u s dollar moves up or down by 10 percent bitcoin in contrast can move that much in a day thanks to the massive amount of speculative trading around it which makes it a poor medium of exchange or store of value investors take this volatility for granted now long downturns like this are normal with crypto the ceo of a crypto tech company that works with asset managers told cnbc folks should know that going in that might be sound advice but it makes a mockery of the idea that crypto will ever really be capable of replacing dollars or euros but this crash hasn t just undercut the case that bitcoin might be a viable currency which has seemed pretty unlikely for a while it s also shattering one of the big arguments in favor of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as an investment asset class because the supply of bitcoin is technically capped and there s no central bank to print more it has long been hyped as a safe place where investors could put their money if they were worried about inflation a form of gold without the inconvenience and cost of storing a load of shiny metal that s traditionally been a big part of its appeal to hard money libertarians who distrust the federal reserve advertisement the theory that bitcoin would act like an inflation hedge seemed plausible for much of 2021 when consumer prices picked up and crypto values skyrocketed but now not so much since bitcoin and its cousins are in retreat even though inflation is still very much with us you d think with the inflation we re seeing you d see the opposite bob fitzsimmons the executive vice president for fixed income commodities and stock lending at wedbush securities told the washington post recently that s been one of the selling points for bitcoin in contrast the price of actual gold the oldest inflation hedge of all has stayed relatively stable in recent months and is up a bit over the last 60 days advertisement advertisement advertisement advertisement instead of a currency or an inflation hedge bitcoin seems to be acting like something else a tech stock over time its performance has become increasingly correlated with the nasdaq index its correlation with gold is practically nil interesting the regime change in bitcoin s correlation with nasdaq uncorrelated claims from its supporters aside it has essentially gone from a correlation of near zero with the index to among the most nasdaq correlated risk assets out there higher than many equities pic twitter com a87ogbe97g paul kedrosky pkedrosky january 19 2022 advertisement investors in short have been betting on bitcoin as a gamble on tech froth of which there s been a lot in recent years but lately traders have been dumping stocks and other risky assets in anticipation of the federal reserve raising interest rates soon to try and control inflation as a result they re dumping crypto too it doesn t help matters that russia s central bank has announced plans to ban crypto much as china already has there s some dramatic irony here again bitcoin s ideological roots lay partly in the desire to create a form of private money totally free from central bank meddling but ultimately like every other asset its value is swinging to jerome powell s tune you can t ever really escape the influence of the fed advertisement advertisement all of this also raises an important question about bitcoin what exactly is it supposed to be good for nobody really needs another way to bet on tech stocks you can just bet on tech stocks for that unlike the ethereum network meanwhile bitcoin isn t widely thought of as a useful platform for advanced financial services update jan 25 2022 at 1 37 p m some hope that a recent network upgrade designed to make executing so called smart contracts in bitcoin will change that but it s unclear how much impact the update will have one potential answer is crime crypto is the preferred payment method for hackers who perpetrate ransomware attacks but that doesn t exactly bode well for bitcoin s long term future so if it isn t a currency isn t a gold substitute and isn t even a very good way to diversify your portfolio what exactly is its purpose as far as i can tell other than buying some drugs online the answer is absolutely nothing

maneuverings and markets nudged down lower on the news that britain was joining the united states in withdrawing some diplomats and their families from the embassies in kyiv the ukrainian capital the

told reporters that the intelligence about russian intentions was gloomy but added that a russian invasion was not inevitable the intelligence is very clear that there are 60 russian battle groups on the borders of ukraine the plan for a lightning war that could take out kyiv is one that everybody can see we need to make it very clear to the kremlin to russia that that would be a disastrous step johnson said he added we also need to get a message to moscow that invading ukraine from a russian perspective is going to be a painful violent and bloody business i think it s very important that people in russia understand that this could be a new chechnya he was referring to the brutal wars fought between russia and chechen rebels in the 1990s that left tens of thousands of people dead chechnya had waged wars of independence against russia speaking as britain started to withdraw some embassy staff from ukraine johnson said we do think it prudent to make some changes now

despite a crude oil inventory build in the latest eia report u s commercial petroleum stocks have declined in most of the weeks in the past year and a half falling below seasonal averages for the past five years and even below the five year average before the pandemic the continuously declining u s petroleum stocks over the past year suggest that supply has not caught up with rebounding demand as u s exploration and production companies have not responded with a spike in new drilling activity to the rising crude oil prices petroleum stocks at lower than seasonal norms have contributed to market tightness alongside the opec group s inability to fully meet its rising monthly production quotas and rising global demand as economies look to return to normal global oil demand has held resilient during the omicron wave so far prompting the international energy agency iea to revise higher its 2022 demand growth estimate by 200 000 barrels per day bpd last week in the united states the latest eia data as of january 14 showed a small crude inventory build of 500 000 barrels and another large increase in gasoline stocks which added 5 9 million barrels this follows a combined build in gasoline inventories of over 18 million barrels for the previous two weeks despite the increase gasoline stocks in the u s are now in line with the five year average 2015 2019 before the pandemic according to estimates by reuters market analyst john kemp compared to the latest five year average which includes the pandemic years gasoline stocks are now about 2 percent below the five year average for this time of year eia data showed the data also pointed to the fact that total commercial petroleum inventories in the united states decreased by 1 5 million barrels in the week ending january 14 u s crude oil inventories are about 8 percent below the five year average for this time of year distillate fuel inventories are about 16 percent below the five year average and propane propylene inventories stood at some 7 percent below the five year average according to the eia that s including the pandemic years compared to the 2015 2019 average total u s commercial inventories are 4 percent below the pre pandemic five year seasonal average the lowest level for this time of the year since 2015 reuters kemp has estimated in december 2021 for example u s petroleum demand returned to 21 1 million bpd with more people driving places instead of flying the american petroleum institute s chief economist dean foreman said in api s latest monthly statistical report related the nickel supply squeeze could send prices even higher by contrast the production of u s crude oil and natural gas liquids ngls remained flat overall with a minimal response by investment and drilling even as oil prices returned to more than 80 per barrel in january foreman wrote lower domestic oil production has also required refiners to use oil that s already been produced and consequently reduced u s crude oil inventories to below their five year range he added at the end of december crude oil inventories were below the five year range and at their lowest for december since 2014 api s report showed moreover total inventories were at their lowest for december since 2017 lower than normal petroleum inventories have been putting an upside pressure on u s and international oil prices which hit the highest since october 2014 last week advertisement the tighter market these days is reflected in the rising backwardation in the futures prices of both major benchmarks wti and brent with prompt prices higher and rising compared to those further out in time robust demand insufficient investment in new supply low inventories and declining global spare production capacity have prompted major wall street banks including goldman sachs jp morgan and morgan stanley to forecast that oil prices could hit 100 per barrel as soon as this year by tsvetana paraskova for oilprice com more top reads from oilprice com

nasdaq index rose 0 6 after recovering from a nearly 5 descent early in the day benchmark stock indexes flirted with near 4 month lows as investors anticipated guidance from the fed later this week about its plans to raise interest rates to tame inflation which is at its highest level in nearly four decades the fed s short term rate has been pegged near zero since the pandemic hit the global economy in 2020 and that has fueled borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses but rising prices at supermarkets car lots and gas stations are raising concerns that consumers will pare back spending to limit the pressure on their budgets companies have warned that supply chain problems and higher raw materials costs could crimp their profits the fed has kept downward pressure on longer term interest rates by buying trillions of dollars worth of government and corporate bonds but those emergency purchases are scheduled to end in march nudging rates higher is intended to help slow economic growth and the rate of inflation there s a short term panic and part of that is the high level of uncertainty around what the fed is going to do said sylvia jablonski chief investment officer

thinking on the economy and interest rates some economists worry the fed is moving too slowly others fret that the fed may act too aggressively they argue that numerous rate hikes would risk causing a recession and wouldn t slow inflation in any case in this view high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the fed s rate hikes are powerless to cure when the fed boosts its short term rate it tends to make borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses slowing the economy with the intent of reducing inflation that could reduce company earnings which tend to dictate stock prices

remember when we were all assured that joe biden was a paradigm of decency unlike the bad orange man he would never lose his temper and launch a gross attack on the free press advertisement well that s how the story went anyway in reality biden has continuously shown himself to be a thin skinned man child who can t take even the slightest hint of criticism today that boiled over into an expletive laden attack on fox news peter doocy gird your loins because you are about to witness an event that would have cnn s jim acosta in tears if it involved donald trump the president of the united states just called peter doocy a stupid son of a bitch pic twitter com rqqo3n1iz7 townhall com townhallcom january 24 2022 as you can see it appears that biden thought the mic had been cut off and was trying to attack doocy behind his back putting aside the cowardly notion of such a move how dumb do you have to be to not suspect a hot mic moment could occur when you say something like that the reporters were still in the room after all but hey that s part of the senility i guess not being able to control one s emotions is a sure sign of age related decline past that i m struck by a few things here first the hypocrisy we are about to witness from the mainstream media is going to reach epic levels after spending the last six years insisting any attack on the press amounted to crushing constitutional rights and endangering the lives of journalists you can expect msnbc cnn the times and the rest to either ignore this or laugh it off you almost certainly won t see a united front as you have in defense of some liberal journalists in the past demanding the white house apologize and adjust its behavior advertisement second let s remember that biden himself once said that he would fire on the spot anyone in his administration who disrespected someone else townhall shared that inconvenient clip for the president as a follow up on the hot mic moment joe biden in january of 2021 but i m not joking when i say this if you are ever working with me and i hear you treat another colleague with disrespect talk down to someone i promise you i will fire you on the spot pic twitter com xxh5gororn townhall com townhallcom january 24 2022 lastly can we just talk about how thin this guy s skin is inflation is an issue of top concern for americans today the stock market also tanked nailing the retirements and investments of the middle class especially hard all doocy did was ask if those realities are a problem for the administration biden is such a wimp though that he d rather cut the mic off except he didn t and launch obscene attacks instead of addressing the issue at hand i m not that old but i m old enough to have lived through more than a few presidencies and biden is by far the least capable least prepared person for the job i ve ever seen yeah he s good at not making mean tweets likely because he can t manipulate a phone by himself but he s wholly incapable in every other facet of the job we are seeing that play out in real time as europe moves to the brink of war and the economy continues to falter you can t in fact just put a warm body in the white house and have everything work out leadership matters and biden just doesn t have it in him advertisement anyway we ll have to see how this plays out over the next day i m sure jen psaki will get asked about it at tomorrow s briefing will biden apologize he might but we all know how he really feels he has total contempt for normal americans and their concerns your problems are an inconvenience for him nothing more and he showed that in spades by attacking doocy in this way

a question that comes up often during the daily white house press briefings and which is usually asked by fox news reporter peter doocy revolves around the rising crime epidemic sweeping democrat run cities across america and whether or not the biden white house agrees with the soft on crime approaches taken by democrat district attorneys as well as efforts in various cities and by certain democrat lawmakers in congress to defund the police advertisement usually the stock answer from press secretary jen psaki is to avoid dodge specifically weighing in on what individual cities are doing while issuing a blanket statement in which she falsely claims president biden has always been a staunch supporter of funding the police psaki has also been quick to attribute rising crime issues primarily to gun violence without acknowledging the reality that efforts to defund the police in major cities in this country have had a detrimental deadly impact on some of those same cities but during today s press briefing psaki switched up and finally made a significant concession on the issue of defunding the police and how it relates to rising crime rates during a back and forth exchange with doocy psaki did as she normally does by attributing the bulk of the rising crime rate to gun violence but second on her list was what she called underfunding of some police departments and their need for additional resources watch psaki if we look at the facts we have seen a surge of rime over the last 2 years would you agree w that doocy so what are you attributing the rise in crime to then psaki we should be responsible how we are reporting the reason gun violence is a huge reason pic twitter com sdefcuyitd curtis houck curtishouck january 24 2022 advertisement psaki s concession came just a few days after president biden called for increasing funding for the police potus to u s conference of mayors we shouldn t be cutting funding for police departments i propose increasing funding pic twitter com ygypneimie mediaite mediaite january 21 2022 without a doubt this is a deliberate election year pivot on behalf of the biden administration to distance themselves from radicals in their party who have for years been railing against the police and who have demanded they be defunded in 2020 house democrats attributed the drubbing they received in part to the party s embrace of the defund movement laughably during the summer of 2021 democrats attempted to shift the blame on defunding the police to republicans suggesting because the gop rejected biden s bloated spending bills that they were in effect supporters of defunding the police republicans were quick to welcome the democrats revival of the topic at the time because it gave them the opportunity to bring receipts to the table to prove once and for all that it is democrats who have supported yanking much needed funding from police departments i suspect this pivot is being made now to try and head republicans off at the pass in advance of the 2022 midterms and also because some democrat mayors have even abandoned ship on this issue some temporarily because they see what it s done to their cities advertisement but republicans shouldn t and likely will not let the biden administration off the hook on this one because they know this issue is a losing one for democrats with a cross section of voters who agree that police departments should not be defunded in short the biden administration is welcome to revive the debate over defunding the police but it s unlikely to prove helpful to them come election time where the writing is already on the wall flashback here s why the prog left are running away from woke as fast as they can

weber state gives entrepreneurs confidence to launch multimillion dollar company january 21 2022 ogden utah hydrojug is the kind of success story every entrepreneur dreams a growing 40 million company that started production in the family s metal garage just five years ago as a part time side hustle for two brothers who attended weber state university ryan holmes director and jake wadsworth co founder hydrojug s concept is simple a 73 ounce water bottle for health enthusiasts who want to stay hydrated all day the growth is exponential in august 2021 inc magazine ranked hydrojug at no 33 on its annual 5000 list of the nation s fastest growing private companies in 2021 the company expanded to a 35 000 square foot manufacturing facility at the business depot ogden and will add another 119 786 square feet in the first quarter of 2022 they now employ 80 people and have a distribution center in the united kingdom co founder and coo jake wadsworth gives thanks to the executive director of weber state s hall global entrepreneurship center dave noack for giving him the confidence to make hydrojug a full time pursuit following his graduation in accounting in 2017 professor noack said this is kind of rare that you have something that s grabbing traction wadsworth said accounting jobs you re thinking of will be there after hydrojug so go for it jump into it and i did wadsworth s brother hayden who has a wsu bachelor s degree in accounting conceived the idea of hydrojug five years ago while watching an athlete on youtube carry water in a plastic milk jug the brothers decided they could improve the design quality and durability of a milk jug so they paid a designer and ordered three pallets of product one each of white black and clear nearly 1 000 jugs altogether hayden handled marketing jake processed and delivered i was fulfilling out in the uninsulated unheated metal shop at my parents house he said it was a grind and a lot of those bottles would leak so they sent us replacement parts to make them not leak so i would test every one of them before i would send them out if customers were in the local area i would actually deliver them the brothers weren t afraid to work hard and remain frugal they grew up as employees on their dad s landscaping crew and in their mother s subway sandwich shops it gave them the chance to contribute to ensure the financial success of their family they took those lessons to hydrojug where they were willing to build sweat equity they kept their expenses at a minimum returning all the profits to the business for the first two years before jumping in full time i d been going to weber state for the last few years so i was used to living off pretty well nothing wadsworth said laughing i was really careful about student debt as well and taking out the minimum i needed and paying for the rest with part time jobs and my scholarship so the timing of it was really good to build their business they set up displays and demonstrations at expos and gyms there d be guys carrying milk jugs and we d say hydrojug is so much better yours is not dishwasher safe it s leaching plastics in your water and guys just didn t really care wadsworth said but we had a lot of traction with women so we decided ok for the next order we re going to do a bunch of color the colored jugs sold and buyers then asked for a straw and an insulated sleeve the product has continued to evolve rapidly with glass and stainless steel jugs as more sustainable options hydrojug is now looking for other growth opportunities including sportswear one challenge that plagued the young business was forecasting needs and trends they would build up stock then do marketing and then sell out to help solve that problem the wadsworths turned to another weber state wildcat ryan holmes graduated from the supply chain management program in december 2020 where he was president of the supply chain club coordinated wsu s annual case competitions and completed an internship with autoliv his depth of experience and faculty support gave him confidence to tackle the work of a growing multi million dollar company you have the right amount of inventory to support the demand while still keeping cashflow healthy holmes said on the outbound side we make sure we re optimal in how we ship our product so we can decrease outbound spending quality control reports are very robust and i attribute all of that i really truly attribute all of my knowledge and success to what i learned at weber state after 18 months at hydrojug holmes is now director of operations he focuses on forecasting supply chain management and product development you don t graduate and remember every single piece and part of the book but it s the principles you learn there how to deal with your suppliers what you need to do to optimize your supply chain he said those key principles stick with you and having professors who care about your success and your success after you graduate is really what did it for me as a young business hydrojug has also successfully employed two other strategies that have yielded great returns when they have a question they seek out other utah entrepreneurs who have been generous with information and insights hydrojug has also harnessed the power of social media which has been an integral part of their advertising and marketing strategy from the very beginning they retain fitness influencers who use their product hydrojug s instagram following just topped 400 000 social media is the driving factor that builds a brand that s how people are doing it wadsworth said i feel like we have a competitive edge there because of our knowledge in that space it s something that we have been doing for a long time that s what really took the business to the next level they also use social media to help monitor trends and scan the environment for the opportunities and pitfalls of the future in 2022 they plan to move into retail sales and international markets with private labels and product customization they are positioning the company to become an e commerce business that owns several other e commerce companies from a basic level we solved the problem of people who had a need for this product so now we are refining the processes and finding new problems wadsworth said that s what it s all about and that s what s going to give you growth identifying problems finding solutions putting them in place reviewing what you ve done and building upon that to learn more about hydrojug visit this link for photos visit

interest rate in 2022 to try to tame inflation which is at its highest level in nearly four decades the fed s short term rate has been pegged near zero since the pandemic hit the global economy in 2020 and that has fueled borrowing and spending by consumers and businesses but rising prices at supermarkets car lots and gas stations are raising concerns that consumers will pare back spending to limit the pressure on their budgets companies have warned that supply chain problems and higher raw materials costs could crimp their profits the fed has kept downward pressure on longer term interest rates by buying trillions of dollars worth of government and corporate bonds but those emergency purchases are scheduled to end in march nudging rates higher is intended to help slow economic growth

waiting to hear from federal reserve policymakers after their latest meeting ends wednesday some economists have expressed concern that the fed is already moving too late to combat high inflation other economists say they worry that the fed may act too aggressively they argue that numerous rate hikes would risk causing a recession and wouldn t slow inflation in any case in this view high prices mostly reflect snarled supply chains that the fed s rate hikes are powerless to cure when the fed boosts its short term rate it tends to make borrowing more expensive for consumers and businesses slowing the economy with the intent of reducing inflation that could reduce company earnings which tend to dictate stock prices over the long term the fed s benchmark short term interest rate is currently in a range of 0 to 0 25 investors now see a nearly 65 chance that the fed will raise the rate four times by the end of the year up from a 35 chance a month ago according to cme group

getty images getty images key takeaways stocks bounce back from a major monday morning sell off as small caps rally into positive territory bargain hunters and bottom pickers could finally give investors the day of capitulation needed for a bottom global central banks are speaking different languages that could help small cap stocks stocks started the week in a downslide with the s p 500 spx falling nearly 4 after the open however small caps stocks started the intraday recovery with the russell 2000 rut bouncing off its morning lows after falling 5 5 in the morning the small cap index rallied back into positive territory and closed 2 29 higher thanks in large part to energy stocks the s p 500 and the nasdaq composite comp were also able to bounce off their lows to close in positive territory the massive sell off and recovery could be the sign of capitulation that investors have been hoping for when finally backed into a corner with what appeared to be real panic selling bargain hunters seem to have stepped in and started buying it could also be a good sign that investors started their bargain hunting with the riskier small cap stocks demonstrating that these stocks have fallen to valuations where the risk is low enough to make the companies worthwhile even bitcoin rallied to positive territory alongside small caps reflecting the change in appetite for risk hopefully over the next week the larger companies can demonstrate greater strength they could get some help from dow jones industrial average dji stocks because half of them report earnings this week in fact international business machines ibm reported after the closing bell and rallied 6 79 on the news that the company beat on earnings and revenue forecasts the company had been working on a turnaround plan that appears to be taking shape particularly in its cloud services division the dow jones closed in the green despite being down 1 100 points intraday it was helped by home depot hd which traded 4 21 higher on the day despite the roller coaster of a day some stocks rallied kohls kss rocketed over 36 on news that an activist investor consortium led by starboard value lp proposed a deal valued at 9 billion clothing stocks appeared to be hot because gap gps also rallied 7 94 because some investors may be thinking that it also has merger potential domino s pizza dpz rallied 4 85 despite no immediately related news oil prices fell despite the continuing tension at the ukrainian and russian border the united states and the united kingdom have withdrawn some diplomats from ukraine as nato sends more ships and fighter jets to eastern europe rising tensions in the oil rich area could cause oil prices to move higher a week to test wills this could be a big week for stocks with heavy hitters like apple aapl microsoft msft and tesla tsla reporting additionally the federal reserve will meet this week and hopefully lay out a plan for hiking interest rates in the near future this could give investors some confidence in their plan to curb inflation while these news events will be great for those of us who write market commentary they could spell headaches for investors stocks like apple and tesla often provide an insight into investor psychology so this week could be a vote of confidence from investors on market strength apple has been a mainstay for investors and has often demonstrated strength compared to other technology stocks even with the recent pullback apple is down about 11 compared to the nasdaq composite comp which is down more than 16 from its highs tesla has been a buy the dip kind of stock and investors have been willing to go to that well several times however with the fed raising rates investors may not be so willing to drink from these wells despite the enormous rally to end the day there s no reason for volatility to fade the bears could strike back later this week over concerns about earnings for technology companies particularly those that deal in the cloud fortunately ibm was able to show progress in its cloud business but microsoft had a range that stretched more than 20 on monday the problem comes with rising rates and investors still trying to determine valuations pandemic plays were all over the map with netflix nflx falling 11 to close down 2 60 zoom zm rallied 3 58 peloton pton rallied 9 79 as activist investors cry for the ceo to be fired and the company be sold finally docusign docu also fell more than 7 but closed 4 91 higher correction vs bear market as previously noted the nasdaq is in correction territory a correction is classified as a market pullback between 10 and 19 a bear market is a declining market that has dropped 20 or more the russell 2000 rut small cap index was down about 20 at its intraday lows on monday which would ve put it in bear market territory all other major indices including the s p 500 spx and dow jones industrial average dji are near correction territory a correction can be quite healthy for stocks in that it helps weed out overvalued companies and allows other stocks to revert to their earnings means or in other words trade more in line with their actual earnings growth a bear market is different in that it tends to signal that there may be something wrong with the underlying economy stocks are commonly said to run about six months ahead of the economy the vix cboe market volatility index can be helpful in signaling a correction versus a bear market by paying attention to certain levels in 2021 market pullbacks often turned around when the vix was near 30 see below however in 2020 that level was around 40 and that 40 level stretches back into the previous two decades the dot com bubble burst and the bear market bottomed out soon after the vix hit 40 but the 2008 credit crisis changed everything the vix can now spike above 40 during a correction and the last two bear markets saw spikes around 90 before creating bottoms chart of the day the rub on the vix the vix or cboe market volatility index vix has broken above its 2021 reversal level red line upper chart and is testing a long term reversal level blue line in both charts data sources ice s p dow jones indices chart source the thinkorswim platform language barrier the world s central banks don t appear to be speaking the same language as the u s federal reserve is talking about tightening the u s money supply european central banks are holding off on tightening as long as possible and asian central banks are increasing their money supplies to stimulate their economies the federal reserve is meeting this week to discuss its monetary policy plans the fed has greatly reduced its bond buying stimulus efforts and should quit them entirely by march then the markets are expecting the fed to increase the overnight rate by a quarter of a point in march this is because the fed is concerned that the higher rate of inflation is at risk of becoming structural and not transitory european central bank president christine lagarde has rejected calls to increase rates to combat soaring inflation and prefers to wait on the inflation problems correcting themselves as supply chain bottlenecks open up and producers get back to work when covid 19 restriction are lifted in europe the largest increases in prices have been due to energy prices so getting through the winter months could also be a big help lagarde stated that an important difference is that europe isn t seeing the excessive demand that the united states is last week the people s bank of china cut a couple different interest rates to try and stimulate economic growth china isn t seeing the same degree of inflation because consumer spending has slowed regulations have tightened and the property sector is struggling the housing market has been troubled by overborrowing from homebuilders and now they need to refinance the debt to lower levels so it becomes more serviceable these conditions are likely to push the u s dollar higher which has normally been a drag on large and mega cap international companies and help domestic small cap companies perhaps this morning s small cap led rally is a good sign

ottawa business leaders are urging ottawa to ease vaccine mandates for cross border truckers to relieve the congested supply chain with the united states while liberals and conservatives sparred over the extent of the problem and how to resolve it ottawa business leaders are urging ottawa to ease vaccine mandates for cross border truckers to relieve the congested supply chain with the united states while liberals and conservatives sparred over the extent of the problem and how to resolve it prime minister justin trudeau defended the mandate monday as a necessary step to keep supply chains open arguing that covid 19 itself is the biggest risk to canada s economy the mandate which came into effect after an exemption ended jan 15 means canadian long haul truck drivers must now be vaccinated against covid 19 to avoid a two week quarantine after crossing the border while unvaccinated non canadian truck drivers will be denied entry the u s brought in its own vaccine mandate for truckers on saturday which means that unvaccinated canadian drivers will also be unable to return below the border in separate statements the canadian chamber of commerce and the canadian manufacturing coalition both urged trudeau to back down perrin beatty the president of the chamber said that while we strongly favour getting as many people vaccinated as possible the government should allow more time before imposing the mandate on truckers until now governments have considered truckers to be providing an essential service which has kept supply chains functioning even during the most serious waves of the pandemic beatty said in a written response to questions but beatty said the government hasn t produced statistics that show that truckers are a major source of covid 19 infections in canada neither health minister jean yves duclos nor chief public health officer dr theresa tam were able to provide any data about covid 19 and truck drivers when asked last week at the house of commons health committee if the government has such figures and has been concerned that they pose a particular threat they should have had an educational program directed specifically at them long before now and they could have worked with the provinces and industry to set up mobile vaccination clinics near border crossings and truck stops throughout canada said beatty what we are asking for is that they delay implementation at a time when supply chains are under severe pressure and that they use that time to encourage and facilitate vaccinations the canadian manufacturing coalition which represents over 30 manufacturing trade associations called for a full reversal of the vaccine mandate after meeting friday with industry minister françois philippe champagne dennis darby the president of canadian manufacturers exporters which chairs the coalition told champagne that canadians are seeing empty shelves because vaccine mandates are making supply chain bottlenecks worse in a statement darby said the meeting with champagne was a good first step but now we need to see concrete action by the government to start addressing these challenges starting with reversing the trucker vaccine mandate supply chains were already struggling from two years of pandemic interruption workers falling ill with covid 19 and multiple weather events including snowstorms and last fall s flooding in british columbia on monday trudeau showed no signs of adjusting the mandate and said getting vaccinated was the best way to keep canada s economy going he said in french that the conservatives are heightening fears about empty store shelves the prime minister reiterated that the canadian trucking alliance says 90 per cent of truck drivers are already vaccinated on sunday the alliance denounced a convoy of hundreds of truckers now making its way to ottawa to protest the mandate the reality is that vaccination is the way we are going to get through trudeau said in french the conservatives are pressuring trudeau to lift the mandate calling it a risk to canada s economy supply chains and economic recovery conservative leader erin o toole has called on the government to allow unvaccinated truckers to take rapid tests and argued the effects on public health would be minimal o toole stopped short of saying monday that he would meet with the truck convoy he also refused to indicate whether its participants have his support it s not for the leader of the opposition or a political party to attend a protest on the hill or a convoy he said in ottawa former conservative leader andrew scheer appeared at a convoy that rolled into ottawa in 2019 protesting a range of issues including the liberal government s energy policies over the weekend liberals and conservatives used social media in warring posts about whether stores shelves were full or empty conservative transport critic melissa lantsman was accused of misleading canadians by sharing a photo of empty shelves that turned out to be a stock image of a british grocery store several liberal supporters and staffers posted photos of fully stocked shelves as evidence that there was no supply chain issue this report by the canadian press was first published jan 24 2022 mike blanchfield and stephanie taylor the canadian press

mainly just a continuation of the same worries bugging markets since the start of the year namely the surge in inflation and the policy tightening now planned to bring it back under control noted rupert thompson chief investment officer at kingswood integrated wealth management group on monday equity corrections are far from unusual at the start of fed tightening cycles and have in fact been the norm in the past sharp jumps in bond yields as we have seen in recent weeks are also prone to trigger market falls the important point however is that these declines have tended to be temporary and followed by renewed gains he added he added that there was no obvious immediate catalyst to trigger an easing of concerns and a market rebound a marked fall in inflation would clearly be very helpful but no relief on this front is likely for a few months yet 6 30am us stocks seen opening down us stocks are expected to extend their losses as investors await the outcome of the us federal reserve s two day meeting on wednesday and prepare for more earnings reports from large tech companies including apple microsoft and tesla futures for the dow jones industrial average sank 1 51 in

as we start what could be another turbulent week commented aj bell investment director russ mould the federal reserve is meeting on wednesday amid expectations of a first interest rate hike in march and more increases to come this year than had previously been pencilled in this has been signalled by a rise in bond yields mould noted that the hardening of monetary policy has negative implications for the valuations of tech stocks already under pressure following big slumps in recent weeks perhaps apple microsoft and tesla can come to the rescue with some knockout numbers when they report this week on the other hand a series of disappointing updates from these technology titans would only undermine sentiment further he added
so who is the highest paid person in the government the answer may surprise you here s a hint it s not president joe biden who reportedly makes 400 000 a year as commander in chief mark scribner managing director at oxygen financial tells newsy that this person is dr anthony fauci the director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases lindsay tuchman so why does dr fauci make more money than the president of the united states mark scribner so his package it s about 440 000 a year and then he has a lifetime pension of 380 000 a year he is part of an old federal system i think there s only a handful of people still left it s called the csrs system and it was disbanded in 1987 so he s part of an old package that was not very effective for pensions that was costing the government way too much money so they stopped it but he s still on that program tuchman so and in part has to do with just his longevity of serving in the position that he s in scribner you know i m a financial advisor i have clients that work for the fbi atf and they ve had the same tenure in terms of length of service they don t have those kinds of packages they are you know maybe 80 000 a year in pensions they have a million dollars in their retirement accounts dr fauci has about 10 4 million in his investment accounts so there s definitely a disparity tuchman interesting so as we re talking about government employees making money there s the salary of course but we ve also seen politicians on both sides of the aisle profiting off of the stock market and sometimes it s due to some information that they have or something that they know about and that of course faces a lot of criticism what are your thoughts on making sure that doesn t happen in any sort of way that could be seen as something to be criticized scribner well for your viewers there s a great website called unusual whales and it goes through each politician and it s not a it s not a red or blue type of a topic it s all across the board but they are definitely having access to inside information now i m a financial advisor and there s a term called front running that basically prohibits us from buying an individual stock for our own accounts ahead of a client account but they have access to trade deals all kinds of big announcements and they buy individual stocks and this was something that was attempted to be resolved and it s called the stock act it got watered down in 2013 but they are buying ahead of you know some major announcements major trade deals and it actually ruins the integrity of the market when you know they have access to inside information that the average person can t it s completely unacceptable and i think it just erodes trust for the consumers this report was originally published by lindsay tuchman of newsy

photo credit konstantin l shutterstock the frenzied real estate market over the last two years has been challenging for many homebuyers but for those who have been able to buy the return on investment has been strong homes are appreciating at a record pace with sale prices rising around 20 from 2020 to 2021 with these rapid increases in home values some investors are looking to rental properties as a source of potential returns while many of those capitalizing on the current state of the market are institutional investors the current market conditions could present opportunities for small scale investors as well however these would be landlords must assess how rapid shifts in the value of real estate could affect their investments in the short and long term increasing home prices have been a major story since the pandemic began but home prices have shown a fair amount of volatility over time especially in comparison to rent for example prices rose at a fairly rapid pace during the real estate bubble of the early to mid 2000s but collapsed when the bubble burst home prices then had an uneven recovery until the recent spike beginning in 2020 for rents meanwhile the rate of growth year over year has held steady between around 2 and 5 percent outside of a dip during the great recession and over the last year or so the relative stability of rents compared to the current rise in home prices will affect how potential real estate investors assess properties as sale prices increase the initial investment and ongoing costs increase as well which can limit the investment s cash flow should rents fail to keep pace on the other hand rapid appreciation in home values can increase the investor s overall return when the property is eventually sold one example of how home prices can shift an investors calculations is the gross rent multiplier which is a common indicator that investors use to gauge the quality of an investment gross rent multiplier is a ratio calculated as the price of a real estate investment divided by the gross annual rental income investors usually view a lower ratio as a good investment because it means that the rental income will more quickly recoup the cost of the property when the investment price rises the multiplier does as well another example is property taxes all else being equal rising home prices translate into larger annual property tax burdens and thus reduced cash flow fortunately property tax rates vary widely by location and in many parts of the country existing owners are paying effective rates of less than 1 this collection of factors can help real estate investors hone in on the best locations to make an investment markets that have a low gross rent multiplier low property taxes and a positive outlook for future property value growth offer the best mix of conditions for a potential investor in the u s most of those locations are found in the south southern states tend to have some of the lowest housing prices and lowest property taxes of any region but the region is also seeing some of the fastest growth in the country which will boost property values as more people seek housing to identify the best locations

impose drastic economic sanctions on moscow to deter further aggression in the future a scenario that can significantly drive up energy and agricultural commodity prices restrictions that curtail

the clinical trial has been halted by the fda for now pending the submittal of a preclinical study what happened investors didn t exactly launch a raid on viking therapeutics vktx 2 43 stock during monday s trading session the shares tumbled by nearly 7 on the back of discouraging news about one of the company s drug candidates so what viking a clinical stage biotech that concentrates on metabolic and endocrine disorders announced that its vk0214 program has been put on ice for now by the food and drug administration fda the company explained that the american regulator is requesting an additional preclinical study on the drug which is being tested as a treatment for x linked adrenoleukodystrophy x ald a genetic disorder that targets the membrane covering nerve cells in the brain and spine viking took pains to emphasize that the fda s request is not due to any findings from ongoing or previously completed studies and that it plans to submit the solicited information in the second quarter of this year while the biotech identifies its current vk0214 study as a phase 1b trial in the fda s opinion it is falls under the phase 2 category viking said that phase 2 testing requires a rodent genotoxicity study to proceed hence the regulator s request now what it s important to note that while inconvenient this fda mandated hold is not due to issues with vk0214 itself errors in conducting the study or any other factor that might presage potential failure rather it s procedural based on the distinction between clinical trial phases as such the market s sell off feels like a bit of an overreaction that is perhaps due for a correction in the coming days viking said in its disclosure that it does not expect the long term development timeline for vk0214 to be significantly impacted it aims to resume dosing in the drug s trial later this year and did not provide more specific timing

outlook goes from bad to worse after a substantial early morning sell off u s stocks reversed course and staged a stunning rebound finishing the day slightly higher as dip buyers took the opportunity to swoop in to scoop up beaten down shares ahead of wednesday s fomc decision at the closing bell the s p 500 was up 0 28 to 4 410 recovering from a 4 decline that briefly plunged the world s most popular equity index into correction territory for the first time since 2020 the dow jones after a 180 degree turnaround also ended in the green up 0 29 to 34 364 elsewhere the nasdaq 100 which bore the brunt of the rout during most of the day miraculously erased a 5 plunge to finish 0 49 higher at 14 509 last but not least the russell 2000 managed to outperform its main wall street peers rallying 2 29 to 2 033 after suffering steep losses during the early trade related meme stock traders are here to stay but they ll need to adapt before the late afternoon rebound concerns about the path of monetary policy were the main negative catalyst for equities especially those in the tech and growth universe investors appear increasingly worried that the fed s tightening cycle aimed at curbing inflation may be too aggressive and ultimately trigger a hard landing at a difficult time when the u s economy is rapidly losing steam on the latter point the deceleration was most evident in the ihs markit pmi data released this morning according to the financial intelligence firm january u s business activity in the services sector slumped to 50 9 from 57 6 in december hitting an 18 month low and coming within a whisker of recessionary terrain for refence any reading below 50 indicates contraction while a figure above that level signals expansion while the slowdown can be blamed in part on the omicron surge the recovery is still weakening and bodes ill for corporate earnings related nasdaq 100 s p 500 russell 2000 mauled as risk off sentiment dominates price action during most of the session risk aversion was compounded by rising geopolitical tensions in eastern europe specifically the latent threat of russia invading ukraine in the coming days or weeks the situation is very fluid but the u s ambassador to the united nations warned allies to prepare for a possible failure of diplomacy a sign that hope for a last minute breakthrough is quickly fading at this point there are many unknown variables but wall street fears that an invasion could reverberate through global markets and trigger a worldwide recession if an escalation occurs the white house is likely to impose drastic economic sanctions on moscow to deter further aggression in the future a scenario that can significantly drive up energy and agricultural commodity prices restrictions that curtail russia s exports can exacerbate the highinflation trend around the globe and lead to significant demand destruction but we ll need to see how the standoff plays out before making general assessments about the outlook turning our attention to other catalyst the reporting season will remain in the spotlight but the focus will concentrate on earnings and guidance from the mega caps as these companies typically have a greater impact on the direction of the broader market that said microsoft tesla and apple are set to announce results in the coming days tuesday wednesday and thursday respectively finally earnings aside traders should closely follow wednesday s fomc decision arguably the most important event of the week while no change in monetary policy is expected the central may offer insight into the tightening cycle including the timing of the liftoff and the start of the balance sheet runoff all things considered the bank is likely to indicate that the normalization process remains on track but may issue a less hawkish message to calm investors and stabilize markets any sign that policymakers will be patient and not raise borrowing costs as aggressively as traders had discounted in recent days when they were forecasting four rate hikes for the year may produce a large relief rally and pave the way for the s p 500 dow jones and nasdaq 100 to regain lost

plays out we could see a move towards 4 495 4 500 followed by a possible test of the 4 540 area on the flip side if strong downside momentum picks up pace support can be seen in the 4 230 region if
