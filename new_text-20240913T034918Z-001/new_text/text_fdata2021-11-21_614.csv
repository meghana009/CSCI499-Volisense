exposed klaus schwab s school for covid dictators plan for great reset videos by michael lord rair foundation usa economist ernst wolff believes that a hidden alliance of political and corporate leaders is exploiting the pandemic with the aim of crashing national economies and introducing a global digital currency how is it that more than 190 governments from all over the world ended up dealing with the covid 19 pandemic in almost exactly the same manner with lockdowns mask mandates and vaccination cards now being commonplace everywhere the answer may lie in the young global leaders school which was established and managed by klaus schwab of the world economic forum and that many of today s prominent political and business leaders passed through on their way to the top the german economist journalist and author ernst wolff has revealed some facts about schwab s young global leaders school that are relevant for understanding world events during the pandemic in a video from the german corona committee podcast while wolff is mainly known as a critic of the globalist financial system recently he has focused on bringing to light what he sees as the hidden agenda behind the anti covid measures being enacted around the world mysterious beginnings the story begins with the world economic forum wef which is an ngo founded by klaus schwab a german economist and mechanical engineer in switzerland in 1971 when he was only 32 the wef is best known to the public for the annual conferences it holds in davos switzerland each january that aim to bring together political and business leaders from around the world to discuss the problems of the day today it is one of the most important networks in the world for the globalist power elite being funded by approximately a thousand multinational corporations the wef which was originally called the european management forum until 1987 succeeded in bringing together 440 executives from 31 nations already at its very first meeting in february 1971 which as wolff points out was an unexpected achievement for someone like schwab who had very little international or professional experience prior to this wolff believes the reason may be due to the contacts schwab made during his university education including studying with no less a person than former national security advisor and secretary of state henry kissinger wolff also points out that while schwab was there the harvard business school had been in the process of planning a management forum of their own and it is possible that harvard ended up delegating the task of organizing it to him the forum initially only brought together people from the economic field but before long it began attracting politicians prominent figures from the media including from the bbc and cnn and even celebrities schwab s young global leaders incubator of the great reset in 1992 schwab established a parallel institution the global leaders for tomorrow school which was re established as young global leaders in 2004 attendees at the school must apply for admission and are then subjected to a rigorous selection process members of the school s very first class in 1992 already included many who went on to become important liberal political figures such as angela merkel nicolas sarkozy and tony blair there are currently about 1 300 graduates of this school and the list of alumni includes several names of those who went on to become leaders of the health institutions of their respective nations four of them are former and current health ministers for germany including jens spahn who has been federal minister of health since 2018 philipp rösler who was minister of health from 2009 until 2011 was appointed the wef s managing director by schwab in 2014 other notable names on the school s roster are jacinda ardern the prime minister of new zealand whose stringent lockdown measures have been praised by global health authorities emmanuel macron the president of france sebastian kurz who was until recently the chancellor of austria viktor orbán prime minister of hungary jean claude juncker former prime minister of luxembourg and president of the european commission and annalena baerbock the leader of the german greens who was the party s first candidate for chancellor in this year s federal election and who is still in the running to be merkel s successor we also find california governor gavin newsom on the list who was selected for the class of 2005 as well as former presidential candidate and current us secretary of transportation peter buttigieg who is a very recent alumnus having been selected for the class of 2019 all of these politicians who were in office during the past two years have favored harsh responses to the covid 19 pandemic and which also happened to considerably increase their respective governments power gavin newsom young global leaders class of 2005 angela merkel global leaders for tomorrow class of 1992 peter buttigieg young global leaders class of 2019 emmanuel macron young global leaders class of 2017 but the school s list of alumni is not limited to political leaders we also find many of the captains of private industry there including microsoft s bill gates amazon s jeff bezos virgin s richard branson and the clinton foundation s chelsea clinton again all of them expressed support for the global response to the pandemic and many reaped considerable profits as a result of the measures jeff bezos global leaders for tomorrow class of 1998 bill gates global leaders for tomorrow class of 1993
photo credit aunging shutterstock the covid 19 pandemic has dramatically reshaped the u s labor market in many ways many low wage jobs in fields like retail and hospitality were lost early in the pandemic and have not come back while throughout the pandemic there has been strong demand for health workers in response to the pandemic and technology specialists who can support an increasingly virtual economy the unemployment rate remains elevated but many industries are facing labor shortages and millions of workers have been leaving their jobs voluntarily in a phenomenon that has come to be known as the great resignation in some cases the pandemic has been an accelerant of labor trends that were already underway like increasing automation and digitalization of jobs in others post pandemic shifts in the labor force will have less to do with the effects of the pandemic than with underlying demographic and economic trends this complicated set of factors is evident in recent projections from the bureau of labor statistics which estimated that total u s employment will grow 7 7 between now and 2030 but only by 1 7 when excluding the economy s recovery from pandemic related job loss one of the demographic trends driving shifts in the workforce is the aging of the population the baby boomers those americans born between 1946 and 1964 number more than 75 million and were the largest generation in u s history until the millennials came along the boomers have until recently tended to represent the largest sections of the labor force and are working later into life than previous generations as a result those aged 55 are expected to represent around a quarter of the workforce for at least the next decade but the aging of the baby boomer generation will have more widespread effects on jobs and the economy as well eventually as this generation ages out of the workforce into retirement more companies will have vacancies and potentially find themselves struggling to fill positions that the boomers once occupied this scenario will put pressure on many employers but could also position younger workers for greater job opportunities a larger population of elderly americans will also bring greater strains on healthcare so more of the economy will need to be oriented around supporting older americans in their later years of life the latter trend is one of the primary reasons why health and human service occupations are projected to be among the fastest growing fields in the years ahead healthcare support jobs are the top field for growth with a total projected growth rate of 23 1 between 2020 and 2030 the related fields of community and social service and healthcare practitioners are also near the top of the list with growth rates of 12 4 and 10 8 respectively one of the other major growth fields is computer and mathematical positions a category that includes professions like programming data science software development and network and systems administration as more of society and the economy become dependent on technology these positions are poised for rapid growth in addition to good job prospects computer and mathematical positions also offer some of the best compensation of any occupational group with a median wage of more than 91 000 at the individual occupation level health related and technology related professions are unsurprisingly among the fastest growing but two of the top three individual occupations for growth are in the lower growth category of installation maintenance and repair occupations wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers the field of renewable energy has seen significant growth in recent years and is likely to continue as the costs of renewables decline consumer demand increases and the transition to lower carbon energy sources takes on greater urgency for job seekers interested in reliable jobs and growth opportunities in the years ahead a career in wind or solar energy may be one of the best options out there the data used in this analysis is from the u s bureau of labor statistics employment projections program to identify the fastest growing occupations over the next decade researchers at smartest dollar reported the projected percentage change in employment between 2020 and 2030 excluding occupations with greater than average drops in

2 2 reuters people are awaiting sentencing at the trial of kyle rittenhouse at the kenosha county courthouse wisconsin usa on november 19 2021 reuters brendan mcdermid 2 2 corrects the third paragraph to clarify that rittenhouse did not move his weapon from illinois to wisconsin by joseph ax reuters kyle rittenhouse s friday s acquittal on murder charges opened another front the long running struggle for american gun rights is it acceptable for a teenager to carry an assault style rifle in protest conservatives called rittenhouse a hero for exercising his right to self defense when he shot two protesters and wounded a third saying he attacked a racial justice protest in kenosha wisconsin last year proponents of gun control warned that the jury s verdict could create a new wave of armed surveillance after rittenhouse traveled from his illinois home in illinois to kenos in august 2020 after police blasted demonstrations following the shooting of a black man jacob blake weapons have long been a powerful political problem in the united states where permissive laws have led to the highest rate of possession of civilian firearms in the world mass shootings which are much rarer in other rich nations have hit the country for decades rittenhouse 17 decided to walk the streets of kenosha in the name of protecting private property from the rebels which caused a special nerve to carry a weapon to the extent that gun rights had to be extended the tragic events that night in august showed that arming a 17 year old with an ar 15 does not make anyone safer giffords the head of the weapons security team said in a statement today s verdict sends a disturbing message that will encourage more custodial violence and killings arms rights organizations and supporters of rittenhouse celebrated the result as a great victory a few minutes after the verdict was handed down the national rifle association posted on twitter nyse the language of the second amendment to the u s constitution they will be torn brandon lesco kenosha was outside the courtroom shouting kyle is released signal he said the verdict was fair someone has to be there to defend the american people who want to burn people i respect that he was there i respect that he carried a weapon he used it properly he used it legally the jury agrees lesco said earlier this week the trial judge dismissed a criminal charge against rittenhouse for illegally possessing the rifle he used in the shooting citing the law s vagueness immediate message the liberals denounced rittenhouse s acquittal as further evidence of a racially biased criminal system rittenhouse like the men he shot is white the fact that a white youth can travel across state borders armed with an assault rifle and engage in armed confrontation without facing criminal liability that can result in multiple deaths is well known in a country where systemic racism continues to corrupt the system margaret huang the president and ceo of the southern poverty law center said in a statement some legal experts were careful to distinguish between the specific facts of rittenhouse s case and the broader message he could send prosecutors had a high level of clarification to convince the jury that rittenhouse had no reasonable fear at the time he was released for his life according to former wisconsin supreme court judge janine geske under state law he was legally allowed to carry his weapon clearly but gesk said he is worried the trial will teach him a wrong lesson when you re protesting or counter protesting it s okay to bring loaded weapons to protect you the echo of that sentiment was echoed by karen bloom and john huber anthony huber s parents one of the men killed by rittenhouse it sends an unacceptable message that armed civilians can appear in any town use the risk they create to justify violence and then shoot people in the street they said in a statement

don mclean tells me my money how his hit still earns him big bucks i ve made millions from american pie and i don t even have to sing it the best financial move that singer don mclean ever made was to fight for ownership of all his songs in the 1980s mclean 76 who shot to fame in 1971 with hit song american pie told donna ferguson that he believes he is consistently one of the world s top earners from september next year he will be performing a 50th anniversary american pie tour around the uk tickets are available via donmclean com what did your parents teach you about money my father taught me not to spend it given he never wanted me to spend it i never had any unless i worked for it the other thing my father put in my head was don t get into debt only buy what you can afford to pay for my father had a white collar job he was district manager for a local utility company in new york my mother didn t work she stayed at home did the laundry cleaned the house made the food and went shopping was money tight when you were growing up my father made a decent living but all the money was spoken for there wasn t any money to throw away or fool around with the play death of a salesman is the story of my father he spent 30 years paying off a 7 000 mortgage and when he had paid it off he burnt the mortgage deeds in an ashtray as they caught fire he said what they say in the play now we are free and clear and then very shortly after that when i was 15 years old he died my mother couldn t afford to stay in the house but i told her if you sell this house i m leaving and i ll never speak to you again so she decided to rent it out and i decided i was going to get out of there and do something with music have you ever struggled to make ends meet no because i never lived beyond my means and i never got into debt i was always able to make a living from music i would give lessons and do little shows play at birthday parties and put on my own shows anything to make a few bucks have you ever been paid silly money my song american pie has been used in a couple of chevrolet adverts and i have earned millions of dollars in licensing fees i didn t have to perform the song or do anything except say yes to a whole lot of money what was the best financial year of your life every year is the best financial year of my life because i do better as i age but if i had to pick one year that was phenomenal it would be 1971 the year american pie was released it went to number one and i went from being a nobody with nothing i was broke to earning more than a million dollars of course taxes and commissions took a lot of that money 70 per cent or more the first thing i did with my newfound success was to buy a house in garrison new york which is a beautiful place to live i also gave my mother the money she needed to be able to move back into her home after years of renting it out she stayed there until the day she died so i overcame fate the most expensive thing you bought for fun i buy a lot of expensive items but the most memorable and the best was an electric blue mercedes 450 sel with palomino leather seats it cost 18 000 in 1973 which would be the equivalent of spending 83 500 on a car today the best money decision you have made to battle for ownership of all my songs in the 1980s i had to fight a number of people in court and finally won everything i d rather not put a figure on how much my catalogue is worth but it s large and lucrative it s possible it s worth a nine figure sum so above 100million how much have you made from american pie i don t have any idea i make money from all my songs of course american pie makes more than the others but not that much more in terms of my career i have made an enormous amount of money over the past 50 years by any standard i have always been in the top one tenth of 1 per cent of earners i m very thankful back on the road don mclean starts a 50th anniversary tour next year do you save into a pension no i used to i started in 1972 now it s paying out i didn t really think about whether saving into a pension was a good way to fund my retirement i was making so much more money than i was putting into that little account i never really thought of it that much and then it grew and grew over the years and got good do you invest directly in the stock market no i don t any more i don t understand this market so i d rather not be involved with it right now in the past i have invested in property and us government bonds which you used to be able to get a high yield from now you can t get anything on anything so it s a good time to sit back if you have money and not invest for a while and watch what s going on do you own any property oh yeah i have four homes two are in maine one of them is a huge estate with 20 bedrooms five kitchens a swimming pool and 175 acres it has blueberry fields that s where i keep my horses i got it very cheaply 30 years ago and it s worth a lot of money now a medium eight figure sum in dollars i also have two homes in palm desert california a really nice house and a condo if you were chancellor what would you do i would stop giving people money for nothing i d ease them out of it i wouldn t stop cold i d give them a six or an eight month plan and say we re going to continue to do what we ve done during the pandemic but the money is going to decrease by 15 per cent every month until it comes down to zero and by that time you re going to have to have a job then these people will have time to realise they had better get off their asses and start to look for work because there is so much work around in america companies can t get anybody to take the jobs what is your number one financial priority to be independent i do not ever want to rely on anybody i value my financial freedom too much
a fractured america is struggling to adopt stakeholder capitalism getty america hungers for unity not divisiveness we sit at a vital moment in history for capitalism one that has created a sharp divide that resonates from the corporate board room to the halls of american democracy and which threatens not only our businesses but our very way of life what we desperately need at this moment of extreme polarity is to reconcile two vastly different views of the state of america s economy expressed by two senators seated on opposites sides of the political aisle these political viewpoints which bring us the system of checks and balances so critical to our country must be put to the side even if temporarily while we forge a path to heal our economy our businesses and our society for the past 40 years american has embraced a shareholder primacy model of capitalism one that produces only one winner the shareholder it has resulted in a devastating socio economic inequality made even more evident by the pandemic when those with less suffered infinitely more this is unacceptable in my view it is a complete repudiation of all that this country has stood for since its founding which is opportunity for all of us not just the lucky few we now must immediately embrace a systemic change and create stakeholder capitalism a system which produces multiple winners the shareholder the employee the business itself the community and the planet stakeholder capitalism i am confident is the only model capable of creating inclusive growth and prosperity for all americans meantime a recent hearing in the senate illustrates that government appears to be divided on which version of capitalism is best suited to our country this is a vitally important debate there is much at stake in the two forms of capitalism being considered the shareholder primacy model or a more evolved version stakeholder capitalism the future prosperity of the american people is in the balance the role of business in society is also part of the debate i turn to the testimony from a recent hearing of the banking house and urban affairs committee with the ceos of the six largest banks in america and cite the starkly opposing views of two senators considered the most powerful leaders in the senate dealing with business issues it is clear that these two elected officials couldn t be further apart in their observations on the economic state of our country these are their words from that hearing senator sherrod brown look what s happened to our country during that time the past 40 years profits have gone up stock prices have soared your own compensation is stratospheric the workers are getting a smaller and smaller share of the wealth they create and they re working harder than ever we have a racial wealth and income gap that s barely budged since we passed the civil rights act in the aftermath of the 2008 great recession where millions lost their jobs wall street still made record profits in a pandemic where half a million americans died we had the highest unemployment since the great depression wall street still made record profits like most americans i want businesses to make money i don t mind that those bankers are rich some people are going to be wealthy that s fine with me here s the problem though under the current system wall street profits no matter what happens to workers because those profits now come at the expense of workers your banks are the ones that largely built that system wall street s interests main street s interests no longer match up the current system treats workers as a cost to be minimized instead of the engine behind their success senator pat toomey so the financial system s contributions to america s economic growth before and during the pandemic are really part of the larger success story of our capitalist system there s no economic system that has lifted more people out of poverty created more opportunity and produced a higher standard of living than democratic capitalism thanks to capitalism life is better for the vast majority of americans today than it s ever been in fact before covid we had the best economy of my lifetime we had the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years for all americans we had across the board wage growth and the wage growth was growing fastest for the lowest income earners so we were narrowing the income gap in fact the very system of economic freedom that my colleagues sometimes criticize was actually creating unprecedented and shared prosperity across america some bank leaders have embraced the so called stakeholder capitalism which really diminishes the primary the primacy of shareholders in our economy and encourages corporations to pursue a social agenda rather than prioritize its responsibility to its owners it s a fact that a well run business always benefits their stakeholders that s the nature of business but management s responsibility is to do so in service to shareholders because they own the company and people who own a company whether it s through shares in a retirement account pension plan college savings account or anything else they rely on a firm s officers to look out for their financial interest making decisions based on social policy objectives rather than profit maximization deprives these shareholders of their rightful property and worse yet once shareholders rights are reduced to the level of all other stakeholders it s up to the company its management to decide whose interest to prioritize i am concerned that sometimes rather than defending this principle of capitalism some of you have embraced so called stakeholder capitalism which really is something different than true capitalism and i would just ask you to reconsider this because stakeholder capitalism is meant to diminish the importance of a company s obligation to shareholders relative to other stakeholders and i think that s a contradiction of the fundamental aspect of capitalism and my point is that if you concede the premise that shareholders don t rank above other stakeholders then it s hard to explain in principle why those criticisms are wrong i think there is a principle to explain why they re wrong and that is that your primary responsibility is to maximize value for your shareholders it s shocking isn t it how can it be that two senators elected by the american people could have such wildly different views of what is actually happening in america one seems to have donned rose colored glasses the other appears to have put on his readers to examine the world around him and sees data that suggests an extremely unequal america as an immigrant and businessperson i started to study the socio economic reality of america about 10 years ago several articles starting in 2015 one in the new york times summarized my scary conclusions in early 2017 my book capitalists arise was published and the myriad of data and analysis support senator brown s position as i have built the case for a better form of capitalism i point to a single example that makes clear our country s pain pre pandemic nearly 60 of american households had to borrow money most months to put food on the table or pay their rent mortgage senator toomey whom i don t know personally makes unsubstantiated false claims which i feel compelled to address i grant him the benefit of the doubt and assume that he is simply uneducated about the facts i will not excuse him for not closely studying these issues given his position of power and influence this senator must be asked to deliberate again for the record he is not alone in his expressed views challenging the claims economic health of the country senator toomey claims that america s economy pre pandemic was great implying for all americans in fact before covid he said we had the best economy in my lifetime we had across the board wage growth wage growth was growing faster for the lowest income so we were narrowing the income gap we had the lowest unemployment in 50 years in fact america is deeply split between some 25 of the haves the shareholder class who own some 90 of the total value of the stock market and 90 of the operating profits of all american businesses operating profit the other 75 of americans have seen their wages with small blips here and there stagnate at or below inflation for the last 40 years and real unemployment meaning the people of working age who should be working 18 55 years old has been growing pre pandemic it reached close to 20 the federal reserve refers to this measure as labor participation which is exactly what real unemployment means the senator referred to the misleading figure of 3 7 or so of workers who have looked actively for a job during the past 4 weeks the other folks have been driven out of the job market by lack of jobs lack of skills poor education driven primarily by poor pay resulting in low real estate taxes in the zip codes where the vast majority of americans live surely the senator should know all this he should at least be curious why america is rated at the top of the developed world in income inequality and also ranks as having the most immobile society among the same peer nations who owns the corporation senator toomey said in his testimony the shareholder owns the company so shareholder primacy must be the role of business in america in his own words management is in service to shareholders because they own the company in fact shareholders of a publicly incorporated company do not own the company there is no law that says they do owners gave up that right when the company incorporated the shareholders have no liability for what happens to a company whose shares they own they come into a stock when they want and leave when they want today they can own a share for literally only milliseconds the corporation owns its own assets the shareholders own a stock certificate with rights and privileges otherwise it would have been an ownership certificate the idea of ownership is nowhere to be found in the stock certificate for more clarity marty lipton a scion of america s corporate law details in fair and unemotional specifics why the shareholder does not own the corporation stakeholder capitalism s social agenda senator toomey claims that stakeholder capitalism pursues a social agenda and it is different than true capitalism in fact stakeholder capitalism is not pursing a social agenda but rather realigns us with the form of capitalism that made the american economy the strongest in the world from 1945 1982 modern capitalism took hold in america and the world and embracing business governance was reflective of multi stakeholder capitalism its purpose was to optimize the interests of the corporation s customers the workers the shareholders and the community in its now famous credo the johnson and johnson corporate purpose document made this capitalist governance exceedingly clear multi stakeholder capitalism is what made america the world s dominant economic and military nation in the world and built a middle class that became the world s largest economy starting around 1982 business with the open collaboration of the government they helped elect changed the business governance from multiple stakeholders to shareholder primacy maximize shorter term shareholder value was the new business mission a set of rules enforced by the financial community with brutal effectiveness it was horribly effective shareholder value went up to unimaginable heights while the other stakeholders became exploited and languished in miserable lows the socio economic devastation that followed for most americans was horrific and the pandemic inflicted further pain and suffering the alarm bell has been sounded capitalism in america must undergo a systemic change current government efforts are on the right track if moving a bit too slowly for my taste but to provide sustained recovery business must produce inclusive growth for all americans senator toomey is quite simply wrong in his assessment of the state of america today the role of stakeholder capitalism and the dire need for change stakeholder capitalism is the only way to help pay workers fairly to ensure that customers remain the most vital stakeholder that the corporation must have the resources to invest for the long term that communities are helped to strive and that we can all pitch in to save the planet as all stakeholder s interests are optimized profits will increase and so will long term shareholder value our very democracy is now teetering in the balance stakeholder capitalism is one of the most essential foundations to provide the nation with inclusive growth and help move our people towards democracy s ultimate goal equal opportunity for all america is hungry for this unity let s begin the process to make it a reality today

photo credit aunging shutterstock the covid 19 pandemic has dramatically reshaped the u s labor market in many ways many low wage jobs in fields like retail and hospitality were lost early in the pandemic and have not come back while throughout the pandemic there has been strong demand for health workers in response to the pandemic and technology specialists who can support an increasingly virtual economy the unemployment rate remains elevated but many industries are facing labor shortages and millions of workers have been leaving their jobs voluntarily in a phenomenon that has come to be known as the great resignation in some cases the pandemic has been an accelerant of labor trends that were already underway like increasing automation and digitalization of jobs in others post pandemic shifts in the labor force will have less to do with the effects of the pandemic than with underlying demographic and economic trends this complicated set of factors is evident in recent projections from the bureau of labor statistics which estimated that total u s employment will grow 7 7 between now and 2030 but only by 1 7 when excluding the economy s recovery from pandemic related job loss one of the demographic trends driving shifts in the workforce is the aging of the population the baby boomers those americans born between 1946 and 1964 number more than 75 million and were the largest generation in u s history until the millennials came along the boomers have until recently tended to represent the largest sections of the labor force and are working later into life than previous generations as a result those aged 55 are expected to represent around a quarter of the workforce for at least the next decade but the aging of the baby boomer generation will have more widespread effects on jobs and the economy as well eventually as this generation ages out of the workforce into retirement more companies will have vacancies and potentially find themselves struggling to fill positions that the boomers once occupied this scenario will put pressure on many employers but could also position younger workers for greater job opportunities a larger population of elderly americans will also bring greater strains on healthcare so more of the economy will need to be oriented around supporting older americans in their later years of life the latter trend is one of the primary reasons why health and human service occupations are projected to be among the fastest growing fields in the years ahead healthcare support jobs are the top field for growth with a total projected growth rate of 23 1 between 2020 and 2030 the related fields of community and social service and healthcare practitioners are also near the top of the list with growth rates of 12 4 and 10 8 respectively one of the other major growth fields is computer and mathematical positions a category that includes professions like programming data science software development and network and systems administration as more of society and the economy become dependent on technology these positions are poised for rapid growth in addition to good job prospects computer and mathematical positions also offer some of the best compensation of any occupational group with a median wage of more than 91 000 at the individual occupation level health related and technology related professions are unsurprisingly among the fastest growing but two of the top three individual occupations for growth are in the lower growth category of installation maintenance and repair occupations wind turbine service technicians and solar photovoltaic installers the field of renewable energy has seen significant growth in recent years and is likely to continue as the costs of renewables decline consumer demand increases and the transition to lower carbon energy sources takes on greater urgency for job seekers interested in reliable jobs and growth opportunities in the years ahead a career in wind or solar energy may be one of the best options out there the data used in this analysis is from the u s bureau of labor statistics employment projections program to identify the fastest growing

nov 20 may have been the final day of the goffs november breeding stock sale but the appetite for fillies and mares that had driven demand during the opening session showed no signs of being sated while the allure of the new always turns heads at sales there is nothing quite like the tried and trusted source of success and quality to set buyers pulses racing and when it comes to broodmares there are few sires who have the cachet of galileo and even fewer pedigrees that can offer the added enticement of inbreeding to his granddam allegretta baroda stud consigned one such gem at goffs in the shape of loyal lot 1406 a 3 year old daughter of the breed shaping sire and who features allegretta 2 x 4 in her pedigree and she duly sparked a bidding war that was won by john o connor of ballylinch stud her dam is a lovely young mare chartreuse and her sister in america expand the map has been second in a very good saratoga maiden on her only start so with a little bit of luck she ll go on said o connor after signing for loyal at 280 000 us 316 878 that form ties in with the best displayed by any 2 year old filly in the united states this year as the winner of the july 22 maiden was none other than pizza bianca who went on to win the breeders cup juvenile fillies turf g1t and was also second in the natalma stakes g1t expand the map is by dark angel and is in training with chad brown for klaravich stables loyal is the first foal out of chartreuse a daughter of lawman and could eventually be joined in the broodmare band by some more siblings by kings of the stallion ranks we have retained a dubawi filly out of her and she has a lope de vega filly foal so there could be a lot to happen in this pedigree added o connor the fact that loyal did not manage to live up to the expectations created by her lofty pedigree on the track does not necessarily preclude success in her second career and as a daughter of galileo the potential for paddocks success remains o connor said everybody knows how good he is as a broodmare sire and some of his daughters who didn t perform on the track have gone on to be good broodmares it could all still happen for her in the next few years and we ll observe with interest what happens around the family the aga khan studs draft reliably provides purchasers with a rich seam to mine and saturday s offerings were no different with eight fillies from some of the aga khan s famous families going under the hammer the most expensive of them proved to be the unraced 3 year old dark angel filly rayagara lot 1349 she is a daughter of debutante stakes g2 winner raydara a rock of gibraltar mare and was bought by bba ireland for 80 000 90 536 photo courtesy of goffs rayagara at goffs richie fitzsimons who signed the docket said she s to go to kodi bear mystery angel who was second in the oaks g1 is out of a dark angel mare so the cross is an exciting one she s a nice filly and the mare has already produced a group 3 placed filly rated 96 with her first runner and was a group 2 winner at 2 herself the sale recorded the highest top price for the session in 15 years and an extraordinary two days of trade ended with turnover increasing by 196 to 16 219 300 18 355 500 both the average and median figures posted significant gains with the former improving by 38 to 43 718 49 476 and the latter up 26 points to 17 000 19 239 goffs group chief executive henry beeby revealed that even though the caliber of the catalog was of the highest class the goffs team was still surprised by the level of trade witnessed over the course of the sale we knew that we had assembled the best catalog for many years as so many major breeding entities had drafts of note but the tempo enthusiasm and hunger to buy was just breathtaking as a huge cast of international buyers both in person and online battled for mare after mare to highlight the enduring attraction of the best irish bloodlines he said the class of 2021 will disperse around the globe as international breeders tap into the class and quality that was offered whilst it was also heartening to see so many local stud farms investing in the future over the six days of the november sale a total of 41 827 300 47 336 300 of foals fillies and mares were sold marking an incredible 81 increase over the aggregate recorded in 2020 the average price of 37 819 42 800 was a gain of 7 4 on last year s figure while the median was up 11 to 20 000 22 634 the strength of trade was reflected in an improved clearance rate of 82
photo credit konstantin l shutterstock the booming real estate market has been one of the most noteworthy stories of the pandemic era economy demand for residential real estate increased early on in the pandemic at a time when living and working space took on greater importance government stimulus in response to covid 19 s economic effects low mortgage interest rates and high savings rates and investment returns have given more households the financial means to enter the real estate market and yet the supply of homes has been historically low for much of this same period only recently returning to pre pandemic levels many current owners have been hesitant to sell and shop for new homes in such a competitive market meanwhile homebuilding has been challenged by supply and building material shortages that have made it hard to keep up with demand the forces of high demand and limited supply have produced dramatic price increases in the housing market since the start of the pandemic while prices had been climbing steadily since the end of the last recession the rate of growth has been much higher since the beginning of 2020 home prices have risen by more than 20 over that period with the typical home price in the u s crossing over 300 000 for the first time in history according to data from zillow the pandemic has also led people to reconsider where they live and work which will have its own effects on housing markets in the u s many employers are now permanently offering telework hybrid schedules or other flexible arrangements that offer employees more choice of where to live meanwhile millennials now the largest living generation are becoming a major force in the real estate market with many looking for affordable places to settle their growing families with these factors at play some states may prove less desirable given their significantly higher price points the geographic disparities between home prices in the u s can be enormous with some states costing more than double the national level for example the median home price in hawaii the most expensive state is 764 146 which is more than twice the national median and over six times more expensive than the median home in west virginia which sells for 118 581 in general states on the coasts like california massachusetts and washington are also among the most expensive locales while homebuyers who prioritize affordability should look to the south and midwest home prices are lower in these regions for a variety of reasons including local laws and ordinances that affect how easy it is to build homes as in places like texas and stagnant or declining populations that reduce demand for housing as in rust belt locations like ohio and michigan to identify the cheapest locations in the u s researchers at porch analyzed county level home price data from zillow the researcher also calculated changes in home price and included median household income data from the census bureau to

there is nothing new under the sun what has been will be again on oct 28 facebook founder mark zuckerberg officially announced to the world on his site that facebook was changing its name to metaverse zuckerberg a modern man has been paving the way for this change for weeks by dropping facebook from the internet for several hours after frances haugen a former manager at facebook appeared before members of congress and disclosed zuckerberg s trickery facebook s share price has fallen on global stock exchanges zuckerberg is said to have lost 7 billion in six hours surprising facebook users who are addicted to zuckerberg s site according to reliable statistics the number of facebook users may be as high as 2 billion users who are accustomed to living on facebook these users are all writers analysts experts and thinkers and some believe they are citizen journalists some television stations now treat these citizen journalists as genuine reporters it s nothing new for people to be spooked by change in the world of technology people have greatly feared such change throughout history when the arabs in basra not china invented gunpowder in the seventh century for example then came the invention of rifles in al andalus during glory days before portuguese explorers crossed over to the new world and slaughtered native americans with this new invention the native american warriors had only swords and bows and arrows to fight with and denied the chance to use european rifles died without mercy the same thing happened when sultan tuman bey defended egypt from invasion by selim i in 1517 people are prisoners of whatever is familiar some are afraid of the new and unknown such people would have been terrified to see the first iron horse trains moving across the land or an automobile which was called an iron devil terrified to hear voices come over the wire after when alexander graham bell invented the telephone or see steel fly through the air in the shape of an airplane and yet they shortly got used to it all the invention of the internet several decades ago was a great surprise and now zuckerberg and his friends have come along and made miracles happen where reality mixes up with the virtual world this shakes up people a bit at first but they soon get used to it and anticipate the next new thing it is merely an invention that has duplicated something old then something new comes along to erase the invention as if it had never existed zuckerberg chose the name meta for metaverse which means a place beyond the universe to signify leaving behind tangible reality for the imaginary through the metaverse people move between time and space but this is nothing new the sufis did this too mixing the imaginary with reality performing supernatural miracles in stories such as the tale of the person who circled the globe on a donkey in a single night or the person who walked on water or the individual who flew without wings often some sufi mystic left behind unbelievable stories about the supernatural although followers take it as a religious creed and incontrovertible truth the philosopher rene descartes said i think therefore i am a phrase that has long occupied philosophers concerned with the state of mind and body and what connects them as well as what separates them zuckerberg s new leap is meant as an escape from the scandals besetting facebook and from how frantically it has been involved in changing the political social and cultural structure of societies creating a new model for a virtual world built according to the whims of the young zuckerberg s employees when zuckerberg invented facebook in his dorm room at harvard in 2004 neither he nor his friends ever imagined that facebook would play such a dangerous role in managing battles taking place thousands of miles away he never imagined facebook would be used to change societies countries and nations that it would become a significant tool in wars of the fourth fifth and sixth generations or that it would play a role in bringing down governments and their leaders this happened with the 45th president donald trump who is now working on his own social media site for supporters trump mocked zuckerberg after he changed facebook s name to meta saying look who s talking editor s note facebook officially changed its name to meta editor s note although accurately translated this quote could not be independently verified

virginia dare after whom vdare com is named was the first child of english parents born in what is now the united states of america on august 18th in 1587 she may be considered the foremother of the historic american nation which is not descended from such rival claimants for the title of first child as snorri porfinnsson allegedly born in vinland in the eleventh century and martin de arguelles born in a part of new spain which is now st augustine florida they were earlier but they were not what america today is descended from culturally as a settler in a land full of what thomas jefferson would later refer to as the merciless indian savages whose known rule of warfare is an undistinguished destruction of all ages sexes and conditions virginia dare was a white minority and as far as we know she and her whole family were either massacred or enslaved by local indians vdare com editor peter brimelow wrote in 1999 when he founded vdare com that i have always been fascinated by the story of virginia dare she was the first english child to be born in the new world in august 1587 shortly after the founding of what was to become known as the lost colony on roanoke island off the north carolina coast it says something about the mettle of those settlers that any pregnant woman would cross the atlantic the equivalent of a lunar expedition at that time and virginia s mother elenor was no less than the daughter of john white the colony s governor perhaps you have to have a daughter yourself to appreciate what white must have felt three years later when he finally returned from a supply trip to england much delayed by the spanish armada the smoke he took at first to be proof of occupation turned out to be brushfires the settlement stood abandoned over a hundred settlers his daughter and granddaughter among them had vanished he would never see them again there s a sort of tradition that virginia dare may have survived assimilated into a local indian tribe and even had descendants there s a legend as distinct from a tradition that she was transformed by shamanic magic into a white doe this may or may not be true wikipedia gives her birthdate and says date of death unknown but if it is it s kind of horrifying tamar jacoby once smeared us criticizing vdare com s immigration restrictionism in the wall street journal that virginia dare is thought to have eventually married into a local indian tribe or to have been killed by it almost equally unfortunate possibilities in the minds of vdare s writers who make no secret of their concern about the way america s original anglo saxon stock is being transformed by immigration at that time i replied that i didn t think like john wayne in the searchers that virginia dare would be off better dead but that yes it would be unpleasant to be kidnapped from a massacred colony and forced to marry into an indian tribe that s why in subsequent years i ve written columns titled virginia dare white minority and on virginia dare s birthday will her fate be the fate of america recently we ve learned that according to the census america s white population is declining in absolute terms and that according to various main stream media thinkers this is a good thing because it means that evil whiteness is declining that s why we shouldn t forget that if you re a white minority you face serious challenges however from the lost colony of virginia rose the american nation and it s been kind of hard to suppress since on virginia dare s birthday let s not forget what the historic american nation created and that it has a future as well as a past previous virginia dare birthday columns
don mclean tells me my money how his hit still earns him big bucks i ve made millions from american pie and i don t even have to sing it the best financial move that singer don mclean ever made was to fight for ownership of all his songs in the 1980s mclean 76 who shot to fame in 1971 with hit song american pie told donna ferguson that he believes he is consistently one of the world s top earners from september next year he will be performing a 50th anniversary american pie tour around the uk tickets are available via donmclean com what did your parents teach you about money my father taught me not to spend it given he never wanted me to spend it i never had any unless i worked for it the other thing my father put in my head was don t get into debt only buy what you can afford to pay for my father had a white collar job he was district manager for a local utility company in new york my mother didn t work she stayed at home did the laundry cleaned the house made the food and went shopping was money tight when you were growing up my father made a decent living but all the money was spoken for there wasn t any money to throw away or fool around with the play death of a salesman is the story of my father he spent 30 years paying off a 7 000 mortgage and when he had paid it off he burnt the mortgage deeds in an ashtray as they caught fire he said what they say in the play now we are free and clear and then very shortly after that when i was 15 years old he died my mother couldn t afford to stay in the house but i told her if you sell this house i m leaving and i ll never speak to you again so she decided to rent it out and i decided i was going to get out of there and do something with music have you ever struggled to make ends meet no because i never lived beyond my means and i never got into debt i was always able to make a living from music i would give lessons and do little shows play at birthday parties and put on my own shows anything to make a few bucks have you ever been paid silly money my song american pie has been used in a couple of chevrolet adverts and i have earned millions of dollars in licensing fees i didn t have to perform the song or do anything except say yes to a whole lot of money what was the best financial year of your life every year is the best financial year of my life because i do better as i age but if i had to pick one year that was phenomenal it would be 1971 the year american pie was released it went to number one and i went from being a nobody with nothing i was broke to earning more than a million dollars of course taxes and commissions took a lot of that money 70 per cent or more the first thing i did with my newfound success was to buy a house in garrison new york which is a beautiful place to live i also gave my mother the money she needed to be able to move back into her home after years of renting it out she stayed there until the day she died so i overcame fate the most expensive thing you bought for fun i buy a lot of expensive items but the most memorable and the best was an electric blue mercedes 450 sel with palomino leather seats it cost 18 000 in 1973 which would be the equivalent of spending 83 500 on a car today the best money decision you have made to battle for ownership of all my songs in the 1980s i had to fight a number of people in court and finally won everything i d rather not put a figure on how much my catalogue is worth but it s large and lucrative it s possible it s worth a nine figure sum so above 100million how much have you made from american pie i don t have any idea i make money from all my songs of course american pie makes more than the others but not that much more in terms of my career i have made an enormous amount of money over the past 50 years by any standard i have always been in the top one tenth of 1 per cent of earners i m very thankful back on the road don mclean starts a 50th anniversary tour next year do you save into a pension no i used to i started in 1972 now it s paying out i didn t really think about whether saving into a pension was a good way to fund my retirement i was making so much more money than i was putting into that little account i never really thought of it that much and then it grew and grew over the years and got good do you invest directly in the stock market no i don t any more i don t understand this market so i d rather not be involved with it right now in the past i have invested in property and us government bonds which you used to be able to get a high yield from now you can t get anything on anything so it s a good time to sit back if you have money and not invest for a while and watch what s going on do you own any property oh yeah i have four homes two are in maine one of them is a huge estate with 20 bedrooms five kitchens a swimming pool and 175 acres it has blueberry fields that s where i keep my horses i got it very cheaply 30 years ago and it s worth a lot of money now a medium eight figure sum in dollars i also have two homes in palm desert california a really nice house and a condo if you were chancellor what would you do i would stop giving people money for nothing i d ease them out of it i wouldn t stop cold i d give them a six or an eight month plan and say we re going to continue to do what we ve done during the pandemic but the money is going to decrease by 15 per cent every month until it comes down to zero and by that time you re going to have to have a job then these people will have time to realise they had better get off their asses and start to look for work because there is so much work around in america companies can t get anybody to take the jobs what is your number one financial priority to be independent i do not ever want to rely on anybody i value my financial freedom too much

here s what i ve learned in a nutshell condensed down to the pithiest summation i can muster running for public office is a pain it s time consuming expensive and downright scary also everyone should do it at least once who s next there are a thousand reasons not to run i recognize the immense privilege which even allowed me to consider a run in the first place but i do think anyone with half a brain and half a heart as well the capacity and opportunity should consider running for public office seriously think of the benefits to society if everyone ran for office at least once it would generate more interest and engagement in the democratic process and we might even get some good candidates elected occasionally so who s next is it you one piece of advice start early it s not a bad idea to start getting your campaign organized a full year before the qualifying period taking stock let s review by the numbers 17 weeks the campaign was only supposed to last for twelve weeks remember the election was postponed five weeks because of hurricane ida it was the right thing for louisiana but it certainly taxed my endurance the campaign was only supposed to last for twelve weeks remember the election was postponed five weeks because of hurricane ida it was the right thing for louisiana but it certainly taxed my endurance 4 candidates i chose the new orleans city council at large division 2 because it appeared to be guaranteed the most media coverage it was an open seat with some high profile contenders this calculation proved correct as far as it goes the race did get more attention in the media frustratingly but predictably my campaign was often ignored in favor of the establishment candidates when jared brossett was arrested for dui subsequently suspending his

louisiana i thought i might also receive the stamp of approval from sunrise movement since they are a climate focused group and i ran a climate focused campaign but for whatever reason that didn t happen antigravity magazine and the local chapter of the dsa didn t endorse me per se but their glowing writeups came close from the outset we made the decision not to pursue endorsements aggressively

hot seat debate on wdsu that was it the most high profile race of the season and it s only covered on tv twice fortunately i was able to mention the need for action on climate both times this was

host of ringside politics in wgso i jumped at the chance though i was uncertain what kind of reception i d get the program skews some pretty far to the right and airs some highly questionable conspiracy theories nevertheless jeff was cordial even friendly and a caller immediately after said i was exactly the kind of candidate we need if only i didn t talk about climate so much sigh my one

didn t talk about climate so much sigh 1 newspaper interview i guess this comes as no surprise we only have one daily paper and goddess knows how journalism has been gutted in recent years i had a great conversation with jessica williams unfortunately very little of that interview made it into print and the paper kept referring to me as a xavier administrator for the record i m just a humble

one was local though yes that s right five only one was local though 0 signs push cards flyers and mailers we made a decision early on to forego all printed materials it makes sense as an

point 3 print ads we did have a couple print ads designed however and we ran these three times locally once in the gambit and twice in the data news weekly i learned that print ads are expensive this

way to the big gambit debate at a busy intersection where the traffic signals have been out of commission since hurricane ida a month later i m still healing penny my trusty campaign coordinator was actually hit by a car we are both lucky we weren t seriously injured statistically speaking this was a weird anomaly i haven t wiped out like that in 21 years of bike commuting nevertheless it highlights the importance of bike safety and how we need to do better by our bicycle riders and pedestrians a key point of my campaign i wiped out on the way to the big gambit debate at a busy

comb and file a campaign finance report the contributions came in mostly small amounts from 43 individuals plus the aforementioned grant i m honored and amazed that people believed in this campaign enough to support it financially thank you that number is a rough estimate i have to go over everything with a fine tooth comb and file a campaign finance report the contributions came in mostly small

saw one advance poll on this election they had me at 2 i only saw one advance poll on this election they had me at 2 7 actual percentage points i actually got 6 5 of the vote but the secretary of state rounds up to be fair to the pollsters the margin of error was 6 so they weren t wrong i actually got 6 5 of the vote but the secretary of state rounds up to be fair to the pollsters the margin of error was 6 so they weren t wrong 4 776 votes received i was expecting 1 500 votes so i was very pleased with this result jp got eight times as many votes as me but i m sure he spent well over a hundred times my total budget a more incisive analysis will be possible once all the campaign finance reports are filed here s a graphical breakdown of the vote from the secretary of state bonus this interactive map lets you zoom around and examine results precinct by precinct the only victory that matters i d like to return now to the definition of victory i offered at the beginning of this campaign if my campaign can raise climate action to the top of the public agenda for the city of new orleans i will consider that a success if my campaign can help to mobilize the community for climate justice i will consider that a victory on election night both of the front runners were on tv talking about my campaign and the voter desire for climate action jp has said he s looking forward to working with me on this for my part i will aim to provide a little more connectivity between our local government and the various activist networks in which i participate we can t say mission accomplished i don t think i ll ever see that day in my lifetime indeed a lot of very smart folks say there s precious little chance for humanity and our so called civilization to avoid very dire outcomes in the very near future climate change is only the biggest challenge of many interconnected crises that doesn t mean we sit idle on the sidelines for me at least it means we must engage deeply and fully with the struggle for justice for now though i m taking a breather as i plot my next move i look forward to re engaging with the greater new orleans interfaith climate coalition and citizens climate lobby and of course the gaian way i encourage you to get involved with them or any of the other numerous groups doing good work on restoring ecological sanity to western civilization

when the weather changes from sizzling summers to winters houbara bustards migrate to our country from russia china and the central asian states to escape the harsh winters the internationally protected bird never knows what kind of reception awaits it on landing here well it s a royal reception arab royals have been given permits to hunt houbara in sindh province the provincial government issued houbara hunting permits for falconry season 2021 2022 fourteen arab royals given permits to hunt the endangered houbara include big names from the royalties of the arab countries different districts of sindh have been allocated to various royals according to their status to sate their passion for houbara hunting when the pti ruled khyber pakhtunkhwa only the party chief didn t allow arab dignitaries to hunt houbara in the province but why houbara and why not any other bird that offers meat more delicious in taste such as the partridge people think that arab royals hunt the houbara as a sport but that s not the only reason the far outweighing aspect of hunting houbara is its aphrodisiac quality whether it s a myth or reality is another matter the royals know better the medical care provided to royal falcons in abu dhabi may be much better than that given to pakistani citizens in government hospitals mary weaver a reporter of the new yorker once covered a houbara hunting trip of the arab dignitaries she stood near the tarmac to witness the spectacle of how an executive learjet landed and a red carpet rolled out to welcome the royal dignitary the learjet was followed by two customised boeings and a fleet of reconfigured c 130s which flew two abreast alongside her stood a local notable who couldn t help commenting and said you know madam these arabs consider houbara an aphrodisiac but some of them madam eat one houbara a day sometimes two if it s a special occasion that means they may eat as many as 500 birds a year so insatiable is the appetite for houbara that tabuk governor prince fahad bin sultan hunted 2 000 houbaras last year and invited the attention of international media and so overexcited the governor was over his cache that he even forgot to pay the mandatory houbara hunting fees of 100 000 according to a press report such a huge cache is transported back to the kingdom in refrigerated planes part of the entourage but what a coincidence that falcon and houbara the predator and its prey are both migratory birds and both migrate to our temperate regions to save themselves from freezing winters of the northern regions since arab royals relish hunting houbaras by falcons the falcons must be poached and trained to bring the houbara down when unleashed on the clumsily flying bird falcons are therefore netted and sold to the traffickers who pass them on to the agents of the royal enthusiasts in the gulf states reportedly last october the authorities seized dozens of falcons whose worth in gulf markets amounted to more than 1 million according to a falcon conservationist falcon poaching in pakistan has developed into an industry in itself netting falcons and dispatching them to the gulf states has become a thriving trade no wonder that margit muller director of a falcon hospital in abu dhabi said that the hospital treated more than 11 000 falcons annually the medical care provided to royal falcons in abu dhabi may be much better than medical attention given to pakistani citizens of the lower strata of society in the local government hospitals the irony however is that royals are multiplying while the houbara population is dwindling in neighbouring india houbara hunting has been banned since 1970 but we continue to give hunting permits to arab royals not only to keep them in good humour but also to earn their favours after all saudis do provide us badly needed forex even if it s only meant for the purpose of showing deposits to negotiate imf loans this kind of situation often arises when a nation lives beyond its means if the houbara goes extinct it matters less nonetheless the aphrodisiac efficacy of the houbara bustard remains debatable maybe it s nature s way of controlling the houbara population by instilling an overpowering desire in the arab royalty to hunt and stock the prized possession to last until the next hunting season the anti climax is that what the royals consider an aphrodisiac the doctors think is only diuretic try a houbara if you like the writer is a lahore based columnist and can be reached at pinecity gmail com

weeks after a red wave slammed new jersey and virginia democrats are still reeling to quote democratic strategist lanae erickson if house elections had to be held on the day of the virginia elections we would have lost 50 seats the writing is on the wall and that writing is public opinion in terms of congressional outlook republicans are currently polling ahead of democrats by 10 percentage points their largest lead since the early 1980s when it comes to handling crime republicans hold a 22 point advantage on the issue of inflation more pressing with each passing day it extends to 24 points border security americans trust the republican party by a 27 point margin yes people still believe in borders and no they do not support six figure payouts to illegal immigrants making matters worse for democrats the liberal base is not energized by the failures of the biden administration uninspired by press conferences with stock questions and scripted answers under half of biden voters expect to vote next year democrats beware nov 2 was just the beginning we are in the midst of a second american revolution characterized by a massive and mounting disdain for president biden and his left wing platform back in june i warned the biden administration about the red wave approaching as i wrote our founding fathers gave us a republic by which our revolutions are fought at the ballot box indeed it was fought in new jersey where the senate president was taken down by an upstart it was fought in virginia where republicans won the governorship and two other statewide races while regaining the majority in the house of delegates and americans are still fighting despite the incessant wailing of the radical left americans are seeing what happens when good faith people rise up to fight for their children their businesses and the american way of life when small businesses were summarily deemed non essential and shut down last year while big box stores and fast food chains remained open americans were infuriated when schools were closed and childhood education was put on hold americans were enraged when schools were reopened yet reserved for mask wearers despite minimal covid related risks americans were outraged when children were forced to confront propaganda like critical race theory and white privilege in the classroom americans were frustrated yet again this month americans told the democratic party enough the more democrats and their allies promote policies with little to no support the more that everyday americans will fight back if biden dares to define parents as domestic terrorists he and his allies will face their wrath at the ballot box people will organize and mobilize on election day as one democrat in virginia acknowledged voted straight ticket republican today first time in my life the democrats who kept my kids under house arrest all of last year didn t get a single vote from me and in the end former gov terry mcauliffe lost a state that biden won by double digits just one year earlier hispanic voters some of whom became first time republicans because of the biden administration went for glenn youngkin by an 11 point margin yet democrats like alexandria ocasio cortez blame the virginia loss on centrism urging her party to become even more left wing for lawmakers like her the 2022 midterms will be another rude awakening november 2021 was no fluke republicans have every reason to be optimistic about the months to come they have every reason to be encouraged by the americans organizing and mobilizing to take back their schools their districts and the entire country in the end it will not be the republican party that wins the 2022 midterms the second american revolution it will be the decent hard working fathers and mothers who stood up for their nation which side will you be on ted harvey is chairman of the anti biden committee to defeat the president he wrote this for insidesources com

even as biden secures long awaited progress on his legislative agenda the white house is weighing action to confront other problems they are considering whether to escalate an attack on parts of corporate america over rising consumer prices according to an administration official and three people with knowledge of the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private meetings several outside advisers have pitched senior white house officials including white house chief of staff ron klain and white house national economic council director brian deese on an offensive in which the administration would amplify criticisms of large firms in heavily concentrated industries for passing higher prices on to consumers as they benefit from high profits the people familiar with the matter said the effort would be aimed at both directing voters attention to companies over inflation as well as giving companies a reason to think twice before raising prices but the push could backfire should it antagonize many of the firms it is highly dependent to resolve supply chain pressures ahead of the holiday season the white house took a step in this direction earlier this week with biden urging the federal trade commission to escalate its investigation of anti competitive behavior in the oil and gas industry which the president alleged was leading to higher prices for drivers at the pump administration officials have discussed launching similar measures with aides discussing calling attention to consolidation in the grocery sector as food prices rise two people familiar with the matter said a senior white house official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect internal thinking said the administration has been focused since the beginning of the administration on antitrust measures from housing to agriculture aimed in part at reducing consumer costs senior white house officials published an analysis in september on the role of concentration in the meatpacking industry on higher prices the administration has also already appointed a number of aggressive antitrust advocates to key positions the white house is working to make clear inflation is not happening for organic reasons it s happening because it s profitable for enormous corporations to raise prices on consumers said sarah miller executive director of the american economic liberties project a think tank that supports aggressive antitrust policy who said her views had been made clear to the administration miller acknowledged biden s letter to the ftc about oil and gas companies but said i think that strategy can be expanded through resources the white house has to do a broader and more urgent investigation into rising prices in key industries for consumers and identifying excess profits that s resulting in they should do that now many economists are skeptical of whether publicly cajoling firms would actually lead them to lower their prices and biden has leaned heavily on the heads of companies such as fedex walmart and target over the supply chain crunch with the administration just this month touting executives commitments to stock their shelves ahead of the holidays it is unclear how these corporations would react to being criticized over corporate consolidation conservative and even some nonpartisan economic experts say that trends in consolidation since the start of the pandemic do not explain a massive increase in inflationary expectations over the last year this is just a fantasy there s no corporate consolidation that explains it said douglas holtz eakin a republican policy analyst this is just an attempt to change the subject the white house has found itself hemmed in on short term price pressures even amid the advancements of the bipartisan infrastructure law and social spending bill which are primarily intended to address long term structural problems in the economy one of the federal government s most traditional ways of dealing with inflation is through actions by the federal reserve and biden is expected to announce whom he will nominate to lead the agency in the next few days fed chair jerome powell s four year term expires in early 2022 in a previously undisclosed meeting at the white house on monday a bipartisan group of 10 centrist senators met with biden around the signing of the bipartisan infrastructure law that they had helped broker biden gave comments to the group that were highly complimentary of powell two people who attended the meeting told the washington post speaking on the condition of anonymity to reveal details of the private conversation a white house spokesman said that the president had not yet made a decision about the fed selection but later the same week powell came under increasing attack from two democratic senators who joined sen elizabeth warren d mass in opposing the renomination of the central bank chair democratic sens jeff merkley of oregon and sheldon whitehouse of rhode island said powell had not done enough to use the regulatory power of the central bank to address the financial risks of climate change president biden must appoint a fed chair who will ensure the fed is fulfilling its mandate to safeguard our financial system and shares the administration s view that fighting climate change is the responsibility of every policymaker merkley and whitehouse said that person is not jerome h powell despite the internal divisions the white house was buoyed friday by passage through the house of the build back better legislation the bill would devote more than 2 trillion to dozens of key policy priorities and the administration is eager to tout improvements to early childhood education energy policy health care housing and other key policy areas where americans are facing high costs it puts us on the path to build our economy back better than before by rebuilding the backbone of america working people and the middle class biden said in a statement after the bill passed the house conservatives have blasted the measure with rep jason smith r mo saying in a statement washington democrats have spent months consumed by infighting and backroom dealmaking in pursuit of a partisan tax and spending agenda that bankrupts our economy benefits the wealthy and builds the washington bureaucracy the legislation will now head to the senate where sens kyrsten sinema d ariz and joe manchin d w va have made clear it will have to undergo key changes before it can be approved the revised package from the senate

but a retirement savings system rooted in australia s industrial relations system also is inherently politicised that planted the seed of today s industrial relations based superannuation system rather than the government run pension top up scheme proposed by the whitlam commissioned hancock inquiry as the financial review editorialised in 1979 union run super funds might even give workers a direct stake in the profitability of the corporate sector and co opting the union movement away from its tradition of militant demands that ended up hurting workers apart from some outrageous exceptions that has been the case with most industry super funds such as australian super and uni super as they have exploited compulsory employer super contributions to quickly build large scale funds mostly by default by and large compulsory super has helped to build a bigger pool of australian savings that has helped stabilise a commodity exporting economy yet the result of the history spelled out by pamela williams is that industry super funds owned by a handful of unions and industrial relations club employer associations but with no capital backing could account for half of a 9 trillion super pool by 2041 that would dwarf both the banks and the sharemarket advertisement one of the great ironies is that a superannuation system devised by labor and the unions now encourages the shift of wealth creating companies such as sydney airport from publicly listed stock exchanges to the less transparent private equity space but a retirement savings system rooted in australia s industrial relations system also is inherently politicised as underlined by the actu s aggressive response to the governance issues canvassed by the financial review an institution that in effect has been granted custodianship over the retirement savings of millions of australians most of whom are not union members must go above and beyond in separating its own institutional interests from those of its super fund members none of whom get a vote in how their fund is governed of course the history of australia s superannuation system we tell today should be supplemented by the decline of the dominant life mutuals of the 1960s and 70s such as amp and mlc the rise and fall of the banks bancassurance model and the banks retreat from wealth management and financial advice following their failings exposed by the hayne royal commission all covered by the financial review over the past 70 years the upshot now is that australia s largest financial institutions offer almost no financial advice at all and very little investment management to help millions of customers make good decisions about their household wealth the vacuum has encouraged new entrants and innovation from sharemarket trading platforms akin to america s robinhood to millennial pitched super funds backed by american venture capital firms hundreds of thousands of young australians now access financial markets regularly via their smartphones as covered by the financial review s wealth generation franchise the story of australia s savings system from industry super s first step in 1985 is far from finished
bloomberg bloomberg bloomberg it was another tough week in a brutal year for bears despite being right about many aspects of inflation monetary policy and the persistence of the coronavirus equity bears who were expecting anything to put a meaningful brake on the stock market were again denied investors limped into the week amid incontrovertible evidence price pressures are building in the economy amid a market rally that has sent the s p 500 up 25 in 2021 then retail sales jumped the most in seven months home depot inc posted stellar results and regional manufacturing measures soared past forecasts barely a week after the fastest jump in consumer prices in three decades the s p 500 hit its 66th record of the year on thursday wall street forecasters have been saying all year that a slowdown in the 20 month bull market would be natural with valuations stretched growth forecast to slow and the federal reserve expected to hike interest rates in 2022 but so far in the fourth quarter consumers continue to defy the pessimism a fed model of economic growth is on track to exceed almost all projections in a bloomberg survey of economists the recovery happened much more quickly in 2021 than anyone had predicted chris gaffney president of world markets at tiaa bank said in a phone interview it s realistic to think that markets are not going to be able to repeat 2021 which will go down as a very good year the resilience is doing little to dissipate gloom among strategists when it comes to 2022 the average projection for the s p 500 at the end of 2022 is 4 843 representing a mere 3 advance from the current level that counts as the least optimistic outlook behind only 2019 in two decades of data chalk up caution among the normally bullish group to an unorthodox recovery that has played havoc with forecasts take the latest week when many were convinced strained supply would hamper growth instead retailers were bragging about their ability to build inventories ahead of the holidays and jobless claims fell to a new pandemic era low signaling a still strong labor market stocks advanced for a sixth week in seven with the s p 500 rising 0 3 as countries in europe announced new travel restrictions amid a fresh wave of pandemic cases investors again sought safety in the usual beneficiaries of a stay at home economy software and internet stocks the tech heavy nasdaq 100 outperformed jumping more than 2 strategists are not alone in finding it difficult to make predictions in the pandemic era single stock analysts have watched companies beat the average estimate for earnings per share by an unprecedented amount economists and central bankers have seen their view on inflation being transitory run into against a multi month surge in consumer prices in the end the stock pessimists are almost surely staring at a year where their forecasts for equities missed badly in january the highest year end target was 4 400 the s p 500 ended friday just below 4 700 being wrong about the pace of the recovery in 2021 hasn t fostered optimism among strategists for 2022 they now see the predicted slump in the rate of economic growth occurring next year with gains hampered by the fed s tightening cycle that could include the first rate hike since the pandemic began with so much future growth priced into equities the market has become unusually sensitive to the rise of interest rates according to bank of america corp strategist savita subramanian an increase of 1 percentage point in the discount rate could send the s p 500 into a tailspin that takes it to 3 600 her team s model shows on the other hand a rate drop of similar size would push the stock benchmark to 6 300 a small increase in the discount rate could roil equities subramanian who expects the s p 500 to end 2022 at 4 600 wrote in a recent note to clients but we cannot ignore the opposite scenario helping underpin this year s 12 trillion stock rally is a string of corporate earnings that has defied all the concerns ranging from supply chain snarls to labor shortages and commodity inflation up more than 40 in each of the first three quarters profits rather than price earnings multiples have accounted for all the share gains that kind of boom however is unlikely to last prognosticators say s p 500 profit growth will weaken to roughly 8 in 2022 analyst estimates compiled by bloomberg intelligence show while that doesn t necessarily spell trouble for the market it threatens to remove some buffer should rates start to creep up ned davis research compared the s p 500 s earnings yield how big profits are relative to share prices to inflation adjusted 10 year treasury yields and found that the lower premium that stocks offer over bonds the worse they perform since 1984 when the spread was below its 12 month average the s p 500 tended to rise 7 3 a year that s 4 percentage points behind the return when the spread was above the mean at the end of october the gap sat near its average the risk of potentially higher rates pressuring equity p e ratios is partly why morgan stanley sees the s p 500 finishing next year at 4 400 a forecast that s the lowest among those tracked by bloomberg we re still predicting 10 earnings growth the key linchpin in the equation is interest rates daniel skelly head of equity model portfolio solutions at morgan stanley said in an interview on bloomberg surveillance we think risk reward at the index level is unexciting at this point not everyone s pessimistic though equity bulls point to favorable trends in money flows as one reason to stay invested thanks to zero commissions at brokers and pandemic lockdowns a new generation of retail traders have emerged to help propel the market another pillar of support comes from corporate buybacks u s firms have announced plans to buy 1 1 trillion of their own shares since january almost triple the level at this time last year and poised to surpass the record set in 2018 data compiled by birinyi associates and bloomberg show net demand for equities from corporations and households will total 550 billion in 2022 according to estimates from goldman sachs group inc strategist david kostin he expects the s p 500 to finish the year at 5 100 to brian belski bmo s chief investment strategist all the worries over a growth slowdown or fed tightening set the stage for the bull market to keep going we do not believe the returns registered in 2020 2021 are sustainable belski wrote in a note earlier in the week 2022 will be a year of less positive yet positive nonetheless think of it as a much deserved respite of sorts
by nathaniel meyersohn cnn business cvs announcement thursday that it will close 900 stores over the next three years around 10 of its pharmacies may have caught some shoppers off guard isn t cvs doing really well right now haven t lots of people gone to drug stores during the pandemic to stock up on hand sanitizer cleaning wipes and toilet paper what about all those covid 19 vaccine shots cvs gives out actually cvs closures shouldn t come as a surprise they are the latest moves in the long running contraction of the us retail pharmacy sector cvs walgreens and rite aid have been shuttering stores for years while independent pharmacies have come under pressure from chains drug store closures can hurt local communities creating access gaps for medications and essentials cvs the largest drug store chain in the united states pointed to changes in population consumer buying patterns and future health needs as factors in its decision to close stores here s why cvs will close 900 stores pivot to health care the future of cvs is not selling snacks candy shampoo and greeting cards it s in health care to that end in 2018 cvs completed a 69 billion acquisition of aetna the largest health care deal in history to create a gigantic customer base of about 40 million americans cvs bet that the deal will increase its profits from those patients health plans while helping to lower its costs cvs also has been revamping its retail strategy and said thursday that its stores will have three distinct models locations that offer primary care services healthhub stores that have on site dieticians nurse practitioners and lab services and on site treatment for chronic conditions such as diabetes and asthma and traditional stores cvs is really pivoting and leaning into the health care aspects of the business said george hill an analyst who covers the company and the health care industry at deutsche bank you d much rather be selling health care services that are high dollar value high margin versus greeting cards too many stores when you walk down the street or drive around the suburbs you ll typically pass a cvs and then hit a walgreens right next door rite aid is probably pretty close too there s too many pharmacies in the country and there s too much pharmacy capacity that gives cvs a reason to go said hill cvs closed 244 stores between 2018 and 2020 yet it still has more than 9 900 stores that s more than walmart target kroger and costco combined its latest closings will reduce store density in certain locations cvs said thursday which translates into the fact that cvs has too many stores too close to each other in some places competition from amazon and dollar general also fewer people are heading to cvs and other drug stores to fill their prescriptions and shop for household staples these days and they re not going into cvs to buy tobacco either which the company stopped selling in 2014 some shoppers have replaced their trips to stores like cvs by buying their supplies online from amazon or from brick and mortar giants like walmart and target the chains have built their own strong e commerce businesses in recent years dollar general has also grabbed market share from drug stores undercutting the sector with lower prices on similar items and now dollar general is launching its own health care initiative as it continues to take business from pharmacies online pharmacies and telemedicine have gained traction too amazon bought pillpack in 2018 for more than 700 million and started shipping prescriptions to prime members last year capsule and other digital pharmacies that deliver directly to customers homes are also growing although brick and mortar pharmacies are still an important stop for many elderly people or those who don t use the web or have access to it they are increasingly becoming a thing of the past to the growing ranks of online shoppers rising costs closing stores also reduces cvs costs while still keeping most of its sales its labor and store operations costs increased during the pandemic because of safety protections like plexiglass floor decals and masks the company said in august it planned to raise its minimum wage to 15 an hour from 11 in a bid to retain and attract workers there are cost pressures in all directions said hill the deutsche bank analyst seventy five percent of cvs sales comes from filling prescriptions but its profits from that segment have declined in recent years because of lower reimbursement rates but when cvs closes a store it can hold onto most of those sales by shifting the prescriptions to its nearest pharmacies hill said covid 19 vaccines weren t a huge boost cvs got a lift from people coming into its stores for their covid 19 vaccines and tests the company has administered 43 million vaccines and around 38 million tests ceo karen lynch said on an earnings call earlier this month but the vaccines were only a short term gain for the company which said they will generate only 3 billion in revenue in 2021 that will decline by up to 40 next year along with whatever sales cvs racked up as shoppers browsed aisles while they waited to get vaccinated lynch said people also visited their doctors less frequently last year and into 2021 and elective procedures were suspended early in the pandemic which meant that cvs filled fewer regular and chronic care prescriptions than in the years before the pandemic and fewer people have also been coming into stores to pick up cough and fever medicines big business for cvs because they re still wearing masks and spending more time at home than they once did the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved

for 30 years philp has fished scotland s seas what s happened in that time has been an environmental disaster he says philp is a creel fisherman small boats like his fish in our inshore waters sending down divers for scallops or using pots known as creels to catch crab and lobster it s the sustainable way to fish however trawlers have been given free rein to come into scotland s inshore waters and rip up the seabed as they scoop out their catch according to fishermen like philp tonnes of marine life is discarded and wasted underwater plant life is destroyed habitats and ecosystems ruined philp national co ordinator of the scottish creel fishermen s federation which represents 400 fishermen across scotland lays the blame squarely with the scottish government edinburgh has presided over the ruination of scotland s inshore waters creel fishermen claim x a three mile inshore exclusion zone should be established around scotland prohibiting trawlers they say in this new environmental age they believe inshore fishing should be low impact and sustainable to allow the sea to recover trawlers ploughing the sea release masses of carbon it s not just about the environment or even the livelihoods of the creel fishermen struggling for a catch in plundered seas it s about national economics too rebalancing how scotland fishes giving creelers like philp a fair crack of the whip in inshore waters would bring in more money from exports and increase jobs it is claimed creelers think it s a no brainer a vote winner so why on earth ask fishermen like philp is the snp government pursuing its current policies creelers worry that because of brexit support among the scottish public for them is low and allows the government to sideline their environmental and economic warnings the irony is that creelers voted against brexit en masse knowing it would only add to their woes when it comes to shellfish brexit now means that every kilo exported costs 2 50 more that s enough to ruin some businesses on tiny margins the skipper there s only remnants of habitats left in our coastal waters and what is left must be protected philp says in argyll 50 per cent of flame shells which make up biogenic reefs are gone around 90 of seagrass in the western isles has gone philp says fragile serpulid reefs are disappearing trawlers have devastated these ecosystems marine scotland which is responsibility for scotland s seas has been an abject failure when it comes to protecting the environment and they ll continue to fail so long as they allow unregulated trawling right up to the shoreline says philp we need low impact fishing in this coastal zone which will protect these ecosystems and allow them to recover what s going on is disastrous frightening small creel boats fish inshore deeper treacherous seas make their job impossible there isn t a single inshore vessel which makes a living catching fish anymore says philp it s 100 shellfish he says everything else is effectively gone along with the habitats which support them philp adds we ve pretty much made every single species of fish which was once fished inshore commercially extinct shellfish are quite literally the very last creatures that can be pulled from the sea philp even brought the creel fishermen s plight to cop26 yet still nobody in government heeds their warnings bally the actions of trawlers are akin to ploughing on land he says the problem is that you can plough 95 of scotland s seabed legally the effect is the forests which once nurtured fish the nurseries of juvenile fish they re disappearing creelers believe the narrative is controlled by the big trawler industry and marine scotland the wee guys aren t at the table he says that s why the creel federation was set up its message is conservation in order to save fishing communities to philp the current way scotland runs the seas is stuck in the 1970s and 80s but society is in the 2020s it s not cool to destroy ecosystems anymore the fact that the government allows inshore trawling to continue is absolute madness there s no excuse left for not creating an inshore zone with a sense of urgency he says that if a three mile exclusion zone was set up to protect the environment and create sustainable fishing then trawlers should be compensated for any loss by the scottish government any transition must be just he says there are claims trawlers bully creelers telling them to move from areas they want to fish or destroying creeler fishing gear when they dredge the creel federation sneers at scottish government claims that the seas are well protected it says government claims that 37 of seas are in protected areas are misleading and insist only 2 5 of marine protected areas have effective measures introduced to ensure protection the old hand before philp took over alistair sinclair was the federation s national co ordinator for sinclair now retired the problem is the domination of big business money rules the pound comes before communities he says sinclair who has driven the fight for change was fishing commercially back in 1984 when a three mile limit around scotland s shoreline was scrapped scotland s seas are in terminal decline he says from 1984 it became a race to fish there s been no proper management of inshore waters it s not as if the government doesn t know what s happening he explains back in 2007 information came to light which showed that in the clyde fishery trawlers were catching and discarding 31 million juvenile fish per year we want the public to understand what s going on beneath the waves what s happening is being done underwater where it can t be seen says sinclair the lawyer the federation has already taken the scottish government to court the government asked for suggestions to improve the seas the creelers sent in their plans and in a ruckus which landed before a judicial review ministers were found to have turned the idea down solely due to opposition from the trawling industry creelers say the finding proves their point that the scottish government is in thrall to trawling at the expense of the environment it is thought that the scottish government s costs for the legal fight including its ongoing appeal could exceed 100 000 in public money robert younger from fish legal is the lawyer who helped creelers fight the case what disturbs me most he says is that i d fondly imagined that what lay under the inshore waters was in a healthy state with healthy fish populations that the seabed was healthy what i discovered is that there s been an armageddon under our seas what you re seeing is pretty much every bit of the seafloor pummelled by the use of very heavy machinery that leaves very little space for healthy ecology and ecosystems to survive younger says in the firth of clyde it s virtually impossible for a fish to get much beyond 5cms because they get scooped out in trawl nets adding healthy fish populations have pretty much disappeared so much has been lost marine scotland don t seem to care we just have hollow promises to improve ecology and in every instance the same wall is met and that s opposition from so long as we ve fisheries management that s done on measures agreeable to them nothing will change he sees the creelers campaign as a david and goliath battle and helped found the federation to advocate for low impact fishing salmon farming is also helping destroy inshore fishing with toxins from fish farms spilling into the sea he says the massive supply chain of salmon farming leaves a heavy carbon footprint too he is scathing of the scottish government if you read a lot of their literature you d think scotland was in a kind of permanent blue planet haven the leading fisheries nation in the world there s a total disconnect between the reality and the propaganda he thinks that post cop26 environmental arguments may force change in government policy inshore waters are a huge carbon sink he says the fact they re constantly raked over by trawlers could be decisive in pushing things over the edge the seafloor is the driver of marine health we need to remind ourselves that we actually can turn things around and make positive change the scientist dr sally campbell has a lifetime of marine ecology behind her she worked with the world famous scripps institute of oceanography in california now she s with the creel federation providing the science for its campaign to set up a trawler exclusion zone and create sustainable inshore fishing the inshore waters of scotland campbell says were rich in fish but that went in 1984 with the change to the three mile limit prior to that there was protection from trawling they had a bonanza in the inshore waters and it s got so depleted that what we re left with is some shellfish she adds what we lost was areas of seabed there was wonderful seagrass kelp areas of loose gravel so cod could lay their eggs and not be disturbed we ve a serious problem in inshore waters areas designated marine priority features haven t been properly protected she says we ve had decimation of some of those prime areas it s been appallingly managed if trawlers were kept out of inshore waters there d be amazing regeneration if you leave nature alone it will solve a lot of its own problems campbell also points to the destruction of sea angling once a huge source of jobs in tourism that s a great sadness she says when it comes to the trawling industry says campbell government ministers need to stop meeting with lobbyists and being wined and dined she points out that england although far from perfect is managing inshore waters better than scotland english inshore fisheries conservation authorities have shown themselves willing to heavily fine illegal trawling in sussex a two mile inshore trawling ban is in place to protect kelp forests nobody in scotland gets fined for anything as far as i can see campbell adds we need teeth in compliance we need to police the marine environment the way we police the streets our seabed must be allowed to recover after years of being degraded we ve fished out in all the major stocks we re fishing out our inshore waters to the base of what s left we need to resurrect that it would be a 10 year project the economist alan radford has been an economist his entire working life lecturing in environmental economics at university and specialising in fisheries he s carried out studies for marine scotland and is now on the management board of the creel federation marine scotland he says has a policy of letting trawlers fish where they like they say it s more profitable than creeling however the claims of the scottish government are economically incoherent he adds there isn t a single economic performance indicator per tonne caught where the average trawler is better radford says in a comparison of profits per tonne creelers are far more economically efficient than trawlers a creeler s high quality produce crucially caught live by hand and in creels sells for around 13 000 per liveweight tonne trawler catches which often bring up dead and mangled shellfish sell for between 1 750 5 000 per tonne depending on the quality huge amounts are discarded he says often up to two thirds in weight is thrown overboard as it s mashed up to favour trawlers over creels is economic madness he says which ignores the environmental consequences and the jobs that have been lost radford adds usually if you get poor economic performance you can say it s good for the environment or if you get bad environmental performance you can say it s justified by jobs with this there s no economic or environmental reason it s nuts trawlers shouldn t operate in areas where creelers can profitably operate at the heart of this there s dreadful market failure there s no competition in allocating the seabed like in agriculture where if i want to farm i have to outbid someone else if there was a hypothetical market for the seabed the average profits per liveweight tonne for creelers would be 600 the average trawler profit s about 180 330 so trawlers would never get access to the seabed as they d be outbid the market would say sorry there shouldn t be any trawlers in this area when it comes to the environment radford says if this was happening on dry land people would be appalled if the government wants to say it supports trawling irrespective of economic coherence or environmental tragedy then fine at least that would be honest a life changed alasdair hughson is six miles west of ullapool in his boat the auk he is the chair of the creel federation today hughson is fishing in one of the few inshore spots he says which genuinely has benefited from marine protection he talks as he keeps one eye on his diver in the water the mountains looming in the distance seven years ago this was in such a poor state you couldn t fish any more but since 2015 there s not been any legal dredging and we ve noticed a massive difference there s a lot more stock it s amazing how quickly it recovered we re seeing seaweed recovering little fish swimming about if only all inshore waters were similarly respected hughson says scotland would be on a good path the failure is down to regulator capture of marine scotland by big business we keep asking ourselves why the government won t act all we can think is cronyism the trawling industry is well funded and organised with a large staff and time to plan we ve none of that hughson laments what s happened to the seas he loves when you go down to a healthy seabed you see it purple with maerl and slow growing seaweed and lots of species living among it that stabilises the seabed stops it moving the same way trees hold the earth together then you come along with a dredger and just rip it apart a trashed seabed is like a desert you ve taken all the life out of it broken the ability of the seabed to hold together some areas will never recover there s hundreds and thousands of square miles utterly trashed the reality says hughson is far worse than just increased costs and lower productivity it s changed our entire way of life with shellfish so hard to find fishermen like hughson are now completely nomadic living aboard our vessels spending weeks in one spot before moving on to the next he adds the outlay and cost for the larger boats capable of living aboard has crippled us almost bankrupted us at times it wasn t always this way if it wasn t for scallop dredging inshore we d likely still be using small fast boats working two or three areas most importantly we d be home at night it could have been so different had marine scotland done their job correctly that s the effect of this on my life scots gov says a scottish government spokesperson said the vast majority of stakeholders will not recognise the scenario portrayed by this series of unfounded claims from members of the scottish creel fishermen s federation our marine protected areas network already covers 37 of our seas and we are committed to delivering fisheries management measures for existing sites where these are not already in place by march 2024 we will also designate highly protected marine areas covering at least 10 of our seas by 2026 which will exclude all fishing activities to complement these measures we will also consult on introducing a cap on fishing activity in inshore waters that will limit activity to current levels these elements of the co operation agreement with the scottish green party will help ensure scotland leads the way on marine environmental protection and will enhance our reputation for providing quality sustainable seafood and position us well to deliver a green recovery the agreement builds on our fisheries management strategy which sets out policy initiatives for the next 10 years and helps ensure that we manage our sea fisheries in a responsible and sustainable way for future generations the scottish government is wholly committed to the sustainable development of our fishing industry

sign up for daily news updates from cleantechnica on email or follow us on google news thanks to numerous comments on my first article i am including many of the electric things i missed in my first version of electric everything the smallest electric vehicle on the market these days may be the electric skateboard this one is capable of speeds up to 34 mph one of the comments on my previous electric everything article was that i had left out electric gardening equipment since my main focus was on electric mobility i forgot to include electric gardening tools also all kinds of hand tools like drivers jigsaws routers pneumatic nail guns and impact wrenches have been essentially electric forever more recently almost all of these tools now come battery powered so workmen no longer have to find an outlet and drag a power cord or air hose around look at the photo above we see electric riding lawnmowers electric chainsaws electric leaf blowers etc along with all the spare battery packs and chargers necessary to make them all work today you can go down to any home depot lows or harbor freight and come home with an electric lawnmower with enough power and spare battery packs to mow a decent sized lawn here s another thing i missed in my first version of everything electric the seabob from cayago anyone who has spent time in bangkok thailand new delhi india hanoi vietnam or almost any developing country in asia has seen and ridden in one of the 3 wheeled 2 cycle air polluting tuk tuks that dominate in those cities companies like gmw see below are leading the charge to electrify and clean up those cities if you have ever been around a ski resort traveled in yellowstone in the winter or traversed any of the endless miles of snowmobile trails of northern wisconsin minnesota and michigan you know that snowmobiles are used both for work and play the electric snowmobile in the photo above was developed by aurora powertrains of rovaniemi finland electric cars are no longer just personal vehicles they are also work cars police vehicles taxis ambulances etc then there are the electric buses how could we skip those many us cities and municipalities are experimenting with electric busses so far that s normally just a handful in each location but there are hundreds in some cities and thousands in some chinese cities out of almost 425 000 electric buses worldwide at the end of last year some 421 000 were in china the global electric bus fleet grew about 32 in 2018 the city of shenzhen alone has over 16 000 electric busses and 22 000 electric taxis it is the home of the byd electric battery car and bus company an obvious omission in my first article was electric passenger trains they are virtually nonexistent in the us but very common in europe and china in the figure above the tgv streaks through the french countryside at 200 mph near the small village of la bonnardelière speeds almost incomprehensible for americans the speed record for the tgv is over 350 mph the tgv in france and ice trains in the rest of continental europe make train travel an attractive alternative to air travel the world high speed train network consists of 6 552 miles in europe 24 653 miles in china and zero miles of true high speed rail network in the us however this may improve slightly by next year amtrak has purchased upgraded train sets from alstom which tilt on the turns allowing faster speeds the new trains are expected to operate up to a top speed of 160 miles per hour 10 mph faster than the current generation of rolling stock the increase might seem small but the design of the train isn t the limiting factor alstom states that the avelia liberty trainsets could travel at speeds over 185 miles per hour the only thing left holding back alstom s avelia liberty trains are the ancient tracks the amtrak acela runs between washington dc and nyc and boston a total distance of 451 miles this is the only semi high speed rail service in the us at the present time it will take several billion dollars to upgrade the tracks in the northwest corridor to get true 200 mph service biden s build back better bill may include money for this upgrade the california high speed rail authority is in full construction on 119 miles of track for high speed trains in the central valley of california this is to be the first true high speed rail network in the us eventually the network will link san francisco to los angeles however at the present time only the easy part is under construction the most expensive sections will connect downtown la and san francisco which are not funded at the present time the california high speed rail service will not be truly useful until the whole project is completed once again the biden build back better bill may have money for those projects many electric aircraft take their cues from the ubiquitous drones which are used for both hobbyist models and for larger delivery vehicles speaking of miniature drones these carry high resolution video cameras which make them extremely useful for hobbyists and let hollywood feature film producers eliminate helicopters there you have it many of the things that i missed in my first

key lime pies are produced en masse in the mike s pies factory in tampa fla on nov 4 2021 photo for the washington post by zack wittman tampa fla for months supply chain issues and labor shortages have been putting the squeeze on mike s pies a popular commercial bakery here that s been selling pies based off owner mike martin s mother s recipes for three decades but another powerful factor climate change is heightening those challenges its impact is less visible but more enduring and its consequences are playing out right as the food industry is struggling to avoid holiday season shortages many of the ingredients in mike s pies pies wheat berries honey soybean oil among numerous others have been hit hard by climate and weather effects including droughts wildfires and power shutdowns around the world that s sending prices soaring and combined with a scarcity of workers and other hurdles is causing mayhem throughout the global food supply chain we are cutting every order that we ship we can t fulfill the obligations martin said for consumers the impact on the food business means that stocks of seasonal items from entrees to desserts are significantly below pre pandemic times with meat and pies at the highest risk of being out of stock entirely according to iri a global data provider for retail companies food prices are also way up rising 5 1 in october over last year the fastest rate in years according to inflation data released last week by the u s bureau of labor statistics economists broadly expect that the labor and supply chain disruptions should work themselves out as the pandemic fades but they say climate and weather impacts will remain major threats to food and a growing number of other industries there is no place to run and hide from extreme weather events said michael swanson wells fargo s chief agricultural economist while the world s food conglomerates and agricultural giants are acutely aware of the climate threat near the end of the supply chain martin is more focused on tackling whatever crisis is front of him regardless of the cause i don t know what tomorrow is going to bring i could walk in and they say we can t get boxes or we can t get sugar he said orders are going through the roof prices are skyrocketing and we re having to order way out and to order more than we ve ever ordered mary provatas general manager of mike s pies and martin s right hand woman got ghosted it started on july 30 when their graham cracker crumbs vendor with whom they d done business for 20 years emailed to say labor shortages and equipment breakdowns meant their aug 5 order wouldn t be available for pickup for five more weeks the vendor scrounged up only a quarter of their order in september then things fell silent again no crumbs in october i sent them an email are we done doing business or aren t we just be frank with me provatas recounted it went back and forth with provatas sending nudgy emails nearly daily still no crumbs they finally came back and said do you want to cancel the rest of your orders what do you want to do at some point you gotta be done right for mike s pies this was a crisis the company was facing record demand from customers such as red lobster and winn dixie and it was down about a dozen workers the price of most ingredients had climbed 10 to 15 the company couldn t get dole crushed pineapple in the big cans flaked coconut or hershey s fudge and caramel but the graham cracker crumbs those were the foundation for so much of what the company sells they came from richmond baking which has been in business since 1902 and manufactures the crumbs in indiana and georgia bill quigg the company s president says richmond was having its own severe shortages the labor supply is a challenge the number of pounds we can produce is directly related to how many people we can employ and how many show up on a given day he said at the same time he was facing massive price increases for the core ingredients in the crumbles such as soybean oil as well as honey and spring red wheat like martin quigg isn t certain how much the climate and weather are to blame i m not the commodity

while the common focus on mps second jobs is the vast amounts of money paid there is the other consideration of the time spent away from their primary duties the only people mps should be hustling for are their constituents andrew rawnsley comment during my working life my employers had the old fashioned idea that in order to be paid i had to turn up and do work to their benefit if mps are working up to 30 hours a month at a second job how much does that eat into their working week is an mp s job so undemanding that they can fit in the extra hours if they contend that the work is in addition to their parliamentary commitments do they contravene the working time directive do you want to be represented by an mp who is exhausted rawnsley states that the public do not mind mps working as doctors the argument being that they are kept abreast of nhs matters from the inside if working in a casualty department allows sufficient time to wander around inquiring into the state of services generally i suggest all the talk of nhs crisis is exaggerated in the time it takes to earn a day s pay in a hospital they could visit several health service premises in their constituency and use their expertise to ask challenging questions the only way to prevent all this is to pay them a proper salary elect by proportional representation to eliminate ultra safe seats and ban all second jobs nick

sewage the big picture i agree entirely with tim adams s swimming in sewage article the new review however southern water is not the only culprit the system under which it has to operate is absurd the

guidance 11 have difficult conversations with parents 12 just get started showchallenges women face christine ripic compared with men women have longer life expectancies less earning power and quite often greater caretaking burdens this combination can feel overwhelming and make financial success seem out of reach but with sound planning saving and investing it becomes easier to take control of your financial life said ripic income gap on average women earn 22 less income than men 1 they also tend to have fewer years in the workforce a woman may take time off to care for young children and then retire earlier to coincide with the retirement age of an older spouse less income over the course of a lifetime restricts a woman s ability to accumulate retirement savings covid related income loss many of the sectors hardest hit by the pandemic closures were dominated by women who lost jobs or income or both in april 2020 the women s unemployment rate reached 16 2 it was the first time since the department of labor has been calculating that measure that it was over double digits 2 some women turned to gig work where income is lower and less predictable caregiving responsibilities even before covid many women had been juggling care of both children and elderly parents the pandemic exacerbated the problem leading 40 of mothers vs 28 of fathers to reduce work hours and 25 of mothers vs 10 of fathers to quit their jobs to provide care for a family member 3 greater healthcare costs one of the downsides of a longer life is that a woman will often face higher healthcare costs later in life wives often bear the burden of caring for older husbands and as they age they are less and less likely to have a spouse who can take care of them that s one reason that 58 of women but only 47 of men will need long term care after age 65 and two out of three people living in nursing homes are women 4 5 many women end up shouldering those costs alone which can range from 5 000 to 8 000 a month low investing confidence studies have shown that women investors tend to take a longer term approach with less frequent trades and more diversified portfolios as a result their investment performance tends to be better by an average of 4 annually6 than men yet far fewer women than men own investments outside of a 401 k the difference seems to come down to women s relative lack of confidence in their own abilities to affect outcomes explained ripic one survey asked men and women to identify the factors that would contribute to the growth of their assets a significantly larger percentage of men 36 vs 29 of women correctly gave more weight to how they invest while more women than men 43 vs 35 expected that the way they save would have the biggest impact in addition even though women overwhelmingly control the family finances they may still sit back and let a male partner drive conversations with their financial advisor ripic advises women to lean into these conversations instead by asking questions and getting clarification on anything you don t understand how to take control of your finances gigi verrey the many current and future challenges women face makes it critical to take care of not only your financial health but also your physical and emotional health knowledge is power fear is powerful but can be overcome through education said verrey she advises women to read books or listen to podcasts about investing and financial planning you can also leverage a range of educational tools and resources such as risk assessments or calculators that are available online or offered as part of your 401 k armed with some knowledge about how the financial markets work you can make investment decisions with an eye to minimizing the risk of not meeting your goals not trying to avoid short term volatility in fact while a woman s longer life span can be seen as a challenge it also generally means a longer time horizon to ride out market ups and downs keep in mind that you don t stop investing on the day you retire and your assets can continue to grow throughout your retirement years said verrey take advantage of tax advantaged savings if you re working and your company offers a retirement savings plan take full advantage of the tax advantaged savings even if your budget is tight and you can t max it out contribute at least the minimum required to capture any employee matching contributions by the same token contribute to a health savings account hsa if that s available to save tax free for qualified health expenses if you re not working your spouse can fund an individual retirement account ira for you you may also want to consider purchasing long term care insurance get professional planning guidance work with a financial advisor to create a flexible long term financial plan once you have a plan you ll feel more in control said verrey if you don t already have an advisor you know like and trust you might ask peers friends or family for a recommendation or look to women s organizations on social media for a list have difficult conversations with parents recognize that you might end up responsible for your parents care including their finances verrey recommends speaking with your parents about their finances before they become physically or cognitively impaired at the same time start to get their documents in place their life insurance and long term care contracts have yourself added to their financial accounts and work with a trusted advisor to arrange for power of attorney so you have the legal authority to act on your parents behalf if need be acknowledging that this isn t always easy verrey suggests arranging a specific time to discuss finances rather than trying to do it as part of a casual conversation if your parents currently work with an advisor you could invite that person to join a call so you can introduce yourself and start to become familiar with their financial picture you could also reach out to other people in your network who may be going through a similar thing they may be able to provide suggestions and ideas that have worked and possibly emotional support as well added verrey just get started it s never too early to start taking control of your finances but it s also never too late make a commitment to yourself today to take steps toward a better

may rally up to 80 000 next year in bull case predicts morgan stanley in the prevailing scenario one can say with confidence that india is one of the fastest growing economies however india s gdp represents only 3 of world gdp and roughly the same percentage of global stock market capitalization globally a lot of innovation is taking place through disruption of various traditional industries such innovation and disruption creates investment opportunities across geographies such opportunities are very limited in india in the listed space hence to participate meaningfully in these opportunities investors need to take exposure to several themes or emerging mega trends outside india every country has its own strengths and weaknesses and reactions to global news flows can be consequently different as can be seen in the chart above no single country region has been the best performer consecutively for a prolonged time period in the last 10 years the us has been the top performer in 6 years but only twice consecutively international investments reduce single country region specific risk at portfolio level correlation shows the strength of relationship between two variables in this case the stock market performance of one country vis à vis the other as against the general notion that indian us equity markets have high positive correlation there have been periods of divergent movements e g 2011 2013 2015 16 as given in the previous chart also in the last 10 years the correlation between india us has been only 0 29 international exposure also carries with it exposure to different currencies whenever there is any depreciation in inr the global portfolio could earn higher inr returns which is depicted in the chart of the us s p 500 index below though india is one of the fastest growing economies in the world it still lags behind the advanced economies with respect to innovation since the major technology centric firms operate globally e g names like facebook amazon apple netflix google etc are not listed on indian bourses popular themes that are emanating across the globe are robotics artificial intelligence electric vehicles industrial automations e commerce and cloud computing since these themes are expected to shape our future it makes sense for domestic investors to participate in such global themes to summarize international investing helps in diversifying single country risk provides correlation benefits provides currency diversification and the opportunity to invest in some of the leading global brands themes international investing is possible either through domestic mutual funds either through index funds which mirror global indices or actively managed funds or by investing directly in foreign currency through the liberalized remittance scheme lrs investing via domestic funds is preferable since the money remains inr denominated and is subject to domestic taxation funds which invest in international equities are taxed as fixed income mutual funds in india i e subject to ltcg 20 with indexation if held for 3 years or subject to stcg mmr if held for 3 years benefits of index funds in international investingfor domestic investors passive funds or index funds are the best way to invest in international markets index funds aim to replicate the performance of an index the case for index funds is pretty much proven in the us where almost 50 of the assets managed through that mutual fund industry is covered through passively managed funds one of the key reasons for this is the information efficiency which is prevalent in us other developed markets this is makes it difficult for a global active manager to consistently outperform the benchmark indices e g the s p500 nasdaq100 msci world index etc global index funds are more economical since they do not have the management operational expenses associated with actively managed funds furthermore global index funds provide

required minimum distribution preparing for qualified charitable distributions and updating your charitable giving plan for this year this is also a good time to make a plan for your giving tuesday donations if you don t have an ira set up yet for charitable distributions listing your favorite charities as beneficiaries you should consider doing that now too when you leave an inheritance for your children it may be heavily taxed both income tax and estate tax charities don t pay any taxes on your gifts if you are over 72 years old you are required to withdraw a percentage of your ira based on your life expectancy if you are over 70½ years old you can make qualified charitable distributions up to 100 000 that count toward your required minimum distribution there is a 50 penalty if you don t take out the required minimum distribution amount for the year you can help actualize a bold ambitious dream of what the world could be the magical beauty of your charitable giving results not only in tax savings for you but as importantly enhances our community and our world nonprofits change humanity for the better in myriad ways whether through human services the arts or ecology as a donor you are advancing equity and justice enriching lives through museums and art helping to nourish your fellow humans curing diseases and more so don t miss out on the joy that comes from being part of the vibrant process of giving back to others through your charitable gifts you can be smart about leveraging your resources and be generous about making a difference for good at the same time also research shows that gifting yields mental health benefits for the donor donations are predicted to increase this year donors plan to continue giving this year according to a new study from fundraising technology company classy the annual survey which ran between august and september 2021 asked a representative sample of 1 000 u s adults about their giving intentions and actual donations eighty four percent said they planned to give the same or more to charity in 2021 compared to what they gave last year a recent report from the lilly family school of philanthropy at indiana university forecasts a 4 1 increase in total giving in 2021 and a 5 7 increase in 2022 donors are increasing their giving to their favorite charities and including additional nonprofits because they are aware of the suffering that has occurred from an increased demand for services because of the pandemic for example the foodbank of santa barbara county is serving more people than ever before other organizations like calm friendship center domestic violence solutions cada santa barbara rescue mission and hospice of santa barbara are being especially challenged by these difficult times some organizations like the santa barbara foundation and united way of santa barbara county have been giving direct aid to families impacted by job loss and other challenges the pandemic has also significantly hurt the arts music and museums if arts and music interest you you might consider donating to camerata pacifica opera santa barbara santa barbara dance institute or music academy of the west if museums are your preference we suggest santa barbara museum of natural history santa barbara maritime museum or santa barbara trust for historic preservation others worthy of your donations include santa barbara response network and tv santa barbara this year please give special thought to creating an intentional and creative plan for your charitable giving by designing your own giving plan that reflects your values and passion identify why you are giving and which causes stir your soul people make charitable donations for all sorts of reasons some believe passionately in a particular cause and want to do all they can to make a difference others donate because giving is a deeply held family tradition some businesses make charitable donations because they know it will draw customers while benefiting their community still others want to do all they can to be part of the solution for a certain problem in their community there are a few who like the prestige of seeing their name high on a public listing of donors all reasons for giving are valid but it s best to identify exactly what motives drive your own giving engine your reasons for giving will provide a foundation for your own philanthropy plan i invite you to spend some time asking yourself why you are giving you might find some surprising answers and identifying why you are giving will be the first step toward making the greatest impact and feeling the greatest reward sitting down with pen and paper to examine your heart will reveal your basic areas of interest ask yourself which causes you hold dear you can t give to every solicitation that fills your mailbox so be proactive decide what causes stir your own soul make a short list of your categories of interest and then begin to list organizations that address those areas of need next it will be time to do a little research do your research to determine which organizations you will give to once you have identified exactly why you want to make charitable donations and which organizations resonate with you i invite you to do a little research some people will want to do more research than others but everyone can benefit from looking a little deeper than the donation request in your mailbox take a look at the list of nonprofits you compiled rank the organizations in order of their priority to you choose charities that are truly making a difference and are going to be around for awhile you want to be sure that any donations you give support organizations that are financially stable well run and achieving results for their mission or at least are showing promise of doing so in the case of start ups you can review the finances of any nonprofit with a 501 c 3 tax exempt status by examining its 990 tax return on guidestar another important consideration is whether the organization can sustain its programs over time their 990 will reveal whether they are able to grow their revenue at least at the rate of inflation continue to invest in their programs and maintain an appropriate reserve account for unexpected expenses these are all indicators of economic sustainability and accountability that will give you a sense of their effectiveness and staying power keep in mind a nonprofit s full cost of doing business includes direct costs of delivering programs indirect costs to support effective program delivery such as fundraising marketing management salaries occupancy and infrastructure and costs related to strengthening the balance sheet such as investments in facilities and other fixed assets and reduction of debt don t be misled by charities that claim unusually low overhead expenses and don t be surprised by high percentages spent on personnel costs it s common for human service nonprofits to spend 52 to 75 of their management and general funds on personnel expenses since this is usually the vehicle for delivering their services now that you have identified your personal motives for giving made a list of your areas of concern and organizations that fulfill those missions and investigated the financial and programmatic viability of some of your favorite organizations it s time to decide how you will give and how much you will ultimately donate choose the best giving vehicles for you before you decide how much you want to give to each organization you will want to take a look at the possible vehicles or ways of giving to determine which ones are best for you charitable giving can help reduce your income taxes estate tax and capital gains tax so it is crucial to think about how you can best leverage tax rules to expand your philanthropic impact everyone can give something and each method of giving has its own benefits here are some of the more popular giving vehicles to consider writing a check offers a quick and easy way to donate you can mail this to the organization or donate through its website this can be an immediate income tax deduction and removes the value from your future taxable estate giving assets such as cars real estate clothing or household goods can be deducted based on the full fair market value of the items including the charity in your will makes the donation exempt from federal estate tax and allows you control of your assets for your lifetime as discussed in the beginning of this article you can make cash donations to irs approved charities directly out of your traditional ira and not have it included in your adjustable gross income the best way to do it donating appreciated stocks and mutual funds eliminates tax on long term capital gains and offers an immediate charitable deduction based on the value of the stock or mutual fund gifting your retirement assets allows you to make the gift from the most highly taxed assets making a gift of life insurance offers a current income tax deduction and allows you to make a large gift with little cost to yourself setting up a family foundation appeals to some high net worth individuals because it is the best way to make sure your donation totally matches your values and interests donating through donor advised funds is becoming more popular these funds are charitable giving accounts offered by a sponsoring organization such as the santa barbara foundation or companies like morgan stanley that are designed as an accessible simple and less expensive alternative to private foundations put your money in let the sponsoring institution manage it and then make a donation to the causes of your choice giving circles like women s fund of santa barbara is both fun and practical arranging for a planned gift such as a charitable remainder trust a charitable lead trust or a charitable gift annuity has a variety of benefits and is best handled by a financial professional remember that volunteering your time doesn t cost you a dime whether you have one hour a week or one day a year to give you can donate your time to a cause that inspires you i hope these suggestions will help you create a philanthropy plan that reflects your unique interests and passions you will now be ready to make your contributions with the certainty that they will make a significant impact in your community and deeply resonate with your own spirit your gifts will make a difference and the organizations you give to will be the ones that are strong and viable for the long term this is especially important this year when so many nonprofits have been so negatively impacted by the virus restrictions and shutdowns dr cynder sinclair is a consultant to nonprofits and

how does this affect me but the latest generation of fintech firms and their services are disrupting the playing field even more and in money matters across the board including banking transfers savings investments and shopping they are eliminating not only the need for actual exchange of cash but also the need to be limited to one financial institution s platform while spending money but how does all this affect you today uae residents now have access to solutions that are unlike others in the region and interestingly many of these were launched in the peak of the pandemic year 2020 we spoke to a couple of firms about how and why they created these payment solutions for uae residents while uae residents are no newbies to installment plans on purchases usually the plan comes with a profit rate or processing fee buy now pay later and not just with your bank uae residents are no newbies when it comes to installment offers many merchants have bank partners who allow customers to pay back the purchase amount in installments even if these installments are profit free the customer may still be charged a processing fee spotii is a new uae platform that is placing the onus of customer convenience on the merchant for their free installment plans on purchases the customers pays no fees and no interest on the four installments unless the payment is past due date the merchants pay a platform fee we figured merchants will want this as it a new tool to engage with their consumers better while customers will appreciate it because in this uncertain period they re being given a very user friendly way to make the purchases that they need to make anushcha iqbal ceo and co founder spotii founded by sibling duo anushcha iqbal and ziyaad ahmed spotii is a uae grown initiative my background has always been in financial services ceo and co founder iqbal said to gulf news in a zoom interview iqbal left her last role in private equity in 2018 and started looking at fintech solutions and studying the market i was visiting ziyaad in new york and he was describing what he was up to in the us the idea was simple yet very powerful iqbal said ziyaad ahmed coo and co founder of spotii used to work with afterpay us a platform that aggregates merchants and allows customers to pay the purchase amount back in interest free no cost installments every two weeks here s when the buy now pay later idea took shape we spent the latter half of 2019 just developing and building the product in the uae iqbal added the company was established in january 2020 while the official launch of the platform was in april the same year launching during a pandemic when asked about launching a new business amid the coronavirus pandemic she said the reason we decided to push forward was if there was going to be a disruption a shift or enhanced restrictions on movement digital payments are going to be needed and we figured merchants will want this as it a new tool to engage with their consumers better while customers will appreciate it because in this uncertain period they re being given a very user friendly way to make the purchases that they need to make tabby is another platform in uae similar to spotii founded in 2019 tabby partners with retailers to offer customers to defer paying for their purchases for up to 30 days or to pay in four equal monthly installments at zero cost to the consumer image credit supplied press release iqbal said was their sole source of income was the merchant s platform fee afterpay reportedly revealed that they make over 24 per cent of their income from late payment fees from customers however iqbal said that spotii was not looking to make income from late payments which were capped at dh40 dh20 is charged the first time payment is late a second late payment is charged an additional dh20 or 25 per cent of the purchase amount whichever is lower we don t want to punish consumers for beng unable to pay she said platforms similar to spotii in the uae include postpay and tabby both of which have a similar model where you pay the amounts in three or four interest free installments all three platforms launched in 2020 amid the rising need for such solutions given the pandemic and its economic impact transfer money to a friend from your phone money solutions such as venmo in the us wechat in china and paytm in india have been around for some time enabling people to make peer to peer money transfers easily using mobile devices as long as both parties are on the platform however such transfer solutions were not common in the uae apart from bank transfers which could take time owing to the authentication processes of each bank 2020 saw the launch of a lot of solutions for exactly this purpose ziina payby and mamo pay are all examples of new launches that allow residents to easily transfer money to friends family or colleagues all that s needed is an account for both parties on the chosen platform each of these platforms also tout end to end security and encryption to ensure security of customer details faizal toukan ceo and co founder of ziina told gulf news in an email interview andrew gold co founder and head of engineering at ziina and i met at a hackathon called ethereum san francisco after our first encounter we started brainstorming how to best solve p2p payments in mena with our co founder sarah toukan you can send and request money from any of your friends on ziina by searching for their ziiname username or phone number faizal toukan ceo and co founder of ziina we realized that cash was becoming an issue in the region people wanted an easy way to settle a tab share a cab fare send an allowance and split the grocery or the takeaway bill in january 2020 we started building the app and shortly after launched in june 2020 ziina is currently partnering with 11 banks but toukan says soon payments will be possible through any bank s debit card the platform requires authentication of first time transfers toukan added when you sign up with ziina you only need your phone number and a bank account you can then send and request money from any of your friends on ziina by searching for their ziiname username or phone number no need for any additional details the money goes straight from your bank account to your friends covid 19 impact when asked if the pandemic had triggered a faster app launch toukan said while we started working on ziina prior to covid 19 the pandemic has made the need for cashless payments all the more urgent this is for two reasons firstly people have fewer opportunities to meet in person so they will resort to sending remote payments when they need to pay someone back secondly people are hesitant to handle physical cash which can be a carrier of germs this is in part due to circumstances relating to covid 19 and in part because our users have been looking for an alternative to cash for some time now uae has been moving towards becoming a cashless society for some time but abu dhabi based fintech solution payby also credits the pandemic for proving a catalyst for the growth of more cashless solutions being adopted a spokesperson from the firm told gulf news the social distancing economy has indeed catalysed the growth of contactless payment solutions such as payby and led to increased adoption rates the firm partnered with first abu dhabi fab bank in march 2020 and was then integrated into 40 000 fab point of sale pos devices within a few weeks the company added payby has also partnered with adcb and abu dhabi s itc to roll out cashless payments in all abu dhabi taxis which don t need to have a pos other partnerships with the lulu group the middle east s largest retail conglomerate leading retailers such as al ain coop and jumbo have helped consolidate and establish payby banked or unbanked everyone has a solution this is a common scenario for some uae residents where the salary drawn may be too low to open a bank account or get a credit debit card or if the resident is still in the process of settling in or moving payby has been integrated with upay systems so users without a bank account can top up their digital wallets on kiosk machines and use payby for shopping cashless payments withdrawals and peer to peer transfers residents may also have seen payby on their voip platforms such as botim and totok payby allows direct p2p transfers between contacts using the chatrooms on these platforms image credit supplied payby opens a virtual fab account for each user to ensure the fund security but linking to bank accounts isn t a must the firm said in the email statement to gulf news payby has an instant credit feature that allows users to take a small amount as credit for no fees as long as it is paid back in 40 days however more information on this feature was not immediately available residents may also have seen payby on their voip platforms such as botim and totok payby allows direct p2p transfers between contacts using the chatrooms on these platforms the transfer can also be done through a text message or via qr codes the amount is received in the payby account but it can be easily transferred to one s bank ziina on the other hand doesn t hold any money and facilitates inter bank transfers only security is key a word of advice to our readers using apps for financial transactions make sure that the security settings on any app you use and those on your device are efficient before saving or entering any sensitive financial data toukan from ziina said our users security is our highest priority all api calls made to ziina s servers are encrypted in transit three separate encryption keys stored in three separate places are required to initiate a transaction one of those keys is only ever stored on the user s device so ziina is unable to make a transaction without the user s consent contactless payments already represent at least a third of all face to face transactions in nearly 50 countries image credit shutterstock a payby spokesperson said financial transactions on payby are well protected by leading and proven technologies including an ai based fraud management system to detect unauthorized activities compliant with pci dss standards the international gold standard for security the qr code generated by payby is based on tokenization widely acknowledged as a more secure payment method as it allows the payment to be processed without exposing sensitive payment information yet another all in one payment solution that launched in 2020 was empay by emirates payment services empay is a platform that allows a wide variety of payments and lifestyle services such as dubai economic department license renewal all types of bill payments food ordering from restaurants education fee payments international remittance p2p peer to peer micro payments etc save some invest some for decades banks have been the preferred choice for savings and for risk free nominal growth of those savings through fixed deposits or re investment schemes however most moderate gain wealth growing plans are usually unavailable for residents earning average salaries or who don t have a pot of money saved away or those of us who don t have the time or knowledge for day trading globally the past five years have seen many new investment platforms that allow micro investments buying fractions of a share or shares of an index which allow people to put away a small amount of money to invest uae also now has a couple of licensed platforms such as sarwa wealthface or stashaway where you can start saving or investing at low amounts paying a fraction of the cost you would pay an investment manager globally the past five years have seen many new investment platforms that allow micro investments buying fractions of a share or shares of an index which allow people to put away a small amount of money to invest a spokesperson from investment platform stashaway told gulf news in the region around 45 of the total wealth is held in cash a very high percentage by any standard this goes to show that there is a huge amount of money sitting idly and not generating any returns for investors given the residents needs in the region products also need to be modified if a person does not want to invest but just save and make something extra some platforms offer that as well for example stashaway has a sharia compliant cash management solution stashaway simple that yields 1 2 per cent per annum without any restrictions or associated fees sarwa on the other hand has no savings product but allows small regular investments tied to a goal and the risk appetite of the customer the growth of such robo advisors in the region is all the more important given the nuances of trading in global stocks or global index funds which include possible taxes exchange rate loss high management fees and liquidity issues why uae as raja al mazrouei executive vice president of the fintech hive at the dubai international financial centre difc put it the uae has successfully created a complete ecosystem for companies to grow and thrive we started the first and

initiatives sheikh mohammed bin rashid launched the national innovation strategy for the uae in 2014 with the aim of making the uae one of the most innovative nations in the world within seven years the importance of becoming a cashless and paperless society however is not just to be technologically advanced according to a mastercard study countries that prioritize digitized payment economies are better placed to mitigate the associated adverse impact of unemployment financial exclusion fraud theft cost of cash and corruption did covid 19 trigger the rise of more money solutions every stakeholder we spoke to agrees that while going cashless was already the need of the hour globally and in the uae the pandemic may have accelerated that need even further bryan stirewalt chief executive at dfsa said in early 2020 the dfsa expanded its permitted financial services activities by introducing the region s most comprehensive money services regime the introduction of this new regime coincided with the declaration of the covid 19 pandemic by the who we have since had considerable interest from firms wanting to establish a presence in the difc and offer innovative payment applications to consumers in the uae and across the measa region the majority of the firms applying for the itl and in the itl are money services firms so it can be hard to tell if this was driven by the pandemic the overall trend of digitisation of finance the creation of the regulation itself or just an increase in demand from consumers wanting access to innovative payment solutions we believe it is a combination of each of these factors
the bargain bonanza that is black friday has begun only there are fewer special offers this year and those that are being advertised aren t quite so eye catching you can blame the global supply chain meltdown for the dearth of doorbusters even when toys and tvs start flowing through trade arteries again retailers should maintain a more disciplined approach to discounting this won t be easy but stores stand to gain a lot if they bin the bargains in black fridays to come this year many americans are still flush with lockdown savings while wage gains are also boosting household spending power combine that with missing out on holiday festivities in 2020 and that s made for buoyant consumer conditions call it revenge christmas if you like given the higher costs that retailers are facing from spiraling freight rates to air shipping goods from asia they had little choice but to cut down on promotions this year in order to protect profit margins in any case why risk running out of stock when you don t even need to stimulate demand walmart inc pointed to lower markdowns during the crucial back to school and halloween seasons victoria s secret co t j maxx owner tjx cos inc and macy s inc also had to clear less stock adidas ag said it was selling more sneakers at full price this year compared with in 2020 meanwhile retailers such as target corp and amazon com inc started their offers in october to capitalize on early consumer demand and having enough supply that may have contributed to us retail sales rising by the most in seven months in october but that early holiday spending may take some heat out of the traditional late november frenzy stacey widlitz of sw retail advisors who tracks promotions on both sides of the atlantic says that across the us deals are similar to or lower than in 2020 when they had already been reined in due to covid there are some categories where special offers are heating up such as beauty and toys but some items are already in short supply in the e commerce market meanwhile adobe found that discounts were weaker in electronics sporting goods and electrical appliances they were similar in tvs and furniture while prices were actually rising in diy products compared with reductions last year even though signs suggest supply chain problems have peaked the scars of stock shortages along with rising inflation mean consumers now expect to pay more for what they want this creates an opportunity for retailers to reset their profitability by keeping bargains at 2021 levels or even lower in future years there are challenges to this strategy for starters the pent up demand that characterized 2021 is likely to fade splashing out on everything from new cushions to coats as well as meals out and travel is taking its toll on those accumulated pandemic savings the proportion of americans who plan to travel over the thanksgiving holiday has more than doubled compared with 2020 according to destination analysts and is even ahead of 2019 levels meanwhile 2022 will lack the extra impetus from those stimulus payments at the same time inflation is eating into household spending power if americans are having to pay more for the things they need such as food and fuel there will be less left over for the things they want add in the prospect of higher borrowing costs and it s no wonder that us consumer sentiment has dropped to a 10 year low for retailers this all makes judging demand into 2022 and beyond perilous while it s fair to say next year s holiday season likely won t be as strong the outlook from here is about as clear as mud one of the reasons that discounts are so scarce now is because the items currently in shops were ordered earlier in the year amid uncertainty about covid 19 cases and before the true extent of consumer strength emerged companies shouldn t be lulled into a false sense of security by the current strength in spending and order in bigger volumes for next year s holiday season at the same time chains must strike the right balance between protecting profits and making stores fun unlike in europe where there is no reason for black friday to exist the shopping holiday is an american tradition many customers still expect some razzamatazz and that means door busters but everything in moderation this year s extraordinary combination of soaring demand and constrained supply has given stores a golden ticket to end the vicious retail cycle of over ordering and then deep discounting to clear unwanted stock they d be wise to use it bloomberg
s anta comes down the chimney of rotorwash on a static line and hits the ground hard when he gets up he s already firing he s got that glint in his eye you know the one you ve seen it in his press photos and on tv it s like he knows exactly who the good guys and the bad guys are he knows who s been naughty and who s been nice no one even questions him right about now i m sure glad i haven t been naughty he goes storming off toward the remains of the outer wall of the terrorist compound and i duck and run behind him sand fills the air as the huey pilot dusts off and leaves us he ll go hide at our rendezvous point santa sits back to the wall and pops a new magazine into his thompson submachine gun it s just one of the many little toys that he took from surplus of the millions of weapons santa s workshop has manufactured this year this one is his personal favorite bullets hit the wall behind us as he pulls out a map and jabs it with his finger to show me the place i shine a red light on the map just enough to see that he s put a big x across a room in the middle of the compound sir i say don t you think we should wait for the rest of the team but he s already on his feet hell no he says i m ready i know where they are and i have presents to deliver to them all no time to waste tonight then he s over the wall and yelling and charging straight at the machine guns and somehow the bullets aren t hitting him gone is the santa of old fat jovial and bearded now he s clean shaven square jawed buff and barrel chested in his signature red and white uniform and the colors blaze amongst the desert browns and greys and his bag painted bright blue with little white stars to show his national pride is slung over his shoulder he s like a beacon a big banner that says shoot me i m american used to be he d wait for me let me guide him i mean it is my job to take point and maybe it was also that he used to have fear had at least a little bit of understanding of mortality but then the defense department went and hired him and he realized he was immortal emergency claus that s him now he s so gung ho ho ho i m afraid for us all bullets don t only hit the immortals what about the rest of us we re not immortal even when we re told we are but i go over the wall anyway because he s my commanding officer i hear the other eight members of my team struggling along behind me short bursts of gunfire mark their positions santa takes out a machine gun encampment and then he s at the door that leads into the compound i m right behind him we pause while my team catches up they re all young scared i m going to blow it santa says and rigs the charge we all grab cover and he detonates it the explosion rips the door from its hinges hold the door santa says don t let anyone through then he s in firing and yelling like a madman stay put i say to my team and they tense for battle i go through after santa following the string of bodies like a trail to that center chamber and there s santa at the door thompson leveled at several dozen people inside sir i say cover me he says and i bring my own weapon to bear on the people santa digs into his bag and brings out three boxes switches them on c 4 and electronic detonators lock it up he says i look from face to face civilians some of them children these are terrorists santa evidently thinks so why sir i ask just lock the door soldier he says and for a moment he turns that glint of his on me that glint that says you re awfully close to being on the naughty list i close the door and jam a piece of rebar across its latch then i step back what are you doing sir i ask he finishes setting the charges and pulls a detonator remote from his bag my job he says he jogs back through the corridors and out the door i follow there are civilians in there i say children there are no good children here santa says he hits the ground then presses the detonator button everything shakes and smoke slowly billows its way from the building santa drops the remote and stands the first thing i notice is quiet in the aftermath nothing moves i realize there s no machine gun fire either and look around to see the bodies of the dead our soldiers and theirs we missed the fight out here i don t know what you think you re doing i say to santa but watch yourself he warns then he stares again i look away sir a faint voice says from the ground nearby one of ours santa says he leans down and turns the wounded soldier s body over what s your name soldier he says corporal vixen sir she says eyes wide damn santa says females in combat don t know what i think of that you re new yes sir knew a vixen once damn fine soldier whatever happened to him he asks me dead sir i say lost him over cleveland in 89 collided with a weather balloon remember sometimes i think his memory is going but no he can remember every kid every grid coordinate every crime against his nation yeah that s right he says for a moment his eyes glaze and i think maybe he s remembering the fun times they had together late night hot buttered rum topless dancers then he says i take it back vixen was a fuck up sir vixen asks didn t follow my orders to the letter questioned my authority and look where it got him dead he looks at me a threat am i dying she asks santa says nothing yes i say is there anything i can do for you no she says but maybe santa can what can i do he asks when i was a little girl she says i sent you a letter and asked for world peace i used to get a lot of those he says not so much anymore most kids want playstations i don t she says i want world peace sometimes you ve got to go along with what everyone else wants santa says that s the price of freedom you kids don t get it but maybe this war will change that had everything handed to you you ve got to fight or you get soft what s wrong with being soft she says but she doesn t hear santa s disgusted grunt because she s dead we walk quickly out of the camp and around the rock outcropping to where our huey waits the pilot is dead too another casualty of war i fire up the chopper and we lift off pushing up through the thick choking smoke of the burning compound everything fades as the thwacking of the rotors pounds all my senses flat santa hangs his head out the open gunner s door and yells into the night his face is red and charged with enthusiasm he looks like a big demented kid just like old times ain t it rudolph santa says he takes the seat next to me and carves little h and o figures into the stock of his thompson one for each confirmed kill the wood of the rifle is so crisscrossed with marks it looks like a chainsaw hacked stump sculpture all rough and torn in pain sometimes you let these ideas of good and bad and right and wrong go to your head and your head gets carved up in little h and o patterns it s nothing like old times but i don t say that whatever you say sir i say i kick on the bright red nose light and

when it comes to art beauty is most certainly in the eyes of the beholder and while highly collectible and valuable works by spanish artist pablo picasso 1881 1973 are no exception however a new real estate phenomenon named to honor the artist s legacy of innovation is arguably a controversial movement in its own right not unlike cubism surrealism and expressionism were in the art world at the time pacaso founded in october 2020 has created a new category of second home ownership by turning single family homes into unlicensed but legal mini multi user resorts designed to capitalize on the high demand for second homes in luxury destinations where the pandemic real estate boom has priced many out of the market pacaso s unique model is relatively straightforward pacaso creates a limited liability company llc that purchases a luxury home lightly refurbishes it divvies the company up among two to eight owners and sells co ownership interests via its website for 12 upfront and 99 in monthly management fees pacaso finds and vets all co owners handles all sales details takes care of all furnishings repairs cleaning and property management and enables owner scheduling via a proprietary app currently valued at 1 5 billion this start up is purportedly the fastest american company to achieve in investment parlance unicorn status meaning a market valuation of 1 billion or more investors obviously love the model and it s coming to a resort town near you in fact pacaso has already arrived in aspen on oct 8 pacaso under the guise of 28 smuggler grove llc closed on that local property for 9 1 million one eighth owner membership interests of the property specific llc that owns the three bedroom four bath home on a quiet cul de sac off midland avenue are now listed for sale on pacaso s website interests are currently on the market for 1 34 million each which get you up to 44 nights a year in this tasteful and newly remodeled 3 166 square foot single family residence buy as many interests as you d like up to half ownership sign the owner operating agreement for the llc and you and your co owners will then collectively own 100 of the the home the only catch you can only stay there for a maximum of 14 days at a time pacaso s novel model is gaining traction across the country in addition to homes in aspen the website features available interests in llcs that own luxury homes in palm springs scottsdale jackson hole telluride lake tahoe miami park city napa malibu west palm naples carmel santa barbara and vail among others in addition to paying aspen s 1 5 rett upon the initial purchase pacaso takes good care of local real estate agents through payment of a 3 referral commission on sales and restricted stock options as a referral equity bonus interests in the home owning llcs are being marketed on the local mls it has long been a desire of city council to target second home owners for special taxation because they do not reside in their aspen properties on a full time basis an occupancy tax is regularly suggested to raise additional money for pet projects such as more subsidized housing the idea being to punish people who dare to pay their property taxes and bills yet leave their private homes empty until they wish to use them but pacaso second homeowners are a new breed they own vacation real estate that they do not occupy full time but pacaso houses are not sitting empty in fact pacaso homes will likely be occupied 100 of the time and while the co owners cannot rent out their interests on the open market they can gift them to friends and family what could possibly go wrong aspen s nemesis the law of unintended consequences is rubbing her hands in glee so council doesn t like empty vacation homes now imagine full vacation homes all the time the pacaso owner code of conduct stipulates no large parties quiet hours 9p 7a no more than two dogs less than 80 pounds each and recommends avoiding on street parking but since these are not airbnb type rentals there is no lodging tax collection no business licensing and therefore no agent of record for when something inevitably goes awry they re not commercial businesses so there s no housing mitigation the interests being sold are not deeded ownership timeshares they re interests in an llc which holds the deed to the home so these sales are not subject to the rett or are they it s unclear furthermore what will the impacts be on our community services and infrastructure and given the unprecedented service industry labor shortage and horrific commuter traffic on highway 82 just who is going to service the revolving doors of these mini multi user resorts many jurisdictions are already fighting the pacaso model in their communities however there are challenges with doing so pacaso is not selling easily regulated fractionals or timeshares nor tenancies in common rather interests in llcs that represent true ownership of real property it s unclear what aspen can or should do if anything and since many local real estate buyers already make their purchases using an llc often for privacy it s impossible to identify a pacaso home until it s too late pacaso dramatically lowers aspen s real estate ownership barrier to entry but comes with its own host of serious concerns and unintended consequences contact theredantem comcast net

there was a big market for typewriters students used them to type term papers secretaries used them to type memos for their bosses aspiring novelists used them to type their works in progress typewriters were all the thing today if you showed a young person a typewriter there s a good chance that he or she would not be able to identify its purpose today typewriters belong in museums laptops have taken over most of their functions which means that we produce far fewer of the things than we once did the demand for typewriters has contracted so the production of them has contracted too if it had not the market would be flooded with typewriters that could not be sold and the excess production would drive the price for typewriters down to levels where it would not be possible to earn a profit selling them fortunately the market for typewriters is flexible and the production of them has fallen off to the extent necessary to match the diminished demand the typewriter market has responded to dramatically altered circumstances not so the stock market a regression analysis of the historical return data shows that the most likely 10 year annualized return for stocks sold at the prices that applied in 1981 is 15 percent real at the prices that apply today the most likely annualized return is a negative 0 5 percent the appeal of stocks has dropped dramatically investors buy stocks to obtain a return on them and to use that return to finance their retirement but the return has disappeared the logical thing would be for demand to drop until the price that applied made more sense why hasn t it happened the stock market is not flexible as markets must be to function properly it s that buy and hold thing investors have been taught that it is always a good idea to buy stocks and that one does not need to adjust one s stock allocation to reflect changed circumstances that would be market timing a bad idea taboo forbidden a four letter word the buy and hold strategy market timing is the means by which the stock market attains flexibility prices go too high investors sell because the appeal of stocks is not as strong and prices return to more reasonable levels without market timing that doesn t happen prices drift upward and then stabilize for a bit and then drift upward some more and then stabilize for a bit again and then drift upward yet some more the only way to get stock prices back to reasonable levels in a world in which the buy and hold strategy has become popular is to crash them which is a completely non flexible and painful approach to price correction price crashes are economic heart attacks people have heart attacks because they eat to excess and thereby over time come to put excessive strains on their hearts if only they took a more flexible approach when one learns that one is 20 pounds overweight one should take steps to get one s weight back to a good level that s a flexible approach to fitness gain a little lose a little lose a little gain a little stay flexible avoid heart attacks the stock market needs to stay flexible the problem of course is that investors like high prices stocks are the only thing we buy on a regular basis for which we dream of paying ever high prices the price of stocks goes up and we think oh i earned more on my stock portfolio this year than i did from my job did you if the gains were all irrational exuberance you didn t earn anything of lasting value at all you earned a mirage if you come to believe that the mirage is real your stock investing experience will end in tears we need to encourage investors not to get carried away with the irrational exuberance thing to be more flexible in their attitude toward stocks buying more when prices are low and less when prices are high we have public service commercials to encourage good behavior in other fields of life endeavor to stop people from throwing cigarette butts on the ground and from taking narcotics to relieve life s pains what if we did that in the stock investing realm only you can prevent bull markets please market time until it hurts a financial freedom dream is a terrible thing to waste the retirement plan you save

investors excitement in the oil and gas business in the united states of america in his writing monsieur smith highlights some of the negatives of the oil and gas business like the amount of energy needed to extract the energy depletion of reserves in wells and lastly investor returns we love his writing because for that time period he was right the most sensitive issue an investor should have been focusing on then was the last point investor returns to smith s first two points using energy to produce energy is just physics there is no way around it it s just like sending electricity across lines you ll lose 15 of the electricity in long range transportation this certainly shouldn t stop you from wanting to transmit electricity over long distances these transmission lines provide a dynamic deep market for consumers and businesses when it comes to his other point on depletion this is yet again a natural process for oil and gas we have become smarter in pad drilling and fracking to get after more oil and gas in particular geographies the issue then wasn t the natural depletion it was the cash flow that would come in the years ahead with that depletion this points back to smith s later point of investor returns we were in complete agreement with smith at that time smith finished his piece in the financial times saying as the late jimmy goldsmith was fond of saying if you see a bandwagon it s too late the shale bandwagon may have already passed to his point on investor returns they weren t there and weren t going to be there for a while the cash flows were being pushed at more marginal wells not the cash cows as buffett has said a multitude of times price is what you pay value is what you get in 2014 you didn t get much value at those prices as the bandwagon was long and very noticeable fast forward to 2021 the bandwagon of other energy forms is very noticeable there are practically religious orders being built up in other forms of energy like solar and other renewables are these other forms of energy subject to the laws of economics yes they may end up with the same victim mentality that energy investors in 2014 did we are by nature very skeptical of wall street and the ideas it peddles this is because you should always be skeptical of someone selling something that has an incentive attached particularly when you don t have similar incentives physicist mark mills pushed back strongly in his 2019 piece titled the new energy economy an exercise in magical thinking mills stated in 2019 when speaking about shale versus wind the fundamental differences between these energy resources can also be illustrated in terms of individual equipment for the cost to drill a single shale well one can build two 500 foot high 2 megawatt mw wind turbines those two wind turbines produce a combined output averaging over the years to the energy equivalent of 0 7 barrels of oil per hour the same money spent on a single shale rig produces 10 barrels of oil per hour or its energy equivalent in natural gas averaged over the decades mills is pointing out some of the pure physics of this discussion as george gilder points out time is money these resources have vastly different costs in time thus price isn t it odd this doesn t stop the bankers from creating a magical story for the bandwagon spot oil prices vs occidental petroleum why would so many people not be aware of the time limitations or why would many investors not care that per pound mass hydrocarbons are the most efficient acceptable non nuclear energy source in the world it s because the bandwagon is out there on renewable energy just as it was in 2014 with shale in newton s third law for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction the equal reaction to today s renewable revolution is that people have immense confidence in its future and that reflects in price the opposite reaction is that hydrocarbons are left for dead and the price is very low below is a chart comparing spot oil prices to occidental petroleum corporation nyse oxy since 2014 investors used to pay 60 80 per share for occidental petroleum at today s spot wti price and this was prior to them owning anadarko petroleum this acquisition gave them 30 more production our minds spin at the thought of this while the bandwagon comes and goes in renewables non hydrocarbons we will wait for our investors day in the sun with occidental petroleum oxy us continental resources inc nyse clr conocophillips nyse cop and chevron corporation nyse cvx the bandwagon being nowhere near us today makes us very excited for the value we get at today s prices to bring it back to terry smith he was right in 2014 our investors owned zero in energy stocks then like terry now he should be elated that the bandwagon is not in the oil and gas business however he isn t buying energy stocks because his discipline doesn t allow him to own these types of businesses between investors unwilling to own these companies the bandwagon and the magical banking that these investors have been sold we are thankful for our investors newton s third law and george gilder s principles just reinforce the truth

in the 1960s my uncle kept a large library housed in a room he called his library facts that seemed both marvelous and exotic to me as a boy when i visited him in the summers he would encourage me to browse his shelves and to read whatever i liked he gave little guidance and forbade nothing not even the kama sutra or in cold blood though both so confused and terrified me i finished neither nor did i finish or start a book called stoner then though i remember its butter yellow dust jacket with a drawing of a window through which could be glimpsed three columns partially obscured behind the branches of a tree for some reason this image stayed with me and when i encountered an identical first edition in a new orleans used bookstore when i was in college i bought it for 3 i acquired it more as a nostalgic talisman it went unread for some time but eventually i opened it and read the opening paragraphs william stoner entered the university of missouri in the year 1910 at the age of 19 eight years later during the height of world war i he received his doctor of philosophy degree and accepted an instructorship at the same university where he taught until his death in 1956 he did not rise above the rank of assistant professor and few students remembered him with any sharpness after they had taken his courses an occasional student who comes across the name may wonder idly who william stoner was but he seldom pursues his curiosity beyond a casual question stoner s colleagues who held him in no particular esteem when he was alive speak of him rarely now to the older ones his name is a reminder of the end that awaits them all and to the younger ones it is merely a sound which evokes no sense of the past and no identity with which they can associate themselves or their careers those paragraphs are an accurate summing up of the life of the protagonist a quiet and unremarkable man who lives an unremarkable life stoner is born in rural poverty to young parents trying to make a go of farming in central missouri at the behest of the county agent they send their only boy off to college to study agriculture he arrives at the university a bumpkin in black broadcloth and numbly fumbles through his first year paying for his tuition and keep by working on a nearby farm belonging to relatives then a chance remark by his english professor archer sloan incites in stoner a certain inarticulate yearning the young man falls in love with intellectual pursuit with learning so he doesn t go back to work the farm but stays on at school he s there through the first world war though his classmates do their patriotic chore one of them a dark intelligent and mysterious boy with whom he might have developed a genuine friendship does not comes back another gordon finch who seems to have scant gifts aside from a ruddy sociability goes on to become one of the university s leading lights and stoner s lifelong friend stoner marries a high strung woman from a st louis family with pretensions and a little money edith is mercurial and materialistic and deaf to stoner s muse she demands a house they cannot afford causing stoner to borrow from her father a banker who kills himself when the stock market crashes in 1929 and believes his family and bank to be ruined they have a daughter grace who brings stoner joy but out of jealousy edith wages a campaign to alienate father and daughter and eventually succeeds stoner all but moves out of the house doing research in his college offices he watches as his classes are decimated by world war ii when his mentor sloan dies he is shaken by the university s indifference and when stoner refuses to pass a student he regards as insolent and lazy he makes a bitter enemy of his department head who relegates him to teaching freshman composition and would have fired him had finch now the academic dean not intervened middle aged and lonely stoner suddenly finds himself embroiled in a passionate affair with a student katherine who is nearly as mad for literature as he is for a season the pall lifts and stoner realizes a full measure of the life that has been denied him even edith gives her tacit approval it can t last and stoner emerges from the ashes stoic determined to face the rest of his life as his parents did taking things as they come and doing what he must stoner is a hero because he is a man who does what he needs to do a man who persists stoner is a remarkable book a hymn to work and the small lives most of us necessarily lead it was written by john williams who died in fayetteville in 1994 and won the national book award for his 1972 novel augustus an epistolary novel about the roman emperor while stoner has something of the feel of a semi autobiography williams life story has only a few points of congruence with his character s williams grandparents were texas farmers his parents were poor and he attended and taught at the university of missouri which he attended on the gi bill he served in world war ii surviving a plane crash that killed five of his colleagues he developed a dependence on alcohol his widow nancy gardner williams told paris review a few years ago but he was an integrated man she said all of a piece he was all one he wasn t contradictory or contradicted about himself he was a good man good good the university of arkansas press reprinted stoner in 1988 i had a copy of that edition too i think i gave it away and somehow i lost the other copy too many moves too many boxes i checked the internet to see what it would cost to replace it i found a signed first edition for 6 500 unsigned in good condition for 1 850 a better option for most of us might be the library of america s recently published volume john williams collected novels 40 which collects augustus and 1960 s butcher s crossing as well as stoner it wasn t until recently that i realized it is one of those novels that is famous for being underappreciated eight years ago the new yorker ran a story about it under the headline the greatest american novel you ve never heard of it s probably not that because more people have heard of it than say t r pearson s off for the sweet hereafter morris philipson s a man in charge or donald harington s the choiring of the trees there are many great novels we haven t heard of but we have heard of stoner it is well known enough to have critics who find williams depictions of stoner s antagonists edith the insolent student the peevish department head problematic the latter two are physically disfigured which does seem a bit 19th century roger chillingsworth ish again it is a hymn to work to carrying on told in precise straightforward language like hemingway but without the self regarding bravado it s a great american novel email
