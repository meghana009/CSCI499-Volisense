university park pa while the covid 19 pandemic delivered a massive economic blow to the u s tourism sector some rural communities benefited from the crisis in terms of employment gains according to a team of researchers from penn state and west virginia university their study which is the first to document covid 19 s economic impact on tourism in the u s at the county level may help guide the development of rural tourism and destination management strategies that enhance community resilience as regional economists we re interested in how communities are affected by and recover from economic shocks such as a natural disaster or recession the covid 19 pandemic was an entirely new kind of shock that is unique in many ways including how it impacted the leisure and hospitality sector in different places said luyi han the study s lead author and a postdoctoral scholar at the northeast regional center for rural development nercrd based in penn state s college of agricultural sciences for example while americans avoided air travel and crowded destinations they flocked to places with outdoor amenities and low population density or places that were distant from population centers we wanted to better understand this variation over space in terms of its economic impacts the researchers focused on two key economic measures employment and wages in the leisure and hospitality sector and how these measures changed across counties in response to the pandemic they found that while leisure and hospitality employment on average declined by 12 across all counties it increased in 332 counties they also found that where employment losses were the greatest wages were more likely to increase indicating that leisure and hospitality workers who managed to hold onto their jobs in hard hit places received pay increases to conduct their study which was published online june 16 in the journal tourism economics the researchers used the quarterly census of employment and wages which provides county level data by industry and allowed them to focus on the leisure and hospitality sector specifically they compared data on employment and wages from the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020 to capture the peak travel months of july and august said han we found that the pandemic had vastly different economic effects on tourism across the u s with some places experiencing tourism related job losses as high as 71 and other places experiencing more than a two fold increase in these types of jobs said han typically the places that experienced the biggest job gains had very low tourism employment to begin with but our study revealed quite a bit of variation from place to place to better understand this variation the researchers conducted a statistical analysis to examine whether certain place based factors might have played a role they considered each county s status on a continuum from urban to rural distance from metropolitan areas population density average household income the extent to which the local economy is diversified and the community s stock of social capital a measure of the networks and bonds that foster cohesion among residents our main finding is that the tourism economy in rural counties weathered the shocks of the pandemic better than their urban counterparts this is not all that surprising given the risks covid posed and the need for social distancing measures which tourists might perceive as easier to accommodate through outdoor recreation and visiting lower population density rural communities said jason entsminger assistant research professor of agricultural economics sociology and education at penn state and associate director of the nercrd what was really surprising was how much employment grew in some of the most rural and sparsely populated counties rises in employment and wages in these communities show the growth in tourism demand for rural spaces suggesting people not only sought to avoid crowds but looked for far flung and isolated places which they felt they could explore safely entsminger noted that this rise in demand presents both challenges and opportunities for rural community well being and that for some rural places their new tourist destination status and related employment gains weren t necessarily all for the best we know from previous research that tourism can be an effective strategy for rural communities to diversify and to enhance their resilience in the face of economic shocks however some communities might not be ready for the sudden influx of visitors and can struggle over time with the effects for example there are early indications this influx is impacting the housing market quality of life and environmental quality in some areas entsminger said our findings show that the covid 19 pandemic provides an opportunity for communities to consider their resilience as a tourist destination can they weather a sudden influx of tourists as well as a sudden downturn policies that consider both perspectives are clearly needed in many rural places in addition to han and entsminger other members of the research team include stephan goetz professor of agricultural and regional economics at penn state and director of the nercrd daniel eades extension specialist in rural economics at west virginia university wvu and doug arbogast extension specialist in rural tourism development at wvu the research was supported in part by funding from the usda national institute of food and agriculture and the college of agricultural sciences at penn state university
david klepper associated press one by one several of donald trump s former top advisers have told a special house committee investigating his role in the jan 6 insurrection that they didn t believe his lies about the 2020 election and that the former president knew he lost to joe biden but instead of convincing trump s most stalwart supporters testimony from former attorney general bill barr and trump s daughter ivanka about the election and the attack on the u s capitol is prompting many of them to simply reassert their views that the former president was correct in his false claim of victory barr s testimony that trump was repeatedly told there was no election fraud he was paid off by a voting machine company according to one false claim that went viral this week ivanka trump saying she didn t believe trump either it s all part of trump s grand plan to confuse his enemies and save america more scott perry s alleged pardon request renews calls for criminal probe more rep scott perry asked trump for a pardon after jan 6 committee leader says as hearings open more perry other gop lawmakers escalate standoff with jan 6 panel the claims again demonstrate how deeply rooted trump s false narrative about the election has become it s cognitive dissonance said jennifer stromer galley a syracuse university professor who has studied how trump used social media and advertising to mobilize his base if you believe what trump says and now bill barr and trump s own daughter are saying these other things it creates a crack and people have to fill it the lawmakers leading the hearings into the deadly attack on the u s capitol said one of their goals is to show how trump repeatedly lied to his supporters in an effort to hold onto power and subvert american democracy president trump invested millions of dollars of campaign funds purposely spreading false information running ads he knew were false and convincing millions of americans that the election was corrupt and he was the true president said rep liz cheney r wyo the panel s vice chair as you will see this misinformation campaign provoked the violence on january 6th for those who accept trump s baseless claims barr s testimony was especially jarring in his interview with investigators he detailed trump s many absurd allegations about the election 2020 calling them bogus and idiotic barr told the committee when he talked with trump there was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were he s become detached from reality if he really believes this stuff barr said following his testimony many trump supporters using sites like reddit gettr and telegram blasted barr as a turncoat and noted that he s disputed trump s election claims before but many others began grasping for alternative explanations for this testimony i m still hoping barr is playing a role one poster said on a telegram channel popular with trump supporters one post that spread widely this week suggested barr was paid by dominion voting systems a company targeted by trump and his supporters with baseless claims of vote rigging from 2009 to 2018 dominion paid barr 1 2 million in cash and granted him another 1 1 million in stock awards according to sec filings no wonder barr can t find any voter fraud the post read wrong dominion barr was paid by dominion energy a publicly traded company headquartered in richmond virginia that provides power and heat to customers in several mid atlantic states unlike barr ivanka trump has remained intensely popular with many trump supporters and is seen by many as her father s potential successor that may be why so many had to find an an alternative explanation for why she told congress she didn t accept her father s claims jordan sather a leading proponent of the qanon theory claims both barr and ivanka trump lied during their testimony on trump s orders part of an elaborate scheme to defeat trump s enemies by confusing congress and the american public i can just imagine donald trump telling ivanka hey go to this hearing say these things screw with their heads sather said last week on his online show some trump supporters dismissed ivanka trump s testimony entirely by questioning whether any of it was real that s another common refrain seen on far right message boards many posters say they don t even believe the hearings are happening but are a hollywood production starring stand ins for the former president s daughter and others she looks different in a big way one poster asked on telegram cgi

bob and katie jarnot have created a local legacy based on helping eagle county students discover post secondary pathways courtesy photo growing up kids often look to their heroes to figure out an answer to the perennial question what do you want to be when you grow up and so from firefighters to astronauts kids emulate their future off figures that feel larger than life many times this includes their parents and while following in your parents footsteps is no easy feat when it s done right you can build a family legacy for the jarnot family who have called eagle county home since 1973 this legacy is rooted not only in education but also in helping students figure out their next steps after high school whatever path they take bob jarnot following in the footsteps of his mother who served as a teacher in a one room schoolhouse was a longtime business teacher at battle mountain first when it was located at maloit park and then when it was where the homestake peak school currently resides now his daughter katie jarnot serves as the assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction for the same school district in which he taught and she attended school not the path i was going to go however katie jarnot s path to her current role and to education wasn t as straightforward as one might think i m very proud to say i m a third generation educator but yeah he had to force me into it that was not the path i was going to go but i m glad i did katie jarnot said support local journalism donate katie jarnot initially went to college for theatre and english in illinois only getting a teaching degree at the urging of her dad who wanted her to have a backup plan with something she could get a job in she said however her student teaching experience made that seem like her education degree was something she never wanted to use so she went into a career producing large scale events museum exhibits and documentary films but after 10 years she decided to give teaching another try in a school district in new hampshire i really loved it it was the right school district it was small it was well funded katie jarnot said quickly however when evaluating her first teaching paychecks she decided to go to the dark side and get into administration having grown up the daughter of a teacher administration was the dark side it was the man you don t do that she said but i took a class and i realized that being a principal was the same thing as being a producer you have a finite amount of time you have a finite budget it s your job to make sure it all gets done and the kids are the talent and the teachers are the director and you re the producer and i just went oh yeah i could really like this katie jarnot ultimately returned to serve as a principal and then assistant superintendent in the same district that her dad taught in and that she graduated from in 1988 courtesy photo this path in administration is eventually what brought her back to eagle county and to the same district her dad had taught in and for over 10 years she served as the principal of eagle valley middle school before taking on her current role as assistant superintendent in 2018 in her current role katie jarnot oversees a number of programs staff members and curriculum but a big part of her role has been nurturing and growing the district s career and college readiness programs including avid careerx careerwise early college high school and ascent it wasn t until recently she said that a light bulb went off and she realized she was following directly in her dad s footsteps in many ways i was here having dinner with my parents playing cards or something and all the sudden this light bulb went off and i realized my dad used to do what we do in careerx and careerwise and even avid katie jarnot said he did all of those things back in the day when that s what the business teacher at the school did and now we have this whole five person team that is reaching every kid in the district starting in sixth grade creating pathways when bob jarnot first joined battle mountain high school after moving to eagle county in the 1970s he was the only business teacher as such he taught everything from accounting and keyboarding to business law and entrepreneurship over time he witnessed not only the changing skillsets in these classes as keyboarding progressed from manual typewriters to electric typewriters and eventually to keyboards but also was able to grow a number of meaningful career based programs for students specifically bob jarnot started the local chapter of the future business leaders of america something still in place in the district today as well as a co op program that helped students find employment in school something now reflected in the district s careerx careerwise and other readiness programs through the co op program bob jarnot said he helped kids find jobs in various offices from local banks to vail town hall through these opportunities students not only got school credit a paycheck and real world employment experience but a chance to learn valuable life skills and develop interests that they re going to use the rest of their life bob jarnot said i think getting that exposure to the workplace early on is really important i think it helps kids realize what s out there in the world that they might not otherwise experience katie jarnot said of both her father s work and her own the classes and programs through bob jarnot himself also helped them consider their college and career options and plan for their future as he taught students in every class he taught practical everyday things that you re going to use in life he said the success of this program and the legacy of bob jarnot was and remains evident in the eagle county community there was a point in this valley where i could not go into any bank anywhere in the valley where someone didn t say oh are you bob jarnot s daughter he got me this job i ve been here since high school katie jarnot said a lot of those kids would stick with those jobs and rise through the ranks and end up being really successful bob jarnot also recalled a recent moment when he went to a local machine rental business in eagle and ran into a former student this student bob jarnot said told him the best thing he learned from school was from a stock trading program ran at the time through the denver post which he used in his business courses the lesson the student said helped him with his retirement more than anything else bob jarnot said a true celebration of being a third generation educator katie jarnot has her father and grandmother s first teaching contracts framed alongside her own in her office the moments were a graduation gift from her father courtesy photo while the co op program took a hiatus for 20 some years after bob jarnot left battle mountain it s returning through a number of programs that katie jarnot now oversees and they re growing exponentially katie jarnot said when i was in school either you were going to college or you weren t going to college there wasn t a whole lot of support if you weren t going to college and i feel like that s where a lot of the programs that my dad worked on helped kids either to explore that track she said adding that she recalls her dad having many conversations with his students about considering the various options available to them out of high school now i m really proud of the fact that we have so many different pathways and no matter what your background or where you re from you can explore it you can look at it we ve got ways for kids to you can get an associates degree before you graduate from high school and transfer into college as a junior and for free and save money katie jarnot said it just exposes kids to so many different things and i think that s really really important that we have so many options now having those opportunities is important while many of the things that bob jarnot worked to build at battle mountain are rapidly growing fixtures of eagle county schools under katie jarnot s leadership the father daughter duo agreed that their success and growth are also the results of the growing population locally and the growing need for these programs nationally katie jarnot noted that eagle county schools was the first rural district in the state to have careerwise the first rural district to have early college high school and one of the very few to have p tech a testament she said to the population here i think parents expect a lot more for their children than what they had and the question is will their children ever have a chance to improve their life bob jarnot said i think we have rather forward thinking parents in eagle county that are willing to support programs that will improve their kids lives it s not just reading writing and arithmetic it takes more than that today to have a future in any area of work for bob jarnot it has been great to see not only the continuation and growth of programs that he believed in but also to see solutions to some of the challenges he saw students facing when he taught this includes the introduction of red canyon as an alternative high school in the district which he called a great improvement as it allows all students an opportunity to better themselves a proud legacy bob jarnot taught business at battle mountain high school after moving to eagle county from detroit in 1973 courtesy photo even as katie and bob jarnot are still discovering how their careers overlap talking shop is not something that often occurs when they re together i don t think we sit down and have school discussions because i m too far out of it to have a discussion about what s going on in the classroom today kind of thing but we have more or less philosophy discussions about education bob jarnot said while he s out of the classroom katie jarnot added that her dad does often remind her to consider the teacher s perspective you will call me out when i m not paying attention to the teacher point of view katie jarnot said i appreciate that perspective plus she added while they don t often talk business she does like to share about the growth of the career and college readiness programs i don t know if i pick your brain that much but i brag to my dad a lot she said anytime we ve grown the careerx or the careerwise programs i feel like i definitely brag a lot to my dad this she said stems a lot from the newly found pride that she s following pretty directly in her father s footsteps i just am so proud and when that light bulb went off for me and i realized i m continuing on my dad s work that was just incredibly meaningful to me that we still have that going and we ve grown it and look where we are now katie jarnot said
a representations of cryptocurrency bitcoin is seen in front of a stock graph and u s dollar in this illustration created jan 24 reuters yonhap bitcoin tumbled more than 13 percent at one point on saturday crashing below the closely watched 20 000 level to its weakest value in 18 months as it extended a slide on investor worries about growing troubles in the industry and the general pull back from riskier assets the digital currency sector has been pummeled this week after cryptocurrency lending company celsius froze withdrawals and transfers between accounts while crypto companies started laying off employees there also were reports that a cryptocurrency hedge fund had run into trouble the developments have coincided with an equities slide as u s stocks suffered their biggest weekly percentage decline in two years on fears of rising interest rates and the growing likelihood of a recession the accelerated pace and depth of bitcoin losses in conjunction with the stocks rout could challenge support for the cryptocurrency from a range of investor groups while some institutions purchased bitcoin hoping it would offset declines in stocks and bonds it hasn t demonstrated that it is an uncorrelated asset said michael purves founder and chief executive officer of tallbacken capital the case for institutions to buy the dip is more challenged now given that the utility for bitcoin has yet to be proven he said i think this is going to slice through 15 000 he said there is so much velocity on the downside bitcoin the biggest cryptocurrency had dropped around 13 7 percent by saturday afternoon to a low of 17 593 its weakest level since december 2020 before pulling back up to 18 556 still down 9 22 percent it has lost about 60 percent of its value this year while rival cryptocurrency ethereum backed ether is down 74 percent in 2021 bitcoin peaked at more than 68 000 breaking 20 000 shows you that confidence has collapsed for the crypto industry and that you re seeing the latest stresses edward moya senior market analyst at oanda said on saturday moya said that even the loudest crypto cheerleaders from the big rally are now quiet they are still optimistic long term but they are not saying this is the time to buy the dip the sector has also suffered losses after companies such as coinbase global inc gemini and blockfi said they would lay off thousands of employees as investors ditch risky assets the slide is hitting retail investors that bought into the asset there s a tremendous amount of people that will be scarred forever said moya referring to retail buyers but there are still a lot of people that were about to get into the space and there s still interest technical levels jeffrey gundlach ceo of doubleline capital said wednesday he would not be surprised if bitcoin fell to 10 000 others say the deepening slide could force more investors to unload bitcoin which rose along with other risky assets during the era of pandemic related stimulus the 20 000 level for bitcoin is an important technical level and the dip below may trigger more margin calls resulting in forced liquidations said jay hatfield chief investment officer at infrastructure capital management in new york bitcoin may dip below the 10 000 level this year as the fed federal reserve liquidity driven bubble fully bursts with bitcoin returning to its pre pandemic levels he said at saturday s lows bitcoin was in danger of closing below key levels identified by technical analysis which could reinforce bearish sentiment one of those levels was 19 225 the 76 4 percent fibonacci retracement level of its rise during the pandemic the other was 19 666 the cycle high for the previous bitcoin rally that peaked in 2017 reuters
for the united states and much of the rest of the world the 1970s were a time of high oil prices surging inflation stock market swoons political upheaval and geopolitical tension add pandemic and climate change to the list and it also sounds like a fair description of the world today a half century later psychoanalyst theodor reik once wrote it has been said that history repeats itself this is perhaps not quite correct it merely rhymes so just how much do the 1970s and the 2020s rhyme many commentators have based 1970s redux analyses primarily on what was then called stagflation inflation in the context of a stagnant economy after world war ii the us economic growth rate achieved sustained unprecedented highs but then in the 1970s growth stalled that s partly because energy production also stalled energy is after all the irreducible basis of all economic activity us oil extraction rates started a long decline the economic effects of which were greatly amplified by the arab embargo of 1972 and the 1979 iranian revolution which sent oil prices soaring inflation surged averaged economic growth rates fell by half for the decades after 1980 compared to the two decades before and interest rates topped out at nearly 17 per cent in 1981 but much is different now today s global energy crisis is actually much worse affecting not just oil but gas and electricity as well as in the 70s high fuel prices are due both to resource depletion then declining us oil production today declining global production of conventional oil and to geopolitical events then events in the middle east now the russia ukraine war the 70s energy crisis was eventually defused by increased petroleum production in places like the north sea alaska mexico and china today prospects for boosting world oil production are few notably in the permian formation in texas and most hopes for future energy supplies rest on renewable sources like solar and wind but these sources will require vast investment and the electrification of enormous swathes of our industrial system and may end up being limited by materials requirements for panels turbines and batteries inflation is once again surging but the federal reserve may not be able to deploy high interest rates to fight it as it did in the 1970s and early 80s as energy economist carey king explains those interest rate hikes were a drag on economic growth so after the 1980s the fed gradually lowered interest rates and the economy began a tepid recovery but lowering interest rates led households governments and businesses to take on more debt with increased debt somewhat making up for slower economic growth since a larger proportion of spending was now funded by debt rather than profits or wages king notes the us total debt and loan to gdp ratio rose from near 160 per cent in the 1970s to over 370 per cent in 2009 at the peak of the great recession following a decline after 2009 this ratio has remained above 350 per cent since with a short peak over 400 per cent at the beginning of the covid pandemic the result today is a situation in which massive debt government corporate and household makes raising interest rates exceedingly hazardous because doing so boosts interest payments as older debt gets rolled over at higher interest rates thereby risking a round of debt defaults that could send economies toppling like a row of dominoes so our current situation has some features in common with but is far from being an exact repeat of the 70s repetitive patterns in time or cycles exist everywhere in nature and society searching for cycles in human history can be intellectually seductive and revelatory but it can also be treacherous if we see patterns that aren t really there or try to make bold predictions based on them cycles can proceed in temporal near lockstep like seasonal bird or butterfly migrations but underlying or background conditions can change resetting or altogether halting long standing cyclical patterns as when bird migrations fail due to habitat loss similarly human societies exist within regimes of climate and relative resource abundance and when those regimes shift social rhythms can be shattered for example ancient egyptian civilization which based its agricultural success on the annually replenished fertility of the nile delta saw many cycles of advance and retreat however the ancient greeks who depended upon a more fragile ecosystem and depleted both forests and topsoil enjoyed fewer turns of the screw before suffering long term population decline if it s important to pay attention to changes in underlying environmental factors when comparing historical periods then let s return to our comparison of the 1970s with the 2020s and consider some numbers human population in 1970 stood at about 3 7 billion today it s over twice that and estimated by the un to hit 8 billion this month global materials use in 1970 stood at less than 30 billion tons annually today it s over three times that level at roughly 100 billion tons meanwhile rising population and resource extraction have had serious impacts on nature since the 1970s the population numbers of wild insects birds mammals amphibians and reptiles have declined by 60 to 70 on average a recent study found a significant decline in average fishery biomass in all observed regions across all oceans and climate zones a third of the earth s topsoil has been lost since the 1970s in short from a biophysical ecological point of view we now inhabit a different world in just 50 years we have shifted from relative abundance to relative depletion and scarcity there s no reason to regard this shift as mostly the result of a repetitive cyclical process rather it makes more sense to think of it as the consequence of a one time only profusion of human population innovation and consumption enabled by a rapid influx of energy from fossil fuels this can best be understood as a singular self limiting cycle like a wildfire consuming all available fuel maybe the biggest thing that s different today is climate change in 1970 the carbon dioxide content of the planetary atmosphere stood at 326 parts per million compared with the pre industrial level of 280 ppm today it is shooting past 421 ppm global temperatures have increased on average by over one degree celsius already and are likewise rising rapidly while there are cycles in earth s climate the past three million years have featured several roughly 100 000 year long glacial periods punctuated by 10 000 year warmer interglacials what s happening now as a result of people burning fossil fuels has no true precedent excerpted oil crisis surging inflation is this the 1970s again courtesy commondreams org

adrian florido host on your most recent trip to the grocery store or to the gas station you ve surely noticed what we all have prices keep going up inflation is still climbing at a record pace in the u s and to try to stop that the federal reserve has raised interest rates again this week its biggest rate hike since 1994 the idea is that by making it more expensive to borrow money for a car or a house or to charge something to a credit card americans will start spending less bringing down demand and prices but many economists fear these aggressive rate hikes will slow the economy so much that we may be headed into a recession which has many americans wondering should i be preparing for that to help us make sense of where the u s economy is and how it might affect your life we ve called teresa ghilarducci she s a professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci welcome back to the program teresa ghilarducci oh it s really good to talk to you again adrian florido the federal reserve says it s trying to engineer a soft landing to the economy hiking interest rates just enough to bring down prices without causing a full blown recession what s your sense of whether that s a realistic expectation ghilarducci well me like the majority of economists in the united states and actually in most of the world believe that they won t achieve it that the federal reserve has set in motion a recession for next year there was only one fed governor that voted against it esther george from kansas city and she dissented because she said the rate hike was way too high that it will cause a lot of construction to seize up making the housing supply problem even worse it will certainly stop people from buying on credit but it also stops businesses from borrowing in order to expand and employ more people so it s not just consumers that are affected by the interest rate hike it s also businesses that need to borrow money to basically create jobs florido even if we aren t in a recession yet a lot of people you know remember the great recession of 2008 ghilarducci yeah florido and how tough it was for so many people and they re wondering should i be preparing teresa ghilarducci are you doing anything yet to prepare for a possible recession ghilarducci right it s really important for people to wonder what to expect when expecting a recession i am i have stopped my spending a bit i don t click on amazon as much and i m putting a lot of money in reserve in emergency savings you know in my checking account i m just letting that build up a bit i m not planning the vacation that i was dreaming about in 2021 i m continuing to save in my retirement accounts to the maximum you know along with my emergency fund i m also saving in my retirement accounts the low valuations in the stock market has not deterred me at all in fact i ve been a little happier because buying stock now is a little bit cheaper for people who are in lower incomes these are people who are making like less than 34 000 which is actually a lot of people or if you re in a married couple and your income is below 68 000 you can get help from the federal government to save for your retirement up to 1 000 to 2 000 depending upon your situation it s called the saver s credit so that s an encouragement for even the people who are most strapped by inflation now to still save for their retirement florido i think a big question on a lot of people s minds is you know what should i be doing with my money first how should i be prioritizing should i be saving first ghilarducci yeah florido should i be using my money to pay down loans and credit cards since we probably expect interest rates to keep going up ghilarducci yeah so what people should do with their first dollar you know the paycheck you get like next week is put about 5 or 10 if you can in emergency savings really plan as if you re going to lose 20 of your hours or that you may have a couple of months of unemployment even for you or your family member so when you have that mindset when you re expecting a recession what you do with that first dollar is going to be very different you don t have to pay off debt don t add to it certainly don t borrow any more because your interest rate s going to go up try to save for those emergencies first the second use would be paying off debt but that might be kind of a luxury right now florido it s obviously a really uncertain time with a lot of this talk of an impending recession and you know it can be hard not to feel anxious ghilarducci yeah florido is there anything we should know so as not to lose maybe too much sleep about this recessions don t last forever right ghilarducci yeah adrian the best antidote to anxiety is information and control and people do have a lot of choices and control and agency as they re expecting a recession and also handling the inflation they have right now you can spend some time searching for bargains and switching from expensive items to cheaper items that helps on the margin but it helps enormously with your state of mind and being able to sleep you re controlling that and if you can put in your mindset not anxiety but reality that you might not have the bonuses and the income or even lose some hours next year again that gives you some control and peace of mind florido what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks and months to get a sense of where exactly the economy is headed ghilarducci yeah i m going to be looking at bargaining power i m going to see if workers can actually get a wage increase to counter this inflation and if they can t i will predict weakening so i like to look at not the unemployment rate but expectations if you ask for the federal reserve has a survey about expectations if you ask for a raise would you get it are you thinking about quitting or are you quitting i m looking at that i m really looking at congress to see if there is bipartisan support for some of the proposals coming from the white house which are to control insulin prices now that sounds odd but insulin is taken by diabetics and 30 of the population needs insulin if we could actually bring down those costs that could help i m looking to see if congress will help people on fixed incomes people who are on tanf people who are on food stamps it s actually again a huge part of the population to see if they will give them some relief so i m watching congress i think the federal reserve has learned its lesson from the loud chorus of economists that say hang on on those rate increases you know slow down a bit on that so i ll be looking at all things i ll look at numbers i ll look at politics and then i ll look at the federal reserve florido i ve been speaking with teresa ghilarducci professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci thank you so much for sharing your expertise

while the covid 19 pandemic delivered a massive economic blow to the u s tourism sector some rural communities benefited from the crisis in terms of employment gains according to a team of researchers from penn state and west virginia university their study which is the first to document covid 19 s economic impact on tourism in the u s at the county level may help guide the development of rural tourism and destination management strategies that enhance community resilience as regional economists we re interested in how communities are affected by and recover from economic shocks such as a natural disaster or recession the covid 19 pandemic was an entirely new kind of shock that is unique in many ways including how it impacted the leisure and hospitality sector in different places said luyi han the study s lead author and a postdoctoral scholar at the northeast regional center for rural development nercrd based in penn state s college of agricultural sciences for example while americans avoided air travel and crowded destinations they flocked to places with outdoor amenities and low population density or places that were distant from population centers we wanted to better understand this variation over space in terms of its economic impacts the researchers focused on two key economic measures employment and wages in the leisure and hospitality sector and how these measures changed across counties in response to the pandemic they found that while leisure and hospitality employment on average declined by 12 across all counties it increased in 332 counties they also found that where employment losses were the greatest wages were more likely to increase indicating that leisure and hospitality workers who managed to hold onto their jobs in hard hit places received pay increases to conduct their study which was published online june 16 in the journal tourism economics the researchers used the quarterly census of employment and wages which provides county level data by industry and allowed them to focus on the leisure and hospitality sector specifically they compared data on employment and wages from the third quarter of 2019 to the third quarter of 2020 to capture the peak travel months of july and august said han we found that the pandemic had vastly different economic effects on tourism across the u s with some places experiencing tourism related job losses as high as 71 and other places experiencing more than a two fold increase in these types of jobs said han typically the places that experienced the biggest job gains had very low tourism employment to begin with but our study revealed quite a bit of variation from place to place to better understand this variation the researchers conducted a statistical analysis to examine whether certain place based factors might have played a role they considered each county s status on a continuum from urban to rural distance from metropolitan areas population density average household income the extent to which the local economy is diversified and the community s stock of social capital a measure of the networks and bonds that foster cohesion among residents our main finding is that the tourism economy in rural counties weathered the shocks of the pandemic better than their urban counterparts this is not all that surprising given the risks covid posed and the need for social distancing measures which tourists might perceive as easier to accommodate through outdoor recreation and visiting lower population density rural communities said jason entsminger assistant research professor of agricultural economics sociology and education at penn state and associate director of the nercrd what was really surprising was how much employment grew in some of the most rural and sparsely populated counties rises in employment and wages in these communities show the growth in tourism demand for rural spaces suggesting people not only sought to avoid crowds but looked for far flung and isolated places which they felt they could explore safely entsminger noted that this rise in demand presents both challenges and opportunities for rural community well being and that for some rural places their new tourist destination status and related employment gains weren t necessarily all for the best we know from previous research that tourism can be an effective strategy for rural communities to diversify and to enhance their resilience in the face of economic shocks however some communities might not be ready for the sudden influx of visitors and can struggle over time with the effects for example there are early indications this influx is impacting the housing market quality of life and environmental quality in some areas entsminger said our findings show that the covid 19 pandemic provides an opportunity for communities to consider their resilience as a tourist destination can they weather a sudden influx of tourists as well as a sudden downturn policies that consider both perspectives are clearly needed in many rural places in addition to han and entsminger other members of the research team include stephan goetz professor of agricultural and regional economics at penn state and director of the nercrd daniel eades extension specialist in rural economics at west virginia university wvu and doug arbogast extension specialist in rural tourism development at wvu the research was supported in part by funding from the usda national institute of food and agriculture and the college of agricultural sciences at penn state university

the prospects for many companies have deteriorated markedly since the start of the year significant threats such as high inflation rising interest rates and war in ukraine have combined to cause a weaker operating outlook across a wide range of industries however not all sectors face a more difficult future than six months ago the defence industry for example is poised to be reinvigorated by a new post cold war era in which the idea of spending more on the armed forces to provide greater security is widely accepted in questor s view this will create more promising circumstances for chemring the ftse 250 company designs develops and manufactures countermeasures such as flares that protect military hardware from guided missiles it also develops sensor technologies that detect a range of threats including cyber explosive and chemical even before russia s invasion of ukraine the company was already growing quickly its interim results published earlier this month reported an 18pc rise in underlying pre tax profits amid buoyant operating conditions as america which accounts for just over half of the company s sales plans to increase its defence budget by 4 1pc to record levels next year demand for chemring s products is likely to rise although the impact of higher defence spending on its sales and profits is subject to time lags as announcements typically precede tangible orders the company s long term prospects are nevertheless increasingly upbeat a solid performance in the first half of the year allowed it to further reduce net debt levels they now stand at just 18 4m including lease liabilities which equates to a gearing ratio of less than 5pc declining leverage not only reduces the risks that face the company in an environment of rising interest rates but provides scope for it to engage in mergers and acquisitions to further enhance its growth prospects

adrian florido host on your most recent trip to the grocery store or to the gas station you ve surely noticed what we all have prices keep going up inflation is still climbing at a record pace in the u s and to try to stop that the federal reserve has raised interest rates again this week its biggest rate hike since 1994 the idea is that by making it more expensive to borrow money for a car or a house or to charge something to a credit card americans will start spending less bringing down demand and prices but many economists fear these aggressive rate hikes will slow the economy so much that we may be headed into a recession which has many americans wondering should i be preparing for that to help us make sense of where the u s economy is and how it might affect your life we ve called teresa ghilarducci she s a professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci welcome back to the program teresa ghilarducci oh it s really good to talk to you again adrian florido the federal reserve says it s trying to engineer a soft landing to the economy hiking interest rates just enough to bring down prices without causing a full blown recession what s your sense of whether that s a realistic expectation ghilarducci well me like the majority of economists in the united states and actually in most of the world believe that they won t achieve it that the federal reserve has set in motion a recession for next year there was only one fed governor that voted against it esther george from kansas city and she dissented because she said the rate hike was way too high that it will cause a lot of construction to seize up making the housing supply problem even worse it will certainly stop people from buying on credit but it also stops businesses from borrowing in order to expand and employ more people so it s not just consumers that are affected by the interest rate hike it s also businesses that need to borrow money to basically create jobs florido even if we aren t in a recession yet a lot of people you know remember the great recession of 2008 ghilarducci yeah florido and how tough it was for so many people and they re wondering should i be preparing teresa ghilarducci are you doing anything yet to prepare for a possible recession ghilarducci right it s really important for people to wonder what to expect when expecting a recession i am i have stopped my spending a bit i don t click on amazon as much and i m putting a lot of money in reserve in emergency savings you know in my checking account i m just letting that build up a bit i m not planning the vacation that i was dreaming about in 2021 i m continuing to save in my retirement accounts to the maximum you know along with my emergency fund i m also saving in my retirement accounts the low valuations in the stock market has not deterred me at all in fact i ve been a little happier because buying stock now is a little bit cheaper for people who are in lower incomes these are people who are making like less than 34 000 which is actually a lot of people or if you re in a married couple and your income is below 68 000 you can get help from the federal government to save for your retirement up to 1 000 to 2 000 depending upon your situation it s called the saver s credit so that s an encouragement for even the people who are most strapped by inflation now to still save for their retirement florido i think a big question on a lot of people s minds is you know what should i be doing with my money first how should i be prioritizing should i be saving first ghilarducci yeah florido should i be using my money to pay down loans and credit cards since we probably expect interest rates to keep going up ghilarducci yeah so what people should do with their first dollar you know the paycheck you get like next week is put about 5 or 10 if you can in emergency savings really plan as if you re going to lose 20 of your hours or that you may have a couple of months of unemployment even for you or your family member so when you have that mindset when you re expecting a recession what you do with that first dollar is going to be very different you don t have to pay off debt don t add to it certainly don t borrow any more because your interest rate s going to go up try to save for those emergencies first the second use would be paying off debt but that might be kind of a luxury right now florido it s obviously a really uncertain time with a lot of this talk of an impending recession and you know it can be hard not to feel anxious ghilarducci yeah florido is there anything we should know so as not to lose maybe too much sleep about this recessions don t last forever right ghilarducci yeah adrian the best antidote to anxiety is information and control and people do have a lot of choices and control and agency as they re expecting a recession and also handling the inflation they have right now you can spend some time searching for bargains and switching from expensive items to cheaper items that helps on the margin but it helps enormously with your state of mind and being able to sleep you re controlling that and if you can put in your mindset not anxiety but reality that you might not have the bonuses and the income or even lose some hours next year again that gives you some control and peace of mind florido what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks and months to get a sense of where exactly the economy is headed ghilarducci yeah i m going to be looking at bargaining power i m going to see if workers can actually get a wage increase to counter this inflation and if they can t i will predict weakening so i like to look at not the unemployment rate but expectations if you ask for the federal reserve has a survey about expectations if you ask for a raise would you get it are you thinking about quitting or are you quitting i m looking at that i m really looking at congress to see if there is bipartisan support for some of the proposals coming from the white house which are to control insulin prices now that sounds odd but insulin is taken by diabetics and 30 of the population needs insulin if we could actually bring down those costs that could help i m looking to see if congress will help people on fixed incomes people who are on tanf people who are on food stamps it s actually again a huge part of the population to see if they will give them some relief so i m watching congress i think the federal reserve has learned its lesson from the loud chorus of economists that say hang on on those rate increases you know slow down a bit on that so i ll be looking at all things i ll look at numbers i ll look at politics and then i ll look at the federal reserve florido i ve been speaking with teresa ghilarducci professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci thank you so much for sharing your expertise

basel war is raging in ukraine stocks are down 20 inflation is up more than 8 the crypto economy is collapsing but back in the bubble of the international art world the wealthy for the moment at least appear to be on a spending spree following on from may s bumper two week series of marquee auctions in new york that raised more than 2 5 billion collectors were on the hunt for further desirable modern and contemporary works at the 52nd edition of the art basel fair in switzerland which opened to vip guests tuesday an iconic spider sculpture by artist louise bourgeois priced at 40 million was announced as the biggest of numerous big ticket sales because of the coronavirus pandemic this was the first in person full scale art basel fair held in switzerland in its customary june slot since 2019 a slightly reduced edition held last year in september was hampered by an unfamiliar date and continuing covid 19 restrictions september was down new york based dealer sean kelly said on the first floor of the main exhibition building where contemporary gallerists are concentrated but this year he said sales have been strong kelly was one of 289 exhibitors at this year s fair up from 272 in 2021 there are hardly any chinese collectors kelly added but it feels like we re very much back some major buyers have been here kelly made more than 20 sales in the 30 000 to 250 000 price range within the first six hours of the opening the fair along with the rest of europe s luxury retail businesses has been adversely affected by the covid related restrictions on unnecessary travel that china imposed in may the masks and coronavirus tests were gone this year and art basel was back to relative normality but the crowds were somewhat thinner the pace slower and the lunchtime lines at the wurst stalls slightly shorter than in the boom years of the 2000s and 2010s some 93 000 visitors attended the fair in 2019 according to art basel however international collectors particularly in asia have become comfortable about engaging with and buying art online at significant price levels nowadays basel exhibitors inundate their clients with online pre fair offers and as a result many of the works in the booths are either presold or reserved on a time limited basis awaiting confirmation by a collector or their adviser i had four minutes to make a decision and there were two others waiting right behind me said new york and florida based adviser kimberly gould she was describing how she bought the large sumptuous 2003 canvas new york ice cream by pioneering black american abstract painter ed clark who featured in the influential touring museum show soul of a nation art in the age of black power the clark was on offer at a nonnegotiable 1 2 million on the booth of new york dealership mnuchin i said ok confirmed gould added decisions have to be made so quickly with stock markets on the slide some vip visitors were reassured by art basel s stolid reputation as the preeminent fair of modern and contemporary art in europe i can sense that people are concerned about the stock market going down said emilie pastor a monaco based collector they re taking more time and looking for safe names i will go for more classical established artists or unknowns pastor bought ages jurassic a framed arrangement of 15 found photos made by british artist steve bishop showing one of the cabazon dinosaurs a roadside attraction in southern california this cost 15 000 pounds about 18 400 at the booth of london gallery carlos ishikawa pastor who has been a regular visitor to art basel for the past 15 years noted how works by younger in demand painters are increasingly prominent on the booths of established blue chip galleries you blinded by m a typically painterly 2022 study by brooklyn based artist jenna gribbon of her musician girlfriend mackenzie scott was sold for 70 000 and could have been sold many times over on the booth of lgdr an international gallery that usually specializes in high end 20th century art also on artdaily claude rutault master of the painted word is dead at 80 a supersize gribbon close up portrait of scott in tears fake cry also from 2022 on the booth of massimo de carlo was regarded by many as one of standout works at art basel priced at 125 000 it was bought for a british based collector during the first few hours of the fair though the subject of intense demand in galleries gribbon has yet to make a game changing auction price unlike young los angeles based painter lucy bull last month at sotheby s the now sale of works by the most exciting artists today one of bull s richly layered abstracts sold for 907 200 an auction record for the artist another painting titled 21 57 from 2021 was discreetly sold to a carefully selected buyer at art basel for 55 000 in the backroom of the booth of bull s los angeles dealer david kordansky how many would be buyers does the gallery have for bull s coveted paintings too many to count said kurt mueller kordansky s director of institutional relations everybody s looking for lot no 1 said philip hoffman founder and ceo of the fine art group a new york based advisory company referring to the rarely available works by young names that auction houses use to kick start their sales with prices that are multiples of the sums first paid in galleries they say i ll buy this if you can get me that hoffman added they think they can make a lot of money yet despite or perhaps because of the current highly speculative market for young art blue chip names continue to rack up sales at art basel a museum grade rarity like felix gonzalez torres 1992 untitled tim hotel one of 22 light string sculptures the cuban american artist created was sold by david zwirner for 12 5 million to an asian collection helped by an exhibition of gonzalez torres work currently on show at the bourse de commerce in paris but then the lisson gallery could also sell an art fair staple like an anish kapoor sculpture in this case the 2018 rhomboid shaped piece non object black for 750 000 pounds about 920 000 after it was announced that bourgeois 22 foot wide steel spider sculpture dating from 1996 had found a buyer at 40 million iwan wirth co founder of the international mega gallery hauser wirth was jubilant it s super exciting he said this is the highest price ever paid for a female artist at art basel no details were revealed of the purchaser for the sculpture which dramatically dominated the dealership s booth a similar size bourgeois spider sold at auction in 2019 for 32 million but that was an editioned sculpture in bronze the spider is the one piece a non bourgeois collector would want to own wirth said it s one of the iconic sculptures of the 20th century true enough but given that 40 million sculptures tend not to be the stuff of four minute or even four hour decisions could that huge ticket purchase have really been confirmed at the fair chloe kinsman a director of communications at hauser wirth said in an email the sale was made on opening day of art basel following discussions in the lead into the fair marc spiegler art basel s global director is now looking ahead to the inaugural edition of the company s paris fair in october spiegler thinks it will take a broad scale economic crash to curb the enthusiasm of the relatively small cohort of superwealthy collectors who currently drive the top end of the art market people s predictions that the pandemic would be the end of art fairs have been proven radically wrong spiegler said you hear every different theory he added there s always money floating around the system this article originally appeared in war is raging in ukraine stocks are down 20 inflation is up more than 8 the crypto economy is collapsing but back in the bubble of the international art world the wealthy for the moment at least appear to be on a spending spree following on from may s bumper two week series of

pandemic this was the first in person full scale art basel fair held in switzerland in its customary june slot since 2019 a slightly reduced edition held last year in september was hampered by an unfamiliar date and continuing covid 19 restrictions september was down new york based dealer sean kelly said on the first floor of the main exhibition building where contemporary gallerists are concentrated but this year he said sales have been strong kelly was one of 289 exhibitors at this year s fair up from 272 in 2021 there are hardly any chinese collectors kelly added but it feels like we re very much back some major buyers have been here kelly made more than 20 sales in the 30 000 to 250 000 price range within the first six hours of the opening the fair along with the rest of europe s luxury retail businesses has been adversely affected by the covid related restrictions on unnecessary travel that china imposed in may the masks and coronavirus tests were gone this year and art basel was back to relative normality but the crowds were somewhat thinner the pace slower and the lunchtime lines at the wurst stalls slightly shorter than in the boom years of the 2000s and 2010s some 93 000 visitors attended the fair in 2019 according to art basel however international collectors particularly in asia have become comfortable about engaging with and buying art online at significant price levels nowadays basel exhibitors inundate their clients with online pre fair offers and as a result many of the works in the booths are either presold or reserved on a time limited basis awaiting confirmation by a collector or their adviser i had four minutes to make a decision and there were two others waiting right behind me said new york and florida based adviser kimberly gould she was describing how she bought the large sumptuous 2003 canvas new york ice cream by pioneering black american abstract painter ed clark who featured in the influential touring museum show soul of a nation art in the age of black power the clark was on offer at a nonnegotiable 1 2 million on the booth of new york dealership mnuchin i said ok confirmed gould added decisions have to be made so quickly with stock markets on the slide some vip visitors were reassured by art basel s stolid reputation as the preeminent fair of modern and contemporary art in europe i can sense that people are concerned about the stock market going down said emilie pastor a monaco based collector they re taking more time and looking for safe names i will go for more classical established artists or unknowns pastor bought ages jurassic a framed arrangement of 15 found photos made by british artist steve bishop showing one of the cabazon dinosaurs a roadside attraction in southern california this cost 15 000 pounds about 18 400 at the booth of london gallery carlos ishikawa pastor who has been a regular visitor to art basel for the past 15 years noted how works by younger in demand painters are increasingly prominent on the booths of established blue chip galleries you blinded by m a typically painterly 2022 study by brooklyn based artist jenna gribbon of her musician girlfriend mackenzie scott was sold for 70 000 and could have been sold many times over on the booth of lgdr an international gallery that usually specializes in high end 20th century art a supersize gribbon close up portrait of scott in tears fake cry also from 2022 on the booth of massimo de carlo was regarded by many as one of standout works at art basel priced at 125 000 it was bought for a british based collector during the first few hours of the fair though the subject of intense demand in galleries gribbon has yet to make a game changing auction price unlike young los angeles based painter lucy bull last month at sotheby s the now sale of works by the most exciting artists today one of bull s richly layered abstracts sold for 907 200 an auction record for the artist another painting titled 21 57 from 2021 was discreetly sold to a carefully selected buyer at art basel for 55 000 in the backroom of the booth of bull s los angeles dealer david kordansky how many would be buyers does the gallery have for bull s coveted paintings too many to count said kurt mueller kordansky s director of institutional relations everybody s looking for lot no 1 said philip hoffman founder and ceo of the fine art group a new york based advisory company referring to the rarely available works by young names that auction houses use to kick start their sales with prices that are multiples of the sums first paid in galleries they say i ll buy this if you can get me that hoffman added they think they can make a lot of money yet despite or perhaps because of the current highly speculative market for young art blue chip names continue to rack up sales at art basel a museum grade rarity like felix gonzalez torres 1992 untitled tim hotel one of 22 light string sculptures the cuban american artist created was sold by david zwirner for 12 5 million to an asian collection helped by an exhibition of gonzalez torres work currently on show at the bourse de commerce in paris but then the lisson gallery could also sell an art fair staple like an anish kapoor sculpture in this case the 2018 rhomboid shaped piece non object black for 750 000 pounds about 920 000 after it was announced that bourgeois 22 foot wide steel spider sculpture dating from 1996 had found a buyer at 40 million iwan wirth co founder of the international mega gallery hauser wirth was jubilant it s super exciting he said this is the highest price ever paid for a female artist at art basel no details were revealed of the purchaser for the sculpture which dramatically dominated the dealership s booth a similar size bourgeois spider sold at auction in 2019 for 32 million but that was an editioned sculpture in bronze the spider is the one piece a non bourgeois collector would want to own wirth said it s one of the iconic sculptures of the 20th century true enough but given that 40 million sculptures tend not to be the stuff of four minute or even four hour decisions could that huge ticket purchase have really been confirmed at the fair chloe kinsman a director of communications at hauser wirth said in an email the sale was made on opening day of art basel following discussions in the lead into the fair marc spiegler art basel s global director is now looking ahead to the inaugural edition of the company s paris fair in october spiegler thinks it will take a broad scale economic crash to curb the enthusiasm of the relatively small cohort of superwealthy collectors who currently drive the top end of the art market people s predictions that the pandemic would be the end of art fairs have been proven radically wrong spiegler said you hear every different theory he added there s always money floating around the system this article originally appeared in the new york times
paris afp central banks have ramped up their battle against runaway inflation a necessary remedy that could have the adverse side effect of tipping countries into recession analysts say advertising read more just this past week the us federal reserve announced its biggest interest rate hike in almost 30 years followed by the fifth straight increase by the bank of england and the first in 15 years in switzerland this week was a first the craziest in my experience said frederick ducrozet chief economist at pictet wealth management the moves rattled stock markets as investors fear that while the rate increases are needed they could put the brakes on economic growth if the tightening of monetary policy becomes too aggressive recessions are increasingly likely as central banks race to dramatically raise rates before inflation spirals out of control said craig erlam an analyst at online trading platform oanda capital economics a research group said it does not anticipate a recession in the united states but the fed is deliberately tempering demand in order to reduce price pressures this is a difficult line to tread and there is clearly a risk that it goes too far and the economy tips into recession it said in a note emerging countries could be collateral victims from rate hikes the dollar rises when the us fed raises its rates a strong dollar will complicate debt repayments of countries with deficits which borrow often in that currency ducrozet said swiss surprise central banks had insisted last year that inflation was only transitory as prices were driven up by bottlenecks in supply chains after governments emerged from lockdowns but energy and food prices have soared in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine pushing inflation higher and prompting economists to lower the world s growth prospects for this year this has left central banks with no other choice but to move more aggressively than planned australia s central bank raised rates more than expected earlier this month while brazil last week lifted its benchmark rate for the 11th straight time more hikes are looming in the united states and europe but it is the swiss national bank that caused the biggest shock on thursday when it announced a rate increase of 0 5 percentage points the first since 2007 the snb had focused on keeping the swiss franc from being too strong until now the actions of the snb are notable in that they mark a significant shift in policy away from a very dovish position said michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk the european central bank has been slower to act than its peers it is putting an end to its massive bond buying scheme and will finally raise rates next month for the first time in a decade the eurozone faces another problem the yields paid by its governments to borrow money have surged with indebted countries such as italy being charged a premium compared to germany a safer bet for investors this spread revived memories of the eurozone s debt crisis prompting the ecb to hold an emergency meeting on thursday after which it said it would design a tool to prevent further stress in the bond market the bank of japan bucked the global trend on friday as it stood by its decision not to raise its rate sending the yen close to the lowest level against the dollar since 1998 but even the bank of japan could adjust its policy said stephen innes managing partner at spi asset management boj members are considering public dissatisfaction with inflation and the rapid depreciation of the yen innes said while they plan to maintain the current easing policy they may look to make some tweaks to support the currency he said no immediate fix consumers will have to be patient before they see the rate hikes have an effect on prices ecb chief christine lagarde said it bluntly when announcing plans for a rate increase next month do we expect that july interest rate hikes will have an immediate effect on inflation the answer to that is no central banks do not have control over some of the problems that are lifting inflation such as soaring energy and food prices and the supply chain snarls capital economics said energy and food prices accounted for 4 1 percentage points of the 7 9 percent rise in consumer prices in major advanced economies over the past year it expects oil gas and agricultural commodity prices to start falling later this year which would bring inflation down sharply but core inflation rates will remain elevated 2022 afp

adrian florido host on your most recent trip to the grocery store or to the gas station you ve surely noticed what we all have prices keep going up inflation is still climbing at a record pace in the u s and to try to stop that the federal reserve has raised interest rates again this week its biggest rate hike since 1994 the idea is that by making it more expensive to borrow money for a car or a house or to charge something to a credit card americans will start spending less bringing down demand and prices but many economists fear these aggressive rate hikes will slow the economy so much that we may be headed into a recession which has many americans wondering should i be preparing for that to help us make sense of where the u s economy is and how it might affect your life we ve called teresa ghilarducci she s a professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci welcome back to the program teresa ghilarducci oh it s really good to talk to you again adrian florido the federal reserve says it s trying to engineer a soft landing to the economy hiking interest rates just enough to bring down prices without causing a full blown recession what s your sense of whether that s a realistic expectation ghilarducci well me like the majority of economists in the united states and actually in most of the world believe that they won t achieve it that the federal reserve has set in motion a recession for next year there was only one fed governor that voted against it esther george from kansas city and she dissented because she said the rate hike was way too high that it will cause a lot of construction to seize up making the housing supply problem even worse it will certainly stop people from buying on credit but it also stops businesses from borrowing in order to expand and employ more people so it s not just consumers that are affected by the interest rate hike it s also businesses that need to borrow money to basically create jobs florido even if we aren t in a recession yet a lot of people you know remember the great recession of 2008 ghilarducci yeah florido and how tough it was for so many people and they re wondering should i be preparing teresa ghilarducci are you doing anything yet to prepare for a possible recession ghilarducci right it s really important for people to wonder what to expect when expecting a recession i am i have stopped my spending a bit i don t click on amazon as much and i m putting a lot of money in reserve in emergency savings you know in my checking account i m just letting that build up a bit i m not planning the vacation that i was dreaming about in 2021 i m continuing to save in my retirement accounts to the maximum you know along with my emergency fund i m also saving in my retirement accounts the low valuations in the stock market has not deterred me at all in fact i ve been a little happier because buying stock now is a little bit cheaper for people who are in lower incomes these are people who are making like less than 34 000 which is actually a lot of people or if you re in a married couple and your income is below 68 000 you can get help from the federal government to save for your retirement up to 1 000 to 2 000 depending upon your situation it s called the saver s credit so that s an encouragement for even the people who are most strapped by inflation now to still save for their retirement florido i think a big question on a lot of people s minds is you know what should i be doing with my money first how should i be prioritizing should i be saving first ghilarducci yeah florido should i be using my money to pay down loans and credit cards since we probably expect interest rates to keep going up ghilarducci yeah so what people should do with their first dollar you know the paycheck you get like next week is put about 5 or 10 if you can in emergency savings really plan as if you re going to lose 20 of your hours or that you may have a couple of months of unemployment even for you or your family member so when you have that mindset when you re expecting a recession what you do with that first dollar is going to be very different you don t have to pay off debt don t add to it certainly don t borrow any more because your interest rate s going to go up try to save for those emergencies first the second use would be paying off debt but that might be kind of a luxury right now florido it s obviously a really uncertain time with a lot of this talk of an impending recession and you know it can be hard not to feel anxious ghilarducci yeah florido is there anything we should know so as not to lose maybe too much sleep about this recessions don t last forever right ghilarducci yeah adrian the best antidote to anxiety is information and control and people do have a lot of choices and control and agency as they re expecting a recession and also handling the inflation they have right now you can spend some time searching for bargains and switching from expensive items to cheaper items that helps on the margin but it helps enormously with your state of mind and being able to sleep you re controlling that and if you can put in your mindset not anxiety but reality that you might not have the bonuses and the income or even lose some hours next year again that gives you some control and peace of mind florido what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks and months to get a sense of where exactly the economy is headed ghilarducci yeah i m going to be looking at bargaining power i m going to see if workers can actually get a wage increase to counter this inflation and if they can t i will predict weakening so i like to look at not the unemployment rate but expectations if you ask for the federal reserve has a survey about expectations if you ask for a raise would you get it are you thinking about quitting or are you quitting i m looking at that i m really looking at congress to see if there is bipartisan support for some of the proposals coming from the white house which are to control insulin prices now that sounds odd but insulin is taken by diabetics and 30 of the population needs insulin if we could actually bring down those costs that could help i m looking to see if congress will help people on fixed incomes people who are on tanf people who are on food stamps it s actually again a huge part of the population to see if they will give them some relief so i m watching congress i think the federal reserve has learned its lesson from the loud chorus of economists that say hang on on those rate increases you know slow down a bit on that so i ll be looking at all things i ll look at numbers i ll look at politics and then i ll look at the federal reserve florido i ve been speaking with teresa ghilarducci professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci thank you so much for sharing your expertise with us ghilarducci oh thank you adrian transcript provided by npr copyright npr

paris june 19 central banks have ramped up their battle against runaway inflation a necessary remedy that could have the adverse side effect of tipping countries into recession analysts say just this past week the us federal reserve announced its biggest interest rate hike in almost 30 years followed by the fifth straight increase by the bank of england and the first in 15 years in switzerland this week was a first the craziest in my experience said frederick ducrozet chief economist at pictet wealth management the moves rattled stock markets as investors fear that while the rate increases are needed they could put the brakes on economic growth if the tightening of monetary policy becomes too aggressive advertisement recessions are increasingly likely as central banks race to dramatically raise rates before inflation spirals out of control said craig erlam an analyst at online trading platform oanda capital economics a research group said it does not anticipate a recession in the united states but the fed is deliberately tempering demand in order to reduce price pressures this is a difficult line to tread and there is clearly a risk that it goes too far and the economy tips into recession it said in a note advertisement emerging countries could be collateral victims from rate hikes the dollar rises when the us fed raises its rates a strong dollar will complicate debt repayments of countries with deficits which borrow often in that currency ducrozet said swiss surprise central banks had insisted last year that inflation was only transitory as prices were driven up by bottlenecks in supply chains after governments emerged from lockdowns but energy and food prices have soared in the wake of russia s invasion of ukraine pushing inflation higher and prompting economists to lower the world s growth prospects for this year this has left central banks with no other choice but to move more aggressively than planned australia s central bank raised rates more than expected earlier this month while brazil last week lifted its benchmark rate for the 11th straight time more hikes are looming in the united states and europe but it is the swiss national bank that caused the biggest shock on thursday when it announced a rate increase of 0 5 percentage points the first since 2007 the snb had focused on keeping the swiss franc from being too strong until now the actions of the snb are notable in that they mark a significant shift in policy away from a very dovish position said michael hewson chief market analyst at cmc markets uk the european central bank has been slower to act than its peers it is putting an end to its massive bond buying scheme and will finally raise rates next month for the first time in a decade the eurozone faces another problem the yields paid by its governments to borrow money have surged with indebted countries such as italy being charged a premium compared to germany a safer bet for investors this spread revived memories of the eurozone s debt crisis prompting the ecb to hold an emergency meeting on thursday after which it said it would design a tool to prevent further stress in the bond market the bank of japan bucked the global trend on friday as it stood by its decision not to raise its rate sending the yen close to the lowest level against the dollar since 1998 but even the bank of japan could adjust its policy said stephen innes managing partner at spi asset management boj members are considering public dissatisfaction with inflation and the rapid depreciation of the yen innes said while they plan to maintain the current easing policy they may look to make some tweaks to support the currency he said no immediate fix consumers will have to be patient before they see the rate hikes have an effect on prices ecb chief christine lagarde said it bluntly when announcing plans for a rate increase next month do we expect that july interest rate hikes will have an immediate effect on inflation the answer to that is no central banks do not have control over some of the problems that are lifting inflation such as soaring energy and food prices and the supply chain snarls capital economics said energy and food prices accounted for 4 1 percentage points of the 7 9 per cent rise in consumer prices in major advanced economies over the past year it expects oil gas and agricultural commodity prices to start falling later this year which would bring inflation down sharply but core inflation rates will remain elevated afp
this stock s share price has already risen 85pc but there s plenty more to come the prospects for many companies have deteriorated markedly since the start of the year significant threats such as high inflation rising interest rates and war in ukraine have combined to cause a weaker operating outlook across a wide range of industries however not all sectors face a more difficult future than six months ago the defence industry for example is poised to be reinvigorated by a new post cold war era in which the idea of spending more on the armed forces to provide greater security is widely accepted in questor s view this will create more promising circumstances for chemring the ftse 250 company designs develops and manufactures countermeasures such as flares that protect military hardware from guided missiles it also develops sensor technologies that detect a range of threats including cyber explosive and chemical advertisement advertisement even before russia s invasion of ukraine the company was already growing quickly its interim results published earlier this month reported an 18pc rise in underlying pre tax profits amid buoyant operating conditions as america which accounts for just over half of the company s sales plans to increase its defence budget by 4 1pc to record levels next year demand for chemring s products is likely to rise although the impact of higher defence spending on its sales and profits is subject to time lags as announcements typically precede tangible orders the company s long term prospects are nevertheless increasingly upbeat a solid performance in the first half of the year allowed it to further reduce net debt levels they now stand at just 18 4m including lease liabilities which equates to a gearing ratio of less than 5pc declining leverage not only reduces the risks that face the company in an environment of rising interest rates but provides scope for it to engage in mergers and acquisitions to further enhance its growth prospects advertisement advertisement acquisitions look more likely following the successful integration of cubica group the artificial intelligence and machine learning specialist bought last year chemring s strong cash flow and long term policy to pay just 40pc of net profit as a dividend further suggest that it plans to make acquisitions alongside ongoing investment in improving its operations encouragingly the company s underlying operating margin increased by one percentage point to 15 2pc in the first half of the year this is largely due to its long term strategy to focus more on higher margin business areas which should add to its investment appeal in an era of high inflation with a return on equity of 12pc last year the company appears to have a sound competitive position of course the strengthening of the dollar has had a positive impact on the company s financial performance in questor s view it should continue to have a positive impact on chemring s bottom line as an increasingly uncertain global economic outlook prompts a flight to the perceived safety provided by the greenback a weakening in the global economy could of course inhibit government spending growth in the coming years although in normal times this would imply weaker prospects for the defence industry vastly changed priorities following russia s invasion of ukraine mean that rising military spending may increasingly be viewed as sacrosanct by policymakers advertisement advertisement since this column advised readers to buy chemring in june 2019 its shares have surged by 85pc they now trade at about 17 times forecast earnings which suggests that their margin of safety has narrowed since our initial recommendation however the company s significantly improved long term prospects mean it has further capital growth potential and continues to offer good value for money with a solid balance sheet scope to make further acquisitions and the capacity to improve margins as part of its growth strategy it remains a stock worth buying and holding for the long term questor says buy ticker chg share price at close 314 5p read the latest questor column on telegraph co uk every sunday tuesday wednesday thursday and friday from 5am read questor s rules of investment before you follow our tips

it s a quirk of history that the foundations of modern biology and as a consequence some of the worst atrocities of the 20th century should rely so heavily on peas cast your mind back to school biology and gregor mendel whose 200th birthday we mark next month though mendel is invariably described as a friar his formidable legacy is not in augustinian theology but in the mainstream science of genetics in the middle of the 19th century mendel whose real name was johann gregor was his augustinian appellation bred more than 28 000 pea plants crossing tall with short wrinkly seeds with smooth and purple flowers with white what he found in that forest of pea plants was that these traits segregated in the offspring and did not blend but re emerged in predictable ratios what mendel had discovered were the rules of inheritance characteristics were inherited in discrete units what we now call genes and the way these units flowed through pedigrees followed neat mathematical patterns these rules are taught in every secondary school as a core part of how we understand fundamental biology genes dna and evolution we also teach this history for it is a good story mendel s work published in 1866 was being done at the same time as darwin was carving out his greatest idea but this genius moravian friar was ignored until both men were dead only to be rediscovered at the beginning of the new century which resolved darwinian evolution with mendelian genetics midwifing the modern era of biology but there s a lesser known story that shaped the course of the 20th century in a different way the origins of genetics are inextricably wedded to eugenics since plato suggested the pairing of high quality parents and plutarch described spartan infanticide the principles of population control have been in place probably in all cultures but in the time of victorian industrialisation with an ever expanding working class and in the wake of darwinian evolution darwin s half cousin francis galton added a scientific and statistical sheen to the deliberate sculpting of society and he named it eugenics it was a political ideology that co opted the very new and immature science of evolution and came to be one of the defining and most deadly ideas of the 20th century all new scientific discoveries exist within the culture into which they are born and are always susceptible to abuse the uk came within a whisker of having involuntary sterilisation of undesirables as legislation something that churchill robustly campaigned for in his years in the asquith government but which the mp josiah wedgwood successfully resisted in the us though eugenics policies were enacted from 1907 and over most of the next century in 31 states an estimated 80 000 people were sterilised by the state in the name of purification american eugenics was faithfully married to mendel s laws though mendel himself had nothing to do with these policies led by charles davenport a biologist and galton devotee the eugenics record office in cold spring harbor new york set out in 1910 to promote a racist ableist ideology and to harvest the pedigrees of americans with this data davenport figured they could establish the inheritance of traits both desirable and defective and thus purify the american people thus they could fight the imagined threat of great replacement theory facing white america undesirable people with their unruly fecundity will spread inferior genes and the ruling classes will be erased pedigrees were a major part of the us eugenics movement and davenport had feverishly latched on to mendelian inheritance to explain all manner of human foibles alcoholism criminality feeblemindedness and weirdly a tendency to seafaring heredity he wrote in 1910 stands as the one great hope of the human race its saviour from imbecility poverty disease immorality and like all of the enthusiastic eugenicists he attributed the inheritance of these complex traits to genes nature over nurture it is from davenport that we have the first genetic studies of huntington s disease which strictly obeys a mendelian inheritance and of eye colour which despite what we still teach in schools does not view image in fullscreen deborah kallikak the young woman whose family history henry goddard fabricated to back up his theories photograph macmillan co publishing 1912 one particular tale from this era stands out the psychologist henry goddard had been studying a girl with the pseudonym deborah kallikak in his new jersey clinic since she was eight he described her as a high grade feeble minded person the moron the delinquent the kind of girl or woman that fills our reformatories in order to trace the origin of her troubles goddard produced a detailed pedigree of the kallikaks he identified as the founder of this bloodline martin kallikak who stopped off en route home from the war of independence to his genteel quaker wife to impregnate a feeble minded but attractive barmaid with whom he had no further contact in goddard s influential 1912 book the kallikak family a study in the heredity of feeble mindedness he traced a perfect pattern of mendelian inheritance for traits good and bad the legitimate family was eminently successful whereas his bastard progeny produced a clan of criminals and disabled defectives eventually concluding with deborah with this goddard concluded that the feeble mindedness of the kallikaks was encoded in a gene a single unit of defective inheritance passed down from generation to generation just like in mendel s peas a contemporary geneticist will frown at this for multiple reasons the first is the terminology feeble minded which was a vague pseudopsychiatric bucket diagnosis that we presume included a wide range of today s clinical conditions we might also reject his mendelian conclusion on the grounds that complex psychiatric disorders rarely have a single genetic root and are always profoundly influenced by the environment the presence of a particular gene will not determine the outcome of a trait though it may well contribute to the probability of it this is a modern understanding of the extreme complexity of the human genome probably the richest dataset in the known universe but a meticulous contemporary analysis is not even required in the case of the kallikaks because the barmaid never existed view image in fullscreen the kallikak family tree from a 1955 textbook photograph macmillan co publishing 1912 martin kallikak s legitimate family was indeed packed with celebrated achievers men of medicine the law and the clergy but goddard had invented the illegitimate branch by misidentifying an unrelated man called john wolverton as kallikak s bastard son and dreaming up his barmaid mother there were people with disabilities among wolverton s descendants but the photos in goddard s book show some of the children with facial characteristics that are associated with foetal alcohol syndrome a condition that is entirely determined not by genetic inheritance but by exposure to high levels of alcohol in utero despite the family tree being completely false this case study remained in psychology textbooks until the 1950s as a model of human inheritance and a justification for enforced sterilisation the kallikaks had become the founding myth of american eugenics the german eugenics movement had also begun at the beginning of the 20th century and grown steadily through the years of the weimar republic by the time of the rise of the third reich principles such as lebensunwertes leben life unworthy of life were a core part of the national eugenics ideology for purifying the nordic stock of german people one of the first pieces of legislation to be passed after hitler seized power in 1933 was the law for the prevention of genetically diseased offspring which required sterilisation of people with schizophrenia deafness blindness epilepsy huntington s disease and other conditions that were deemed clearly genetic as with the american s tenacious but fallacious grip on heredity most of these conditions are not straightforwardly mendelian and in one case where it is huntington s the disease takes effect after reproductive age sterilisation had no effect on its inheritance the development of the nazis eugenics programmes was supported intellectually and financially by the american eugenicists erroneously obsessed as they were with finding single mendelian genes for complex traits and plotting them on pedigrees in 1935 a short propaganda film called das erbe the inheritance was released in germany in it a young scientist observes a couple of stag beetles rutting confused she consults her professor who sits her down to explain the darwinian struggles for life and shows her a film of a cat hunting a bird cocks sparring suddenly she gets it and exclaims to roars of laughter animals pursue their own racial policies the muddled propaganda is clear nature purges the weak and so must we view image in fullscreen a still from the 1935 nazi propaganda film das erbe which conflates natural selection and eugenics photograph youtube orf2 the film then shows a pedigree of a hunting dog just the type that you might get from the kennel club today and then up comes an animation of the family tree of the kallikaks on one side erbgesunde frau and on the other erbkranke frau genetically healthy and hereditarily defective women on the diseased side the positions of all of the miscreants and deviants pulse to show the flow of undesirable people through the generations as the voiceover explains das erbe was a film to promote public acceptance of the nazi eugenics laws and what follows the entirely fictional kallikak family tree is its asserted legacy shock images of seriously disabled people in sanatoriums followed by healthy marching nazis and a message from hitler he who is physically and mentally not healthy and worthy may not perpetuate his suffering in the body of his child approximately 400 000 people were sterilised under this policy a scientific lie had become a pillar of genocide in just 20 years science has and will always be politicised people turn to the authority of science to justify their ideologies today we see the same pattern but with new genetics after the supermarket shootings in buffalo in may there was heated discussion in genetics communities as the murderer had cited specific academic work in his deranged manifesto legitimate papers on the genetics of intelligence and the genetic basis of jewish ancestry coupled with the persistent pseudoscience of the great replacement science strives to be apolitical to rise above the grubby worlds of politics and the psychological biases that we are encumbered with but all new scientific discoveries exist within the culture into which they are born and are always susceptible to abuse this does not mean we should shrug and accept that our scientific endeavours are imperfect and can be bastardised with nefarious purpose nor does it mean we should censor academic research but we should know our own history we teach a version of genetics that is easily simplified to the point of being wrong the laws in biology have a somewhat tricksy tendency to be beset by qualifications complexities and caveats biology is inherently messy and evolution preserves what works not what is simple in the simplicity of mendel s peas is a science which is easily co opted and marshalled into a racist fascist ideology as it was in the us in nazi germany and in dozens of other countries to know our history is to inoculate ourselves against it being repeated this article was amended on 20 june 2022 the mass shooting in buffalo us in may 2022 was at a supermarket not a school as an earlier version said

ukraine italian authorities have confirmed that their imports via ukraine are diminishing bloomberg news agency quoted italy s eni saying gas supplies to the country from russia had declined by 15 recently without any explanation from gazprom geopolitical critics of the kremlin accuse russia of weaponising gas a charge moscow dismisses outright blaming glitches in its supply of goods and services on the protagonists of the so called rules based world order behind the unprecedented sanctions a series of punitive packages of western sanctions against moscow released in strategic batches were unleashed following the outbreak of the ukraine conflict on february 24 in addition to the sanctions the us eu and nato continue to arm the ukrainian army to the teeth in what has become the west s proxy war against russia fears of the outbreak of direct conflict between nato and russia abound fuelled by growing hostilities of nato aligned anti russian regimes of neighbouring poland and bulgaria among others the only reason nato is yet to confront russia directly in the ukraine conflict is as a result that kyiv is not a nato member yet to invoke nato s article 5 which refers to an attack on one is an attack on all is therefore not on the cards at least for the moment the dynamics are susceptible to rapid and constant changes that create an atmosphere of frightening military uncertainty president putin s administration seems to be ready for a long haul in the conflict this weekend putin has been hosting in moscow the saint pietersburg international economic forum spief due to international travel hiccups caused by the sanctions most participants are online thanks to technology engaging directly with the russian leadership on economic recovery plans and programmes in his main address to the conference an upbeat putin outlined several areas of positive economic performance amid a challenging period he said i would like to start with the dynamics in the production sector russia s industrial output increased by 3 9 in the first four months of 2022 according to putin in april this year the unemployment rate across the entire russia stood at a mere 4 this is the lowest rate on record putin said before adding in the current conditions this is a very serious achievement he also said there is the need to remain alert saying that the challenges russians face would not go away any time soon there can be no doubt that russia s economy is under an external threat never seen before the fact that the us led nato and the eu are disinterested in joining the un initiatives aimed at bringing about a truce in the conflict indicate that the situation could become worse before it gets any better russia s allies in india and china have steadfastly refused to join the regime of western sanctions and have continued to do business with moscow in spite of us threats the eu and the global north itself is not as united in the anti russian sentiment as has been made to look surreptitiously several western businesses are doing business with russia in fact the eu itself has conceded that some of its member states may pay in rubles while purchasing russian oil as per the demand of moscow the truth about sanctions in the 21st century is that they have become trickier the world has become one massive global village the social sciences describe modern international world order as inter connected and inter dependent no country or a bloc of like minded countries can prosper as an island the example of turkey blocking the membership application to nato of finland and sweden shows the complex nature of international politics and the extent to which they are influenced by regional and national interests of individual states sanctions against russia may sound like music across the western capitals that have grown accustomed to russophobia however the truth is that europe in particular requires russian oil and gas to survive in similar ways that russia itself cannot survive without the import of critical goods and services war mongering leaders who place their personal interests ahead of humanity and the global human race do a huge disservice to the planet in any case there can be no winners europeans caused the first world war from 1914 1918 two decades later from 1939 1945 the europeans caused world war 2
adrian florido host on your most recent trip to the grocery store or to the gas station you ve surely noticed what we all have prices keep going up inflation is still climbing at a record pace in the u s and to try to stop that the federal reserve has raised interest rates again this week its biggest rate hike since 1994 the idea is that by making it more expensive to borrow money for a car or a house or to charge something to a credit card americans will start spending less bringing down demand and prices but many economists fear these aggressive rate hikes will slow the economy so much that we may be headed into a recession which has many americans wondering should i be preparing for that to help us make sense of where the u s economy is and how it might affect your life we ve called teresa ghilarducci she s a professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci welcome back to the program teresa ghilarducci oh it s really good to talk to you again adrian florido the federal reserve says it s trying to engineer a soft landing to the economy hiking interest rates just enough to bring down prices without causing a full blown recession what s your sense of whether that s a realistic expectation ghilarducci well me like the majority of economists in the united states and actually in most of the world believe that they won t achieve it that the federal reserve has set in motion a recession for next year there was only one fed governor that voted against it esther george from kansas city and she dissented because she said the rate hike was way too high that it will cause a lot of construction to seize up making the housing supply problem even worse it will certainly stop people from buying on credit but it also stops businesses from borrowing in order to expand and employ more people so it s not just consumers that are affected by the interest rate hike it s also businesses that need to borrow money to basically create jobs florido even if we aren t in a recession yet a lot of people you know remember the great recession of 2008 ghilarducci yeah florido and how tough it was for so many people and they re wondering should i be preparing teresa ghilarducci are you doing anything yet to prepare for a possible recession ghilarducci right it s really important for people to wonder what to expect when expecting a recession i am i have stopped my spending a bit i don t click on amazon as much and i m putting a lot of money in reserve in emergency savings you know in my checking account i m just letting that build up a bit i m not planning the vacation that i was dreaming about in 2021 i m continuing to save in my retirement accounts to the maximum you know along with my emergency fund i m also saving in my retirement accounts the low valuations in the stock market has not deterred me at all in fact i ve been a little happier because buying stock now is a little bit cheaper for people who are in lower incomes these are people who are making like less than 34 000 which is actually a lot of people or if you re in a married couple and your income is below 68 000 you can get help from the federal government to save for your retirement up to 1 000 to 2 000 depending upon your situation it s called the saver s credit so that s an encouragement for even the people who are most strapped by inflation now to still save for their retirement florido i think a big question on a lot of people s minds is you know what should i be doing with my money first how should i be prioritizing should i be saving first ghilarducci yeah florido should i be using my money to pay down loans and credit cards since we probably expect interest rates to keep going up ghilarducci yeah so what people should do with their first dollar you know the paycheck you get like next week is put about 5 or 10 if you can in emergency savings really plan as if you re going to lose 20 of your hours or that you may have a couple of months of unemployment even for you or your family member so when you have that mindset when you re expecting a recession what you do with that first dollar is going to be very different you don t have to pay off debt don t add to it certainly don t borrow any more because your interest rate s going to go up try to save for those emergencies first the second use would be paying off debt but that might be kind of a luxury right now florido it s obviously a really uncertain time with a lot of this talk of an impending recession and you know it can be hard not to feel anxious ghilarducci yeah florido is there anything we should know so as not to lose maybe too much sleep about this recessions don t last forever right ghilarducci yeah adrian the best antidote to anxiety is information and control and people do have a lot of choices and control and agency as they re expecting a recession and also handling the inflation they have right now you can spend some time searching for bargains and switching from expensive items to cheaper items that helps on the margin but it helps enormously with your state of mind and being able to sleep you re controlling that and if you can put in your mindset not anxiety but reality that you might not have the bonuses and the income or even lose some hours next year again that gives you some control and peace of mind florido what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks and months to get a sense of where exactly the economy is headed ghilarducci yeah i m going to be looking at bargaining power i m going to see if workers can actually get a wage increase to counter this inflation and if they can t i will predict weakening so i like to look at not the unemployment rate but expectations if you ask for the federal reserve has a survey about expectations if you ask for a raise would you get it are you thinking about quitting or are you quitting i m looking at that i m really looking at congress to see if there is bipartisan support for some of the proposals coming from the white house which are to control insulin prices now that sounds odd but insulin is taken by diabetics and 30 of the population needs insulin if we could actually bring down those costs that could help i m looking to see if congress will help people on fixed incomes people who are on tanf people who are on food stamps it s actually again a huge part of the population to see if they will give them some relief so i m watching congress i think the federal reserve has learned its lesson from the loud chorus of economists that say hang on on those rate increases you know slow down a bit on that so i ll be looking at all things i ll look at numbers i ll look at politics and then i ll look at the federal reserve florido i ve been speaking with teresa ghilarducci professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci thank you so much for sharing your expertise with us ghilarducci oh thank you adrian transcript provided by npr copyright npr

montgomery ala ap investments that are a key source of funding for alabama s employees retirement system have lost ground in the slumping financial markets this year but officials say the pension fund is sound the system s board of control heard a presentation on the latest numbers at its quarterly meeting in montgomery on tuesday retirement systems of alabama chief executive david bronner also talked more broadly about the global economy and said he could not remember when it faced such a multitude of challenges the employee retirement system with 15 billion in assets served more than 139 000 members last year including about 52 000 active and retired state employees and members from local government entities through april its rate of return on investments was minus 5 for this fiscal year which started oct 1 bronner who has led the state pension program since 1973 said participants should not be concerned because they have a defined benefit plan which means it is not dependent on the investment earnings plus the long range performance of the fund has been strong bronner noted including a 22 return last fiscal year the 9 rate of return over the last 10 years puts the ers in the top one third of comparable public pension plans according to the financial firm state street domestic stocks for the employee system are down about 4 for the fiscal year while overall stocks are down 5 domestic stocks are the biggest portion of the investments fixed income investments or bonds are down by 10 normally history will show you that if the stock market sells off a little bit the bond market acts pretty good said bronner in this situation they re both getting killed i mean you re getting hurt bad how long does it last will it change well of course it will change but when that s the question the stock market and bond markets are being affected by the craziest confluence of different things that i ve ever seen among those factors are soaring fuel costs and the war in ukraine and its crippling affect on grain supplies that are a vital food source for countries in europe and africa bronner said drought in africa compounds the food shortage he said bronner has led the pension system during previous economic downturns like a stock market crash in 1987 the financial fallout after the 9 11 terrorist attacks and the great recession of 2007 to 2009 the current situation is different he said it s unusual from the point of view of having a fuel crisis thrown on top of a food crisis thrown on top of inflation bronner said it s all working against us right now it could turn around just as fast and when we say fast we don t mean tomorrow or the next day or the next week but certainly in a matter of months it s just got to settle down if we could settle the war that would help immensely it would help the food crisis and probably it would also help with the gasoline prices and things like that state treasurer young boozer who serves on the board of the employee retirement system said the global problems are substantial but expressed confidence in the health of the state s pension funds the markets are in turmoil and they have been for several months boozer said and dr bronner talked about the causes of those and they are here they are active and we re going to be dealing with these things for months to come how is that going to impact the fund and rsa and the participants in the plan the plan is in good shape we are well funded we are well positioned and if you look at our portfolios we ve got a great asset allocation and i expect that this is just a period of turmoil that we will pass through and settle down and i think we re going to be in good shape going forward the retirement systems of alabama also manages the teachers retirement system a larger fund with 30 billion in assets the quarterly numbers for the teachers system were released at a previous board meeting showing a 5 loss on investments but last fiscal year teachers investments earned a 22 6 annualized return overall the rsa manages 24 funds that had total assets of about 52 billion as of the end of last fiscal year bronner said the systems investments other than stocks and bonds are generally doing well those include the robert trent jones golf trail nine hotel resorts across the state and 55 water the largest office building in new york city we re making the most money we ve ever made on the hotels today bronner said same way with the robert trent jones trail we had the best year we ve ever had last year on the golf trail and this year so far is better than last year

be saving first ghilarducci yeah florido should i be using my money to pay down loans and credit cards since we probably expect interest rates to keep going up ghilarducci yeah so what people should do with their first dollar you know the paycheck you get like next week is put about 5 or 10 if you can in emergency savings really plan as if you re going to lose 20 of your hours or that you may have a couple of months of unemployment even for you or your family member so when you have that mindset when you re expecting a recession what you do with that first dollar is going to be very

anxiety is information and control and people do have a lot of choices and control and agency as they re expecting a recession and also handling the inflation they have right now you can spend some time searching for bargains and switching from expensive items to cheaper items that helps on the margin but it helps enormously with your state of mind and being able to sleep you re controlling that and if you can put in your mindset not anxiety but reality that you might not have the bonuses and the income or even lose some hours next year again that gives you some control and peace of mind florido what are you going to be paying attention to in the coming weeks and months to get a sense of where exactly the economy is headed ghilarducci yeah i m going to be looking at bargaining power i m going to see if workers can actually get a wage increase to counter this inflation and if they can t i will predict weakening so i like to look at not the unemployment rate but expectations if you ask for the federal reserve has a survey about expectations if you ask for a raise would you get it are you thinking about quitting or are you quitting i m looking at that i m really looking at congress to see if there is bipartisan support for some of the proposals coming from the white house which are to control insulin prices now that sounds odd but insulin is taken by diabetics and 30 of the population needs insulin if we could actually bring down those costs that could help i m looking to see if congress will help people on fixed incomes people who are on tanf people who are on food stamps it s actually again a huge part of the population to see if they will give them some relief so i m watching congress i think the federal reserve has learned its lesson from the loud chorus of economists that say hang on on those rate increases you know slow down a bit on that so i ll be looking at all things i ll look at numbers i ll look at politics and then i ll look at the federal reserve florido i ve been speaking with teresa ghilarducci professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci thank you so much for sharing your expertise

adrian florido host on your most recent trip to the grocery store or to the gas station you ve surely noticed what we all have prices keep going up inflation is still climbing at a record pace in the u s and to try to stop that the federal reserve has raised interest rates again this week its biggest rate hike since 1994 the idea is that by making it more expensive to borrow money for a car or a house or to charge something to a credit card americans will start spending less bringing down demand and prices but many economists fear these aggressive rate hikes will slow the economy so much that we may be headed into a recession which has many americans wondering should i be preparing for that to help us make sense of where the u s economy is and how it might affect your life we ve called teresa ghilarducci she s a professor of economics at the new school for social research in new york professor ghilarducci welcome back to the program teresa ghilarducci oh it s really good to talk to you again adrian florido the federal reserve says it s trying to engineer a soft landing to the economy hiking interest rates just enough to bring down prices without causing a full blown recession what s your sense of whether that s a realistic expectation ghilarducci well me like the majority of economists in the united states and actually in most of the world believe that they won t achieve it that the federal reserve has set in motion a recession for next year there was only one fed governor that voted against it esther george from kansas city and she dissented because she said the rate hike was way too high that it will cause a lot of construction to seize up making the housing supply problem even worse it will certainly stop people from buying on credit but it also stops businesses from borrowing in order to expand and employ more people so it s not just consumers that are affected by the interest rate hike it s also businesses that need to borrow money to basically create jobs florido even if we aren t in a recession yet a lot of people you know remember the great recession of 2008 ghilarducci yeah florido and how tough it was for so many people and they re wondering should i be preparing teresa ghilarducci are you doing anything yet to prepare for a possible recession ghilarducci right it s really important for people to wonder what to expect when expecting a recession i am i have stopped my spending a bit i don t click on amazon as much and i m putting a lot of money in reserve in emergency savings you know in my checking account i m just letting that build up a bit i m not planning the vacation that i was dreaming about in 2021 i m continuing to save in my retirement accounts to the maximum you know along with my emergency fund i m also saving in my retirement accounts the low valuations in the stock market has not deterred me at all in fact i ve been a little happier because buying stock now is a little bit cheaper for people who are in lower incomes these are people who are making like less than 34 000 which is actually a lot of people or if you re in a married couple and your income is below 68 000 you can get help from the federal government to save for your retirement up to 1 000 to 2 000 depending upon your situation it s called the saver s credit so that s an encouragement for even the people who are most strapped by inflation now to still save for their retirement florido i think a big question on a lot of people s minds is you know what should i be doing with my money first how should i be prioritizing should i be saving first ghilarducci yeah florido should i be using my money to pay down loans and credit cards since we probably expect interest rates to keep going up ghilarducci yeah so what people should do with their first dollar you know the paycheck you get like next week is put about 5 or 10 if you can in emergency savings really plan as if you re going to lose 20 of your hours or that you may have a couple of months of unemployment even for you or your family member so when you have that mindset when you re expecting a recession what you do with that first dollar is going to be very different you don t have to pay off debt don t add to it certainly don t borrow any more because your interest rate s going to go up try to save for those emergencies first the second use would be paying off debt but that might be kind of a luxury right now florido it s obviously a really uncertain time with a lot of this talk of an impending recession and you know it can be hard not to feel anxious ghilarducci yeah florido is there anything we should know so as not to lose maybe too much sleep about this recessions don t last forever right ghilarducci yeah adrian the best antidote to anxiety is information and control and people do have a lot of choices and control and agency as they re expecting a recession and also handling the inflation they have right now you can spend some

tackling inflation requires reining in private markets and embracing economic democracy richard wolff for in these times a deafening silence defines debates among u s leaders about stopping or slowing today s inflation alternatives to the federal reserve s raising of interest rates and curtailing money supply growth are ignored it s as if there were no other ways to rein in price increases except to add more interest costs to the already excess debts of workers and small and medium businesses were the last two and a half years of the deadly covid 19 pandemic plus the economic crash of 2020 not sufficient enough burdens on americans without piling on the additional burden of inflation that has been imposed by u s capitalism as usual the profit driven concerns of big business and their result a remarkably selective historical amnesia fuel the silence about alternative anti inflation policies so too do the right wing ideological blinders that now constrict u s politics yet policy alternatives always exist no matter how desperately partisans promoting one policy seek to obliterate debate and discussion of others the narrow dogmatism of u s politics these days is on full display around the issue of an anti inflation policy focused on raising interest rates i will present three other anti inflation policies that do not entail interest rate increases there are many more that could and should be part of today s policy discussions all have precedents in u s history for the first we return briefly to world war ii u s president franklin delano roosevelt s administration grasped the risk of inflation during this period as the supply of many consumer goods shrank relative to the demand for them the war effort was diverting many productive resources away from consumer goods and toward munitions and other defense products had the government allowed the market to handle the prospective shortage of consumer goods an inflation of their prices would have resulted rich americans would have bid up the prices of scarce consumer goods rendering them unaffordable for middle and lower income people that is how markets work they favor the rich who return the favor by funding economists and others to promote markets as marvels of efficiency for roosevelt s government the war effort required a national unity that the market threatened to replace with bitterness envy and division pitting the poor and the middle class against the rich the u s government thus substituted rationing for the market mechanism it printed ration books containing ration stamps and distributed them across the u s population rationed goods could only be sold to those with ration stamps no small irony at least for those familiar with marxism and socialism attaches to the following 1 the u s government distributed ration books according to people s needs and 2 the u s government s explicit goal was to render the distribution of rationed goods and especially food more fairly than what the market would have done rationing forestalled the looming inflation it could work equally well now to slow or stop inflation another anti inflation policy other than raising interest rates came in august 1971 from republican president richard m nixon responding to serious inflation nixon declared a 90 day wage price freeze he and his advisers knew that u s wage and price controls had also been deployed during world war ii some had even read john kenneth galbraith s 1952 book a theory of price control which showed how well such controls had worked during the war as a result of nixon s action employers on one side and employees on the other were formally denied the right to raise prices or wages respectively any move to the contrary was seen as a criminal act rendering the perpetrator subject to police arrest in response to these measures the inflation shrank the stock market rose and nixon was reelected in 1972 for him the policy worked other countries have also imposed wage price freezes to similar effects each alternative policy to control inflation raising interest rates included has its particular strengths and weaknesses virtues and flaws honest discussions of how to respond to inflation would involve comparing the strengths and weaknesses of all or at least many different policy options honest national leaders would not pretend only one policy exists that approach dominant in the united states today yields both policy mistakes and leads to crucial opportunities being lost it does however serve the interests of those who advocate for that one policy there is a third alternative policy to controlling inflation as an inherent risk recurringly faced by a private enterprise capitalist system if profit is the bottom line if the system s mantra is charge whatever the market will bear and if rewards and punishments follow the rise and fall of profits that depend on prices we can hardly be surprised when capitalists raise prices nor can we be surprised that when they do it it both provokes and excuses others following suit inflation results from private capitalists pricing decisions they are driven chiefly by their private profit calculations they need not and do not generally take into account those decisions larger consequences social as well as economic such as inflation the socialization of private capitalist enterprises is thus another anti inflation policy a government for example will generally consider the inflationary consequences of any set of price increases on that basis it can either limit or reject them to the extent that the government is held accountable politically for inflation and its effects it has an incentive to control them the fed is at best held accountable only indirectly that helps explain why the fed has repeatedly failed to prevent or control recessions and inflations across the last century of course such socialization of private capitalist enterprises raises the question of how genuinely democratic the government is yet the degree of genuine democracy the government upholds will influence all alternative anti inflation policies across the united states insurance utility and other public commissions limit private capitalist enterprises freedom to raise their prices in the markets they regulate private capitalists in such markets cannot raise prices without the permission of those commissions to do so a government could establish all sorts of commissions in all sorts of markets with criteria for granting or refusing such permissions suppose for example that some or all food items were socially democratically deemed to be basic goods such that no producer or seller could raise its prices without approval by a federal food commission fighting inflation could be among the approval criteria in this case just as that is a criterion now for the fed s monetary policies in most capitalist economies the tiny class of employers perhaps 1 percent of the total population has enormous powers that class 1 shapes wage and salary levels of their hired workers 2 determines the quantities of all purchased inputs and all outputs and 3 sets outputs prices that tiny class includes many employers who justify their price increases by blaming them on input prices raised by other employers throughout the supply chain more shrewdly the employer class s wiser members refocus blame instead on workers and wages blaming them for the price increases even when as now wage inflation is far lower than price inflation of course commissions to govern prices can be and have been captured by the industries they were established to control private capitalists have thus been able to weaken render toothless or even eliminate controls over them while that is indeed true of the many state level utility and insurance commissions for example it is no less true of the fed vis à vis the nation s major banks rationing systems and wage price freezes can likewise be captured historically the price gouging by and corruption of private capitalist industries have led to public demands that their businesses be transferred to government responsibilities capitalism s undiminished profit drive then incentivized the affected industries to capture the government bodies charged with controlling them the solution to that inherent contradiction of capitalism is surely not an endless series of oscillations between private and public control that is what has failed in the capitalist system rather the alternative solution that beckons is system change putting all the workers in democratic control of the enterprises instead of a tiny separate class of employers a system based on a democratized workplace community interdependent with a democratized residential

reading tricky but i have time on my side my steaming cuppa goes cold as i absorb page after page my imagination runs wild with wizards witches and a little boy with a lightning bolt scar on his head just like that i ve fallen in love i was a latecomer to the wizarding world of harry potter the first book came out five years before i laid eyes on it but the stories mean much more to me than a little magic in 2005 my first husband simon passed away he bought me the first book and helped to kick start my passion for the spellbinding series simon was born with a hole in his heart and suffered with complications as an adult doctors treated him for asthma his symptoms like breathlessness and wheezing were very similar but they were wrong on the day he died we were told he had wind his heart failed and i was devastated and alone with our boy who was just three at the time before simon died he pre ordered harry potter and the goblet of fire for me that book was the last present he gave me and i ll treasure it forever image rowan griffiths daily mirror rowan griffiths daily mirror when i was pregnant harry potter sweets were sold in supermarkets craving sugar i d walk to the local shop and stock up on chocolate frogs in each box was a collectible wizard card just like you see in the movies that s when my collecting started i still have a chocolate frog fully wrapped and sealed from all those years ago when simon passed away i d buy items to remind myself of him it started with little things like key rings teddies and accessories as my son grew up we d spend weekends in toys r us and i d buy him a little figurine but it was really for me over the years my collection grew until it filled a whole room and then my whole house i had to move three years ago just to make space for it all such a magical day i was a single mum until i met my second husband martin in 2016 we tied the knot at discovery cove in florida and of course it was harry potter themed i made my own bouquet of flowers using pages from harry potter books after the ceremony i put on a hogwarts robe and martin and i had a photoshoot at universal studios with diagon alley and the hogwarts express as our backdrop it was a magical day i ll never forget martin doesn t really like harry potter but he ll do anything for me and knows just how much the franchise means to me and amazingly my collecting has never caused an argument between us it s been 20 years since i first picked up a chocolate frog in tesco now i hold the guinness world record for the biggest collection of harry potter and wizarding world memorabilia my collection of over 6 000 items takes up five rooms and a hallway when it s all laid out i still remember counting it all to get the record we had to take a photo of every single item and write each one down while being videoed two officials counted with us and it took five hours we were even videoed when we took a break it s so strict the most martin s spent on an item is a few hundred pounds usually a christmas present like the 350 lego hogwarts castle but i like my bargains you ll often find me trawling the web for the best deals still we save money in other places we re past the age of clubbing image rowan griffiths daily mirror rowan griffiths daily mirror before we moved house i was collecting about 100 items a year but i don t want to move again so i ve slowed down now i d guess i ll buy about 50 things we recently went to the premier of fantastic beasts the secrets of dumbledore and got some priceless pieces to add to my collection martin and i queued for hours to get a front row view of the red carpet i got selfies with director david yates and eddie redmayne who plays newt scamander jude law even signed my world record certificate while i watched the film with the stars martin stayed outside and was given a giant movie poster by a security guard it might seem mean to leave my husband outside but he doesn t share my passion for harry potter he wanted to join me on my journey to london because he knows i m really bad with directions and without him i wouldn t have the poster he s spent hours queuing with me to see the actors and even walked around london for seven hours with mad eye moody s walking stick worth a fortune my collection ranges from figures and fan posters to jewellery vintage bins calendars shoes and clothes i practically live in my marauder s map dress my favourite item changes all the time at the moment it s my collection of harry potter watches sadly they don t help me time travel like hermione s time turner most items i leave untouched even if they cost pennies the collector in me says it could all be worth a fortune one day besides my son won t take it when i m gone he told me mum don t you dare leave it to me brendan is 20 now but i won t let him forget how much he used to love harry potter i would read him the books so much that he d tell people he lived under the stairs it was awkward having to tell strangers that no i don t keep my child in a small cupboard by the age of 10 spending the holidays dressed up at harry potter world wasn t cool any more image sportsphoto ltd allstar sportsphoto ltd allstar nowadays i have to warn him if i ll be in the papers his friends rib him but they all secretly love it when brendan s female friends came over they d excitedly ask to see my collection he would get so embarrassed when i m not collecting harry potter items or attending screenings book launches and premieres in my professor mcgonagall costume my days are spent looking after our menagerie of animals a dog an african pygmy hedgehog and six cats the puppy is called bellatrix and four cats are named after characters too sirius luna albus and nymphadora tonks i can t put my finger on why i keep collecting every new item i see i fall in love with my favourite place to pick up vintage items is ebay they look so much nicer than the modern things i bought an absolutely disgusting squidgy ron weasley toy recently it was on sale so i couldn t resist but it really is awful i m not besotted with every single item but i ll keep them i have a whole community of harry potter fans who i call friends and i ve been lucky enough to meet nearly all of the movie characters too arthur weasley draco and lucius malfoy luna lovegood even ron weasley i gave him a harry potter pez dispenser and he gave me a big cuddle i m usually speechless when i meet the actors i m so excited it s my life s mission to meet daniel radcliffe and emma watson who played harry potter and hermione granger i keep saying i m going to dwindle down my collection but martin took me to warner bros studio tour the making of harry potter for my birthday in april and i couldn t resist buying more it s been 25 years since harry potter and the philosopher s stone was released i feel different to most fans the magic was what i clung to when simon died i needed something to help me deal with the pain of losing my husband and harry potter was there to me it s more than just a collection it holds my happiest memories the 25th anniversary hardback edition of harry potter and the philosopher s stone is out on 26

this recent hike has closely arrived on the back of the 50 bps rate hike in may and 25 bps in march from march to date the fed has already seen a 150 bps rate hike so within four months march april may and june the fed has accelerated the rate hike this recent hike has closely arrived on the back of the 50 bps rate hike in may and 25 bps in march from march to date the fed has already seen a 150 bps rate hike so within four months march april may and june the fed has accelerated the rate hike disclaimer the opinions expressed in this column are that of the writer the facts and opinions expressed here do not reflect the views of www economictimes com pushing the nifty to fresh 52 week lows the us federal reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points the most significant hike in 28 years to control rising inflationary pressure this recent hike has closely arrived on the back of the 50 bps rate hike in may and 25 bps in march from march to date the fed has already seen a 150 bps rate hike so within four months march april may and june the fed has accelerated the rate hike jerome powell believes the american economy is strong and well positioned to handle quantitative tightening he also believes that consumers are financially in good shape and spending but admits that consumer confidence is low due to higher gas prices and lower stock prices however he does not see a broad slowdown we believe there is a fair possibility that the us economy will do a hard landing we also believe that in the next fed meeting on july 26th and 27th there could be another 75 basis point rate hike however we think it will be challenging to control inflation consider it like toothpaste once out it is almost impossible to put it back in global central banks will find it difficult just like the fed has realized that it is behind the curve while they announced the 75 bps hike there was another possibility that they could have told a 100 bps hike but they did not do it this is a global issue evident across the world as seen above inflation rates are heightened in the us uk and the eu there are likely to be four more rate hikes in the future in my opinion i predict here s how the rate hike could proceed going forward in other words i am expecting another 175 bps rate hike from the fed in the next four meetings in 2022 we will need to brace for more volatility in the days to come how does this all impact the rupee what we have realized is that it is all very counterintuitive whenever the fed rate has increased the rupee has remained stable take the table below for instance logically when the interest rate rises the rupee should depreciate severely however that has not happened hence this gives us an idea that it is not necessary for a significant depreciation in the rupee when the interest rate goes up but we do believe the rupee is likely to go up to rs 80 by august 2022 whenever the fed has hiked rates from 2004 to 2006 indian indices went up by 121 per cent a similar thing happened from december 2015 to 2018 when rates were gradually hiked and sensex witnessed an appreciation of 38 per cent nifty is edging close to 15 000 and we believe there will be some volatility in the near term every rise in domestic indices will meet strong resistance and the market will remain choppy we might see some recovery after the second quarter of fy23 however owing to the macro concerns the outlook continues to remain gloomy in all this i would advise you not to get carried away by emotions on market volatility follow the advice of expert advisors and even if it means booking losses adhere to their advice to ensure your wealth creation journey is on track
latterly of bronyard allan jenkins was arguably best known in hop picking helping to design a machine exported all over the world he was born in 1927 in sutton st nicolas near hereford his father a postman and his mother s family tenant farmers at hindlip worcester his family has said this was a bygone age when life was simple and for children idyllic allan and his older sister joyce would walk three miles across the fields to the village school where five to 14 year olds were divided into two classrooms on their daily walks to school allan and his sister would clap hands to scare rabbits pick wild strawberries blackberries hazelnuts and sorrel from the stream allan from an early age was always interested in machinery and would run off to investigate the latest agricultural implement pulled by horse causing the two children to be in trouble for being late for tea in 1935 the jenkins family moved to norton the home of the worcestershire regiment where his grandparents had taken over the running of another farm he later attended school in kempsey and frequently reminisced about learning to swim in the severn close to the new road bridge allan jenkins learned to ride a horse when his family moved to norton worceter on leaving school allan moved to worcester technical college there he studied draughtsmanship skills and gained engineering and mathematical knowledge on

draughtsman apprenticeship his passion was aircraft and this continued all his life he would have loved to join the raf but his work on plane engine testing prevented him from doing so he became a keen member of the royal observer corps his family said he was also a passionate and accomplished motor bike scrambler winning many trophies he was approached by bsa motorcycles to become their team rider but turned the offer down he also owned a classic morgan car allan jenkin was also a keen motorbike enthusiast in the late 50s allan s engineering and drawing skills were spotted by albert brooks of bruff engineering suckley allan was taken on by albert to be head of the drawing office the bruff designed hop picking machine had largely taken over from the first machines designed by mcconnell hinds allan and albert brooks got on famously his family said during the picking season allan would work on machine maintenance and consult closely with albert brooks on how the machines could be improved and any problems corrected their combined thoughts would be put onto the drawing board and modifications made for the next season allan became one of the great characters of the hop growing era especially in the frome valley on hand to ensure repairs were made quickly allan was also involved in the export of machines to europe and the united states he took one to california but alas no further machines were bought by the americans since they incorporated much of the bruff design and produced their own his family said there are still bruff machines in use in australia and new zealand today they said he was a good salesman had an easy going character and would take prospective buyers of the bruff machine around to neighbouring farms during the picking season one of the major customers were guinness hop farms in bransford and in kent eventually allan saw that his time at bruff was reaching a natural conclusion and he spotted the gap in the market for a building

started a very successful small business alvia developments many of the barns cow sheds hop picking machine buildings built in the 60s and 70s were constructed by allan and his small team eventually

not all doom and gloom shankar sharma on where to look for hidden gems in this market the growth element is missing in most of the high pe stocks right now and when the economy is into these situations with high interest rate environments the growth will take a backseat but this is a one two quarter phenomena equity is supposed to be a friend forever but we try and test that friend every second day by looking at what the index or what the price is doing says co founder partner i want to spend the next 13 weeks without worrying if i can spend that i know money will be made money has been made before and money will be made in future but when one is stuck in a situation like this your mind cannot think beyond 13 days 13 hours 13 minutes depending on the kind of trades or investments you have made but yes over the next 13 years people will make money not from the same stocks not from the same sectors but new trends new things will emerge what will emerge no one knows but when it emerges we will be able to catch them but the basic problem right now is about information flow there is much information flowing everywhere i am not talking about ukraine russia i am not talking about interest rate i am talking about the general format in which information flows so there is whatsapp twitter facebook and everyone knows the news and at the same time everyone wants to get in from the same door and exit from the same door so because of that the concept of stock markets being stably consolidating and trending slowly higher is giving way to volatile returns you have to churn this it could not have priced in the worst since a 75 bps rate hike happened in the us and the markets rallied but suddenly we got a new one from swiss bank which said they are going to hike rates by 50 bps so when news flow moves that fast and that quick and the basic problem in a high interest rate recessionary environment is right now we are just seeing interest rates going up but we have not seen corporate default we have not seen people going bankrupt we have not seen credit card defaults i am not trying to create a scary scenario i am saying these will come as part of it but then you will have to price it in and because the good part about the whatsapp and the twitter community is everything gets priced in within an hour or a couple of days if the news is floating for two days it is well priced in i think we are pricing in the situation but the problem is once we have a new set of bad news then we have to price that again it does look like changing i still remember when the bjp government was voted to power in 2014 people said yeh high pe ka jamana khatam ho gaya hai yeh growth ab nahi chalega ab sirf value chalega the days of high pe are over days of growth stocks over now only value will work but things do not change in a year or two things have been there for decades and they will be the same but where is the growth in high pe i will buy a high pe 80 pe stock when i can see at least a 25 growth an 80 pe stock with a 12 growth means if the peg were to go to one you will have to spend five years of sideways zero returns and that is the risk in buying a high pe stock you do not buy high pe for quality you buy high pe for growth because at the end markets stay for growth so the growth element is missing in most of the high pe stocks right now and when the economy is into these situations with high interest rate environments the growth will take a backseat but this is a one two quarter phenomena equity is supposed to be a friend forever but we try and test that friend every second day by looking at what the index or what the price is doing most of the funds do not want to underperform even for one month so when one wants to underperform even for one month or two months most of the long only funds most of the investment funds have actually become traders and that is the fact not just in india but globally i do not want to buy a stock which is not going to perform for six months if i am running a fund because my investors will withdraw and my distributors will be under my skin those are the problems that you take on with but if you are an individual investor how does it matter if a stock does not go up for six months you can just keep holding it as long as you are sure that the growth would come through people look at the nasdaq and start selling it that s how morning trade works over a longer period of time if the us goes into recession then we will have a situation where people will cut down some spending but there is so much of innovation happening in america that one cannot have an america innovating without india being used as its outsourcing back office so results would come through but then most of the it stocks had been bid up at 40 50 times but not now they are down 40 from the top great companies do not fall more than 40 without a reason if they have fallen 60 and if we are short and the company will survive over the next five seven ten years then that is broadly the bottom most of the it stocks are down 40 because america is supposed to be going into a recession it has not yet gone into a recession we are pushing it into a recession it is like a bride groom who says i do not want to marry but we insist he get married so that we can have a feast so there is no recession right now but we are assuming that there will be a recession because interest rates have gone up and obviously when interest rates go up people have seen economies going into a recession but at this time it is too early to take that call the likes of zomato are teenagers who had a nice time based on the pocket money they get from their dad in this case the pe funds so you do not want to be betting on those companies tcs and infosys are the senior citizens the pensioner people who have made all that money in their life and now they want to enjoy life you want to look at the midcap it names i do not own them i can just give you reference point just for viewers to understand maybe a mindtree and lti and ltts this category is growing at 25 when the economy is in a bad shape and when money flows back to america very soon and the dollar is going up the dollar normally appreciates against the rupee one year before the elections so we are approaching a scenario where the dollar should normally do better and should appreciate against the rupee and these guys will make a little more money at that time so the midcap it is the flavour stocks that are growing 20 30 are the stocks to normally look for central bankers cannot create supply but they can destroy demand if central banks hike interest rates do you think russia is going to reduce the price of crude by even 2 they would not but that is the situation we are in they can destroy demand so when american people who had booked housing loans at 3 are being asked to take up a housing loan at 6 over the last four months no one is going to buy a house in america housing is going to be in a slump once they destroy demand they decide to give some money to create demand again there is madari and the dance happening where the fed does not know what to do because basically there is so much debt in the system but they are trying to tinker around with demand depending on the supplies that you get as for the stocks or sectors to bet on the metals game is over at least for the next few years you should not look at metals again they will appear to be cheap because you are looking at them on the basis of historical earnings the moment current earnings come in it will price in all the fall that these stocks have seen through hul and dabur we do not own them but these are classic companies where they will pass on the cost in the current year so once they pass on the cost there will be incremental savings because input costs will come down eventually and will translate into higher ebitda margins so if you were very patient want safety and want a good trade or investment look at stocks like hul or dabur these companies will do well over the next two three years and they are also very protective of your capital these are the companies that you can look for but if you are really looking for some adventurism then go for the consumer discretionaries not now maybe after six months for now it is a very difficult wicket to bat on you want to buy something in a new sector which is going to dominate over the next five seven years you should look at companies that are changing the format tata motor dvr is the best hedge against vladimir putin if crude stays at 120 people would go for evs so that is why you have to look at these kinds of companies where you look for a five year or a three year view but if you have got a one or two year view then one should look at companies like hul and dabur you would not make a lot of money buying hul and dabur but you will make decent returns

four generations of strickland family members gather monday june 6 near the remains of the historic yulee sugarmill in old homosassa they are from left justin dale strickland his grandfather dale curtis strickland wyatt dale strickland 10 and dale dana strickland editor s note the history of any geographical area is the history of its people the pioneers and early settlers the builders and business owners and the individual families that make up the community in old homosassa the strickland family goes back eight generations to the 1830s with the arrival of hardy devil strickland today

family owned the land around the boat ramp into the chassahowitzka river and put up a gate denying the townspeople access to the ramp unless they paid a toll it s been said that the lykes had some strongmen who enforced the toll which angered the townspeople including henry arthur one night although not in his capacity as town constable henry arthur got into a scuffle with these strongmen and was shot by one of them instead of going to the nearest hospital in brooksville henry arthur went to his brother joe s house got a pistol went back and shot two of the strongmen killing one then later died himself henry arthur left his widow laura granger strickland alone to raise their two sons charles and edsel charles strickland was the father of dale curtis strickland my papa s father charles was an alcoholic explained justin strickland the family s unofficial historian he wasn t there often so papa s mom had to work the middle of three brothers dale curtis bounced around a lot he said spending much of his time with his uncle edsel who taught him to fish in those days the main occupation of those who lived in homosassa was commercial fishing dale curtis said dale curtis dropped out of school in the eighth grade and fished crabbed and clammed until 2004 like father like son the men in dale curtis strickland s lineage lived rough they worked hard and partied hard friday night was set aside for dancing and drinking juking as it was called dale curtis was following in his dad s footsteps my dad died at age 41 from cirrhosis of the liver he drank himself to death dale curtis said i know i was headed the wrong way too this is where the trajectory of the strickland family made a dramatic turn i was 32 and up until then my life wasn t all that great my wife and i were fixing to get a divorce dale curtis said dale curtis strickland listens to his grandson justin dale strickland monday june 6 there was a revival going on at a local church and dale curtis decided he wanted to go see the show he said i told my wife i didn t plan on changing and it would just be that one night he said but i felt the power of god and i ve been in church ever since dale curtis became a pentecostal preacher and pastored a church that is still active the church of jesus christ the change in my dad was like night and day dale dana strickland said however despite the change in his parents and now being raised in church by the time dale dana was in 11th grade like strickland men before him he was leaning toward trouble as he described it his dad told him to quit school and get in the boat and work with him he figured i d be better off dale dana said they fished together until 1995 after the net ban took effect dale curtis switched to clam harvesting in cedar key but his son decided it was time to switch careers dale dana went back to school to get his ged went to school to get a job in corrections and more school later to work in law enforcement with the citrus county sheriff s office where he worked until his retirement after 22 5 years my dad left what he loved to make a better life for his family justin said my papa had an eighth grade education and worked hard for everything he had his dad wasn t around for him and he didn t want to raise my dad that way and then dad who didn t finish high school went back and got his ged because his dad raised him to do better than him and dad raised me to do better my dad was the first to finish high school and i was the first one to go to college justin said justin has a business degree from the college of central florida and is executive pastor at crystal river church of god we were raised to do better than the previous generation did before you justin said i never had to worry about my dad coming home drunk ever because he made a change in his life grit and grace from the time justin strickland was a baby he s been his papa s buddy from age 11 to 15 he cleaned stone crab traps for his papa earning 50 cents a trap it was hot and those traps weighed 30 to 50 pounds and i had to stack them five high justin said growing up observing papa and dad the two words that stick out to me what my stock is grit and grace during stone crab season papa would wake up early sometimes at three in the morning to go stone crabbing and be back in time to go to church and preach a message on wednesday nights justin said in that same sentiment i saw my dad do whatever it took to take care of his three babies putting himself through school working extra details so we could go on vacation and he always had a lawn business he said i learned grace from them in the way my papa treated people giving money to people he knew couldn t pay him back hiring alcoholics that no one else would because he d been there he knew what it was like he said with my dad he never handed me anything if i wanted something i had to work for it if i broke something i had to pay for it or fix it but he was always right there alongside me legacy lessons learned at 10 wyatt dale strickland said one of the best things about being a strickland is the stories i love all the history he said plus we get to go fishing and camping all the time and i like going to work at the church with my dad he wants to be a pastor when he grows up also an auto mechanic as an eighth generation strickland wyatt said he has learned from his grandfather and great grandfather that the harder you work the better your life will be wyatt dale strickland listens to his father speak monday june 6 as the 10 year old and three other generations of stricklands speak of their faith and heritage growing up and living in old homosassa justin said he has learned that you have to be first on the scene the last to leave and to work harder as if someone s ready to take your job he grew up right dale curtis said of his grandson justin he s always worked hard all my family works hard and i m very proud of that and he s doing it right with his son getting him in church that s the main thing dale dana said he has learned that it s all worth it all the hard times all the life changes and the struggles all the sacrifices you have to make all it takes to pour into your kids lives so they ll be a solid individual it s all worth it i see that every day by seeing him justin with his son and seeing how far he s gone in his ministry and education and it all started with my dad just wanting something better for his kids he said i think that s a lot of what s missing in our day and age fathers sticking it out no matter what no matter how hard it gets
the federal reserve s congressionally chartered dual mandates are price stability and maximum sustainable employment these objectives are intended to dictate monetary policy and the fed s longer run goals and strategies recent experience however asserts that preventing financial and market instability trumps congressional decree the illustration below from the federal reserve bank of chicago helps visualize its mandates the dual mandate bullseye highlights its 2 core inflation rate and 4 1 unemployment rate objectives the fed is currently way off the mark as we share below is running about 4 above the fed s target and the is about half a percent below their objective to address surging inflation the fed is taking aggressive actions which might increase joblessness and slow the economy but hopefully reduce inflation higher interest rates and balance sheet reduction qt are not good for stock prices investors need to consider how much pain the fed is willing to inflict on stock prices to hit their bullseye further besides significantly lower inflation or a surge in the unemployment rate what might allow the fed to deviate from its objectives and save stock prices we present the fed s third self imposed objective preventing financial and market instability history of the third objective as the bankers bank the fed has made it clear through its actions that monetary policy will also be used to maintain financial and market stability and protect the financial sector financial and market stability encompasses the healthy functioning of capital markets many times in the past when financial markets became illiquid and stressed or even as instability appeared imminent the fed has come to the rescue with liquidity one only needs to look back to 2019 in august 2019 the fed lowered the fed funds rate restarted qe and offered institutional investors liquidity through repo transactions then the unemployment rate was 3 7 4 below its target the fed s preferred inflation measure was 1 85 15 below their target the fed was easing given their mandates the fed should have been tightening monetary policy rather than forcing some investors to deleverage which could destabilize markets they provided liquidity the fed tossed its congressionally mandated objectives out the window instead protecting large investors and preventing financial and market instability took precedence the fed put over time financial instability has become the beacon call for fed action in many investors minds financial instability is not just about helping financial institutions in need but also arresting falling stock prices such a fed reaction is often referred to as the fed put the fed s influence directly indirectly and in investor mindset has increasingly resulted in a positive correlation between returns and fed policy when monetary policy is easy stock prices and valuations tend to rise conversely when the fed tightens policy stocks tend to exhibit weakness with a very hawkish fed pushing interest rates higher and embarking on an aggressive qt program the fed s third objective may be investors only hope for the fed to stop the market bleeding fed funds and leverage the fed graph below shows the fed has used an abnormally low fed funds rate to help fuel debt driven growth fed funds should trade at or above the inflation rate when fed funds are below the rate of inflation as it has been for the last 20 years it implies the fed is pushing rates below where economic conditions and a free market would justify financial instability increases as the real fed funds rate become positive the reason is that too much financial speculative leverage relies on low rates as rates rise liquidity fades and leverage must be reduced consider the brief period when real fed funds were positive in 2019 and the financial instability that ensued 2006 and 2007 is another example the fed does not solely pay attention to fed funds or treasury yields to measure stability they also concern themselves with corporate borrowing rates in particular the spread between corporate borrowing rates and treasury yields the wider the spread the more illiquid market conditions for corporate borrowing illiquid market conditions can result in bankruptcy as we saw in 2008 corporate and bank yield spreads below we share a few popular bond market measurements to assess where corporate bond and bank yield spreads are today versus historical spreads the graph below shows that the spreads of bbb and b rated corporate debt yields versus the same maturity treasury yields are elevated however the current spreads pale compared to those seen in 2008 and other liquidity events while the corporate bond market spreads can widen quickly those sectors do not have a financial stability problem today the ted spread or treasury eurodollar spread measures the cost of borrowing dollars for foreign banks versus treasury yields like the corporate bond spread analysis widening spreads can be a precursor to potential liquidity issues as shown below the spread was recently at its widest level since the financial crisis since then it has tightened like many other financial stability measures the ted spread is higher than normal but not close to concerning levels equity volatility the fed put is the market s way of saying the fed has the market s back if it falls enough enough is often considered a loss of between 10 and 20 in we state more importantly volatility is not just a mathematical calculation volatility measures liquidity and liquidity defines risk in illiquid markets price swings tend to be extreme and often result in financial instability accordingly we compare current implied and realized volatility levels to historical readings realized or historical volatility is backward looking it is a statistical measure of an asset s price movement over a prior period implied volatility is derived from options prices it gauges what investors think volatility will be in the future the graph below shows annual and implied volatility is high but well below levels seen during the financial crisis and the initial days of the pandemic currently both levels are only one standard deviation extended from their norms a variation of three or more standard deviations would likely be destabilizing summary we can measure financial stability in many ways the more popular ones we highlight show financial instability is not a current problem however like summer thunderstorms financial instability can pop up quickly and cause significant damage we are hearing that there are some liquidity concerns in the mortgage and short term treasury markets so while the traditional measures of instability may not be alarming we need to stay alert as liquidity problems spread quickly it is crucial to keep in mind the threshold for a fed instability u turn is much higher than in the past given the stubbornness of the recent bout of inflation the economic damage it s inflicting on much of the population and growing political pressures the fed will not be able to react quickly to premonitions about financial instability unless inflation quickly diminishes it will tolerate a higher than normal amount of instability such may likely result in higher bond spreads and lower stock prices

i ve finished my speech at a luncheon meeting of the mississippi county regional chamber of commerce at the holiday inn in blytheville cliff chitwood walks over and hands me a cap i get plenty of free caps more than i ll ever wear in my travels across arkansas but i particularly like this one it says cotton to steel i ve long been fascinated by the rich history of this sprawling northeast arkansas county which at one time claimed to grow more cotton than any other county in america the transformation of mississippi county from top cotton producing county to top steel producing county is an amazing story the great river economic development foundation which chitwood heads is the organization behind the cotton to steel campaign gredf was formed in 2002 to recruit businesses to the county which has been losing population for decades it s funded by a county wide half cent sales tax for economic development prior to becoming gredf president chitwood was marketing director for the blytheville gosnell regional airport authority which is tasked with finding uses for the former eaker air force base in 2010 the association that represents arkansas economic developers recognized chitwood as its developer of the year a graduate of the university of arkansas with a degree in finance and economics he once worked as a ua development officer the transformation here began in 1987 when nucor yamato steel constructed a mill in the blytheville area nearby nucor steel arkansas locally known as nucor hickman began production in 1992 and expanded in 1998 nucor yamato was formed as a joint venture between nucor and yamato kogyo the plant now has the ability to produce more than 2 5 million tons per year the two steel plants were surrounded by steel related industries such as milwaukee electric tool corp which closed in 2008 and maverick tube corp now tenaris the blytheville area steel mills have produced what are known as hot band cold roll galvanized galvanneal and painted sheet types of steel used in the automotive energy appliance construction and agricultural equipment industries since 2018 nucor has invested almost 750 million in facility upgrades in 2017 big river steel began operations at its 1 3 billion scrap metal recycling and flat rolled steel production facility near osceola it wasn t long until big river was providing steel to more than 200 customers an expansion was planned almost immediately and completed in november 2020 lenore trammell big river s chief administrative officer said at the time of the expansion our location in osceola is steel mill heaven because of our proximity to a main line railroad major highways and the mississippi river that allows us to easily receive raw materials including recycled scrap and then ship steel via a variety of transportation methods in july 2019 zekelman industries announced it would build another tube mill adjacent to its existing atlas tube mill in blytheville the expansion produced 75 additional jobs and cost 150 million production at the facility began earlier this year in october 2019 nucor opened a 230 million specialty cold mill complex on its hickman land the complex expanded nucor s capability to produce automotive grade steel almost 100 additional workers were added at an average salary of 80 000 annually with today s automakers counting on steel as their material of choice to reduce vehicle weight while at the same time improving safety and performance our new cold mill will be at the forefront of making these advanced high strength steel products nucor steel arkansas general manager jay henderson said at the time the expansion pushed nucor s total employment in arkansas above 1 800 last august majestic steel usa announced that it was adding a service center and processing facility on nucor s hickman campus the 515 000 square foot complex will have advanced processing and warehousing equipment and create 225 jobs the facility is expected to be fully operational by the end of this year majestic founded in 1979 and headquartered in cleveland will process and stock steel products for businesses across the region the biggest of all announcements came in january when u s steel corp which earlier purchased big river said it will locate a 3 billion mill near osceola creating 900 jobs with an average pay of more than 100 000 annually it will be the largest private capital investment in arkansas history the mill will have two electric arc furnaces with three million tons per year of advanced steelmaking capacity the plant also will feature advanced finishing capabilities u s steel president and ceo david burritt said in january that the new plant will reshape the future of steelmaking we had numerous competitive site options but osceola offers our customers incomparable advantages alabama and mississippi were also in the running for the mill the arkansas legislature held a special session last year to put together an incentive package industry experts say it will be the most advanced steel mill ever constructed our nation and our customers need a robust and resilient supply chain to meet consumers needs and that starts with u s steel s advanced sustainable steels burritt said in january steel is critical to so much of what the world builds so how we make our products contributes directly to a better more sustainable world for all this new facility will build that future the facility will be adjacent to the big river mill together the two mills will be known as big river steel works u s steel is moving quickly with project completion expected by 2024 arkansas commerce secretary mike preston says the selection of mississippi county speaks volumes about the business climate and workforce in the area by being the home of the first mill in the country to use endless casting and rolling technology the steel industry will continue to recognize arkansas for excellence in steel production in an april speech to the arkansas economic development foundation burritt said his employees have been offered everything from free bottled water to help moving into their homes this is a great place to do business and it s because of the people you have here burritt said we love the culture in osceola they make our people feel extraordinarily welcome i m bullish about our business and about arkansas bullish with a capital b other announcements followed electric vehicle manufacturer envirotech vehicles inc is trying to raise the capital necessary to make an 80 7 million investment in osceola the company announced in february that it wants to refurbish the former fruit of the loom plant that covers 580 000 square feet if funds can be raised the plant will produce up to 2 000 vehicles a year after investing another 200 million above the initial 80 7 million employment is expected to reach 800 the company also announced that it will relocate its headquarters from corona calif to osceola this is what we ve envisioned for northeast arkansas preston says when you bring in big anchor companies like big river steel and u s steel folks in the supply chain are naturally going to gravitate to the area we feel manufacturing in northeast arkansas is going to be strong for years to come last month sierra group roofing solar announced that it will invest 16 million for an 11 000 square foot headquarters at blytheville and create 40 jobs the company makes gutters and metal roofing accessories sierra group is a great example of a company that s poised to make strides in the steel industry preston says here s the problem for chitwood and other economic developers in mississippi county many of those who work in the mills don t live in the county mississippi county s population peaked at 82 375 in 1950 when thousands of sharecroppers and tenant farmers were needed to chop the massive fields of cotton in the summer and pick the crops by hand in the fall the rapid mechanization of agriculture after world war ii sent those workers to other states mississippi county saw its population tumble to 70 174 in 1960 62 060 in 1970 59 517 in 1980 57 525 in 1990 51 979 in 2000 46 480 in 2010 and 40 685 in 2020 many in the steel industry work a schedule of four days on and four days off they share house trailers or recreational vehicles with co workers then return home to missouri tennessee western kentucky and southern illinois during their off days how do mississippi county officials convince them to move their families to northeast arkansas the answer is what s known as the work here live here initiative the program pays 10 percent of any new home bought in the county by a worker in the manufacturing sector as long as the home is in the 200 0000 to 500 000 range a worker must obtain a construction loan from a local bank to qualify when the house is completed a second mortgage with the 10 percent is implemented if the worker remains employed in the county for at least four years the second mortgage is paid off by the program companies with operations in the area are partnering with the county living half your time in an rv is just not sustainable for those who want a family life chitwood says the executives of our companies understand that it s like life in an oil and gas field for these workers i think company executives are beginning to understand the benefit of having their workers live close to the mills take what nucor has done in the way of expansions what big river steel has spent and what atlas tube has spent that s more than 2 billion in recent capital investments even before the 3 billion u s steel announcement the capital is here these mills are going to be here for decades to come i have to believe that more of the people who work in the mills will decide it makes sense to have homes here chitwood doesn t think the work here live here initiative will be around for decades we re not going to have to do this forever he says what we re trying to do is provide an incentive to increase our housing stock and change the conversation inside the county liz smith who heads the mississippi county regional chamber of commerce says the feeling of momentum is palpable i ve never felt this much energy here she says our chamber membership has doubled the huge industrial announcements get all the attention but there are lots of small businesses opening to support those workers we re even seeing investors buy some of the old buildings in downtown blytheville and osceola meanwhile a new foundation was formed to support the ritz theater in downtown blytheville the most exciting thing of all is that the main people involved in things like downtown restoration are young that s what we need in mississippi county a younger generation fully committed to making this a nice place to live in the south part of the county investor gaylon lawrence jr continues to pour millions of dollars into the old company town of wilson its boutique hotel louis is already advertising in upscale lifestyle magazines such as garden gun with plans to open this fall steel company executives are expected to build homes in the wilson area and enroll their children in its prep school the delta school thousands of acres of cotton not to mention soybeans rice and corn are still grown here modern agriculture requires few workers though steel is now king in mississippi county and the key to its future

tuba sim works on joanne robinson s hair at salon simis in fairfax va on june 16 photo for the washington post by amanda andrade rhoades more americans are beginning to hold off on booking flights getting haircuts building backyard pools and replacing old leaky roofs in some of the new signs that the consumer engine of u s economic growth could be losing steam over the past several weeks households had already cut back on big ticket purchase because of soaring prices but in a worrisome twist data suggests consumers are also beginning to tap the brakes on dining out vacation plans and even routine services like manicures hair cuts and home cleaning appointments business owners around the country say rising prices dwindling savings and concerns of a souring economy are taking a toll on household spending decisions at olentangy maids in columbus ohio more customers are putting off or canceling home cleaning appointments some regulars are trying to negotiate lower prices while others have stopped tipping altogether co owner keith troyer said it hasn t been a massive drop off but enough that it s been noticeable troyer said quite a few clients have called saying hey my wife got laid off we need to cancel or can i switch from biweekly to monthly prior to this month that s something that hardly happened consumer spending which makes up more than two thirds of the u s economy has held strong through april even with inflation at historic highs but there are growing signs that the spending streak could be ending retail sales slowed last month for the first time this year driven by a 4 drop in car sales u s flight bookings dipped 2 3 in may from a month earlier according to data from adobe analytics and both high and low income americans have begun pulling back particularly on services in the past four to six weeks according to an analysis of credit card data by barclays the slowdown in spending is now concentrated in services not goods the bank found in a new analysis of credit card data all through 2022 the narrative has been that as covid faded households would ramp up spending on services barclays analysts wrote in a note this week and indeed that narrative has been true for much of this year but services spending seems to be slowing considerably spending on services like travel and restaurants which was growing more than 30 from 2021 rates this year has now slowed to half that pace according to the barclays analysis customers at salon simis in fairfax va have begun cutting back in new ways clients who used to come in every four weeks

pinch of inflation too boxes of disposable gloves have gone from 7 to nearly 25 in two years hair dyes that used to cost 25 are now closer to 40 sim raised prices during the pandemic once but he s worried another markup would alienate more customers people are cutting back left and right he said they re saying i m sorry i can t afford this anymore these early signs of slowdown across a broad range of products and industries including travel and restaurants challenge the notion that americans have simply shifted their spending from goods to services the hope until now had been that after two years of stocking up on products like cars furniture and appliances americans would splurge more on vacations dining out manicures and other services they d mostly put off for much of the pandemic meanwhile one benchmark showed growth in the u s services industry slowed in may to its lowest level since february 2021 according to a closely watched index from the institute for supply management the goods side is definitely weakening but if you look closely services are too said kevin gordon senior investment research manager at charles schwab restaurant sales have eased travel related

down an average 13 so far this month compared with the same period in pre pandemic 2019 restaurant dining data from the reservation platform open table meanwhile shows that the number of people eating at restaurants fell 11 in the week ending june 16 compared with the same week in 2019 while low income families have been hardest hit by inflation higher income households are also beginning to cut back especially as they watch investments from stock portfolios to homes lose value gordon said household wealth fell for the first time in two years in the most recent quarter in large part because of a 3 trillion plunge in the stock values federal reserve data shows the markets continued their volatile descent this week with three major stock indexes deepening losses for the year and the s p

scores are markedly lower than six weeks ago i see more credit problems mcgee said more people have maxed out cards or have fallen behind on payments at the end of the day that means people have to be much more cautious about their spending credit card debt which nosedived during the pandemic as americans used government stimulus to pay down balances has rebounded to all time highs as of june 1 americans had 868 billion in consumer debt up nearly 16 from last year according to fed data and while the wealthiest continue to rent lamborghinis and bentleys mcgee said there has been a notable decline in the number of tourists opting for high end rentals i can tell that traveling is down the tourism is down he said a lot of higher middle class customers used to come into town and splurge but you can see that dropping pretty dramatically that consumer hesitation follows months of inflation at 40 year highs prices have risen 8 6 in the past year driving up costs for a range of essentials including gas which reached a record of 5 per gallon the biggest bright spot in the economy remains the strong jobs market with the unemployment rate at a pandemic low of 3 6 demand for workers neared record highs in april with about twice as many openings than job seekers weekly claims for unemployment insurance have recently begun to creep up but they are far lower than they had been during most of the pandemic with workers still able to find jobs the fed made a sharper move this week to hike interest rates by three fourths of a percentage point in hopes of cooling the economy enough to curb inflation without tipping it into recession despite the central bank s assurances that it can pull off a soft landing businesses and households are increasingly worried about the state of the economy as well as their personal finances indeed u s consumer sentiment plummeted this month to its lowest level on record according to an index by the university of michigan the consumer is coming under stress said douglas duncan chief economist at mortgage giant fannie mae who expects a recession next year we see that in decreasing retail sales and in rising credit card usage we don t expect things to fall apart immediately though it ll be a slower decline indeed small businesses nationwide are reporting small signs of customers pulling back morehead pools which

during the pandemic but lately economic jitters are leading many customers to patch up their roofs instead of replacing them many are also trading down to cheaper materials like shingles made of
