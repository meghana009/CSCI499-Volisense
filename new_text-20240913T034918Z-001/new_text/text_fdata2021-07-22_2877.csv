share 13 growth in core earnings non gaap 0 97 return on assets 1 01 core return on assets non gaap 8 annualized total commercial loan growth excluding ppp loans 14 annualized increase in core deposits 13 increase in fee income exceptional credit quality president and chief executive officer curtis c simard stated we had another quarter of double digit core earnings growth and core return on assets of over 1 00 profitability increased on higher fee income driven from growth in core deposits and assets under management aum customer service income returned to pre pandemic levels suggesting a potentially meaningful recovery in regional activity augmented by a lift from our previously announced fee strategies implemented at the start of this year the 8 annualized growth in commercial loans during the quarter excluding ppp reflects our commitment to meeting the needs of our existing customers and developing new relationships as we navigate past ppp activities our wealth management business continues to be a significant contributor to total non interest income while our retail and commercial loan teams continue to generate new core deposit accounts especially in dda categories more than 1 000 new banking relationships were created in the second quarter highlighting both existing customer retention efforts and new customer initiatives with the increase in mortgage rates late in the first quarter we chose to opportunistically add balances to the balance sheet which helped stem the attrition however a focus on irr management remains top of mind mr simard continued we continued to organically grow our capital levels expanding tangible equity to tangible assets non gaap to 8 23 while maintaining exceptional credit quality all credit metrics remain strong and further improved in the quarter primarily marked by lower past dues minimal net charge offs and improved coverage ratios overall we continue to see favorable migration in risk ratings across most loan categories loan modification concessions made during the pandemic have essentially all resumed normal repayment schedules as of the end of the quarter mr simard stated as we think about net interest margin nim quarter over quarter the second quarter had substantially less ppp fee acceleration and was further impacted by the excess cash on hand of note 105 million of wholesale deposits matured on the last day of the quarter which will benefit our cost of funds going forward we are starting to see a leveling off of nim excluding non recurring items as reliance on wholesale borrowings continues to be reduced and dda growth continues given our overall asset sensitive balance sheet position and a more core funded profile we are well positioned for when rates start to move back up excluding the effects of one time items our second quarter nim was 2 95 compared with the same adjusted metric of 2 86 in the first quarter 2021 mr simard commented in the first quarter we announced the initiation of a comprehensive review of our non interest expenses which included an annual reduction to salary and benefits of more than 3 0 million along with additional cost savings associated with vendor contracts and process efficiencies while some savings have been immediately realized in our second quarter run rates others will be phased in depending on contract timelines as we continue to resume business as usual activities we are also rolling out cost containment initiatives to absorb any potential increases associated with pandemic delayed expenses lastly we evaluate profitability at each branch within our footprint at least annually taking into consideration the unique geography of northern new england and our customer needs mr simard concluded as we move into the second half of the year we are encouraged by an improving economic outlook and better operating conditions our collective resilience has prepared and positioned us to move forward with the same resolve that has sustained us throughout the pandemic we have a unique complementary footprint that is enabling us to utilize all earnings levers that align with our model and strategy we look forward

approximately 36 of its current size total deposits decreased 90 0 million to 2 8 billion during the quarter due to lower time deposits offset by significant growth in core deposits core deposits increased 77 8 million or 14 on an annualized basis during the quarter over 1 000 new customer relationships were added in the quarter time deposits decreased 167 7 million during the quarter

credit losses for the quarter was a benefit of 765 thousand compared to an expense of 1 4 million in the second quarter of 2020 the provision recapture in the second quarter 2021 is attributable to

for the first 12 weeks melbourne has recorded no new local covid cases overnight and just one new case in hotel quarantine acting premier james merlino said it is good news and news i know everyone in victoria wanted to hear but he warned that while it was a terrific outcome it was nowhere near over victorians have done an awesome effort in getting tested getting vaccinated following the rules we are not out of the woods yet today having zero cases is a great reflection of the work of all victorians there is a total of 75 active cases in the community and 17 604 tests were processed on thursday mr merlino urged those in craigieburn to get tested as he said testing numbers were lower than expected in some areas we would like to see an uplift because of community transmission it was lower than we would have liked in some parts of melbourne i am asking victorians that if you live in the craigieburn area and did not get tested yesterday please go out and get tested today he said acting premier james merlino says victorians are not out of the woods yet picture david crosling chief health officer brett sutton also urged victorians to keep testing efforts up the week ahead probably won t be all zero cases we have thousands of primary close contacts some of which will become positive it is not a concern as they all quarantined for the entire period it has only been 48 hours since we had cases of uncertain acquisition the genomic sequence from the four mystery cases in the same reservoir household has indicated they re carrying the kappa strain of virus prof sutton said that finding was consistent with the existing city of whittlesea outbreak the dhhs is still searching for the source of exposure for the two queensland cases in melbourne they have gone through a long interview process with us prof sutton said we thank them for that it is a tiring process lots of detail around where they have been we have been looking quite a bit earlier than june for that acquisition where they may have picked it up whether or not they were infectious through that he said mr merlino said a number of exposure sites would come up as a result of the couple who had travelled to queensland but could not say if the pair would be fined a large line forms at the food bank pop up in la trobe street after the easing of restrictions picture nca newswire david crosling

place prof sutton said the state would not ease restrictions sooner than planned given the kappa variant link with the reservoir household he said he wasn t suprised by friday s zero cases obviously primary close contacts isolating at home has helped to control this he said although tracing work has helped to control this and all the great testing that has been done has allowed us to find cases and then control them so we are going to get days of zero i expect they will be more and i also expect there will be days when we have new cases each day it isn t over yet we are on the right track as the city s restrictions eased on monday prof sutton said he had never backed lockdowns as the first measure to tackle an outbreak they will never be the first measure they will be a measure that we implement when we have to do and only when we have to do there are so many sad stories and struggles that people are reporting on my heart goes out to them i cannot fathom what it has meant across victoria throughout lockdown and through all of the circuit breakers and lockdowns across australia we are doing this with the minimum restrictions that keep us safe the alternative with this running away is too awful to imagine in some respects however he said mystery cases would trigger tighter restrictions but couldn t say whether the emergence of more mystery cases would lead to another lockdown of course mystery cases where there are concerns about high risk settings would be of concern there will be mystery cases where people have had very little interaction or there is a significant suggestion where they may have picked it up geographically or otherwise there is no one size fits all each on its own merits chief health officer brett sutton says mystery cases will trigger more restrictions picture andrew henshaw shopper return to bourke street mall picture david crosling covid jab a path out of lockdowns more than 17 000 victorians were vaccinated on thursday mr merlino said the commonwealth had assured it had enough pfizer vaccination in stock for a second dose he said vaccination was a pathway out of future blanket lockdowns the sooner we get our community vaccinated at a much higher proportion the more comfort is provided to public health in terms of our response to any particular outbreak qld authorities put victorians on notice queensland health minister yvette d ath said she had been informed that there were other victorians who managed to come into queensland without the correct exemptions i ve been advised this morning by the deputy police commissioner that there are other people coming across our border from victoria who are driving up through new south wales crossing our border from victoria who do not have the exemptions or travel declarations to do so ms d ath said we will be making sure that you are found this is an offence you cannot come into this state if you are from a hotspot and put our state at risk and we will make sure that you will face the consequences if you do that queensland police deputy commissioner steve gollschewski confirmed five other people have been identified as failing to comply with directions coming into queensland two in the darling downs one in dalby and two in the wide bay district all five people who entered queensland without border passes were sent to hotel quarantine and returned negative test results more suburbs on alert victorian health authorities uncovered more concerning sewage detections of covid 19 as melbourne emerged from tough lockdown restrictions covid was detected in wastewater in bendigo glenroy pascoe vale and across whitehorse manningham and monash council areas the health department said there had also been positive detections of coronavirus viral fragments in wastewater samples taken in the scoresby and vermont areas in a statement late on thursday these new detections are of interest as there are currently no confirmed covid 19 cases in

melburnians with very little health evidence melbourne s lockdown will be lifted as planned on friday but health experts have reneged on their proposal to scrap outdoor mask wearing despite admitting coronavirus had not been transmitted outside in any recent outbreak it comes as authorities scramble to work out how a family of four mysteriously caught the virus a woman in her 70s and three men in their 80s 50s and 20s from the same reservoir home tested positive on wednesday none have visited an exposure site or been identified as a close contact of a positive case and their strain is unknown one of the family members is a recipient of a disability pension while another provides care in an informal setting chairs were out at 6 30am on friday at the peddler cafe in nunawading as sit in dining returned in melbourne deputy chief health officer allen cheng said these new cases are really the strongest reminder that we are no means out of the woods yet but health officials deemed the cautious easing of melbourne s restrictions allowing schools to reopen restaurants to have 100 patrons only 50 indoors and travel up to 25km could go ahead we are moving ahead but we are on high alert acting premier james merlino said questions have been raised as to the effectiveness of wearing masks outdoors after both professor cheng and covid 19 commander jeroen weimar confirmed no cases in the current cluster or recent outbreaks had been acquired while outside we have no evidence that we ve seen yet in this particular outbreak or the most recent ones we ve dealt with of outdoor transmission mr weimar admitted on thursday professor cheng said there was pretty good evidence around masks reducing transmission and that cases where the virus was passed outdoors in the second wave might have gone unnoticed when asked about reports that transmission was 20 times less likely to happen outdoors prof cheng said that doesn t mean zero there is still a risk infectious diseases expert prof peter collignon said little to no transmission occurred outdoors unless in crowded situations where people gathered for prolonged periods unless you ve got uncontrollable spread like in the uk or europe i can t really see it ll provide much benefit to wear masks outdoors prof collignon said there can t be much community transmission in melbourne right now if any mr merlino said the continued wearing of masks was a small price to pay we don t have the luxury of picking and choosing public health advice that we like or don t like he said melbourne exited lockdown at midnight on thursday picture ian currie acting premier james merlino said victorians must wear masks outdoors victoria police chief commissioner shane patton revealed on thursday about 50 people were fined 4500 for blatant breaches during the recent lockdown meanwhile queensland authorities confirmed a melton couple who tested positive for coronavirus did not have an exemption to enter the state but are believed to have been moving their for work the couple both in their 40s left melbourne on june 1 and travelled through nsw before arriving on the sunshine coast on june 5 they first became symptomatic on june 3 but victorian contact tracers have little information on the case given they are now in the hands of queensland authorities prof cheng flagged the new cases could stall the planned easing of restrictions in greater melbourne from thursday june 17 we may need to hold on the current settings for a little longer prof cheng said more exposure sites added a mcdonald s drive through multiple coles supermarkets and a woolworths are among the latest additions to victoria s long list of covid 19 exposure sites the state s health department made eight additions to the alerts list of venues visited by a confirmed case of covid 19 on thursday as melbourne s tough lockdown was lifted all of the new venues were listed as tier 2 exposure sites meaning people who visited during the times listed need to get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result see the full list here originally published as zero new local cases as melbourne s fourth lockdown eases

and net income of 9 2 million or 0 31 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020 net income for the second quarter of 2021 reflected a 3 5 million pre tax release of provision for credit losses compared to a 3 0 million pre tax release in the first quarter of 2021 and a 2 1 million pre tax provision expense in the second quarter of 2020 mortgage banking income totaled 1 6 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 5 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 5 1 million in the second quarter of 2020 mortgage servicing rights experienced a mark to market loss of 1 0 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared to a 1 1 million gain in the prior quarter and a 445 000 loss in the second quarter of 2020 net gain on sales of mortgage loans totaled 1 9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 3 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 4 6 million in the second quarter of 2020 as mortgage origination and refinancing volumes declined in the current period operating results second quarter 2021 net income was 8 8 million reflecting a decrease in earnings of 3 1 million from the first quarter of 2021 and a decrease of 418 000 from the second quarter of

quarter of 2020 interest and dividend income for the second quarter of 2021 was 24 2 million or 1 2 million less than the first quarter of 2021 and 1 5 million less than the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates over the past year interest and dividend income was favorably impacted by loan fees earned on forgiven paycheck protection program ppp loans during the first and second quarters of 2021 we originated 746 ppp loans totaling 136 7 million in 2020 and as of june 30 2021 11 6 million on 35 ppp loans originated during the first round of the ppp loan program remained outstanding during the first and second quarters of 2021 we originated 62 3 million or 574 loans under the second round of the ppp loan program of which 58 6 million or 483 loans remain outstanding as of june 30 2021 net loan interest and fee income recorded in 2021 year to date on all ppp loans totaled 1 6 million and approximately 2 3 million of net ppp loan fees remain unearned as of june 30 2021 interest expense for the second quarter of 2021 totaled 2 2 million compared to 1 8 million for the first quarter of 2021 and 3 0 million for the second quarter of 2020 the 393 000 increase in interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to the april 6 2021 issuance of 60 0 million of 3 50 fixed to floating rate subordinated notes due april 15 2031 which bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 3 50 until april 14 2026 the reduction in interest expense in the year over year period was due to a decrease in market interest rates which impacted all interest bearing deposit categories we recorded a 3 5 million release of provision expense in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a 3 0 million release of provision expense in the first quarter of 2021 and a 2 1 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2020 as the projected impact of the covid 19 pandemic on future credit losses is currently anticipated to be less than prior projections our allowance for credit losses acl on loans in the second quarter of 2021 consisted of a release of the acl on loans of 2 3 million as well as 65 000 of net charge offs recorded during the quarter in addition the acl for unfunded commitments decreased by 1 2 million in the second quarter of 2021 due to an updated forecast of credit line utilization rates noninterest income was 7 9 million for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 3 4 million or 29 9 compared to 11 3 million for the first quarter of 2021 and a decrease of 2 8 million or 26 0 compared to 10 7 million for the second quarter of 2020 the decrease from the linked quarter was primarily driven by a 4 1 million decline in residential mortgage banking revenue attributable to a 2 1 million decrease in the mark to market adjustment on msrs and a 1 8 million decrease in net gain on the sales of mortgage loans in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the prior quarter these decreases to noninterest income were partially offset by a 238 000 increase in wealth management income and a 218 000 increase in card related income in the current quarter compared to the linked quarter the decrease in noninterest income in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 was primarily due to a 3 5 million decline in residential mortgage banking revenue attributable to a 588 000 increase in mark to market loss on msrs and a 2 7 million decrease in net gain on sales of mortgage loans in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 noninterest expense was 21 4 million for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 337 000 or 1 6 compared to 21 7 million for the first quarter of 2021 and an increase of 2 5 million or 13 3 from 18 9 million for the second quarter of 2020 the decrease from the linked quarter was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense stemming from additional officer incentive compensation expenses paid out in early 2021 and the related increase in payroll taxes and 401k company match expense in addition a decrease in occupancy furniture and equipment costs was related to snow removal costs and building maintenance due to weather conditions in february 2021 the increase in noninterest expense in the year over year period was primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense occupancy furniture and equipment expenses card related expense and other expense the provision for income taxes expense was 3 2 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 4 2 million for the first quarter of 2021 and 3 1 million for the second quarter of 2020 the decrease in tax expense for the linked quarter was due to lower pre tax income in the second quarter of 2021 and the increase in tax expense for the year over year period was primarily due to a decrease in tax deductible expenses in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 during the second quarter of 2021 we repurchased 310 900 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 13 55 per share pursuant to our stock repurchase program on july 20 2021 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0 05 per share payable on august 9 2021 to stockholders of record as of july 30 2021 president and chief executive officer jim eccher said an improving economy and conservative positioning resulted in solid bottom line earnings and a continued return of excess capital to our stockholders through the recent increase in the common dividend and continued share repurchases while challenges remain our credit quality metrics and expectations have continued to improve as the chicago area moves towards a more normalized environment loan demand continued to remain soft in the second quarter with utilization rates remaining low and customers using excess liquidity to pay down existing debt the end result was a somewhat disappointing 21 9 million linked quarter decline in loans and leases held for investment exclusive of ppp loan activity deposit inflows remain robust and resulted in a further increase in excess liquidity as evidenced by a 140 0 million increase in average cash on the balance sheet during the quarter we continue to deploy a portion of the excess liquidity on our balance sheet in short duration securities with yields far below the aggregate portfolio yield the combination of these factors largely resulted in a 39 basis point sequential quarter decline in our net interest margin but a far more modest sequential decline in net interest income looking forward i am more optimistic on loan growth for the remainder of the year and believe reported margin trends are more symptomatic of the profound increase in liquidity on our balance sheet rather than any fundamental change in our business i believe old second remains conservatively positioned to meet these challenges as our expenses remain well controlled our business is well diversified customer activity is increasing and our underwriting has remained disciplined and consistent i would like to thank our employees for their continued hard work in delivering a solid quarter while delivering exceptional customer service as we move towards a more normal routine covid 19 update late in the first quarter of 2020 we began granting loan payment deferrals to certain borrowers affected by the pandemic for the period april 1 2020 through june 30 2021 our clients had requested loan payment deferrals on 506 loans totaling 237 8 million as of june 30 2021 488 loans representing 228 7 million outstanding or 96 2 of the original loan balances deferred have resumed payments or paid off active payment deferrals remain on 18 loans with 9 1 million of balances outstanding we are participating in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act during 2021 we processed 574 loan applications for

despite bouncing back tuesday and wednesday a large blip in traders confidence on monday showed the early signs of a slowdown in the pandemic recovery as well as the fragility in the current market these fears are driven by a resurgent covid 19 spearheaded by the delta variant which is taking hold of countries from east to west this has led to fears of a return to restrictions as cases and deaths rise across many nations our delta variant coverage what has been happening to the stock markets in more detail the markets had been moving comfortably in the right direction of the back off an ever increasing vaccine rollout as well as huge economic injections in the forms of the stimulus packages however monday saw one of the biggest drops in months as traders awoke to news of new restrictions in asia as well as worrying pandemic developments in europe and in the us the nasdaq and s p 500 had their biggest drop in nearly two months falling 1 7 and 1 9 respectively the 10 year treasury bond yield fell to its lowest levels since early march a less volatile measurement of viewing the markets which suggests further trouble ahead the drop off was not just felt in the us in europe the ftse 100 in london slumped 2 6 while germany s dax lost 2 9 and france s cac 40 fell 2 9 asian markets also fell with japan s nikkei 225 losing 1 3 by wednesday the markets had returned to their pre monday levels but it is unlikely that this will be the last significant scare before the end of the year as stimulus injections and covid 19 based support for ailing economies subside the economic growth the us is seeing will slow down in the first quarter of 2021 it grew 6 4 and the forecast is it will grow faster in the second quarter provided the pandemic does not disrupt it too much what threat does the delta variant pose increased transmission and deaths make it more likely that nations will reimpose restrictions to protect lives as has been seen throughout the pandemic these restrictions inevitably damage economies the new variant is driving case numbers up worldwide in south east asia the variant is tearing through communities as the rate of vaccination is lower than in europe in indonesia last week there was more than 50 000 cases a day and further north in japan tokyo was seeing case numbers of more than 2 000 mere days before the start of the olympics even in places with high rates of vaccinations there is a worrying rise in cases the united kingdom has seen a rapid rise in cases just as england threw off the remaining restrictions france is seeing more than 20 000 new cases a day if the lessening of restrictions has come to early then a return to draconian measures could be seen especially as countries head into winter when hospitals are busy with or without covid 19 get vaccinated these shots need to get into arms as rapidly as possible or else we re gonna be back in a situation this fall like what we went through last year pic twitter com j4o6yl5cn4 leader mcconnell leadermcconnell july 20 2021 closer to home california removed its restrictions only to see the reimposition of masks a month later all these worrying signs in such an interconnected world make traders worried if nations vaccination programmes are lagging coming into winter then there is huge risks of more confinements and further economic downturn

san ramon calif ap pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles 16 000 kilometers of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation across drought stricken california the daunting project announced wednesday aims to bury about 10 of pg e s distribution and transmission lines at a projected cost of 15 billion to as much as 30 billion based on how much the process currently costs the utility believes it will find ways to keep the final bill at the lower end of those estimates most of the costs will likely be shouldered by pg e customers whose electricity rates are already among the highest in the u s pg e stepped up its safety commitment just days after informing regulators a 70 foot 23 meter pine tree that toppled on one of its power lines ignited a major fire in butte county the same rural area about 145 miles 233 kilometers northeast of san francisco where another fire sparked by its equipment in 2018 killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands of homes since it started july 13 in a remote area of butte county the dixie fire has churned northeast through the sierra nevada by wednesday the fire spanned a 133 square mile 344 square kilometer area forcing the plumas county sheriff on wednesday to order evacuations along the west shore of popular lake almanor the backlash to pg e s potential liability for the dixie fire prompted the company s recently hired ceo patricia patti poppe to unveil the plan for underground lines several months earlier than she said she planned previous pg e regimes have staunchly resisted plans to bury long stretches of power lines because of the massive expense involved but poppe told reporters on wednesday that she quickly realized after she joined pg e in january that moving lines underground is the best way to protect both the utility and the 16 million people who rely on it for power it s too expensive not to do it lives are on the line poppe told reporters pg e said only that burying the lines will take several years however getting the job done within the next decade will require a quantum leap in the few areas where pg e has already been burying power lines it has been completing about 70 miles 123 kilometers annually pg e expects to eventually be able to bury more than 1 000 miles 1 600 kilometers of power lines annually said its chief operating officer adam wright while wright likened the project to the marshall plan that helped rebuild europe after world war ii poppe invoked president john f kennedy s 1962 pledge for the u s to land on the moon pg e s path to this point has been strewn with death and destruction after previous leaders allowed its equipment to fall into disrepair in a apparent attempt to boost profits and management bonuses the utility s grid was blamed for igniting a series of devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that prompted the company to file for bankruptcy in 2019 the biggest fire in butte county wiped out the entire town of paradise and resulted in pg e pleading guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter last year just weeks before it emerged from one of the most complex cases in u s history as part of its bankruptcy pg e set up a 13 5 billion trust to pay victims of its past wildfires but that fund is facing a roughly 2 billion shortfall because half its money is supposed to come from company stock that has been a market laggard since getting out of bankruptcy pg e also has been rebuked by california power regulators and a federal judge overseeing its criminal probation for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the utility has also been charged with another round of fire related crimes that it denies committing poppe insisted things are getting better this year under a plan that calls for pg e to spend 1 4 billion removing more than 300 000 trees and trimming another 1 1 million but she conceded the utility is not making enough progress since it s only a fraction of that 8 million trees within striking distance of its power lines but she also defended pg e s handling of the tree that may have caused the dixie fire and its response the tree looked healthy and was about 40 feet 12 meters from power lines she said making it a low risk danger when a pg e troubleshooter was sent out to inspect a potential problem he noticed the tree had fallen and may have started a fire in a treacherous area that he tried to put out before firefighters arrived his efforts can be called nothing less than heroic poppe said

as thematic investing strategies go it doesn t get much narrower than this an exchange traded fund concentrating on between 30 and 50 cryptocurrency miners that also pass muster for environmental social and governance criteria that s the objective of the new viridi cleaner energy crypto mining semiconductor etf rigz which started trading tuesday it s a thematic niche play within the bitcoin ecosystem this is an essential service said wes fulford chief executive of viridi funds while the actively managed etf doesn t directly own cryptocurrencies it s designed to operate as a leveraged play on cryptocurrencies including bitcoin because as fulford explained when the price of bitcoin goes up by 10 the operational expenses for miners don t change which means the mining stocks could go up 20 or 30 in terms of timing fulford said the mining companies and other blockchain infrastructure companies including semiconductor makers will likely benefit from the upside potential of recently beaten down cryptocurrencies after peaking at more than 63 000 in april bitcoin has fallen steadily to a recent low of around 30 000 at least some of the pullback was attributed to comments by tesla chief executive elon musk about the excessive amount of energy required for crypto mining fulford called musk s comments tying crypto mining to fossil fuels fairly hypocritical when you look at all the materials that would go into a tesla build and the grid powers required elon musk has quite the following and his news about investment in bitcoin was a major catalyst to drive the price lower but his comments were probably due to pressure from his boards he said the rationale for owning a mining and infrastructure company is much the same as a senior gold producer leveraged returns as compared to the underlying commodity fulford said we believe that based on recent developments within the chinese mining sector north american miners that have access to sustainable low cost power large fleets of new generation rigs and access to capital are well positioned to generate higher returns during the months and years ahead we are excited to be launching rigz at such a pivotal point within the evolution of this market sector and to be prioritizing investment into sustainable crypto mining practices through viridi s clean energy focus todd rosenbluth director of mutual fund and etf research at cfra said rigz joins a growing list of funds offering crypto related exposure but this fund seeks to stand out by tapping into the increased focus on esg however this might be too niche to garner sufficient scale rosenbluth added according to fulford the esg screening is part of an internal scoring system measuring the energy consumption of the various crypto infrastructure companies eighty percent of the companies in the fund have to pass our internal clean energy filter he said

file in this oct 10 2019 file photo a pacific gas electric sign is shown outside of a pg e building in san francisco pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation sprawling across its drought stricken service ap photo jeff chiu file san ramon calif pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles 16 000 kilometers of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation across drought stricken california the daunting project announced wednesday aims to bury about 10 of pg e s distribution and transmission lines at a projected cost of 15 billion to as much as 30 billion based on how much the process currently costs the utility believes it will find ways to keep the final bill at the lower end of those estimates most of the costs will likely be shouldered by pg e customers whose electricity rates are already among the highest in the u s recommended videos pg e stepped up its safety commitment just days after informing regulators a 70 foot 23 meter pine tree that toppled on one of its power lines ignited a major fire in butte county the same rural area about 145 miles 233 kilometers northeast of san francisco where another fire sparked by its equipment in 2018 killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands of homes since it started july 13 in a remote area of butte county the dixie fire has churned northeast through the sierra nevada by wednesday the fire spanned a 133 square mile 344 square kilometer area forcing the plumas county sheriff on wednesday to order evacuations along the west shore of popular lake almanor the backlash to pg e s potential liability for the dixie fire prompted the company s recently hired ceo patricia patti poppe to unveil the plan for underground lines several months earlier than she said she planned previous pg e regimes have staunchly resisted plans to bury long stretches of power lines because of the massive expense involved but poppe told reporters on wednesday that she quickly realized after she joined pg e in january that moving lines underground is the best way to protect both the utility and the 16 million people who rely on it for power it s too expensive not to do it lives are on the line poppe told reporters pg e said only that burying the lines will take several years however getting the job done within the next decade will require a quantum leap in the few areas where pg e has already been burying power lines it has been completing about 70 miles 123 kilometers annually pg e expects to eventually be able to bury more than 1 000 miles 1 600 kilometers of power lines annually said its chief operating officer adam wright while wright likened the project to the marshall plan that helped rebuild europe after world war ii poppe invoked president john f kennedy s 1962 pledge for the u s to land on the moon pg e s path to this point has been strewn with death and destruction after previous leaders allowed its equipment to fall into disrepair in a apparent attempt to boost profits and management bonuses the utility s grid was blamed for igniting a series of devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that prompted the company to file for bankruptcy in 2019 the biggest fire in butte county wiped out the entire town of paradise and resulted in pg e pleading guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter last year just weeks before it emerged from one of the most complex cases in u s history as part of its bankruptcy pg e set up a 13 5 billion trust to pay victims of its past wildfires but that fund is facing a roughly 2 billion shortfall because half its money is supposed to come from company stock that has been a market laggard since getting out of bankruptcy pg e also has been rebuked by california power regulators and a federal judge overseeing its criminal probation for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the utility has also been charged with another round of fire related crimes that it denies committing poppe insisted things are getting better this year under a plan that calls for pg e to spend 1 4 billion removing more than 300 000 trees and trimming another 1 1 million but she conceded the utility is not making enough progress since it s only a fraction of that 8 million trees within striking distance of its power lines but she also defended pg e s handling of the tree that may have caused the dixie fire and its response the tree looked healthy and was about 40 feet 12 meters from power lines she said making it a low risk danger when a pg e troubleshooter was sent out to inspect a potential problem he noticed the tree had fallen and may have started a fire in a treacherous area that he tried to put out before firefighters arrived his efforts can be called nothing less than heroic poppe said

prior period 9 driven by a strong performance from cadia and telfer lihir s gold production was 4 lower in the quarter due to unplanned downtime in the autoclaves lower head grade and recovery rates and the overrun of the planned march 2021 shutdown newcrest s aisc for the june 2021 quarter of 797 oz 5 was 96 oz lower than the prior period reflecting the benefit of higher copper sales volumes at cadia telfer and red chris a higher realised copper price and higher gold sales volumes at telfer and cadia these benefits were partially offset by the associated increase in treatment refining and

benefit of there being no planned shutdown events in the period which enabled a 6 increase in mill throughput head grade and recovery were impacted by a higher proportion of lower grade stockpile feed as access to expit ore in phase 14 was obstructed by high rainfall events scheduled maintenance activities that were planned for september 2021 have been brought forward and are expected to be completed during a period of unplanned downtime of autoclave 4 this planned maintenance activity is currently underway largely offsetting the impact on fy22 gold production associated with the autoclave 4 downtime lihir s aisc of 1 481 oz was 15 higher than the prior period driven by an increase in stripping activities in phase 15 timing of sustaining capital spend and higher covid 19

prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation sprawling across its drought stricken service ap photo jeff chiu file san ramon calif pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles 16 000 kilometers of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation across drought stricken california the daunting project announced wednesday aims to bury about 10 of pg e s distribution and transmission lines at a projected cost of 15 billion to as much as 30 billion based on how much the process currently costs the utility believes it will find ways to keep the final bill at the lower end of those estimates most of the costs will likely be shouldered by pg e customers whose electricity rates are already among the highest in the u s recommended videos pg e stepped up its safety commitment just days after informing regulators a 70 foot 23 meter pine tree that toppled on one of its power lines ignited a major fire in butte county the same rural area about 145 miles 233 kilometers northeast of san francisco where another fire sparked by its equipment in 2018 killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands of homes since it started july 13 in a remote area of butte county the dixie fire has churned northeast through the sierra nevada by wednesday the fire spanned a 133 square mile 344 square kilometer area forcing the plumas county sheriff on wednesday to order evacuations along the west shore of popular lake almanor the backlash to pg e s potential liability for the dixie fire prompted the company s recently hired ceo patricia patti poppe to unveil the plan for underground lines several months earlier than she said she planned previous pg e regimes have staunchly resisted plans to bury long stretches of power lines because of the massive expense involved but poppe told reporters on wednesday that she quickly realized after she joined pg e in january that moving lines underground is the best way to protect both the utility and the 16 million people who rely on it for power it s too expensive not to do it lives are on the line poppe told reporters pg e said only that burying the lines will take several years however getting the job done within the next decade will require a quantum leap in the few areas where pg e has already been burying power lines it has been completing about 70 miles 123 kilometers annually pg e expects to eventually be able to bury more than 1 000 miles 1 600 kilometers of power lines annually said its chief operating officer adam wright while wright likened the project to the marshall plan that helped rebuild europe after world war ii poppe invoked president john f kennedy s 1962 pledge for the u s to land on the moon pg e s path to this point has been strewn with death and destruction after previous leaders allowed its equipment to fall into disrepair in a apparent attempt to boost profits and management bonuses the utility s grid was blamed for igniting a series of devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that prompted the company to file for bankruptcy in 2019 the biggest fire in butte county wiped out the entire town of paradise and resulted in pg e pleading guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter last year just weeks before it emerged from one of the most complex cases in u s history as part of its bankruptcy pg e set up a 13 5 billion trust to pay victims of its past wildfires but that fund is facing a roughly 2 billion shortfall because half its money is supposed to come from company stock that has been a market laggard since getting out of bankruptcy pg e also has been rebuked by california power regulators and a federal judge overseeing its criminal probation for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the utility has also been charged with another round of fire related crimes that it denies committing poppe insisted things are getting better this year under a plan that calls for pg e to spend 1 4 billion removing more than 300 000 trees and trimming another 1 1 million but she conceded the utility is not making enough progress since it s only a fraction of that 8 million trees within striking distance of its power lines but she also defended pg e s handling of the tree that may have caused the dixie fire and its response the tree looked healthy and was about 40 feet 12 meters from power lines she said making it a low risk danger when a pg e troubleshooter was sent out to inspect a potential problem he noticed the tree had fallen and may have started a fire in a treacherous area that he tried to put out before firefighters arrived his efforts can be called nothing less than heroic poppe said

obtained from core drilling in proterozoic basement lithologies pq hq and nq diameter core was drilled on a 6m run core was cut using an automated core cutter and half core sampled at 1m intervals with breaks for major geological changes sampling intervals range from 0 2 1 0m cover sequences were not sampled drilling techniques permian paterson formation cover sequence was drilled using mud rotary drilling depths of cover typically observed to approximately 420m vertically below surface steel casing was emplaced to secure the pre collar core drilling was advanced from the base of the cover sequence with pq3 hq3 and nq2 diameter coring configuration core from inclined drill holes are oriented on 3m and 6m runs using an electronic core orientation tool reflex actiii at the end of each run the bottom of hole position is marked by the driller which is later transferred to the whole drill core run length with a bottom of hole reference line drill sample recovery core recovery is systematically recorded from the commencement of coring to end of hole by reconciling against driller s depth blocks in each core tray with data recorded in the database drillers depth blocks provided the depth interval of core recovered and interval of core drilled core recoveries were typically 100 with isolated zones of lower recovery cover sequence drilling by the mud rotary drilling did not yield recoverable samples logging geological logging recorded qualitative descriptions of lithology alteration mineralisation veining and structure for all core drilled 21 677m for 29 drill holes all intersecting mineralisation including orientation of key geological features geotechnical measurements were recorded including rock quality designation rqd fracture frequency solid core recovery and qualitative rock strength measurements magnetic susceptibility measurements were recorded every metre the bulk density of selected drill core intervals was determined at site on whole core samples all geological and geotechnical logging was conducted at the havieron site digital data logging was captured on diamond drill core intervals only and all data validated and stored in an acquire database all drill cores were photographed prior to cutting and or sampling the core the logging is of sufficient quality to support mineral resource estimates sub sampling techniques and sample preparation sampling sample preparation and quality control protocols are considered appropriate for the material being sampled core was cut and sampled at the telfer and havieron core processing facility half core samples were collected in pre numbered calico bags and grouped in plastic bags for dispatch to the laboratory sample weights typically varied from 0 5 to 4kg sample sizes are considered appropriate for the style of mineralisation drill core samples were freighted by air and road to the laboratory sample preparation was conducted at the independent iso17025 accredited intertek laboratory perth intertek samples were dried at 105oc and crushed to 95 passing 4 75mm and the split to obtain up to 3kg sub sample which was pulverised using lm5 to produce a pulped product with the minimum standard of 95 passing 106µm routine grind size analysis is conducted duplicate samples were collected from crush and pulp samples at a rate of 1 20 duplicate results show an acceptable level of variability for the material sampled and style of mineralisation periodic size checks 1 20 for crush and pulp samples and sample weights are provided by the laboratory and recorded in the acquire database quality of assay data and laboratory tests assaying of drill core samples was conducted at intertek all samples were assayed for 48 elements using a 4 acid digestion followed by icp aes icp ms determination method 4a ms907 which is considered to provide a total assay for copper gold analyses were determined by 50g fire assay with aas finish method fa50n aa which is considered to provide a total assay for gold sampling and assaying quality control procedures consisted of inclusion of certified reference material crms coarse residue and pulp duplicates with each batch at least 1 20 assays of quality control samples were compared with reference samples in acquire database and verified as acceptable prior to use of data from analysed batches laboratory quality control data including laboratory standards blanks duplicates repeats and grind size results are captured in the acquire database and assessed for accuracy and precision for recent data extended quality control programs including pulp samples submitted to an umpire laboratory and combined with more extensive re submission programs have been completed analysis of the available quality control sample assay results indicates that an acceptable level of accuracy and precision has been achieved and the database contains no analytical data that has been numerically manipulated the assaying techniques and quality control protocols used are considered appropriate for the data to be used for reporting exploration drilling results verification of sampling and assaying sampling intervals defined by the geologist are electronically assigned sample identification numbers prior to core cutting corresponding sample numbers matching pre labelled calico bags are assigned to each interval all sampling and assay information were stored in a secure acquire database with restricted access electronically generated sample submission forms providing the sample identification number accompany each submission to the laboratory assay results from the laboratory with corresponding sample identification are loaded directly into the acquire database assessment of reported significant assay intervals was verified by re logging of diamond drill core intervals and assessment of high resolution core photography the verification of significant intersections has been completed by company personnel and the competent person qualified person no adjustments are made to assay data and no twinned holes have been completed there are no currently known drilling sampling recovery or other factors that could materially affect the accuracy or reliability of the data location of data points drill collar locations were surveyed using a differential gps with gnss with a stated accuracy of 0 5m for all drill holes reported drill rig alignment was attained using an electronic azimuth aligner downhole survey was collected at 6 12m intervals in the cover sequence and every 6 to 30m in diamond drill core segments of the drill hole using single shot axis mining champ gyro the single shot surveys have been validated using continuous survey to surface axis mining champ along with a selection of drill holes re surveyed by an external survey contactor using a devigyro tool confirming sufficient accuracy for downhole spatial recording a lidar survey was completed over the project area in nov 2019 which was used to prepare a dem topographic model for the project with a spatial accuracy of 0 1m vertical and 0 3m horizontal the topography is generally low relief to flat elevation within the dune corridors in ranges between 250 265m australian height datum ahd steepening to the southeast all collar coordinates are provided in the geocentric datum of australian gda20 zone 51 all relative depth information is reported in ahd 5000m data spacing and distribution within the south east crescent and breccia zone drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 100m to 50 by 50m within the initial resource extents outside the initial resource boundary drill hole spacing ranges from 50 to 200m in lateral extent within the breccia zone over an area of 2km2 the data spacing is sufficient to establish the degree of geological and grade continuity significant assay intercepts remain open further drilling is required to determine the extent of currently defined mineralisation no sample compositing is applied to samples drilling intersects mineralisation at various angles orientation of data in relation to geological structure drill holes exploring the extents of the havieron mineral system intersect moderately dipping carbonate and siliclastic sedimentary facies mineralised breccia and sub vertical intrusive lithologies geological modelling has been interpreted from historic and newcrest drill holes variable brecciation alteration and sulphide mineralisation is observed with a footprint with dimensions of 650m x 350m trending in a north west orientation and over 1000m in vertical extent below cover the subvertical southeast high grade arcuate crescent sulphide zone has an average thickness of 20m and has been defined over a strike length of up to 550m and extended to over 700m in vertical extent below cover drilling direction is oriented to intersect the steeply dipping high grade sulphide mineralisation zones at an intersection angle of greater than 40 degrees the drilled length of reported intersections is typically greater than true width of mineralisation sample security the security of samples is controlled by tracking samples from drill rig to database drill core was delivered from the drill rig to the havieron core yard every shift on completion of geological and geotechnical logging core processing was completed by newcrest personnel at the havieron facility high resolution core photography and cutting of drill core was undertaken at the havieron core processing facilities samples were freighted in sealed bags by air and road to the laboratory and in the custody of newcrest representatives sample numbers are generated directly from the database all samples are collected in pre numbered calico bags verification of sample numbers and identification is conducted by the laboratory on receipt of samples and sample receipt advise issued to newcrest details of all sample movement are recorded in a database table dates hole id sample ranges and the analytical suite requested are recorded with the dispatch of samples to analytical services any discrepancies logged at the receipt of samples into the analytical services are validated audits or reviews internal reviews of core handling sample preparation and assays laboratories were conducted on a regular basis by both project personnel and owner representatives in the competent person s opinion the sample preparation security and analytical procedures are consistent with current industry standards and are entirely appropriate and acceptable for the styles of mineralisation identified and will be appropriate for use in the reporting of exploration results and mineral resource estimates there are no identified drilling sampling or recovery factors that

san ramon calif ap pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles 16 000 kilometers of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation across drought stricken california the daunting project announced wednesday aims to bury about 10 of pg e s distribution and transmission lines at a projected cost of 15 billion to as much as 30 billion based on how much the process currently costs the utility believes it will find ways to keep the final bill at the lower end of those estimates most of the costs will likely be shouldered by pg e customers whose electricity rates are already among the highest in the u s pg e stepped up its safety commitment just days after informing regulators a 70 foot 23 meter pine tree that toppled on one of its power lines ignited a major fire in butte county the same rural area about 145 miles 233 kilometers northeast of san francisco where another fire sparked by its equipment in 2018 killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands of homes since it started july 13 in a remote area of butte county the dixie fire has churned northeast through the sierra nevada by wednesday the fire spanned a 133 square mile 344 square kilometer area forcing the plumas county sheriff on wednesday to order evacuations along the west shore of popular lake almanor the backlash to pg e s potential liability for the dixie fire prompted the company s recently hired ceo patricia patti poppe to unveil the plan for underground lines several months earlier than she said she planned previous pg e regimes have staunchly resisted plans to bury long stretches of power lines because of the massive expense involved but poppe told reporters on wednesday that she quickly realized after she joined pg e in january that moving lines underground is the best way to protect both the utility and the 16 million people who rely on it for power it s too expensive not to do it lives are on the line poppe told reporters pg e said only that burying the lines will take several years however getting the job done within the next decade will require a quantum leap in the few areas where pg e has already been burying power lines it has been completing about 70 miles 123 kilometers annually pg e expects to eventually be able to bury more than 1 000 miles 1 600 kilometers of power lines annually said its chief operating officer adam wright while wright likened the project to the marshall plan that helped rebuild europe after world war ii poppe invoked president john f kennedy s 1962 pledge for the u s to land on the moon pg e s path to this point has been strewn with death and destruction after previous leaders allowed its equipment to fall into disrepair in a apparent attempt to boost profits and management bonuses the utility s grid was blamed for igniting a series of devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that prompted the company to file for bankruptcy in 2019 the biggest fire in butte county wiped out the entire town of paradise and resulted in pg e pleading guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter last year just weeks before it emerged from one of the most complex cases in u s history as part of its bankruptcy pg e set up a 13 5 billion trust to pay victims of its past wildfires but that fund is facing a roughly 2 billion shortfall because half its money is supposed to come from company stock that has been a market laggard since getting out of bankruptcy pg e also has been rebuked by california power regulators and a federal judge overseeing its criminal probation for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the utility has also been charged with another round of fire related crimes that it denies committing poppe insisted things are getting better this year under a plan that calls for pg e to spend 1 4 billion removing more than 300 000 trees and trimming another 1 1 million but she conceded the utility is not making enough progress since it s only a fraction of that 8 million trees within striking distance of its power lines but she also defended pg e s handling of the tree that may have caused the dixie fire and its response the tree looked healthy and was about 40 feet 12 meters from power lines she said making it a low risk danger when a pg e troubleshooter was sent out to inspect a potential problem he noticed the tree had fallen and may have started a fire in a treacherous area that he tried to put out before firefighters arrived his efforts can be called nothing less than heroic poppe said copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

of the ufp family of companies for your incredible effort when the company is successful we share that success with our teammates and we are grateful to share over 10 million in additional benefits and bonuses with our hourly employees for the first six months of 2021 to thank them for their exceptional effort too you have seen a truly remarkable financial performance and mike will provide more analysis shortly i would like to highlight a few items while providing some insight into the balance of 2021 we saw more records in the second quarter than the grammys yet our team is not focused on receiving awards for them it is about competing improving growing our people and opportunities and making our company stronger they had a grand slam in the second quarter we can t talk about q2 without acknowledging the significant impact of the lumber market we had top line help from a rising lumber market during the first half of the quarter however the last half saw a drastic drop in lumber prices which made an impact on our retail variable priced products while we had anticipated a market reduction in that late second or third quarter we did not anticipate that it would fall as far and as fast as it did included in our quarterly results was a charge of 23 million to reduce the value of inventory on certain of our variable priced products in our retail segment since the southern yellow pine market has dropped nearly a 1 000 per 1 000 in the last several weeks the impact would have been much worse if not for the skill and dedication of our purchasing and operations teams who managed inventories very well under the circumstances this lumber market drop also highlighted another benefit of our new structure as our teams were able to coordinate movements of inventory and maximize utilization of on hand items to limit the impact of the market decline thanks to our balanced business model diverse product and customer mix and a variety of pricing methodologies we are well positioned to weather these kinds of events as we have discussed on many occasions these diverse markets and pricing methodologies enables us to create a natural hedge against lumber market fluctuations like we just experienced last fall when prices were rising the retail segment benefited overall while the industrial and construction segment to suffered going forward for the balance of 2021 we expect that retail will lag while construction and industrial will benefit we expect the lumber market to normalize and believe that mills will try to balance inventories to match demand we believe the lumber market is trading today within the range where it should remain for the next 30 to 60 days with slight fluctuations since most of the lumber products are sold under agreements between suppliers and customers a significantly smaller volume is actively traded and reported via random lengths and other market reporting services therefore this metric is subject to more fluctuation and it is less reflective of the overall lumber market than it used to be certain products such as osb remained tight however diy demand is not as robust as it was a year ago while professionals are still very busy and maintaining robust purchases for their businesses many believe that diy demand is paused due to other pursuits such as vacations and travel which were severely curtailed due to the lockdowns in 2020 overall however we remain confident in our original targets for the year a quick review by market shows that our retail solutions team was the most impacted by the lumber market decline the segment recorded a 6 decline in unit sales versus a year ago looking at retail business units the prowood unit sales were down 17 as demand returned to more normalized levels from a significantly higher sales in q2 of 2020 the sunbelt team has done a great job growing their business and more recently integrating the acquisition of spartanburg forest products we have been impressed with their treating operations and quality and have worked together to target synergies in our purchasing and administrative areas this team suffered the most from the lumber market drop as customer orders did not match customer forecast ufp edge our siding pattern and trim business unit was up 27 in unit sales as new capacity came online during the quarter more capacity will be added in q4 and early in 2022 to meet expected demand for our high quality finishing services and our pattern and trim products the deckorators unit sales increased 11 over record q2 2020 levels the patented deckorators voyage and vault mineral based composite products continue to grow their fan base among contractors as the strength to weight ratio product flexibility and ease of installation make it a preferred product as a result the production is sold out through year end and as previously disclosed additional mineral based capacity will be coming online starting in november of 21 and by the end of 22 we will have doubled the mineral based capacity our wood plastic composite line is sold out through november with additional capacity coming online in 2022 which will add around 30 to 35 more capacity in those product lines deckorators continue to feel some of the impacts of higher resin and transportation costs in q2 while passing along some of these costs to customers during the quarter handprint the new home and decor business unit formally known as dimensions will be rolling out its new website in late q3 and will be adding to its ready to make craft and product and project line of products handprint continues to gain more sales volume with its cut to size product offering for building materials retailers too outdoor essentials has expanded its fencing range to include a variety of materials including aluminum and composite it is also unveiling a new raised planter for 2022 specifically targeted for customers e commerce portals moving to the ufp construction segment unit sales increased 29 over the second quarter of 2020 strong single family residential demand continues in the geographic markets we serve and multi family remains solid and may even begin to expand again as developers who held off due to high prices reengage as commodity prices normalize steel products such as the connectors used in our trust manufacturing remain in short supply due in part to overseas shipping constraints unit sales to the factory built business unit rose 56 as strong demand continues the robust growth in factory built reflects the growing recognition that it is an authentic and much needed affordable housing option and our factory built team has been working hard to meet this need our team continues to grow its new product portfolio for the factory built market and we should see growing new product sales units by q4 and several new product lines the factory built customers have also seen shortages in certain items such as appliances and other items using microchips which has moderated their growth somewhat unit sales to the site built customers rose 32 in the quarter the customers in this business unit are bullish on the market and have been very complimentary of the ability of our teams to supply product in this challenging market they re also imploring us to add more capacity to serve their growing needs unit sales to the commercial construction unit rose 11 more importantly our commercial business unit was profitable in q2 and focused on improving margins and rationalizing customer concentration we continued to position the commercial business unit for significant improvements in performance and have been refining our customer mix to ensure that we do not work for free or worse yet pay a customer to do work for them our concrete forming business unit continues to grow the team has been offering new solutions to its customers and expanding its supply network geographically we expect continued organic growth in this market and are looking at potential targeted acquisitions as well ufp industrial segment grew unit sales 73 over lockdown impacted 2020 organic growth accounted for 26 of unit sales growth acquisitions led by palletone t r and pallet usa comprised 47 of the unit growth the assimilation and integration of these acquisitions is going very well operationally both tnr and pallet usa have been part of the family for over a year and they ve been working well in their geographic regions palletone was a very large acquisition for us and the cultural fit has been incredibly good they have great team members and have a can do spirit and treat each other well they are also becoming an integral part of our industrial leadership team and the exchange of best practices has been exceptional we have already utilized the palletone experience with automation and technology to fuel our adoption in existing facilities and we expect that process to grow unit sales of protective packaging products our newest runway in industrial rose 53 in the quarter gross profit for the industrial segment rose 262 well in excess of unit sales growth and palletone made a big impact by contributing 54 of the increase in gross profit rationalizing capacity enhancing operating leverage and utilizing better analytics helped improve this gross profit return the industrial team is working together to drive increased automation consolidate capacity and utilization of its vast facility network to serve national and regional customers better new product sales increased to 232 1 million for the quarter and are 396 9 million year to date well in excess of our year to date budget we also launched our new innovation accelerator initiative in june and it will work with the business units to identify new product opportunities and rapidly design prototype and test them to increase our speed to market we have increased the breadth of products in each business unit but we need to be even faster to vet and bring these new products to consumers more quickly we continue to deploy capital targeted on automation and expansion to promote and invest in new products and technology and to develop our teams we have been forced to increase our spend on regulatory issues cyber security and other non value added requirements as well acquisitions remain a strategic growth initiative as we pursue targets in each segment with an emphasis on scalable and synergistic new products or services complementary value added products and core competencies our capital allocation strategy targets acquisitions at reasonable roi based values first followed by greenfield growth and automation and efficiency projects during the quarter we completed sunbelt s acquisition of spartanburg forest products which added scale to the sunbelt operations we expect to scale the endurable building products acquisition with our existing site build business unit geography as it adds adjacent product lines for both new and existing customers and our handprint unit added walnut hollow farm which introduces handprint to craft and decor customers and allows expansion through the existing manufacturing and distribution network of ufp retail given the number of automation opportunities available to us which help us become the low cost producer and grow our businesses we are adding an additional 25 million for capital expenditures in 2021 given long lead times for equipment most of the installations will not occur until late q4 or early q1 of 2022 labor continues to be a challenge as we have more than 500 open positions posted on a weekly basis in geographic areas where the states have eliminated the additional 300 a week bonus the labor market has loosened up somewhat in other areas where tax payers are subsidizing cash and benefits to the tune of nearly 20 an hour not surprisingly hard working employees are tougher to find however our hr teams and business operators have worked together to craft creative solutions for the markets where our facilities are located and by taking care of our strong performing team members using as one example i previously mentioned the 10 million and year to date bonuses and extra benefits paid to our hourly employees we hope to be able to alleviate challenges in finding and retaining talent we have expanded our recruiting to discover additional sources of employees and broaden our outreach to make sure that all demographic groups are aware of the opportunities for them at ufp and we have incentivized existing team members to recruit from their own network of friends and acquaintances now i d like to turn it over to mike cole who will provide more details on our financial performance michael r cole chief financial officer thanks matt and hello everyone our consolidated results this quarter are highlighted by unit sales growth of 47 including 11 organic growth and 36 growth from acquired businesses organic growth included 88 million of new product sales growth which continues to provide a margin lift for us and operating profits grew by 157 as acquisitions contributed 15 million in operating profit and 18 5 million in ebitda for the quarter now i ll review our income statement and sales by segment sales to the retail segment increased 107 consisting of a 59 increase in selling prices and a 52 unit increase from acquisitions offset by a 4 decrease in organic unit sales organic growth was impacted favorably by a 27 increase in ufp edge and 11 increase in deckorators and a 6 increase in outdoor essentials new product sales for the retail segment were also strong growing by over 32 unfortunately our prowood business unit reported a 17 decrease in units compared to last year reflecting a decline in demand as consumers shifted spending as a result of pandemic related restrictions being lifted and the economy being reopened sales to the industrial segment increased 172 consisting of a 99 increase in selling prices 26 organic unit growth and a 47 unit increase resulting from acquisitions year over year organic growth was strong due to the impact of the pandemic related restrictions last year and strong demand this year while market share gains from new customer and new product sales contributed 33 million and 27 million respectively to sales growth for this quarter finally our sales to the construction segment increased 106 consisting of a 77 increase in selling prices and 29 unit growth including a 3 contribution from acquisitions organic unit growth was driven by our factory built and site built housing business units which achieved 56 and 24 increases respectively our commercial business unit also achieved an 11 unit increase again these organic increases were largely due to the impact of the pandemic related restrictions last year and a strong demand environment this year moving down the income statement our second quarter gross profits increased by 216 million or 106 by segment retail increased by 39 million in spite of a 23 million reserve to reduce the value of our treated inventory to net realizable value at quarter end primarily in our new sunbelt and spartanburg business units industrial and construction gross profits increased by 97 million and 73 million respectively recent acquisitions contributed 3 million to retail 2 million to construction 23 million to industrial and 30 million to our overall increase in gross profits these increases resulted from a variety of factors including strong unit sales growth and leveraging fixed costs increased sales of value added and new products that have higher margins and more effectively adjusting for increases in lumber and other costs and our selling prices lumber prices that continue to fall and normalize will continue to impact our gross profits of commodity based products sold on a variable price primarily our treated lumber products that were not purchased through a vendor managed inventory program we anticipate that this will be more than offset by the benefit we experienced on the value added products sold on a fixed price primarily in our industrial and construction segments continuing to move down the income statement our sg a expenses increased by almost 71 million consisting of 15 million from recently acquired businesses a 33 million increase in bonus expense and a 9 million increase in sales incentives the remaining 14 million increase is primarily related to higher compensation and benefit costs and travel cost which have started to normalize finally our operating profits increased by 145 million which was comprised of a 16 million increase in retail a 64 million increase in industrial a 48 million increase in construction and an 8 million increase in international again acquisitions contributed 15 million to our operating profits primarily in our industrial segment moving on to our cash flow statement our cash flows used in operations for the year was 116 million and consisted of net earnings and non cash expenses totaling 328 million compared to 148 million last year and a 444 million increase in net working capital since the end of december of 2020 compared to 300 000 increase in the prior year reflecting strong market demand and record high lumber prices this year our people continue to do a great job managing our working capital efficiently as evidenced by our cash cycle which remains on pace with last year our investing activities include capital expenditures totaling 79 million including expansionary and efficiency capex of 42 million we re now planning for total capital expenditures for the year of 140 million which includes projects to expand our capacity to produce our mineral based and wood plastic composite decking products our ufp edge siding pattern and trim products expand our machine built pallet capacity and take advantage of automation opportunities and 433 million was spent on acquisitions so far for the year including the recent additions of spartanburg forest products walnut hollow and endurable building products this quarter lastly our financing activities include another 9 million of dividends paid this quarter at a rate of 0 15 a share a 20 increase in the rate over last year and net borrowings under our revolving credit facility totaling 260 million to finance the increase in our net working capital with respect to our balance sheet at the end of june our total debt net of cash was 562 million and our total liquidity was 288 million looking forward to q3 and q4 we expect our seasonal working capital investment of 444 million to be converted to cash as lumber prices and demand normalized leaving our liquidity and balance sheet in strong shape as the year progresses that s all i have in the financials matt matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you mike now i d like to open it up for any questions you may have questions and answers operator thank you our first question will come from stanley elliott with stifel please go ahead stanley elliott stifel analyst hey guys thank you all for taking the question and congratulations on another great quarter very nicely done can you talk on the deckorators business it sounded like that there was somewhat inventory constrained curious to kind of get your view a little bit of a step down from q1 but still very good numbers in terms of the units but just curious kind of what you re seeing in the marketplace there matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah we are still seeing very very strong demand and again i think we were kind of lapping year over year where we had capacity issue a year ago we were full up as i mentioned on the mineral based through the end of the year and on wood plastic composite in november so we re still feeling really good about the demand there obviously i mentioned a couple of cost challenges that i think will be rationalized out and so we should be able to get ahead of those certainly by the end of the third quarter so again very very optimistic about where we are there stanley elliott stifel analyst and when we think about kind of the working capital unwinding in the back part of the year it s going to be very nice boost with so many growth opportunities it sounds like that we could still see a fair amount of m a activity on the horizon matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i think that s one of our forefront ideas that s what we re trying to get accomplished here and again we want to make sure valuations are right and continue with our conservative approach to how we value and acquire companies but yeah definitely the pipeline is full there s a lot of opportunities out there and we just want to make sure we choose the right ones and the market for valuations is right stanley elliott stifel analyst perfect and then last from me any comments on the visibility that you re hearing from your construction customers as it relates to state projects moving forward other infrastructure projects moving forward matthew j missad chief executive officer we have not gotten a whole lot more insight into the kind of infrastructure type projects and maybe it s because i probably turned a little bit of a deaf here to some of that until it becomes a reality there s been talk about it for several years and as soon as something hits i think then it will become much more real but our concrete forming group is probably going to be the one that would be most impacted there in a positive way so we re hopeful that we end up with something that s reasonable and rational and that we can participate in it stanley elliott stifel analyst perfect guys thank you very much appreciate the time and best of luck matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you operator thank you our next question will come from kurt yinger with d a davidson please go ahead kurt yinger d a davidson analyst yeah good afternoon matt mike and dick matthew j missad chief executive officer hi kurt michael r cole chief financial officer hey kurt kurt yinger d a davidson analyst hey just a couple of questions here i mean first you touched on customers and site built looking to you perhaps at capacity i think in the past that s been an area where you ve been kind of cautious growing the footprint given the cyclicality has that changed at all and do you feel like in this type of environment the adoption of component solutions can be more significant than it has been in the past matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah kurt i still think there is opportunities for us to convert there s maybe not as many people that are doing total stick framing but our floor cassette roof trusses wall panels selling more components is definitely where we want to go and i think that s the capacity they are looking for as labor is tight particularly skilled labor in the field so we re still going to be cautious about it but if we have good insight into both the customer s plan and our own ability to service it there ll be areas that we will continue to expand again we re trying to keep it within our basic geography that we re in today we want to still stay away from the old the so called boom and bust markets but where we are today i think a very steady stable type markets kurt yinger d a davidson analyst got it okay that s helpful and then obviously it was a great 2020 but your commentary this afternoon seems to be more cautious than we ve heard previously in terms of the repair and remodel and diy side just curious how recently you ve maybe seen some deterioration there and are you concerned at all that this is more than just a tough comp situation and that the market could really start to slow down quite a bit matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i think i tried to outline the differences there the professional builder or contractor they re is still extremely busy and so that indicates the demand is solid i do think diy we can discuss whether they pulled forward from sales in 2020 from future years or if it was because people are locked down at home and they just did more projects so i think it will normalize what i m trying to convey mostly is that we just had a blowout quarter and i m trying to moderate people s expectations relative to repeating that type of quarter kurt yinger d a davidson analyst got it okay that makes sense and then on the idx in commercial construction businesses what type of progress have you made there in terms of getting that business back to breakeven and are you seeing any green shoots in terms of pent up demand or new quoting activity anything along those lines matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i think there has been a really fundamental shift as we ve tried to focus on it and that team has been working extremely hard trying to get the ship rightsized i d say and in terms of both looking at and analyzing their customer base their margin profiles for those customers and what i would call the imbalance where the customer had historically held most of the leverage and us taking the position that we need to be able to make money as i mentioned in my remarks we need to be able to make money in order to stay in business so we ve changed our pricing methodology and we probably have lost a few customers along the way but that s the right thing to do so they are running at a profitable rate here for the last couple of months and we anticipate that will continue so it s a big turnaround we re still not there yet but they are on the right path and i really thank them for all the effort that they ve put forth kurt yinger d a davidson analyst okay all right that s encouraging and then just last one from me kind of higher level i mean over with the performance over the last year and some of the benefits from the rise in the lumber market i think there s been a lot of concern here that has that s rolled over you will give a lot of it back but i think mike said that with the trend you re seeing in lumber you expect the benefits from the fixed price products to kind of outweigh the headwinds you might see on the variable side could you just maybe walk through some of the other puts and takes there as we think about the back half of the year and into 2022 i mean is the comp issue associated with lumber in your view a much smaller issue than it seems to be to people you talk to or at least in terms of maybe what the stock might suggest matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i think the way that i would encourage folks to look at at least our company is we try to focus on unit sales sales dollars is going to is not going to be a good comparable because in the lumber market pricing impacts so much of that but if we look at unit sales and more particularly gross profit dollars on a per unit basis and overall that s kind of where i would focus the attention and we feel good about that as you mentioned the fixed price and mike talked about fixed price items in industrial and construction and they actually had a headwind a year ago as prices were rising so they ll have hopefully a little bit more of a tailwind this year with the lower price levels so and the question is how does that balance off against the challenges that retail will face from the declining market in that area so we feel good overall as i mentioned i think we feel very comfortable with our original forecast for the year but i think as we look at the different stress points and the different margins within the segments that s what we would expect to see kurt yinger d a davidson analyst okay all right well i appreciate all the color and good luck here in q3 guys matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you michael r cole chief financial officer thanks kurt operator thank you our next question will come from jay mccanless with wedbush securities please go ahead jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst hey good afternoon great quarter guys matthew j missad chief executive officer thanks jay jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst i guess the first question on prowood have you ever communicated or try to find out from the field what the split for the sales on that or for do it yourself versus contractors installing those decks matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah it s really really difficult to do i think in prior years i d say 10 years ago actually jay was probably a little easier to do because the big box retailers were primarily diy and right now all the big box retailers have been pushing more to the pro customer so it s kind of blurred that line we can kind of tell who our independent retail customers are that generally serve the professionals and the contractors but we haven t been able to really nor have we necessarily try to get out the detail level at the big box jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay all right and then the next question i had just maybe give me a little more of you re supporting i guess ideas that lumber prices are going to be able to stabilize at these levels is the transportation issues candidly getting better or you re seeing a little bit better delivery of wood in the south just maybe because we hear so much in the media about all these transportation issues and supply chain issues just what are you seeing that makes you feel like lumber prices can stabilize here because with the puts and takes of the acquisitions in there getting at least getting close on the lumber price would certainly help matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah that s an excellent question and i m not sure i got a great answer for you on that what i would say is that transportation issues are still there they ve moderated quite a bit i think the international transportation issues are still a bigger problem bigger challenge but i would say the production side on the mill side has improved the demand takeaway hasn t been as great as originally forecast particularly at retail and i think that s created a little breathing room in the marketplace i think a lot of retailers had considerable amounts of inventory in their supply chain and that the takeaway being not as great has really opened up a lot of product availability again certain items are still tight but i d say overall there is a good supply right now jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay and then just digging down on that retailers i mean do you feel like the retailers are overstocked right now or is the sell through sufficient to keep you guys maybe not up in terms of units year over year but at least flat to slightly negative matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i would say it is tough to paint them all with a broad brush i think they all had from strategies in terms of what their purchasing strategy was so some wanted to commit early and make sure they have supply given last year when they ran out of supply so i would say that overall i think your last statement is accurate though in terms of how we would look at unit sales takeaway jay mccanless wedbush securities analyst okay all right that sounds great thanks guys matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you operator thank you and our next question will come from ketan mamtora with bmo capital markets please go ahead ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst hi can you hear me matthew j missad chief executive officer yes ketan ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst hey matthew j missad chief executive officer we thought you did a mic drop ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst sorry about that matt and mike congrats on a very strong quarter matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst first question maybe to start off on the industrial side very strong performance there especially on the gross profit side two part question maybe talk a little bit around from a unit sales standpoint where you are seeing areas of strength and products where you are seeing increased traction i know kind of one of the focus areas has been kind of growing on the mixed material side so with some of the acquisitions you ve done maybe talk about kind of where you are seeing the most traction and then obviously great performance on the gross profit side talk a little bit about kind of where you ve been able to make the most progress matthew j missad chief executive officer well there s a lot to unpack in those questions there ketan so i ll try to hit the high points so on the industrial side the industrial teams have been doing just an outstanding job what they ve been focused on is providing more value added customer oriented solutions and as you will recall historically we started out selling sticks and panels to people who made their own crates and packaging materials and that s been a constant goal of ours as to continue to convert those types of customers to customers who will buy our complete value added program and i think they ve done an outstanding job of that they ve also utilized their own pricing analytics and tools to make sure that again as we mentioned before with some of the commercial things let s make sure that we re properly getting paid for the value that we provide and i think they ve done really really nice work in that area as well so i think on industrial that is part of their strategic plan and they ve just had really really good execution overall i think again it s a tale of the different markets and so if you look at construction and industrial you ve seen improvement and enhancement there and a lot of its efficiency in terms of getting utilization and operating leverage pickups too but lumber market certainly helps there retail is the one that we ve already talked enough about that one so they were hitting it out of the park last year and we don t expect that to happen this year but we still expect it to be strong ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst got it and then sticking with industrial obviously on the pricing side it was a big help almost 100 year over year increase as we look into the back half of the year and i know that you all don t provide specific guidance but i m just trying to understand what is the right way to think about it especially given how sharply prices lumber prices have fallen over the last eight weeks can you just help us kind of help us frame what is the right way to think about it matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah i think mike and i have talked a lot about that i ll kind of turn it over to mike i think there some examples and metrics that you can probably look to that will help guide you there mike can you michael r cole chief financial officer yeah there is a natural lag in the pricing for on the industrial side on the fixed price side for one reason is because you got to sell through that inventory that you bought in order to be able to supply the customer so there is just kind of a natural lag that occurs that helps us and we would expect that as a result of that lag that s really going to help us offset in the construction and the industrial side with what s going to occur on the retail side with more variable priced product i think the other thing that s happening though is there is a lot of pricing rationalization i think that s occurred throughout the company just making sure now as we re able to add more value and provide more solutions for our customers we re making sure we re getting paid for it in our prices and so there is all those activities that are going on which i think sets up for industrial and construction in particular a nice healthy operating margin environment in the back half of the year ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst understood and then shifting to the retail side i m just curious we ve there is it seems like on the treated lumber side there is some easing in demand we ve seen a sharp drop in lumber prices as well i m just curious are you seeing any signs of having any ripple effects on the composite decking side from what i heard in your prepared remarks matt it seemed like that demand is still pretty strong but i m curious if you are starting to see signs for at least in sort of q4 and into next year of having any impact on composite decking demand matthew j missad chief executive officer yeah maybe i could kind of frame it in a slightly different way ketan so as i look at the composite products that we provide more and more of those are do it for me projects as opposed to do it yourself projects they re spending a lot more money on them and they want to make sure it s done right so what we re seeing with the composite is consistent with that and what we re seeing on the diy side for the prowood decking for example that s much more of a do it yourself type project people feel comfortable doing that and it s kind of consistent with the overall theme that says hey maybe people are taking a pause and they re going on vacation and they re doing other things now that they are able to do it so i don t see anything that says the composite demand is going to fall off again absent some other kind of change in the economy that isn t obvious today so ketan mamtora bmo capital markets analyst got it that s very helpful i ll turn it over good luck in the back half of the year matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you ketan operator thank you and speakers i am showing no further questions in the queue at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to you for any further remarks matthew j missad chief executive officer thank you as we look ahead we expect that unlike mr bezos with 11 minutes of heavens which ended when he landed on the earth the ufp team will continue its incredible focus adjust to the economic changes that inevitably will come our way and to perform our plans our business model helps chart the course but our talented and experienced teammates are the ones responsible for our ultimate success whether it s crazy lumber market unpredictable government or an ohtani curveball i m confident that we will win

quick overview of the second quarter revenue in the quarter was 4 6 billion an increase of 7 sequentially and 41 year over year driven by strong demand in industrial automotive and personal electronics on a sequential basis analog grew 6 and embedded processing grew 2 on a year over year basis analog grew 42 and embedded grew 43 our other segment grew 30 from the year ago quarter moving on given the current environment again this quarter i ll provide some insight into our second quarter revenue by end market and comment on our lead times first the industrial market was up mid teens sequentially and up about 40 from the year ago the strength was seen across most sectors the automotive market grew sequentially following the strong first quarter 2021 and more than doubled from a weak year ago compare personal electronics was about even sequentially and up about 25 compared to a year ago the strength was broad based across sectors and customers within personal electronics next communications equipment was up low single digits sequentially and was down upper teens from the year ago enterprise systems grew upper teens sequentially and was about even from the year ago regarding lead times the majority of our products continue to remain steady however the growing demand in the second quarter of 2021 again expanded our list of hotspots which required extending some lead times as planned we continue to add incremental capacity in 2021 and first half of 2022 with additional support from the start up of our third 300 millimeter wafer fab rfab2 that will come online in the second half of 2022 as discussed during our capital management review in february our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology delivers the benefits of lower cost and greater control of our supply chain which really shows through in a market environment like this rafael will now review profitability capital management and our outlook rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations thanks dave and good afternoon everyone as dave mentioned second quarter revenue was 4 6 billion up 41 from a year ago gross profit in the quarter was 3 1 billion or 67 of revenue from a year ago gross profit margin increased 290 basis points operating expenses in the quarter were 816 million up 5 from a year ago and about as expected on a trailing 12 month basis operating expenses were 19 of revenue over the last 12 months we have invested 1 6 billion in r d acquisition charges and non cash expense were 48 million in the second quarter and are related to the national semiconductor acquisition this acquisition charges will remain at about this level through the third quarter of 2021 and then go to zero operating profit was 2 2 billion in the quarter or 48 of revenue operating profit was up 80 from the year ago quarter net income in the second quarter was 1 9 billion or 2 05 per share which included a 0 06 benefit that was not in our prior outlook due to the signing of our royalty agreement let me now comment on our capital management results starting with our cash generation cash flow from operations was 2 1 billion in the quarter

below desired levels in the second quarter we signed an agreement to acquire micron s 300 millimeter fab in lehi utah this investment continue to strengthen our competitive advantage in manufacturing and technology and its part of our long term capacity planning the lehi fab will be our fourth 300 millimeter fab dmos6 rfab1 and soon to be completed rfab2 in our wafer fab manufacturing operations we continue to believe that our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology will be of growing importance in owning and controlling our supply chain for the third quarter we expect ti revenue in the range of 4 40 billion to 4 76 billion and earnings per share to be in the range of 1 87 to 2 13 we continue to expect our annual operating tax rate to be about 14 in closing we continue to invest to strengthen our competitive advantages and in making our business stronger with that let me turn it back to dave dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations thanks rafael operator you can now open the lines up for questions in order to provide as many of you as possible the opportunity to ask a question please limit yourself to a single question after our response we ll provide you an opportunity for an additional follow up operator questions and answers operator thank you and we ll go first to vivek arya of bank of america vivek arya bank of america analyst thanks for taking my question rafael and dave when i look at the last few quarters your reported sales have been significantly above your guided range and i mean like between 5 to 13 above your original outlook and that s just making it very hard to distinguish right between how to read your guidance because even now you re guiding to a flattish outlook and what s supposed to be a seasonally stronger quarter should we take that to be conservatism should we take that to be a peaking in the cycle and how is it that the demand is so strong you re increasing supply but yet your sales outlook is very flattish i think it s a very confusing message and i would love your insights into how to interpret your guidance are we reading them in the right way dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations yes vivek thanks for the question i think first i d say perhaps normal seasonal patterns may not be the best measure to look at things in periods like this certainly the last few quarters we would all agree have been unusual periods that we ve gone through and as we continue to move through so and as you said the last few quarters have been exceptionally strong second quarter was certainly strong both sequentially and year on year so if you look at our guidance it would suggest that next quarter will again be a very strong quarter so and as you know our guidance is the best estimate that we have at this time so that s what we try to do and try to give you that insight do you have a follow on vivek arya bank of america analyst yes thanks dave so from what you said i assume that you are again implying conservatism unless you re suggest otherwise my real question is when i look at the share buyback activity it s been very low in the last few quarters and there are only a few reasons why that would be right one is the simplest reason that maybe the stock is perhaps not attractive at these valuations or it could be that you re preparing for some m a or is it some large capex or some caution about macro i m trying to understand why is there such a material shift in terms of your return of free cash flow strategy right we understand the dividend part has been very strong but the share buyback activity has been very low over the last almost a year now so just appreciate your views as to why you are not buying back your stock at the pace at which you have historically done so thank you rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations no i m happy to address that one vivek so first let me take you back to how we think about cash return and you know us very well you follow us for many years and you ve heard us talk about this during capital management year in and year out and our objective when it comes to cash return is to return all free cash flow to the owners of the company we do that through dividends as well as buybacks now that that has never meant and doesn t mean that every single quarter or even every single year where that return is going to be exactly 100 right if you look at our history over 15 plus years it has been actually above 100 so that shows our commitment to that and that commitment has not changed we are committed to returning all free cash flow to the owners of the company over time dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations great thank you vivek and we ll go to the next caller please operator and the next caller will be toshiya hari of goldman sachs toshiya hari goldman sachs analyst hi guys thanks so much for taking the question i had two as well i guess one clarification dave i think when you talked about automotive you set up sequentially in the second quarter did i catch that right did you not give a specific number for automotive dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations that s correct it was up low single digits toshiya hari goldman sachs analyst okay got it dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations do you have a follow on toshiya hari goldman sachs analyst yes so in terms of gross margins i realize you guys don t run the business management business for gross margins but clearly you had a very very strong quarter in q2 and i know you don t guide gross margins going forward but based on how you re thinking about utilization rates in your factories given what you know about pricing in your business both on the analog side as well as the embedded side going forward how are you thinking about gross margins and kind of the opex leverage going forward in your business thank you rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations yes no so first let me emphasize a point you made we do not focus on gross margins and how we run the business just like you said our focus is on free cash flow generation in fact free cash flow per share and how we can grow that over the long term right because we think ultimately that is what drives value for the owners of the company and you can do that at 67 margin you can do it at a lower margin you can do it at a higher margin depends on a number of factors so and then to answer your specific question as we have always guided over the long term not any one quarter or even any one year but over the long term 70 to 75 fall through is the right way to generally speak in the right way to look at the model of the company as we go forward so as you put whatever revenue expectation you have there and fall that through at about that rate and you will be in the ballpark dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations okay thank you toshiya we ll consider that two questions if that s ok we ll move on to our next caller operator and the next caller is going to be stacy rasgon of bernstein research stacy rasgon bernstein research analyst hi guys thanks for taking my question so i know you don t think about running the business to gross margins but i m going to ask a gross margin question anyways and do your 65 2 obviously you did very stronger this quarter but you said you had 0 06 of royalties that was unexpected that should have been about 1 4 points of gross margins as i understand it if i do the math right and i think you had something like 50 million in austin cost last quarter that should have rolled off this quarter that would have been another 100 basis points give or take so i m actually wondering why gross margins were in fact if i take out the royalties they would have been up 60 basis points only with 100 basis points of cost it should have rolled off with a massive revenue increase like what s going on with what happened with gross margins in the current quarter given all of that rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations so stacy i let me address one and then i have to ask your question i didn t quite understand part of your question but stacy rasgon bernstein research analyst or maybe royalties working gross margins maybe they weren t rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations the factories that s the part i didn t ok so you are assuming royalty okay so let me address that first we took out royalty used to be in revenue and gross margin but that was years ago i think three or four years ago we dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations yes rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations yes we moved that to other income and expense so that is in that line other income expense so it has nothing to do with margins it has been for three or four years or so since we and the reason we moved that is it is very de minimis it s a relatively small amount it averages about 100 million a year of course in the big scheme of things given our revenue level it s a relatively small amount and we expect that to be continue to be small going forward on the other part of your question so last quarter we had about a 50 million hit to our gross margins that was because of the winter storm in texas we did talk about that during the call we mentioned it and that was all in gross margin so yes you can adjust that you can you guys just however you wish for fourth quarter to get you the gross margin without that impact right and that may make more sense when you look at the trends stacy rasgon bernstein research analyst yes dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations does that answer your question stacy rasgon bernstein research analyst yes no that s very helpful thank you rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations i think you have a second you still have a follow up or stacy rasgon bernstein research analyst so my follow up yes you re guiding revenues flat and you re guiding eps down slightly so either gross margins are going down or opex is going up normally opex i think seasonally into q3 would be down a few points i guess are you expecting any sort of different opex trends into q3 as you would normally see like in a normal q3 is there or something else going on because normally it s down sequentially rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations yes well so the reason that eps is moving at the midpoint is the royalty that we just talked about right so you just take out that 0 06 from the eps that we just delivered you get to a more normalized eps without that royalty and then compare that to the next quarter and you ll see that there s nothing unusual there obviously we only give revenue and eps range but there was some unusual in between the lines we would pointed out and there s nothing unusual yes nothing is changing much between the other lines right yes ok thank you stacy and we ll go to the next caller please operator and next we have john pitzer of credit suisse john pitzer credit suisse analyst yes good afternoon guys thanks for letting me ask the question dave and rafael i just want to go back to the revenue guidance sort of flat at the midpoint with down sequentially i guess i m just trying to wrap my head around the fact that your deficiencies kind of increased in the june quarter you said you re hotspots went up it sounds like demand is still relatively strong and yet there is a part of your guidance that could be down sequentially which i m having a hard time grasping dave maybe you can talk about end markets are there any end markets that particularly looked like they re cooling off sequentially into the calendar third quarter or why the down sequential i think i have to go back to quite a bit of time to see you guys have a flat to down sequential q3 dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations and john when you say down sequentially just to clarify are you saying that part of our range would imply that could be down and the other part would imply that it will be up john pitzer credit suisse analyst yes dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations that s what that s just to clarify that part of the question i got you yes so yes john if there is something that s unusual going on within end market or region or product area we ve always provided insight into that to help understand an outlook or even something that s happened in the current quarter i ll just say there is nothing unusual like that that we feel that we would need to explain what s going on i think that as i mentioned earlier to vivek s question on the topic seasonality probably isn t the best thing to be looking at as we ve been moving through the last few quarters and i would say with that range implies that the revenue still will be will still be strong so you have a follow on john pitzer credit suisse analyst yes just as my follow on on rfab2 i m just curious with the proposed purchase of lehi should we think about sort of the building going on as planned the pilot line going on as planned but capacity at rfab2 kind of slowed or how do we think about kind of now your mix of capacity as lehi comes in next year and what that means for capex and the ramp of rfab2 rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations yes no let me tell you about that so first let me step back remind everyone objective when it comes to capex is to invest to support new technology development and revenue growth and specifically extending our low cost manufacturing advantage primarily 300 millimeter right so we have talked about that for a long time and its a core part of our strides one of our competitive advantages having that manufacturing and technology advantage rfab2 will be the third 300 millimeter factory lehi will be our fourth 300 millimeter factory rfab2 will become operational sometime in the middle of next year that s when the shell will be completed and then we ll be deploying equipment there and then we re incurring capex because of that so capex as i said at the last call will be higher both in absolute dollars and as percent of revenue because of that and then on top of that as lehi right which we didn t have last quarter when we had talked when we had the earnings call so now lehi is going to be on top of that that s 900 million purchase price which will run through capex but then in addition to that factory is ready for production once we qualify it but at relatively low volumes we still have to add capex at factory to take it to the volumes that we want and that will happen over time and think of that that capex is probably going to be is probably going to run about half of what rfab2 capex will run and i m talking over years right as we deploy equipment there and both of those will add to the strength or will strengthen our competitive advantage of manufacturing and technology with two more 300 millimeter factories dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations okay thank you john and we ll go to the next caller please operator and that will be blayne curtis of barclays blayne curtis barclays analyst hey thanks for taking the question i just want to ask on i know you re not going to probably guide december but just kind of any feel you can for that quarter obviously seasonality has been out the window typically a down quarter just trying to get a better handle on the back half year obviously the flattening market but at much higher levels anything you can throw out there for december dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations yes blayne and certainly i know there is lots of speculations on how long the strong demand will last and certainly we ve read the ranges that it s going to end soon and others that say it is going to continue for quite some time and obviously as you stated we re not going to forecast the fourth quarter or even comment on how long the cycle last because honestly as you know we don t know i don t think anyone knows but i think we can frame how the actions that we ve taken and our approach as we ve gone through the cycle and in the first phase you ve seen us accelerate into the widely anticipated decline and that really enabled us to gain ground and really in the second phase we re working to ensure that we gain strategic ground particularly in industrial and automotive and that those gains will reward us for years to come and independent of that we re investing for the long term so some of the obvious things that you can see are the new manufacturing investments in rfab2 if you re down here in texas you ll see cranes up over the building i think i counted six or seven at the max that were up over that the additional lehi some of the less visible ones are the r d investments and new capabilities at ti com and those investments are continuing so we won t we ll go through cycles we won t be able to predict it but we can make the place stronger we can continue to invest in our competitive advantages so do you have follow on blayne curtis barclays analyst yes i just wanted to ask you on inventory levels obviously way down at these sales levels on a days inventory but your ability to grow that absolute amount and if you re able to do that in the september rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations i ll start and dave you want to follow up but inventory levels first let me remind everyone the objective there maintain high levels of customer satisfaction while minimizing obsolescence which frankly is not an issue given our business model we are clearly below desired levels just like we said during the prepared remarks right we re running about 111 days and our target is 130 to 190 days that s part of the reason why we have the hotspots that we talked about at the same time i ll tell you we go back to second quarter last year when the pandemic was starting in fact march of last year everybody all our competitors were decreasing their inventory levels slowing down factories we went the other way right we maintained and in fact increased our production levels we increased our inventory levels they went from about 140 days to 160 some 170 days almost and that along with our business strategy our business model helped to put us in a great position to take advantage of the situation and has helped us do significantly better than our competitors over the last three or four quarters right but we have gotten to a point where things are inventory is now below desired levels we will continue to add incremental capacity as we have talked about that is in all of our factories especially rfab1 but the next bigger tranche of capacity will come in with rfab2 as we talked about earlier once that is operational sometime in the second quarter or next year then that will that s when we finish and when we produce revenues sometime in the second half of next year then that will add a significant amount of capacity and then shortly after that lehi will also come in line for additional revenue capacity there dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations yes and maybe just quickly what i might add to that obviously whenever things do slow we will then use that period of time to rebuild inventories in those positions to be able to support growth in the future rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations yes and i ll just add one more thing both rfab2 and lehi was a long term play right these are this is to strengthen our manufacturing advantage owning our own manufacturing which clearly has proven over the last year and a half we knew that already but it has proven that how important that is in the current environment they are going to happen to help in the medium term most likely but if they don t if things slow down and it doesn t work out that way that is completely fine with us that s not why we are equipping those factor that s not why we bought we re buying lehi is for the long term positioning of the company to support long term revenue growth in both analog and embedded dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations okay thank you blayne we ll go to the next caller please operator and next we will go to ambrish srivastava of bmo ambrish srivastava bmo analyst hi thank you very much rafael and dave i had a question on free cash flow per share and you guys know i don t look at it on a quarterly basis so if i look at the last two years so look at 2020 free cash flow per share down 3 2019 it was flat and i know that if i look at this year on a trailing 12 month basis it is up double digit but it has lagged sorry for the background noise it always happens on a conference call if i look at the trailing 12 months and then so that s in line with what you have said consistently but should we expect this to come back to the double digit on an annualized basis what s the right way to think about the lag over the last two years and how should we think about it going forward rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations yeah this is one most financial metric but if you want to look at this over the long term right any one quarter or even any one year they could be a little choppy you mentioned a couple of years when 2019 and even 2020 where that trajectory does not represent the longer term and arguably the same thing for 2021 or the trailing 12 months number that you just quoted right so if you want to look at this over the long term and that s how we look at it and that s what s going to ultimately drive value for the owners of the company right dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations did you have a follow on ambrish srivastava bmo analyst yes i did with all the tightness and contrast this with the way you guys have managed the business and the share shift probably show up that quickly because these designs are such long lasting and they don t change on a dime are you seeing any discernible change in your design in activity as a result of what we ve seen from your peers with the tightness and you managing your lead times and inventory much better than some of your peers thank you dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations yes i ll start off and rafael if you want to add i would say that as you know ambrish we have started on the journey to have closer direct relationships with customers really eight seven eight years ago with our investments on ti com investments in our sales applications teams investments in processes and how we do business and just our structure inside of the company and last year you saw a pretty major step of taking more customers direct and operating with fewer distributors as well as transacting business through ti com so you kind of mix that together with the pandemic and our ability to do virtual sales calls i think all those things have positioned us well strategically especially in markets like industrial automotive those markets where we want to gain that strategic ground you couple that with availability and like you say things don t move quickly but the supply shortages really started showing up in the beginning of 2020 took a break in the first or second quarter when the pandemic hit and then reaccelerated after that so there are cases that are unusual but there are cases where customers redesign boards just because of availability i ll describe that as an outlier but we do see cases of that but we see more cases where you have designs that are being intersected as they come through and again our sales teams are engaged from production all the way back into engineering and that gives that visibility is a great strategic advantage and those benefits again will be things that will pay rewards for us for a long time to come okay thank you ambrish and i think we ve got time for one last caller operator and that caller will be chris danely of citigroup chris danely citigroup analyst thanks guys hey dave by the way thanks for the other analysts go first and beat you up on the flat guidance so i don t have to my question is on the auto revenue so if we look at the headlines and talk to the folks in the auto supply chain there is still a lot of shortages etc etc out there and i think your revenue was only slightly up so can you just explain the discrepancy it seems like it would be up a little bit more than that if there is all these folks clamoring for parts out there dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations well i d pointed out at over doubled from a year ago chris so it s a little bit more than up a little bit and i think you re pointing to the sequential but again last quarter it was up over 25 from pre pandemic levels i don t think we re shipping 25 more cars from pre pandemic levels right so our shipments into automotive are up and up significantly and we continue to add capacity and continue to we believe we re gaining share there as well you got to measure it over time but yes so we are our shipments are up there and up strong so you have a follow on chris danely citigroup analyst yes just i guess the hotspot question so you said that you re seeing a few more hotspots last quarter do you think that the situation gets a little bit worse this quarter or do you think it gets better when do you guys think you ll start to get a handle on all these sort of supply issues out there i guess rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations chris it s going to depend on demand right we are on the supply side as we said we are adding capacity incrementally we have been and we ll continue to do that the bigger tranche of capacity doesn t come in until about a year from now right as we just talked about rfab2 and then six months later we ve lehi so it will be a while before we have big tranches of capacity coming online so it s going to depend on demand at the end of the day we don t fully control there it is more of a macro situation but we are better prepared than our peers and have been in both the tactical decisions we have made during the pandemic we re more importantly our business model and how we run the company specifically own in our own manufacturing that there has been a key in this whole process and we re just really doubling down on that what we were doing with all those factors that we just talked about dave pahl vice president and head of investor relations thank you chris rafael do you want up first rafael r lizardi senior vice president and chief financial officer finance operations yes i ll go ahead and wrap up so let me just emphasize what we have said previously at our core we re engineers and technology is the foundation of our company but ultimately our objective and the best metric to measure progress and generate long term value for owners is the growth of free cash flow per share while we strive to achieve our objective we will continue to pursue our three ambitions we will act like owners who will own the company for decades we will adapt and succeed in a world that s ever changing and we will be a company that we are personally proud to be a part of and would want as our neighbor where successful employees customers communities and owners all benefit thank you and have a good evening

san ramon calif ap pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles 16 000 kilometers of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation across drought stricken california the daunting project announced wednesday aims to bury about 10 of pg e s distribution and transmission lines at a projected cost of 15 billion to as much as 30 billion based on how much the process currently costs the utility believes it will find ways to keep the final bill at the lower end of those estimates most of the costs will likely be shouldered by pg e customers whose electricity rates are already among the highest in the u s pg e stepped up its safety commitment just days after informing regulators a 70 foot 23 meter pine tree that toppled on one of its power lines ignited a major fire in butte county the same rural area about 145 miles 233 kilometers northeast of san francisco where another fire sparked by its equipment in 2018 killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands of homes since it started july 13 in a remote area of butte county the dixie fire has churned northeast through the sierra nevada by wednesday the fire spanned a 133 square mile 344 square kilometer area forcing the plumas county sheriff on wednesday to order evacuations along the west shore of popular lake almanor the backlash to pg e s potential liability for the dixie fire prompted the company s recently hired ceo patricia patti poppe to unveil the plan for underground lines several months earlier than she said she planned previous pg e regimes have staunchly resisted plans to bury long stretches of power lines because of the massive expense involved but poppe told reporters on wednesday that she quickly realized after she joined pg e in january that moving lines underground is the best way to protect both the utility and the 16 million people who rely on it for power it s too expensive not to do it lives are on the line poppe told reporters pg e said only that burying the lines will take several years however getting the job done within the next decade will require a quantum leap in the few areas where pg e has already been burying power lines it has been completing about 70 miles 123 kilometers annually pg e expects to eventually be able to bury more than 1 000 miles 1 600 kilometers of power lines annually said its chief operating officer adam wright while wright likened the project to the marshall plan that helped rebuild europe after world war ii poppe invoked president john f kennedy s 1962 pledge for the u s to land on the moon pg e s path to this point has been strewn with death and destruction after previous leaders allowed its equipment to fall into disrepair in a apparent attempt to boost profits and management bonuses the utility s grid was blamed for igniting a series of devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that prompted the company to file for bankruptcy in 2019 the biggest fire in butte county wiped out the entire town of paradise and resulted in pg e pleading guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter last year just weeks before it emerged from one of the most complex cases in u s history as part of its bankruptcy pg e set up a 13 5 billion trust to pay victims of its past wildfires but that fund is facing a roughly 2 billion shortfall because half its money is supposed to come from company stock that has been a market laggard since getting out of bankruptcy pg e also has been rebuked by california power regulators and a federal judge overseeing its criminal probation for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the utility has also been charged with another round of fire related crimes that it denies committing poppe insisted things are getting better this year under a plan that calls for pg e to spend 1 4 billion removing more than 300 000 trees and trimming another 1 1 million but she conceded the utility is not making enough progress since it s only a fraction of that 8 million trees within striking distance of its power lines but she also defended pg e s handling of the tree that may have caused the dixie fire and its response the tree looked healthy and was about 40 feet 12 meters from power lines she said making it a low risk danger when a pg e troubleshooter was sent out to inspect a potential problem he noticed the tree had fallen and may have started a fire in a treacherous area that he tried to put out before firefighters arrived his efforts can be called nothing less than heroic poppe said michael liedtke the associated press
americans have enjoyed the benefits of low inflation for years but there s no question that it s starting to rear its head in its most recent report the u s bureau of labor statistics recorded a whopping 5 4 year over year change in the consumer price index cpi one of the most widely followed inflation indicators fed chairman jerome powell has expressed his belief that this most recent bout of inflation is merely transitory and that it will get sorted out as the supply chain recovers by the end of the year yet even if powell is correct and the inflation rate increases only moderately it seems likely that inflation will be higher going forward if you re looking to defend your portfolio against the effects of rising inflation here are some investments that might offer some protection

previous year 110 125 vs 33 804 this growth will have a significant impact on farm this spring and deliver a huge amount of value to our farmers with more high quality heifer replacements and fewer

advisor returns as of june 7 2021 vas narasimhan chief executive officer thank you samir and thanks everyone for joining today s conference call today with me i have members of our executive team and i also would like to introduce karen hale our new chief legal officer karen joins us from the biopharmaceutical industry with over 20 years experience in a broad range of medical devices and pharmaceuticals so welcome karen so if we can move to slide 5 i wanted to start by reflecting on the journey we ve been on as a company as we focused the company rolled out our strategy and delivered consistent performance over the recent period going back to the first half of 2018 when you look at our financial performance over the first half of the for the subsequent four years our sales have grown at 6 cagr our core operating income at a 13 cagr and we ve grown our innovative medicines margin from 31 8 to 36 8 in the first half of 2021 demonstrating that our operational execution has been strong now when you look ahead we remain confident in our growth outlook as we outlined in the meet the management last year where we highlighted a 4 cagr off of our 2019 actuals to a 2025 sales goal of 60 billion or more and a consensus im margin that is currently at 37 6 that we remain confident that we can achieve so a strong performance track record and a strong growth outlook remains the story for novartis now going to slide 6 when you look at our strong performance in q2 it was strong across all of the key elements that we believe will drive long term value for patients as well as for shareholders our sales growth was strong and harry will go through that in a bit more detail we had strong productivity with good core operating income growth and good margin expansion we continued our innovation agenda which will be critical to driving the growth to 2025 and importantly beyond and we also continued on our journey to be a leader in esg with some important milestones and i ll talk about each of these areas in turn moving to the next slide when you look at our key growth drivers and launches over the period we demonstrated i think strong performance across our key brands marie france will talk a bit more about the strong performance of entresto cosentyx and zolgensma as well as kesimpta which is off to a good and strong start and then susanne will also cover the various oncology growth drivers now taken together we our key growth drivers and launches now account for 51 of our im sales and these products are growing at a rate of 29 in quarter 2 which i think nicely demonstrates our transition from an older portfolio of medicines to a next wave of portfolios which we believe will enable us to drive our growth over the next decade now moving to slide 8 i also wanted to say a word on sandoz we saw the business stabilize in quarter 2 we saw sales at 5 in the quarter biopharma sales were also up 5 and core operating income was also up now when you look at the story for the rest of the year for sandoz we continue to expect disruptions related to covid but we do expect also assuming healthcare systems continue on their current trend a return hopefully back to a more stable situation we have had a historically weak cough and cold season and decreased anti infectives use but we will see how this all unfolds and again we re hopeful that we can get back to a more stable situation overall in the generics sector now that said we are confident in the longer term outlook in sandoz we ve made the we believe the right investments in biosimilars we ve doubled the size of the biosimilars pipeline with a focus in key therapeutic areas such as oncology and immunology and we continue to also invest in our core generics capabilities we strengthened our antibiotics manufacturing setup as well as brought in a new portfolio of assets including our recent acquisition of gsk s anti infectives portfolio and we continue to make investments in complex generics including oncology injectables and respiratory medicines so over time we remain committed to delivering a sandoz outlook of mid single digit sales and mid to high 20 core operating income margin so moving to the next slide and turning to innovation q2 continued progress on the innovation front we had approvals of cosentyx in the u s in pediatric psoriasis as well as entresto in essential hypertension in china which can be another growth driver for entresto building on its already strong performance i ll say a bit more on some of these other milestones in subsequent slides but i did want to note that asciminib our abl001 has been filed in the u s in the third line setting and we do believe this medicine has blockbuster potential in the third line setting alone not to mention our efforts to move it into earlier lines which we ll say more about and we also had important advances on kymriah and apelisib as well which i think will enable us to broaden the indications for both of these medicines so moving to slide 10 and taking a little bit of a deeper dive on our portfolio starting with our life cycle management i already mentioned the china approval in essential hypertension but in for cosentyx we remain on track for the hidradenitis suppurativa readouts in the second half there is strong open label data that supports the use of cosentyx in this indication and then we also have a range of other indications we re developing as we ve noted to enable cosentyx to continue its strong trajectory we re on track for kisqali s monaleesa 2 os readout in the second half which would be the third os readout two have already been favorable for kisqali really building on the unique profile we believe kisqali has we also are on track for the adjuvant readout in 2022 we ll speak more about leqvio in a moment now turning to pharmaceuticals we ll go through iptacopan s data in a bit more detail but i wanted to highlight as well that ligelizumab s csu studies are on track for phase 3 readout in the second half we have also initiated on our progressing chronic inducible urticaria studies as well as food allergy studies and we have continued to progress branaplam with an agreement now with the regulators for a start in the second half of a phase 2b study in huntington s disease moving to oncology our canakinumab readouts are also on track for lu psma we have submissions planned for the second half and we ve started the phase 3 studies in the earlier line settings i ll say a bit more about that and i also wanted to highlight that with tno155 our shp2 inhibitor we ve already now advanced both in combination with other kras agents but are also now moving into the clinic with our shp2 in combination with our own kras agent jdq as well as other shp2 combinations that we re currently exploring lastly i wanted to note that asciminib now has entered our wildcard box on the bottom here in first line setting where asciminib is going against investigator choice of tki our hope is if we were able to deliver this result we would be able to once again transform the care of cml patients with a multi blockbuster potential indication for asciminib it s worth noting that across the wildcards you see in that box while these programs are still early each one of them has the potential to be a multibillion dollar medicine if we re ultimately able to deliver on the clinical value of these assets now moving to slide 11 saying a bit more on inclisiran you likely saw that our pdufa action date is now january 1 2022 we have filed the refiled from our schaftenau site which is the manufacturing location where we currently do secondary manufacturing for products such as cosentyx as well as other biologics so a site that s well known to the regulators we also have believe we ve addressed the concerns that fda has raised and it s notable that fda has not raised any concerns related to the efficacy or safety of inclisiran in any of the interactions that we ve had so this is a class 2 resubmission a six month time line we of course will continue to work with fda to see if there s opportunities to move this up earlier in the time period but hopefully now this will get us to a place where we can bring this very important medicine with a very substantial potential for the company to market in the united states now moving to the next slide turning to lu psma you likely saw in the asco plenary session the medicine has really remarkable results of 38 reduced risk of death and a 60 improvement in rpfs regulatory submissions are on track for the second half the movement into earlier line studies with the psmafore and the psmaddition studies are already underway and we re also evaluating whether to move the medicine even into earlier line settings we re working very hard to also expand the relevant capabilities to administer the medicine and susanne will speak more about that in a moment moving to the next slide iptacopan continues to show its utility across a broad range of indications as you saw in the quarter with iga nephropathy we presented the primary endpoint at era edta a 23 reduction in proteinuria at three months and it s important to note that this was a three month time point we expect that proteinuria over time to continue to improve as we typically see in studies like this so we look forward to looking at the six months and beyond endpoint also importantly there was a stabilization of renal function which will be very important from a regulatory as well as clinical utility standpoint the applause igan iga nephropathy study is now ongoing to support the filings worldwide in this indication we also continue to progress our c3g indication for this medicine with eu prime designation already achieved we had a 49 reduction in proteinuria with this medicine at three months again we would expect that trend to hopefully continue in subsequent months a stabilization of renal function also well tolerated and this phase 3 study now is enrolling to support filings worldwide and moving to the next slide when you look at iptacopan in pnh we also presented data here in the frontline setting to complement the data we already have as an add on therapy this new data which we presented at eha showed clinically important benefits of monotherapy of iptacopan and this novel agent with its ability to inhibit factor b with a both impact intravascular and extravascular hemolysis gives us hope that we can be ultimately indicated for frontline usage as well as add on to eculizumab worth noting it s unique as an oral agent with a great safety profile so we look forward to completing the apply pnh studies with the superiority endpoints and then again to support filings worldwide as you likely saw as well in our recent investor day on this medicine we have a broad range of indications also now advancing we believe this medicine has a substantial potential to treat a range of immunological renal and hematological diseases now moving to the next slide one piece of data that came out in the quarter that didn t attract as much attention as what one might have expected is our zolgensma sprint data this was remarkable data showing the impact that gene therapy can have on children with sma in this study 100 of the patients met the primary endpoint of sitting independently when treated in the presymptomatic setting so these are patients who are identified through newborn screening and treated with zolgensma 100 of patients met the secondary endpoint also with respect to walking and standing we saw remarkable gains for these patients which we hope will continue to improve over time this data reinforces that zolgensma is a foundational therapy for presymptomatic and symptomatic children with sma it also continues to give us confidence that over time as gene therapies as a sector matures our capabilities in gene therapy having learned so much with the introduction of zolgensma around the world building outstanding manufacturing and technical capabilities will allow us in the long term to be a leader in gene therapies for the decade to come now moving to the next slide i also wanted to say and as a last note on the pipeline an update on the sabatolimab stimulus program which is progressing in mds and aml now as a reminder in phase 1 studies we showed that sabatolimab had 50 or 58 orr in myelodysplastic syndromes and given this unique mechanism of action it s the first io agent in the hematological setting it gave us confidence to move forward in mds and aml with the stimulus programs which are pivotal studies that tackle both of these indications now the parallel execution of these trials offers us a range of filing options we did have the cr readout and the dmc recommended that we continue the study blinded to the pfs readout and then of course the os readout as well will come over time it s also worth noting in the mds program we have a third study in the stimulus array of studies that also looks at the with a triplet combination including venetoclax so we believe we have a program that can adequately cover the range of potential options that would be needed for patients to be treated effectively with medicines such as mbg so we remain very excited about the program we think scientifically mechanistically and as a first in class asset it can be an important addition to aml and mds treatment an area that we ve been a leader in for many years so we ll look forward to keeping you updated on this program now moving to esg we had strong progress on esg i think some notable milestones in our effort to be a leader in this space we reached 1 billion courses of antimalarial treatment delivered since 1999 it s 1 billion patients we ve been able to treat with our coartem a pioneering agent to treat malaria very proud of that achievement we also recently announced a 10 year commitment to empower 1 200 african american students working with historically black colleges and universities to really address the inequities in medical education and broadly inequities in healthcare in the united states and you can see other important milestones that we hit over the course of the quarter so we ll look forward to continuing our progress on this front and being a leader in esg for the long term ultimately embedding this into our business to drive long term performance so with that i ll hand it over to marie france marie france tschudin president of novartis pharmaceuticals thank you vas good morning good afternoon to all and pleased to update you on our q2 pharma performance if we move to slide 19 we delivered 12 growth versus prior year and an additional 1 billion in revenues as you can also see we also continue to make progress on our portfolio shift our growth drivers and launches are showing excellent momentum with 35 growth and these now contribute to more than 50 of our top line thanks to our strong focus on execution you can expect this shift to continue as we invest behind our growth drivers and launches and also actively manage the mature portfolio if we move to slide 20 consentyx delivered 21 growth u s volume growth in q2 is now back in line with the market and sales were up 11 quarter over quarter our field force activity is above pre covid levels and as we see the market regaining momentum we also intend to capture more volume ex u s we had really strong growth in europe and in china we quadrupled sales versus q1 following the nrdl listing in march so full year we re on track to deliver double digit growth based on our broad access our ongoing geographic expansion and the continued investment we can now proudly say that 500 000 patients have been treated with cosentyx and with our ambition to expand to 10 indications we know that many more can benefit we ll continue to invest with additional approvals in the short term and with our hidradenitis suppurativa readout toward the end of the year if we move to the next slide entresto saw another very strong quarter with 46 growth in the u s you can see from the nbrx growth that we re really capitalizing on the acc consensus recommendation and also on the expanded label in europe the esc guidelines now recommend entresto as first line and that is further reinforcing our position as first choice china we tripled sales compared to previous year on the back of strategic account expansion in fact china is now entresto s second biggest market so this team is strongly focused on execution educating prescribers on guidelines activating patients and ensuring the guidelines become protocol at hospital level you can expect to see the usual summer slowdown however full year we will stay strong as we address the remaining 70 of patients who do not yet benefit from entresto if i move to slide 22 zolgensma is continuing its growth trajectory as we open up reimbursement in new markets as you heard vas say earlier we ve got compelling data in presymptomatic patients and thus it s really important for us to continue the work to implement newborn screening as we know the earlier we treat the more transformational the outcomes are for these babies in the u s 80 of newborns are being screened and this is allowing treatment within a few weeks of birth ex u s we expect to see italy and the u k and additional reimbursed markets to drive the growth in the second half and even though you can continue to expect some volatility in the quarterly pattern we re on track to exceed blockbuster status this year our preclinical studies for it are progressing well and we re actually ready to start our phase 3 as soon as the fda gives us the green light over time the it formulation can more than double the number of patients who could benefit from zolgensma if we move to the next slide with kesimpta our focus is on broad adoption in early lines of therapy we ve added 500 new prescribers and we ve doubled the number of patients on kesimpta versus q1 we also see that half of the kesimpta usage is a naive or first switch and this is exactly where we want to be the b cell class is currently leading the recovery of the dynamic market and kesimpta has got the second highest nbrx share in the ms space so this positions us well as the market opens up further as we move to the second half of the year we know what we need to do to double demand and we re doing what is needed for a strong q4 we re maintaining our leading share of voice to really increase the awareness of kesimpta we also believe that our pira and our igg data provide important clinical differentiation so we re fully focused on what we need to do we re also fully focused on delivering a positive customer experience in fact 80 of patients are receiving their first dose within five days and our patient support services are enabling fast and easy initiation if i move on to slide 24 and move on to leqvio we all know that ascvd is the leading cause of death and unfortunately mortality is on the rise there are effective treatments we know that too but patients are not at goal due to access adherence and affordability challenges and this is why we re taking a different approach on how we bring leqvio to market in the u s we ve got a new action date for january and we re preparing for launch our access strategy could actually enable two thirds of patients at launch to access leqvio with a 0 copay so we re working with healthcare systems on broad adoption we re using our existing infrastructure to identify patients and also to set up buy and bill administration in the u k we re partnering with the nhs to bring leqvio to more than 300 000 patients at risk of a second cv event over the next three years and we re on track for that launch in q3 we understand this approach will take time and further evidence generation but this level of ambition is absolutely necessary if we want to drive better outcomes for ascvd patients so in summary an excellent quarter we re fully focused on our strategy to maximize our growth drivers deliver our launches and also prepare for the next wave of innovative medicines as we further accelerate our portfolio shift we re also transforming our business we want to be much more customer centric and also pursue innovative approaches to launch our products in partnership with healthcare systems around the world so coming out of q2 we had good momentum across the globe which we expect will continue in the second half i want to take a moment to recognize the fantastic teams around the work for their hard work and for delivering these results over to you susanne susanne schaffert president of novartis oncology thank you marie france and moving to slide 26 i m very pleased to give an update on the oncology business so the oncology business showed very solid performance in the second quarter delivering 7 of growth with sales reaching 3 9 billion our growth drivers and recent launches are showing good momentum with 19 growth versus prior year driven by kisqali jakavi promacta revolade and kymriah and together these products now contribute to half of the overall oncologies allowing us to more than offset losses from continued generic erosion of glivec afinitor and exjade jadenu in the u s in q2 the oncology market continued to be affected by covid 19 oncologists are reporting that there s case load depending on geography is still 25 to 50 below pre covid level and most affected areas are our breast cancer portfolio recent launches and hospital initiated therapies like kymriah and lutathera looking at kymriah this grew globally 19 and it was driven by strong ex u s growth and geographic expansion in the u s we remain very competitive however overall demand in the class has slowed down and lutathera sales were growing 10 in q2 the ex u s growth was double digit and we also saw positive sickness in the u s as it is emerging from covid and referrals started to increase so overall we remain confident that patient visits to hospitals will increase and treatment patterns will further improve in the second half of the year leading to acceleration of growth in these segments moving to slide 27 i wanted to share a bit on our performance in the u s u s remains our biggest market globally and is contributing to over 40 of our overall oncology sales our growth brands and launches contribute to 49 of sales the u s market is slowly recovering from the pandemic with oncologists case load now reaching 75 of pre covid level however testing rates for the most common tumor types remain suppressed in q1 delaying diagnosis and new prescriptions in q2 we have seen partial recovery of our growth drivers and recent launches together growing 10 versus previous year and also accelerating versus previous quarter so this was mainly driven by promacta kisqali and taf mek overall with continued recovery of the market we expect acceleration of sales in the u s in the second half of the year moving to kisqali on slide 28 kisqali delivered strong performance second quarter growing 36 with sales of 225 million the uptake was mainly driven by continued momentum in patient share gains ex u s and particularly in europe kisqali is the market leader in premenopausal setting in france italy and spain and in the u s we have also seen kisqali sales getting traction delivering 17 versus previous quarter driven by increased demand and new patient starts we see increased field force reach in those accounts where access restrictions were lifted and we also continue to leverage digital engagement based on dynamic targeting at asco we presented updated os data from our monaleesa 3 trial that showed consistent os benefit with a median os of four to five years and with this data kisqali demonstrated the longest os in postmenopausal patients and is the only cdk4 6 inhibitor with data in first line with fulvestrant we believe that these excellent results may be attributed to the unique profile of kisqali versus other cdk4 6 inhibitors with preferential inhibition to cdk4 over cdk6 and a high concentration to inhibit the target in addition we are going into the adjuvant setting with our natalee study exploring kisqali in both intermediate and high risk population and just to remind you this population represents around 70 of the adjuvant early breast cancer population and there s a clear unmet medical need i am very pleased to report that the enrollment of the natalee study is completed and we are on track for readout in 2022 moving to slide 29 as you heard from vas we are very excited about data from the vision trial that positions lutetium psma well to potentially address the unmet needs of more than 80 of men with late stage advanced prostate cancer who express psma receptors and just to remind you that prostate cancer is the second most diagnosed cancer globally and in the majority of cases patients unfortunately developed metastases by the time of castration resistant prostate cancer diagnosis earlier in june we got breakthrough therapy granted by the fda and filing to fda is on track for the second half of 21 we are fully in launch preparation with focus on the top 200 treatment centers and are also working on raising awareness on the clinical relevance of psma very pleased to see growth in the psma awareness has doubled among the target physicians over the last month and just to reassure you that we have adequate capacity to meet the demand for the current launch so our focus will be on driving referrals from community centers where 70 of prostate cancer patients are treated when you model the lutetium psma launch keep in mind that hospitals need to set up processes and licenses and patients need to be selected through psma pet scannings and these factors are likely to drive a more gradual uptake at launch versus what you saw with the bolus effect on lutathera moving to the next slide slide 30 i would like to talk about a launch preparation for asciminib the first stamp inhibitor that has the potential to transform cml treatment standards again in the phase 3 ascembl study asciminib nearly doubled the major molecular response at 24 weeks compared to bosutinib we have completed filings for fda and ema earlier in june and the fda has granted two breakthrough therapy designations and fast track designations for asciminib and is reviewing the file under real time oncology review as we are preparing for the launch our focus is on raising awareness on importance of stamp inhibition to overcome resistance and minimizing off target events typical for tkis aided awareness has already reached 75 and just to remind you the third line indication for asciminib has already blockbuster potential but we are also very excited by the potential benefit that asciminib may provide to cml patients in first line setting despite the advancements in treatment of cml over the last 20 years there are still around 50 of patients who relapse or are intolerant to imatinib in first line and more than 30 of patients suffer from tki related nonhematological ais we believe that in earlier lines of cml treatment asciminib may prevent resistance currently available tkis and therefore we are initiating a phase 3 study of asciminib versus investigator selected tkis with enrollment planned to start in the second half of 21 so moving to slide 31 we have made great progress on our innovation agenda and 21 is a very important year in terms of readouts and submission in addition to the vision data we had multiple readouts like positive data from to iptacopan in pnh alpelisib in pros kymriah follicular lymphoma and os data for lutathera canakinumab readout in second line non small lung cancer did unfortunately not show positive data but it is very important to mention that we have two more studies ongoing in first line and adjuvant non small cell lung cancer with the first line trial on track to read out in second half of 21 later in the year we re also expecting kymriah to read out in second line non hodgkin s lymphoma and kisqali os data from monaleesa 2 in terms of submission we have completed submissions for gvhd for jakavi in europe and japan tabrecta at in europe and asciminib in third line u s and europe and for h2 we are on track for filing of lutetium psma kymriah in follicular lymphoma and second line on non hodgkin s lymphoma and tislelizumab in non small cell lung cancer and second line esophageal cancer so exciting times ahead for oncology big thank you to all the teams and with that i hand over to harry harry kirsch chief financial officer yes thank you susanne good morning and good afternoon everybody so i m now going to walk you through some of the financials for the second quarter and the first half of the year and as always my comments refer to growth rates in constant currencies unless otherwise noted so on slide 33 you see the summary of our operational performance for the second quarter and the first half we had a strong quarter 2 resulting in a solid first half performance despite the impact of covid during the period quarter 2 net sales grew 9 to 13 billion driven by our key growth drivers and core operating income grew 13 to 4 3 billion mainly driven by the higher sales and favorable gross margin partly offset by higher investments core eps growth was also up 16 to 1 66 and free cash flow grew 17 to usd 4 2 billion of course we appreciate the benefit on comparison from the low base in quarter 2 2020 due to the covid destocking in the prior year however even when excluded we still return to healthy growth with sales up 5 and core operating income growing 4 quarter 2 2021 underlying our half 1 performance was solid with 3 growth on the top line and 2 on the bottom line core eps grew 5 to 3 17 and free cash flow was 6 billion of course for half 1 the quarter 2 quarter 1 destocking stocking from the prior year has washed out so these values represent underlying growth of half 1 2021 next slide please so on slide 34 i want to dive into our performance during the quarter by division innovative medicines delivered a strong quarter with plus 10 top line and plus 14 bottom line growth and a margin of 37 even if we adjust for last year s lower base we still saw strong growth with innovative medicine sales increasing 7 and core operating income up 6 the innovative medicines performance was driven by continued strong double digit growth of our key growth drivers including cosentyx entresto zolgensma and the oncology launch brands and as vas mentioned earlier in the presentation our growth drivers and launches are driving portfolio rejuvenation and now account for over half of our innovative medicines sales of course the pandemic still impacts our business particularly sandoz retail and the anti infective segment however the sandoz business is now beginning to stabilize with sales up plus 5 in quarter 2 and bottom line growing 3 although growth did also benefit from prior year destocking now turning to our full year guidance on slide 35 we confirm full year guidance for both the group sales and core operating income for sales we continue to expect low to mid single digit growth in 2021 and for the bottom line we expect mid single digit growth ahead of sales for innovative medicines and sandoz we are also not making any changes we continue to expect innovative medicines division sales to grow mid single digit and core operating income to grow mid to high single digit ahead of sales and for sandoz we continue to expect sales to decline in the low to mid single digit range and core operating income to decline low to mid teens the key assumption for the guidance is that we see a continuation of the return to normal global healthcare systems and prescribing dynamics in the second half of this year and in addition we continue to assume that no gilenya and no sandostatin lar generics would enter in 2021 in the u s on next slide we provide some detail on our expectations for the second half of the year we expect top line growth to accelerate from 3 in half 1 to mid single digit bringing us to the low to mid single digit range for the full year our assumption is that this will be driven by growth acceleration as we continue to return to normal prescribing behaviors as well as further sandoz stabilization we expect core operating income growth to be high single digit in half 2 reaching our mid single digit expectation for the full year core operating income growth will be driven by higher sales and ongoing productivity programs partly offset by increased investments in our growth drivers and pipeline it is possible that we could reach the higher end of the ranges we have provided but as you know the covid situation still remains fluid finally on slide 37 as currencies are constantly changing i want to bring to your attention the estimated currency impact on our results using the current exchange rates so if mid july rates prevail for the remainder of 2021 the full year impact of currencies on sales would be positive 2 and on core operating income positive 2 to 3 percent points for quarter 3 it will be positive 1 percent point on sales and positive 1 to 2 points on core operating income and as a reminder we always update this estimated currency impact on our website on a monthly basis and with that i hand back to vas vas narasimhan chief executive officer thank you harry so moving to the next slide when you look at 2021 we have a broad range of catalysts still to go we ve also had good pipeline delivery over the course of the year so we look forward to keeping you updated as we continue to advance these assets and programs i d also note our mid stage pipeline continues to generate i think exciting new innovations which we hope will emerge and be able to add to our pipeline over the course of the second half now moving to the last slide just to close as i noted at the beginning our consistent long term performance over the recent years is driving our confidence for the future and the continued growth outlook for the company we ve had strong performance in q2 driven by the key growth drivers as you ve seen throughout the presentation and we ve also continued to advance our pipeline of novel medicines you ve seen the positive readouts across iptacopan lu psma and others and we re reconfirming our full year 2021 guidance our commitment to drive long term accretive growth and again thank you for your commitment to the company and so with that i ll ask the operator to open the line for questions questions answers operator vas narasimhan chief executive officer operator if i could just say one thing if questioners could limit themselves to two questions we d appreciate it thank you operator thank you your first question today comes from the line of wimal kapadia from bernstein please go ahead your line is open wimal kapadia sanford c bernstein analyst great thank you very much for taking my question i m wimal kapadia from bernstein first i m just curious how novartis are thinking about the potential impact of the sglt2s for entresto following some of the recent positive data in the preserved ejection fraction population clearly these drugs have quite a robust profile and have are reasonably well priced and have demonstrated efficacy on top and in entresto naive patients so do you expect to see any impact i m just curious on your level of confidence that these drugs will not be used ahead of enteresto my second question is just on iptacopan clearly lots of interesting data recently for the drug across multiple indications but i m just curious how novartis is thinking about it from a commercial perspective i appreciate this will come down to time lines and which indications demonstrate efficacy in phase 3 but they re quite a different size of markets and competitive dynamics are quite different so ultimately how novartis is going to prioritize should we see success across multiple indications particularly given the acceptable price points by indications could be quite different and competition from the likes of the apellis could limit the potential thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah thanks wimal so first on the sglt2 marie france marie france tschudin president of novartis pharmaceuticals so thanks for the question as you rightly said the sglt2s are add ons and so we expect them to continue to be used predominantly in diabetes patients even if we think about the new readout of pef we ve really only seen the press release and we d have to look at the full data because the trials were really quite different the bottom line is actually entresto has a unique position and it s got a broad label in the u s that s covering five out of six patients with chronic heart failure we re very strong with the cardiologists and we re going to focus on making sure that 70 of the hfref patients who are on previous standard of care switch to entresto so i think between the compelling data the strong guideline support that we have the commercial infrastructure the excellent team that we have in place we have what it takes to continue the momentum with entresto and if patients need an add on then an sglt2 is the right thing to do vas narasimhan chief executive officer and then thanks marie france and with respect to iptacopan i think our overall strategy as you can see is to fully leverage the unique mechanism and profile of this medicine across the range of indications we ve outlined now of course it will be data driven and the sequencing will be determined by the data but our goal is on the one hand to disrupt existing markets with the fact that we have a safe oral that can be given broadly to patients who at the moment are taking at least at the moment taking ivs on an ongoing basis and so we think there s a very attractive profile there and then to enter into completely new market segments in renal disease hematological illnesses that currently don t have a very strong standard of care and so that s how you re going to see us approach the launch fully maximize the asset across the full range of numerous indications we re pursuing thanks wimal next question wimal kapadia sanford c bernstein analyst thank you operator thank you thank you your next question comes from the line of graham parry bank of america please go ahead your line is open graham parry bank of america merrill lynch analyst great thanks for taking my question so first one is on kesimpta just wondering what percentage of drug dispensers free drug in first half and how you expect that to be in second half because you said you expect demand to double 2h and i think if you take first half sales and add on twice that you get to around consensus of 350 million but if you re getting less free drug could you actually beat the consensus number and then secondly on the natalee trial now that recruitment is complete can you narrow the window down to when in 2022 we might see the data even just is that do you think it s a first half or a second half event thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks graham on kesimpta marie france marie france tschudin president of novartis pharmaceuticals yeah so on kesimpta our key focus is really on broad adoption in early lines of therapy and i say that because i think it s really important for our strategy that everyone understand that we want to ensure the value of high efficacy b cell therapy early as i said in my opening comments we have about 500 new prescribers and we ve also got about twice as many patients on kesimpta s q1 all patients are starting on free drug and even though our free to paid conversion is happening really quickly there s always a bit of a lag so in the second half of the year we know we have the fundamentals in place we know we still have some scaling to do around familiarity of the brand given that kesimpta is new in market and we re going to focus we re going to continue our focus on leading share of voice on the differentiation and really on consistently enabling fast and easy initiation so for the full year we re comfortable with external expectations we know what we need to do to double demand in q2 and really deliver a strong q4 medium term we expect kesimpta to be a major growth driver for the company vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks marie france and then on natalee timing john john tsai chief medical officer yeah thanks for the question graham on natalee which is our adjuvant study for kisqali as we disclosed earlier last year that we ve increased the recruitment from 4 000 to 5 000 patients and this includes both the intermediate and high risk patients who have had advanced breast cancer our final result that we expect to read out is going to be at the end of next year and that s how it s currently powered as we said previously we re not disclosing interims so we re currently powered for the end of the year next year for our final readout vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks john so thanks for the question graham next question operator operator thank you thank you your next question comes from jo walton from credit suisse please go ahead your line is open jo walton credit suisse analyst thank you my first question is about marketing spend so we saw in the second quarter of last year clearly very little on the sales side and a dramatic constriction of everybody s marketing spend and then could you give us some idea of how you ve opened that up what sort of level of your marketing capacity you re at now in the second quarter as you enter the third quarter and how you think marketing spend might be able to be sustained at perhaps a lower level going forwards i don t know more use of digital or whatever but if we can get a sense of whether you feel or how confident you are in a reduction in your long term marketing spend because of all the things that you ve learned with covid and my second question would be to ask for a bit more detail on china you ve talked about drugs where you ve tripled sales quadrupled sales can you just give us a little bit of an idea of your level of investment and your level of ambition in china please vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah thanks jo so first on marketing spend trends i ll hand it to harry harry harry kirsch chief financial officer yeah hi jo so on the marketing spend it s actually playing out as we guided to early in the year which is as you pointed out quarter 2 spend is quite higher than last year quarter 2 where basically all major markets were locked down maybe other than china but also in the u s so that s why we guided also that in the first half we wouldn t see margin improvement and i think with the sales of 3 and core operating income of 2 we saw that also playing out so i would expect continued especially quarter 3 where also last year s spend levels were low that marketing and sales growth is at a certain healthy level given the investment needs but of course within our guidance be it on our productivity programs on manufacturing and overall the expected sales growth that then in the second half also as we had more normal i would say spend levels in quarter 4 last year that this plays out and i laid out that in half 2 we will have some very nice margin improvement that leads to the full year guidance of margin improvement now in the midterm i do expect that sg a will be together with manufacturing productivity on cost of goods be the major driver of our margin increases especially innovate medicines to the high 30s and certainly a change in mix somewhat a bit more to virtual digital but still face to face in most markets being important especially for launch initiation but i would expect that sg a is one of the major drivers to continue to improve in the midterm our margin vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks harry and on china jo first to take a step back a few years ago we began an investment effort in china really putting in the necessary infrastructure both in pharma and oncology building out sales forces to really enable us to drive longer term growth and then second we adopted a development strategy to bring our full portfolio of medicines to china as well as including china in our phase 3 programs at the start so that given the changes in the regulatory framework there that would enable us an earlier launch now fast forward today we are growing in the high teens percentages in china overall from a business we re on track on our stated goal to double the size of our china business from the 2020 baseline we expect to be if current trends prevail one of the top three players among multinationals if not more in china by 2024 2025 that s driven primarily by new medicines so overcoming any of the medicines that ultimately get tendered driving our newer portfolio driving the growth we have 50 potential approvals in that time frame continued strong success on the nrdl listings as you saw with consentyx so we expect china to become the second largest market for novartis in the world we see profitable accretive growth being driven from there and we ll continue to look to invest prudently in china over the years to come thanks jo for the question next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from the line of andrew baum from citi please go ahead your line is open andrew baum citi analyst thank you i have a couple of questions please first on kisqali and the natalee trial given the outcome of the penelope b trial with ibrance how comfortable are you that your disease free survival data that you ll have at the end of next year has significant have sufficient duration on it to satisfy the fda without wanting to see further follow up and then second question on business development we ve seen a rash of your competitors doing neurodevelop neurodegenerative deals you ve obviously had the surprising approval of aducanumab how is that influencing your interest in the neurodegenerative space and then if you could also comment on your chairman s recent comments of novartis interest in mrna as a platform many thanks vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah thanks andrew on the kisqali situation john do you want to take that john tsai chief medical officer sure thanks for the question andrew and as we ve taken a look as i said earlier we ve increased the number of patients in our natalee trial from 4 000 to 5 000 including both intermediate and high risk patients as we look at this patient population there s a couple of things that we focus on one is we have a longer treatment duration looking at a duration of three years for the overall treatment so that should give us confidence in the approach we ve also looked at the adherence of patients particularly in the first year as we look at these patients as you know in the early treatment of these patients micrometastatic disease is important and what we ve seen at least across both arms is that the patients are adhering and staying on drug at the 400 milligram dose so with those two specific components we feel comfortable with the readout at the end of next year vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks john and so on business development we of course are watching the changes in the approach to the use of the accelerated approval pathway as we ve already noted in neurodegenerative diseases we have the ongoing program in huntington s disease entering phase 2b and we ll certainly consider how best to potentially bring that forward if there s a way to accelerate regulatory submission assuming positive clinical trials and then also internally we ve had neurodegeneration efforts within the country for many decades as you know and we continue to have programs targeting alzheimer s disease huntington s as well as other neurodegenerative diseases both using biologics rna interference sirnas and asos as well as gene therapies so that will continue no specific comments on bd l in the neurodegenerative space of course we are looking as always for attractive assets to bring in given our broad based efforts in neuroscience on mrna again not much more to add i think we ve watched how mrna continues to have value in the covid space and are curious to see could mrna have applicability more broadly within the vaccine space we have our own ongoing efforts internally obviously with inclisiran in manufacturing for sirnas with pelacarsen with antisense oligonucleotides we re a substantial manufacturer of those technologies and also have internal efforts on rna interference so that work will continue and we ll continue to evaluate if there is any sensible approaches in mrna more broadly but nothing imminent at the moment so thanks andrew for the questions next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from the line of mark purcell from morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open mark purcell morgan stanley analyst yeah thank you very much firstly on kesimpta i wondered if you could give us the nbrx share in the u s currently and then in terms of thinking about those 13 launches anticipated by the end of 2021 how we should think about the advantages and disadvantages of a subcut formulation for a b cell therapy in those launch markets outside the u s and then secondly on inclisiran two parts first part what are your latest thoughts around fda site inspection and how should we think about the future supply split between yourselves and a third party and then you sort of mentioned these new initiatives v initiate and v inception which are kicking off now ahead of outcomes data in 2026 could you elaborate a little bit more on those initiatives and others you are looking to increase the evidence base behind inclisiran before we wait for those outcomes data thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks mark so first on kesimpta subcutaneous outside the u s marie france marie france tschudin president of novartis pharmaceuticals yeah so kesimpta is an important launch for us outside of the u s and if i just if i look at europe alone we ve got 420 000 patients living with ms and many of these patients are on low efficacy therapies actually many more patients are in low efficacy therapies versus the u s so what we also know we re currently working through reimbursement and to accelerate access but what we also know is that a lot of these patients don t have access to infusion centers so our research tells us that physicians and patients will appreciate a self administered high efficacy therapy that can be used in the comfort of a patient s home so right now we re working with each country through their own reimbursement system and we know what we need to do to bring kesimpta as quickly as possible to patients around the globe on your nbrx question currently our nbrx share in the u s is 11 vas narasimhan chief executive officer and i would also note on kesimpta if you look at one case study in the u k our ability to get rapid access there i think demonstrates the value in ex u s markets of the subcutaneous formulation where the overall cost effectiveness of a therapy is high on the system s mind on inclisiran just on the manufacturing side of things in the u s our intention at the moment is to focus production out of our schaftenau novartis owned schaftenau facility we can t predict on whether or not the fda will inspect it s notable that this site is regularly inspected has been recently this very line has been recently inspected by fda using a remote inspection and approved for use in a given indication and so we ll have to see what the fda ultimately determines but i think it s notable that this is a line that s regularly used and inspected by the fda and then in terms of the data initiatives maybe marie france on the efforts to build out data on inclisiran marie france tschudin president of novartis pharmaceuticals yes so i mean you saw some of that on the slide and obviously learning from entresto we know that we need to build evidence generation you know about our efforts on the outcomes data so orion 4 we re also looking at primary prevention studies but we re also looking to complement with the v initiate trial for example on the different ways of accessing inclisiran when it comes to acute coronary syndrome or use or no use of ezetimibe so that s the level of evidence and generation that we want to build around the product so that we can ensure fast uptake mark purcell morgan stanley analyst thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer yes and i just want to add that we continue to work with various important parties so we hope to have updates over the second half of the year on our partnership with the nhs on inclisiran that s something we ve highlighted in the past that will be a very important proof point that inclisiran can be used at a large scale in healthcare systems we re also partnering with major organizations in the united states such as the american heart association and we hope to announce others which i think will also demonstrate that we can generate evidence but also generate large scale utilization volume demand for the medicine so we ll keep you updated as those happen next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from the line of emmanuel papadakis from deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open emmanuel papadakis deutsche bank analyst thanks for taking the question emmanuel from deutsche bank maybe a question on sabatolimab the mds1 deferral effective deferral for pfs readout i think the original fairly long term guidance has been for a filing on the cr readout in the second half of this year so what can we interpret on efficacy from that data monitoring decision or recommendation to continue until the pfs readout unless i m mistaken that s a couple of years away so does that impact your guidance around that being potential blockbuster 1 billion plus indication and then a question on zolgensma you ve given helpful guidance of around 20 newborn screening rates in europe does that inflect next year or is it going to be a relatively slow incremental build how are you progressing in terms of national level discussions about particularly in light of as you said presymptomatic data and then if i may just a quick one on the intrathecal it sounds like not much has changed since q1 i think you said then you had agreement on the trial design you were waiting for the clinical hold to be lifted so is it are those discussions ongoing or has there anything new actually happened in the last few months thanks vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah thanks emmanuel so first on the sabatolimab cr readout john john tsai chief medical officer yeah for the sabatolimab as you know this is our tin 3 compound our first in class io therapy for myelodysplastic syndrome and aml as we designed the study we always had two primary endpoints the first primary endpoint being complete remission and the second endpoint being progression free survival and as we read out the complete remission we reached the number of endpoints in the earlier part of this year at that point the dmc data monitoring committee came back and told us to continue the study as originally planned so you ve seen the slide that was shared earlier by vas in terms of the number of readouts as you ve seen we actually look at not only mds but also aml so as we look at this we do think that this is a differentiated asset for not only for us to think about high risk mds but also aml based on the fact that it has a good safety profile and potentially pending results the efficacy in terms of durability of response so we await the results in 2022 and 23 vas narasimhan chief executive officer and i think emmanuel as we highlighted there s multiple different filing options depending on how the results play out and it doesn t change our belief that the medicine given it s a first in class asset that has a different mechanism than any existing therapy or late stage therapy that can be a significant 1 billion plus medicine on zolgensma on the incremental nbs and how we re doing on newborn screening marie france do you want to say a word about that marie france tschudin president of novartis pharmaceuticals yeah i would just say that so you know that in the u s the newborn screening is high outside the u s i mean it really is a market by market so it s gradual i mean i can give you some information germany will be implemented by from october we ll see parts of belgium screening from the beginning of this year we know that poland is implementing gradually we ve got other countries across europe that are doing this so it s a mixed picture we re very committed to it we know that it s really important to start zolgensma early we saw that from the sprint data and how amazing the results are when babies are treated early so it is a priority for us and then of course medium term our goal is to bring zolgensma to older children once we get the it formulation vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah and just another word on that thanks marie france on the intrathecal there s no update emmanuel we continue to work through resolving the fda s concerns but we do have the protocol finalize agreement with the fda on the phase 3 design or preparing operationally for the study s execution with the belief that that indication can continue to be a multibillion dollar indication for the company and as soon as we have any updates on the preclinical topic and resolution with the fda we ll of course provide it thank you next slide next question operator operator thank you your next question is from the line of richard parkes from exane bnp please go ahead your line is open richard parkes exane bnp paribas analyst hi thanks very much for taking my question just two questions firstly on sales and margins both your expectations for 2q that you set out at the 1q results i just wondered if you could discuss what surprised you positively and confident that those trends will continue given that you haven t updated guidance and i just wondered if you could add your thoughts on impact of the delta variant and maybe whether you ve adjusted your planning or solutions for healthcare systems opening up on the basis of that and then secondly just a question on some of your legacy oncology assets in the u s specifically promacta tasigna and tafinlar if i look at sales per script over the last few quarters at least in the first half it looks like sales per script has been growing in double digits which seems to imply quite significant price increases i just wondered whether you could discuss that trend and whether there are any other factors such as channel mix that might be impacting that thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks richard so first on sales and margins outlook harry harry kirsch chief financial officer yeah the hard the line was a bit hard to understand richard could you briefly repeat vas narasimhan chief executive officer harry i think the question was was there anything that surprised us versus the q the guidance we gave after q1 on how q2 would play out and how do we potentially see the delta variant impacting our guidance for the rest of the year harry kirsch chief financial officer yeah so yeah ok thank you so richard obviously we delivered a bit more than what we thought right so we saw in the u s a bit faster reopening i would say in most of our brands sandoz is pretty much in line with expectation but our innovative medicines some better momentum overall and then also very good work from our manufacturing colleagues on productivity in addition to always perfect levels but overall i would say slightly ahead of our internal expectations in quarter 2 vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah thanks richard i think on the delta variant we continue to monitor the situation what we are expecting is that given that healthcare systems have seen the impact when they have shut down to patients with non communicable diseases and the substantial impact that has we remain optimistic that healthcare systems will ensure that patients get the care they need while dealing with any surges that may or may not happen with respect to covid 19 now on promacta taf mek u s performance susanne susanne schaffert president of novartis oncology yeah thanks a lot and richard on promacta actually we are very very pleased with the performance as you rightly note 18 growth and it s really across all geographies and it is volume driven and it s really still our main indications itp and saa to give you a little bit more granularity on the u s we had 11 growth and maybe just to remind you there was a label update earlier this year that makes promacta even more competitive we are seeing share gains increasing nbrx and of course it is the efficacy driving that it s also the oral convenience and is the nonimmunosuppressive benefit over competitors and therefore a very strong performance ex u s we saw 26 growth versus previous year it s very strong underlying performance in major markets like the eu and also just to mention very strong performance in china where we got the rl listing end of last year so very pleased with promacta similar on tabrecta we could sorry on mekinist tafinlar we could really stabilize market share and are very competitive versus new entries very pleased with the growth also across geographies and also to mention for china we are very pleased we got taf mek included into the nrdl list so really strong growth on volume base across geographies vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks susanne thanks richard next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from the line of seamus fernandez from guggenheim please go ahead your line is open seamus fernandez guggenheim partners analyst great thanks for the question so just two quick ones as we think about the opportunity in mds and for the tin 3 asset i was just hoping if you could give us a little bit more color on the evolution i just wanted to follow up on the previous question and specifically as it relates to the cr response there is that your conclusion there that the proceeding to the pfs benefit is a clear positive moving into the subsequent events or is this just a continuation of the trial which could be viewed as somewhat disappointing on that side of it for the high risk mds patient population the second question obviously you guys are talking quite strongly about the opportunity for asciminib just in the third line setting blockbuster potential can you just talk about that relative is that predominantly relative to bosutinib as sort of the primary opportunity and kind of replacing that asset or replacing that product sales or is it really speaking to a broader opportunity in the third line setting because of potential for duration of use expanding upon how that product is used so far thanks vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah seamus so just in the interest of time on the mds i think with the cr readout i would say neutral to positive i mean neutral is saying because we re blinded so we don t know what the dmc saw but i think the fact that the study will continue now to the next set of endpoints and the positive mechanism that we see in the previous data that we ve seen on the product we remain optimistic that both in mds and aml we can get to positive results and bring meaningful innovation patients as john noted the studies have a range of different designs including a third study that also takes into account venetoclax a doublet and triplet design so i think we have the bases covered and we look forward to getting the additional readouts over the coming year and a half on the sales potential of asciminib susanne do you want to say a word about this susanne schaffert president of novartis oncology yeah i m happy to take that vas and maybe just on the opportunity on sabatolimab just why we are very excited is because it s a completely novel mechanism it s a tim 3 so has the potential to be the first immuno oncology therapy in hematology in mds and aml and why we believe that is important is because obviously there is now has been made progress on having more efficacious treatments but what we all know durability and also safety profile is still remaining challenging and therefore we are very excited that sabatolimab would have this attribute to add really huge value to this medical need and on asciminib to maybe lead you a little bit through just to remind you a little bit on the dynamics in cml so there is still 10 to 15 of patients that progress to third line but what you also have to know there is a significant number of patients that remain in second line just because of lack of options for these patients moving to third line what we still see is a 75 failure rate which of course is devastating and that s why there is still a big percentage of patients sitting in second line even if treatment is not optimal so therefore you see that is the pool we are targeting and we also with asciminib expect longer duration of the current treatment so that is where potential comes from and i think we still underestimate the earlier lines potential of course we have changed completely the outcome of cml but as i said in first line usually patients are started on imatinib and there s 50 of patients that relapsed what you also have to know that 30 of first line patients having issues with adverse events and really are struggling for such a long term treatment and that s where with the profile of asciminib we expect to also add value there and that s why we re also entering into first line vas narasimhan chief executive officer great thanks susanne thanks seamus next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from the line of kerry holford from berenberg please go ahead your line is open kerry holford berenberg analyst thank you a couple for me please harry just on the second half outlook you obviously raised the pharmaa form operating profit growth guide in the slide today but you re not updating the gross guidance for the group and although you ve not changed the outlook for sandoz in the second half what is it within this division that problems continued caution for that second half outlook just by those improvements you ve seen in q2 and then on inclisiran just i think a question was asked on this earlier but just to clarify what are your plans on the manufacturing of that drug in the future can you remind us where the ex u s supply is manufactured should we understand that the global manufacturing sites is now the austrian site or should we anticipate further significant investment at some point perhaps in the u s thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer yes thanks kerry so first on the sandoz outlook on the second half harry harry kirsch chief financial officer yes thank you kerry so we have to remember how quarter 1 and quarter 2 have developed here so clearly you saw a very steep decline of quarter 1 and then you saw that 5 growth of sandoz in the second quarter but underlying if you take the prior year is talking about minus 1 so we saw as expected a stabilization but we have a first half with a 5 decline so in order to be at the low to mid single digit decline in the full year we continue to expect stabilization around broadly in line for the second half for sandoz and i think that is at this moment a very reasonable assumption of course we can all make scenarios around cough and cold and flu season in quarter 4 and the market dynamics for that we have taken the midpoint scenario on this so overall i would say of course volatility given the covid situation and how the cough and cold season would be but overall i would say our guidance is quite starting from a minus 5 decline in half 1 quite reasonable that sandoz would stabilize they have a few first five launches in the second half so that helps we have to see also how the pricing in the u s continues to develop so i would say not all were overly cautious but realistic vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks harry and then kerry on manufacturing it s important to note when you take a step back our overall goal is to have novartis be the primary manufacturing of both the upstream and downstream parts of this sirna for inclisiran and we ve made the necessary investments to do that we have substantial manufacturing capacity to synthesize the sirna and then as we ve noted we in the u s we ll move to using our facility and over time globally the primary manufacturing will be done out of novartis facilities being supplemented by cmos as needed the primary reason to do this is one we believe the medicine will be as we ve noted one of our most significant medicines and then second from a cogs standpoint our goal is to drive significantly down the cost of goods to enable large scale use of the medicine in the secondary prevention study and eventually perhaps in the primary prevention study right now ex u s we do use third parties for both the primary and the secondary but again over time the evolution will be the novartis owned facilities and those investments have already been either started or completed thanks kerry next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from peter welford from jefferies please go ahead your line is open peter welford jefferies analyst hi thanks for taking my question just 2 please firstly on oncology just looking at some of the hospital administered drugs in particular and also some of those that require either biomarker diagnostic companion diagnostics to use it actually looks as though the second quarter for some of those drugs is sort of relatively weak compared to the first quarter there certainly wasn t sort of an uptick i m thinking the likes of kymriah and lutathera for instance also as well i think things like even to break and other drugs i wonder if you could just comment on what you re seeing there with regards to why i guess we re not seeing q on q improvements in oncology and how we should think about that perhaps in the second half of the year and the gating factors and then secondly i just want to come back to harry s comments that we could reach the higher end of the outlook ranges that covid situation remains fluid should we take that to mean that if covid situation pans out as we currently see the higher end of the range is where we should be thinking or should we take that as thinking that you just don t know and you still see uncertainty i guess curious sort of where you re thinking with regards to the current covid situation and whether the situation has to deteriorate significantly for that to be not valid thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks peter so just briefly susanne on the hospital administered oncology susanne schaffert president of novartis oncology yeah thank you vas and thank you peter for the question so as i mentioned in my presentation these areas that you mentioned hospital initiated areas but also of course where you have new launches this is still impacted by covid especially when you look at the u s that only 75 of patients are back versus pre covid levels so we still like a fourth or a quarter of patients volume that we usually saw and that is impacting for example diagnostics it s impacting screening and that s of course tabrecta would be such a brand where you see lower biopsies you see lower testing reit rates overall i have to say when you look within the ones that are tested tabrecta and testing for cmet is increasing but it s just suppressed patient volumes and this is same what we see for hospital initiated product just to give you some figures on kymriah as i said 19 versus previous year but we saw that especially in the u s the whole class saw a reduced demand and while we stay very competitive with kymriah and that is really linked to recent also manufacturing success rate that customers are very pleased about it s really the demand that we saw in the whole class going down and on lutathera there is some early positive signs in the u s we have seen growth versus previous year as some now referrals are started but it s still very very suppressed and we remain confident that with now the market opening up centers taking more patients in this should improve and accelerate vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah thanks susanne and then peter on the outlook as harry noted it s multiple dynamics of course we re monitoring but if the business dynamics continue as we currently see them if oncology can continue its recovery if sandoz remains in a stable situation given the strong growth we re seeing in our growth drivers there s certainly the potential for us to be at the higher end of the guidance and we ll of course keep you updated in quarter 3 next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from the line of laura sutcliffe from ubs please go ahead your line is open laura sutcliffe ubs analyst hello thanks first question is on leqvio please have you dosed any patients in the u k under your program there yet i think you said the program was starting this quarter and what setting will those early doses be given and are these patients being seen in the hospital or have you managed to get it into primary care from the word go and then second question is just on entresto could you maybe talk a little bit about the uptake in the past population vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah thanks laura so first on leqvio the agreement we re still working through the final stages with the nhs so we have not yet dosed patients in the u k the agreement though has the aspiration that this would be rolled out in primary care from day 1 at scale trying to address the ascvd population and get the u k toward its long term goal in cardiovascular health so we hopefully we ll have updates in the coming months on that pioneering initiative which we hope will catalyze leqvio s global impact over the coming years on entresto half of that and i ll just start taking the questions given the time entresto half of that we do see i think the uptake already and you can see that in the nbrx but it s still early days and i think as we continue the rollout in the education as well as the awareness on the guidelines we would expect to see continued growth for entresto we see a strong outlook for the brand we re confident we ll be in that 4 billion to 5 billion range and as we continue to see the trajectory we ll provide further updates on the long term outlook for entresto in the coming months thanks laura next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from tim anderson from wolfe research please go ahead your line is open tim anderson wolfe research analyst thank you on consentyx thinking about bimekizumab they ve gotten some good exposure recently with publication of their data in the new england journal beats your product on efficacy has a one side effect of oral candidiasis how much do you think this product will impact consentyx and do you think that one side effect is a material impairment to their product in your view and then on tislelizumab your partnered pd 1 how realistically will we compete in a setting like lung in western markets can you and your partner assure us you won t be disruptive on price i ask because u s markdowns for price erosion over time in the category i m wondering if it s going to be driving vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah so first on cosentyx when you look at the dynamics we ve been able to take on competition consistently over the recent years continue to grow the brand double digit as marie france said to 20 plus that s driven both in dermatology and in rheumatology we know the additional competitors coming in i can t comment specifically on bimekizumab but we do think that consentyx very clean safety profile the fact that it s used in such a broad range of dermatology offices and consistently across patient types its ability to address scalp palmoplantar psoriasis as well as the joint manifestations and the fact that we have additional indications we re not concerned by additional il 17 entrants and really our focus now given that we ve been able to effectively hold price in the u s market despite some disruptive attempts we are confident now that our focus has to be on the next wave of indications to drive this brand well beyond the 5 billion benchmark we ve already put out there on tislelizumab you ve seen the esophageal cancer filing we re moving toward first and second line non small cell lung cancer we do believe that the we are able to market this medicine from a competitive standpoint given our long presence particularly outside the u s but also in the u s we ll be prudent in how we think about the pricing but we do think we can make a compelling value proposition longer term real opportunity for us is in combination we ll be taking forward tislelizumab in combination with our shp2 inhibitor in combination with some of our rlt agents among other opportunities and so we re going to work to both maximize on the combination side as well as take as much as we can of a very large pd 1 market given the broad range of indications we expect the agent to have thanks tim next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from the line of simon baker from redburn please go ahead your line is open simon baker redburn analyst thanks for taking my question two please if i may just going back to leqvio i wonder if you could give us some idea of the ramp to 300 000 patients given the unusual situation you have there having not only agreed reimbursement but also utilization and then secondly moving on to sandoz harry you gave the principal drivers for expansion of the im margin over time i wonder if you could do the same for the sandoz margin thanks so much vas narasimhan chief executive officer yes thanks simon so for leqvio in the u k it s going to be driven by our ability to work with the u k to get primary care physicians to diagnose these patients out of the ms data systems and then rapidly get them on to leqvio i think it will be a slow initial ramp and then we hope to see a rapid ramp up in the u s we ve done a very good job of targeting the relevant integrated health systems to hopefully be prepared to have a reasonable uptake initially but again it will take time to get those centers on board in parallel we ll also have a traditional launch with our traditional sales and marketing approach leveraging the entresto field force and reach so on approval in the u s we ll go very obviously out very strongly it will take time to get the brand up and then once we think we get momentum we expect the brand as we ve guided to to be a very significant multibillion dollar medicine for the company midterm sandoz margins will be driven by a portfolio shift with the biosimilars portfolio large number of biosimilars in the mid 20s we expect to get forward get into the market and some of the first in class first hopefully to markets such as natalizumab among others and then on top of that the ability to launch additional injectables and oral solids while continuing to drive down cost of goods so you ll have a mix shift to higher margin products as well as the continued efficiency gains and cost of goods and then lastly richard and team are working hard to optimize the manufacturing and sales set of leveraging digital technologies and i think that will be the other element that will help us get to those mid to high 20s margins in sandoz thanks simon next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from steve scala from cowen please go ahead your line is open steve scala cowen co analyst thank you i have 2 questions first on avxs 101 can any findings from the preclinical intrathecal safety studies be shared with us today so that s the first question and then on the second question relates to the kisqali adjuvant interim look in natalee i m curious if this look has already occurred if it has then it would seem to be a material update and you would have announced it so i assume that it has not yet occurred but please confirm thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer yeah thanks steve on avxs 101 it the preclinical data we ve seen to date do not indicate any concerns however we need to complete the relevant assessments and of course ultimately agree with fda and the listing of clinical hold and so we ll keep you updated as that progresses the natalee interim has not occurred but as we ve guided to we re no longer guiding to interim analysis timings and we re focusing on the final outcomes john as you mentioned earlier in the call we expect that to be in the back half of next year and of course as we learn more in that study we ll keep you updated thanks steve next question operator operator thank you your next question comes from the line of naresh chouhan from intron health please go ahead your line is open naresh chouhan intron health analyst hi there thanks for taking my question just 2 please in the u k we recently seen increased structure hospitals partly due to covid and partly because of the record patient we ve seen electives and oncology appointments being delayed as a result are you seeing early signs or anything similar in the u s as you go into a few states where hospitalizations are rising pretty quickly i m just wondering whether or not that have you seen early signs of that in the u s and secondly on asciminib do you expect s food interaction to be flat on the label given to the earlier studies and how do you expect that to be up especially with the generic price probably in the market launch thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer yes thanks naresh on the u s we currently don t see any shifts in utilization or better notable other than what we already stated in the call oncology is below pre covid levels cardiovascular is also below pre covid levels so entresto continues to have very strong performance and patients with heart failure seem to be getting the medicine as expected so nothing that we can flag at this point and also the clinical trials are enrolling on time so we have learned a lot about managing i think the healthcare systems have learned a lot about managing covid we ve learned a lot of them managing our trials and the uptake of our medicines during covid so hopefully we can navigate this next period successfully but certainly something we re watching very very closely i think it s too soon to comment on specifics on asciminib s label i would note that the safety profile was remarkably clean when you look at the it was a head to head study versus bosutinib across all relevant safety markers it was a very clean profile patient stayed on drug so we re optimistic that overall the asciminib profile will be attractive which is a part of the reason as well as susanne mentioned we re quite confident that if it ultimately proves superior can be a very effective first line therapy next question operator thanks naresh operator thank you your next question comes from martial descoutures from oddo bhf please go ahead your line is open martial descoutures oddo bhf analyst good afternoon thank you for taking my question i would like to come back on the sandoz business and thank you for your previous answer on the h2 we understand the next step with the top line improvement driven by the pipeline with biosimilars and the section of complete generics but could you share with us your vision on the improvement of the ratability in midterm do you see any concrete operation or leverage on the cost or due to the improvement of the top line expected and the affiliated cost plus the price erosion should we consider stabilization of this activity for the next year if you could give us more color maybe to help us to manage the core ebit margin in the next quarters and years thank you very much vas narasimhan chief executive officer yes martial i fully picked up the question but i ll give my best answer so when you look at sandoz evolution over time from a margin standpoint first right now our goal is to invest and create a very strong pipeline performance in this period of time both biosimilars and oral solids so in the coming years you re not going to see big shifts in the margin or the operating leverage but our belief is given richard is driving very strong efficiency gains across all the relevant p l items and we continue to expect important pipeline delivery in biosimilars in respiratory and oral solids when that pipeline delivery happens then we expect the margin in the midterm to be accretive and move up into that mid to high 20s so the shape is going to be stable for the period next few years and then we expect acceleration in margin improvement for sandoz as that portfolio ultimately comes through so i think that s the best way to think about it and i think that was the we have one more question operator so operator could we go to the last question thank you operator thank you your last question today comes from keyur parekh from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open keyur parekh goldman sachs analyst thank you and thank you for taking my questions vas if i may your introductory comments on sandoz talking about the strategic vision in the long term almost like setting the narrative for a 2022 decision on the longer term outlook for sandoz am i overinterpreting your comments or is that the time frame in which we should expect a broad decision on whether sandoz is a part of novartis and not longer term that s question number one and then question number two we are getting very close to on an annualized basis kind of the peak sales numbers you provided for cosentyx and kind of entresto so i m wondering kind of why we haven t seen updated kind of peak sales estimates for those two products is there anything from a competitive or market perspective that worries you or was this just not the right opportunity for to for you to address the longer term peak opportunity for those products thank you vas narasimhan chief executive officer thanks keyur good to hear from you on sandoz there s no updates or changes i mean our goal right now is to put sandoz in a strong position to invest in the business so that it can be on a track to be the leading generics company in the world which we think it can be from a financial as well as impact standpoint if and when we take any decisions or start a process we ll of course let you know but right now our focus is on the operational performance of sandoz and supporting richard and his team to driving that mid single digit growth and margin expansion that we ve outlined i think on your second question i think we are very pleased with the trajectory of entresto and cosentyx you are correct if we re approaching the sales outlook of 4 billion to 5 billion we guided to in entresto and 5 billion plus in cosentyx our current plan is that meet the management will provide an updated outlook on both of those brands especially as we understand better the dynamics but certainly would want to highlight we are confident in both of those brands to be very strong pillars of novartis in the years to come so thanks everyone for joining today s conference call apologies we ran a bit over we ll keep you updated thank you for the interest in the company and please stay safe and healthy and we look forward to speaking soon thank you operator duration 100 minutes call participants samir shah global head investor relations vas narasimhan chief executive officer marie france

officer scott kirby president brett hart executive vice president and chief commercial officer andrew nocella and executive vice president and chief financial officer gerry laderman in addition we have other members of the executive team on the line available to assist with the q a and now i d like to turn the call over to scott scott kirby chief executive officer thanks kristina good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today it was great to see many of you in person at our united next event last month in new york and personally it s been great to be back out on the road during the quarter talking to employees and customers and hearing anecdote after anecdote about how great it is to be back traveling thank you also to all the people of united airlines for all that they did to take care of our customers and each other through the crisis and for all that they re doing now to really and truly change the customer experience at united airlines before i really begin i thought i d take a moment to address the most talked about issue among airline investors recently the delta variant as you ll hear from our bullishness today we haven t seen any impact at all on bookings which continue to just get stronger and stronger every week but of course that is backwards looking data since early 2020 however no airline has been more willing to candidly acknowledge the risk and challenges posed by covid 19 and importantly no airline has been quicker to aggressively confront them than united we ve worked hard to protect that operational flexibility in fact it s part of why we haven t had the same mass group cancellation challenges that our competitors have faced as we ramped our schedule over the last couple of months that all said we think the most likely outcome is that the continued recovery in demand continues largely unabated that s the most likely and logical outcome because the evidence is overwhelming that someone who is vaccinated is highly protected against severe disease hospitalization and death the un vaccinated still face an elevated risk of serious illness and death from covid 19 in fact recent reporting says that over 97 of hospitalizations are for un vaccinated people which implies that you re about 50 times more likely to wind up in the hospital for covid if you re un vaccinated but the un vaccinated are also a smaller and shrinking percentage of the general population and an even smaller minority among the most vulnerable groups and for united airlines specifically our customer surveys at the end of june also revealed that 84 of our mileageplus members were already fully vaccinated and so while we expect case count to rise given the vaccination rates they will still remain well below the peak and hospitalizations and deaths will not rise nearly as much that leads to the logical outcome that the reopening continues on track i d acknowledge that shutting down or continuing the reopening also has a political dimension to it and that s a lot harder to predict and so it s possible we will have a temporary pullback in the reopening but given the data science around vaccines that seems like a lower probability outcome and regardless it will be temporary even if it does happen turning now back to our results gerry and andrew will provide a lot more detail but if i was going to briefly summarize where things stand right now i d say the demand is recovering even faster than we had hoped domestically both leisure and business demand and internationally we see the exact same pattern every time new borders are reopened and while the us isn t yet opened to europeans the data and science including the demonstrated safety of air travel similar vaccination and case rate and similar level of variance in europe and the us support an opening and we expect it to happen at some point and when the borders do open we expect to see the same robust hockey stick increase in demand that we ve already seen domestically on the cost front we remain on target for the near and long term and as gerry will detail assuming the grounded 777s are back flying we expect our 2022 casm ex will be lower than 2019 which means we re right on track to deliver casm ex that s 4 lower in 2023 and 8 lower in 2026 as we shared at our united next event last month today with the robust demand trends that we see and our return to profitability we don t just see the light at the end of the tunnel we re exiting the tunnel we re focused on upgauging our hub significantly improving the product and decommoditizing air travel by transforming our customers onboard experience this opportunity is unique to united it is why we re so confident in our 2023 and 2026 financial targets as we exit the tunnel there is still a steep hill to climb to get back to and then exceed our pre covid margins but we also have some important upcoming tailwinds that will benefit united more than others first our coastal hubs and our decision which stands alone among network large network carriers not to retire widebody aircraft means that we are ready to capture the pent up demand for long haul international travel second our opportunity to upgauge our fleet while also driving increased connectivity as part of united next means we can accelerate the margin improvements we saw from investments in the mid con hubs in 2018 and 19 and of course our confidence in united s future is also fueled by the incredible performance of the united team even in the midst of a global pandemic our nps scores rocketed up 30 points year over year and our 50 point year over year improvement in the j d power survey was the largest of any us airlines this customer centric service culture and an influx of nearly 500 new aircraft along with an unprecedented retrofit of our existing narrowbody will transform our customers experience it will also usher an incredible new post pandemic era for united s customers employees and shareholders creating a new era driven by innovation that makes the travel experience better and i m really proud of the work the team did in the second quarter to innovate with customers and our employees and with that i ll turn it to brett brett j hart president thanks scott i want to start by congratulating the entire united family on our expected return to profitability in the second half of this year the united team has worked toward this milestone of achieving positive adjusted pre tax income for over a year and could not be more proud during the second quarter united continued our work to make the travel experience safer and more convenient for our customers we recently made new enhancements to our already industry leading app to allow customers to schedule covid 19 tests and have results directly verified through the travel ready center platform within the united app in may we announced a first of its kind collaboration to use abbott s covid 19 home test and app to enable our customers to self administer a rapid antigen test and use the verified negative test result to board an international flight to the united states as borders continue to open we are working to make the return to international travel as convenient as possible for our customers these initiatives make us uniquely ready to facilitate international travel and further position us as the leading international airline in the us in addition we recently launched our your shot to fly sweepstakes working effectively with the federal government to creatively encourage people to get vaccinated and ultimately get back on planes again we feel optimistic from the recent progress among european countries allowing us tourists to enter the various to enter with various vaccine and testing requirements countries such as iceland croatia greece italy france and spain have all began accepting us travelers for the summer tourist season and we look forward to more destination options for our customers in the coming months we continue to encourage the biden administration to open up international travel and appreciate the bipartisan as well as industry support to ease international travel restrictions and andrew will detail further the demand surges we ve seen to countries once restrictions are loosened gives us even greater confidence regarding the long term outlook for international travel on the domestic side all states have reopened local economies and removed travel restrictions enabling the surge in domestic leisure travel we re currently seeing we remain focused on united s transformation to be the airline customers choose to fly we have already eliminated change fees and with our new aircraft order we will improve the customer experience we re adding seatback entertainment to all of our aircraft improving wi fi and innovating with customer friendly technology like like connectionsaver which saved over 140 000 connections in the second quarter news from washington d c continues to be a focal point for united we are encouraged by the bipartisan efforts to make needed investments in our nation s infrastructure infrastructure is the backbone of our economy and it must be robust sustainable and resilient to meet the needs of today and tomorrow we support modernizing our nation s air traffic control system and advancing sustainable aviation fuel as important aviation infrastructure investment that also reduce industry emissions moving on to other highlights within our global network at united we continue to be a proud partner for our communities throughout the quarter we expanded efforts to support those impacted by covid 19 crisis in india united remain the only us carrier to serve india a distinction we hold to date and help transport more than 300 000 pounds of critical medical supplies to the region we additionally launched a fundraising effort to enable our customers to donate to relief partners in the quarter we announced new initiatives with multiple partners to advance our sustainable goals across the united states these partnerships cover a range of sustainable initiatives including decarbonization sustainable aviation fuel and sustainable agriculture during the quarter we also announced a new order with boom supersonic for the overture the first large commercial aircraft optimized to run on 100 sustainable aviation fuel we also announced our latest investment under united airlines ventures and heart aerospace an electric aircraft start up developing an aircraft that has the potential to fly customers up to 250 miles before the end of this decade united continues to lead the industry with a multipronged approach to our commitment to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions by 100 by 2050 without relying on traditional offsets and we look forward to more to come on this front and with that i will turn it over to andrew andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer thanks brett i m going to start off today by thanking the best commercial team in the business our combined efforts and agility over the last 18 months led us to this moment today announcing the generally positive trasm prasm and yield outlook for the second half of 2021 something hard to imagine just 12 months ago the revenue outlook is allowing for a much improved and profitable financial results on adjusted pre tax basis for the second half of the year and gerry will talk about that in just a bit our realistic view of the pandemic s impact on our business and industry was sometimes questioned however a realistic assessment from day one combined with capacity corresponding to real demand not what we hoped demand would be were the keys and prepared us for what comes next we ll let facts guide us the entire way and i m pleased to report today the facts point to a strong recovery of our business across all segments as scott said we re coming out of the tunnel we now have a clearer path not only to profitability in the near term but a path to higher long term margins even in an environment with elevated industry domestic capacity during the crisis we are pleased with our trasm performance and in the second quarter our trasm was down 11 versus 2019 our performance in q2 is well ahead of our original guidance but largely consistent with our updated mid quarter expectations international long haul demand business demand and yields just improved faster than expected three months ago we still face significant headwinds for the second half with borders being closed and business traffic not fully back but ultimately we expect these headwinds will transition to tail our ability to adjust our global network to transport record amounts of cargo is one of our proudest accomplishments and a clear differentiator versus others in fact during the quarter united generated 606 million in cargo revenues our highest cargo revenue quarter ever up 105 from 2q 2019 with long haul passenger demand now increasing we will cease most of these cargo only flights for the remainder of 2021 although we continue to project strong cargo yields for the remainder of this year during the crisis we also carefully planned and collaborated across divisions to execute a bounce back plan for the second half of 2021 our summer capacity plan continued a measured phase in of that capacity for q3 we expect system capacity to down 26 versus q3 of 2019 up about 39 versus capacity flown in q2 we expect domestic capacity to be down about 20 versus q3 2019 and up 43 versus q2 business travel which was down over 90 versus 2019 for most of q2 has inflected sharply in june it s currently down about 60 versus pre pandemic levels we expect two more inflection points in business demand first at the end of the summer and second the new budget cycle beginning in january we expect business demand to improve by the end of the third quarter to be down about 40 to 45 versus 2019 our recent survey of business customers now indicate over 90 plan to return to travel including international travel in the second half of 21 that is up from around 55 earlier this year on our last conference call we talked about the fact that domestic yields for united will be positive this summer and that we still expect it to be the that we still expect that to be the case overall domestic yields are still likely to be slightly negative in the quarter due to business traffic slower recovery to give you some color on yield q3 right now booked domestic yields today are running ahead of 2019 that higher yield is also matched with higher booked load factors relative to 2019 we really have set ourselves up from an rm perspective very well international demand is also recovering but as we anticipated at a slower rate for q3 we expect international capacity to be down 36 versus 2019 relative to down 53 in q2 the demand bounce back does differ considerably by cabin and by region and even within the region depending on travel restrictions while business demand is down we ve used special incentives to get our mileageplus members back onboard with better access to polaris seats via awards and upgrades asia was the first region to be impacted by covid and continues to be the slowest to recover there is the largest number of border restrictions it will likely be 2023 at least until we see a normal schedule to asia in the meantime our global network already includes new service to india and africa to compensate for reduced asian flying our european schedule this summer is quickly ramping back up however with continued restrictions on europeans from entering the us and on us travelers from entering key countries in europe including the uk we anticipate that it will be the spring of 2022 prior to resuming a normal schedule we expect our summer atlantic load factors to be around 70 in 2021 16 points lower than 2019 i have to add that we think the summer of 2022 across the atlantic has the potential to be our best season ever with pent up demand and easing border restrictions we continue to see structural changes in global long haul flying that we believe will create tailwinds for united as borders continue to open we expect to have 30 incremental widebody jets available to schedule in the summer of 2022 versus 2019 which is why our recent aircraft order we re focused on narrow body aircraft only we continue to operate our 767 fleet which we used just a few weeks ago to begin service to croatia the optimal plane for this type of mission overall we expect that our trasm for q3 will be positive premier members of the mileageplus program are rapidly returning to flying on united a great sign for 2022 business demand year to date three quarters of our top premier members have already flown with us or have booked a flight of the premier members that have not planned to fly yet our research shows that they tend to be fliers focused largely on global long haul markets that simply haven t opened up yet many of our premier members are also maintaining an active spend on one of our credit cards increasing the level of program engagement in 2021 among our top members to more than 90 our chase co brand card programs are thriving our june 2021 new accounts domestic sales and account retention metrics all exceed june 2019 figures i just want to also spend a few moments today talking about united next united next is simply our acceleration of many of our pre pandemic strategies it s a plan to close the short gaps in our commercial strategies customer focus and passenger amenities most importantly our plan is for gates to increase by 30 by 2026 50 seat rjs allowed united to grow schedule depth as we built our mid con hubs but it s now time to replace many of these jets with modern and more fuel efficient 737s and a321s lowering our unit costs and increasing profits while at the same time increasing our product quality with amenities such as seatback entertainment at every seat and larger overhead bins most importantly united next is not about increasing seat density in planes reducing comfort lowering onboard amenities or reducing the number of first class or economy plus extra legroom seats as others have done in fact our premium seat counts will increase by 75 in north america per departure by 2026 versus 2019 and of course that s aligned with the revenue potential of our united hubs united next will allow us to differentiate and decommoditize our network segment our products and put customers first but also maintain fair competitiveness with low cost competitors while offering a superior product we re excited to come out the other side of this tunnel and plan for an amazing and bright future i d like to thank the entire united team for their efforts as well together we ve made an amazing difference with that i ll turn it over to gerry and he ll talk about our financial results for q2 and the outlook for q3 gerry gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer thanks andrew good morning everyone for the second quarter of 2021 we reported a pre tax loss of 600 million and an adjusted pre tax loss of 1 6 billion our adjusted ebitda margin for the second quarter ended down 10 7 in line with our prior guidance with our adjusted ebitda margin a positive 9 for the month of june our adjusted operating expenses for the second quarter ended down 32 versus the second quarter of 2019 which was slightly worse than prior guidance of down 33 the entire difference though is attributable to greater fuel consumption and higher fuel prices as compared to what we anticipated when we provided second quarter guidance all of our other costs came in as we expected giving us continuing confidence in our ability to achieve our near term and long term cost targets as previously noted as the demand environment continues to improve we expect to generate positive adjusted pre tax income in the month of july in fact as we have said we expect to generate positive adjusted pre tax income for both the third quarter and fourth quarter this year despite business and long haul international demand not being fully recovered we are pleased that our return to profitability is expected to occur well before prior expectations and we anticipate another step function improvement once business and international demand fully return turning to our outlook on costs we expect our third quarter casm ex to be up approximately 17 versus the same period in 2019 with capacity down 26 versus 2019 to put the casm ex number in perspective while capacity may be down 26 we are not simply flying 26 less of the same network given our current international and domestic mix where we are currently flying more short haul domestic flights and combined with the temporary grounding of our fleet of pratt powered 777 widebody aircraft this has created an incremental 6 point headwind to our casm ex because of lower stage length and lower gauge versus 2019 our cost outlook additionally includes investments necessary for future flying such as training and maintenance costs on the positive side embedded in this outlook is also the early success from our 2 billion structural cost savings plan we expect casm ex will better represent our true cost performance once our capacity reverts back to 2019 levels and when the network begins to be reshaped with our united next plan and we achieve the full implementation of our cost initiatives we are currently in our 2022 planning process and though we won t share details today we feel confident that our 2022 casm ex will be lower than 2019 we expect that our 2022 outlook demonstrates substantial progress toward hitting our long term casm ex targets of down 4 in 2023 and down 8 in 2026 versus 2019 in addition to the structural cost reductions our united next targets are enabled by our recent announced order for 270 new narrowbody aircraft which when added to our existing order book provide them with 500 narrowbody aircraft on firm order we expect 191 of these aircraft to be delivered through the end of 2023 and for those of you in the aircraft financing community this includes 13 737 max 8s through the remainder of this year 20 max 8s and 20 max 9s in 2022 and 56 max 8s 15 max 9s 50 max 10s and 16 a321neos in 2023 regarding capital expenditures this year we currently expect adjusted capex for the full year to run about 4 5 billion this assumes we take delivery of all eight 787 10 aircraft scheduled for later this year with boeing s recent announcement regarding delays in delivering 787 it is possible that some of these aircraft and the related capex may slip into next year in closing our expectation for adjusted pre tax profitability in both the third and fourth quarters represent a milestone that the entire united family has worked toward since the beginning of the pandemic gone are the days of talking about empty aircraft cash burn and job losses we have now shifted our focus fully toward the long term path for united airlines and united next plan we believe our achievement throughout the crisis fully prepared us to execute on our plan to both maximize earning power and be the airline that customers choose to fly and with that i ll hand it over to kristina to start the q a kristina munoz director investor relations okay thank you gerry we will now take analyst questions please limit yourself to one question and if needed one follow up question brandon please describe the procedure to ask a question questions and answers operator thanks kristina and from raymond james we have savi syth please go ahead savanthi syth raymond james analyst hey good morning everyone your 3q revenue guide is very strong and both relative to 2q and compared to one of your peers i was wondering what factors are driving that strength and what suffered during the assumptions you re building in for that business demand recovery thanks andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer hi savi it s andrew good morning what i d say about our guide is that and i ve said this i think over the last few conference calls that in particular our coastal hubs have really suffered during the pandemic traffic goes down and those hubs a lot more than mid cons and small community are mid con hubs and small communities around the country and we really see an acceleration in demand now out of those hubs including leisure and business for business for domestic in particular which is really great to see and it goes to say again that those headwinds which were so significant during the crisis are going to flip to tailwinds for united and provide us i think a lot of opportunity kind of going forward a little more color for example newark in q2 of this year was really our worst performing revenue hub and we expect newark in q3 to be one of our best to give you a little bit more color on what we re seeing there so there s a lot more to come i think i m really excited about this because these headwinds were just so significant during the crisis and i think they will be tailwinds as we come out of the crisis savanthi syth raymond james analyst andrew just a follow up too just it seems like you did a lot better job of also kind of tilting toward leisure vfr lately maybe not similarly at some other airlines but just wondering what mix of those new markets or capacity remain on as things normalize and just really trying to understand if there is an opportunity here to change the seasonality of the network andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer excellent question and thank you for the vote of confidence there i m sure our scheduling folks really appreciate it we did as i would say tilt our capacity toward more leisure oriented markets during the crisis and we continue to do so and will do so for at least the rest of this year and tilting of those asms toward more leisure oriented markets i think has helped us during this recovery to the extent we did that better than others i think our revenue forecast will be better than others and so we re pretty proud of that we do intend to keep a bigger footprint in these leisure markets going forward in particular florida where united was undersized and that undersizing had led to q1 results for united that could seasonally trail others and we re hopeful that on the other side of this crisis as we rebuild the airline and we rebuild the network we re going to build this better and we re going to be a bigger player in these leisure oriented markets in the q1 time period than we have historically been operator and from bank of america we have andrew didora please go ahead andrew didora bank of america merrill lynch analyst good morning everyone just really kind of a follow on to savi s question on revenues maybe andrew can you maybe talk about how the booking curve has sort of changed over the course of 2q now into 3q i would assume you have a lot more visibility today in terms of your 3q revenue outlook as compared to back in april and is there any color you can maybe give us in terms of what percentage of your anticipated 3q revenues are already booked right now and how that compares to normal periods andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer sure everything is starting to return to normal which is great to see so right now about 60 of our revenue for q3 is on the books and we have obviously i think a really good visibility in july and august and in particular i d say august looks really quite good september we have less visibility into but we still feel very bullish about that as business traffic returns so overall things are returning to normal the booking curve isn t exactly normal yet but it is quickly getting there particularly from the domestic point of view so hopefully that takes care of your question but again about 60 is booked and i ll also add that we do expect positive prasm in all three months for the domestic entity for the quarter andrew didora bank of america merrill lynch analyst got it that s helpful and then maybe gerry you called out the casm impact from the staging gauge differential here in 3q of 6 point should we think about that as a similar impact on trasm as well gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer yeah stage and gauge obviously impact all those stats so there is going to be some impact as well on trasm andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer i ll add there is but the dilemma we face from a capacity point of view is the 777 aircraft that are grounded are large capacity domestic movers and we use those for hawaii and hub to hub and so right now we re flying well below where we d like to be in hawaii and it goes without saying that hawaii is an incredibly strong part of our network and so we would have absorbed that and i think we would have still done very well in hawaii even with those extra seats so we re really disappointed they are missing and then domestically within the continental united states on the hub to hub missions where our load factors are just off the charts we are the simple way to describe it is like clog in the system because we don t have enough gauge between our hubs to flow the appropriate number of passengers over them so we really want those aircraft back and we think those aircraft are really important to our casm but they also unlock at least right now in hawaii better results and they unlock a lot more connecting traffic through our domestic system so hopefully that gives you color as to how we think it impacts casm as well as trasm operator and from j p morgan we have jamie baker please go ahead jamie baker j p morgan analyst hey good morning everybody so scott kind of a follow up to a question i asked you in new york at the event a couple of weeks ago i noted that bad things seem to happen to the industry every 10 years or so so as it relates to the 2026 guide it looks like we re probably in the clear anyhow the follow up scott kirby chief executive officer actually definitely glad to have full perspective jamie baker j p morgan analyst yeah so you have these financial targets you have your largest aircraft order in history if we do hit some sort of a speed bump do you sacrifice the targets or do you adjust the capex and the delivery schedule basically is the order book sacred or is it a lever you can pull to protect the financial targets just trying to better understand the priority there scott kirby chief executive officer well i ll actually let gerry start jamie baker j p morgan analyst okay gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer yes jamie yeah as we said at that event certainly starting in 2024 we have enough flexibility in the order book to be able to adjust based on what the macro environment would dictate so that s a decision we can make as we approach the later years of this scott kirby chief executive officer and i just would add also that we i think we ve created a track record and it is certainly true that we are committed to targets when we put targets out there we re committed to achieving those targets and we re going to achieve our 2023 and 2026 targets and if that requires adjustments in the plan one way or another we ll make adjustments to make sure that we achieve those targets andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer and jamie one of the nice things about this order as well as our fleet that has some aircraft as you know that are aging simply replacing those aircraft and not doing anything else helps us with gauge which helps us with those targets jamie baker j p morgan analyst okay that s helpful thank you both and then just a bit of a modeling question there wasn t a huge change in fuel efficiency just looking at asms per gallon from the first quarter to the second quarter i mean a little bit of an improvement but with more international turning on in the current quarter can you give us some consumption guidance fourth quarter as well if you happen to have it andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer jamie i can t give you a precise number right now but keep in mind just given the mix with a higher proportion of regional flying by definition as widebodies come back and become revert back to normal that will help the fuel efficiency operator from goldman sachs we have catherine o brien please go ahead catherine o brien goldman sachs analyst good morning everyone thanks for the time so maybe one more on costs as we move to unit costs being down from 2019 levels next year outside of capacity what are the other tailwinds we should be thinking about i know you called out the 6 point impact from gauge and the 777 grounding but outside of that are there some ramp up headwinds today that we should think about abating as we move into the fourth quarter and 2022 and just any color on the size of that impact thanks gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer i think the most significant tailwind actually aside from gauge and stage length kind of reverting back is the ramp up of the structural cost saving so if you want to model something right now we ll give you some more color as we finalize 22 but right now you could model that about half of those savings are in our numbers for the rest of this year and then starting in 2022 early in the year first quarter let s say that 80 ramping up to 100 by mid year so that s probably the most significant tailwind i can think of as we normalize the business catherine o brien goldman sachs analyst okay great that s really helpful and then one maybe for andrew throwing it back to 2020 in february 2020 when you got the chase extension you entered into i believe at the time of the announcement you noted to drive 400 million increase in annual cash and we were about to get some more details on that and then covid hit so we didn t really i don t remember getting a time frame for when you d hit that i m guessing the pandemic maybe hit pause in the ramp up but can you just give us some color on what portion of that uplift you ve seen flow through your p l to date and how you expect that to trend over the next year or two thanks andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah definitely everything has been interrupted by the pandemic although we have seen recently where our numbers are now equal to or greater than 2019 so we re pretty excited about that and our new agreement with chase it was effective then and it s impacted in our everything we do here in our financials already but the real i think the real value in this is our working relationship with chase is just incredibly good right now and we re coming up with all creative ideas new products and that s fueling the card growth and the new number of cards we re putting out there and spent on the historic cards so that s maybe not every answer to the question you would like to hear but what i would say is that the relationship is going well which gives me great faith that we re going to hit the targets we put out there i don t have the exact timeline as to when that will happen it was clearly interrupted by the pandemic but we re back on course operator from jefferies we have shiela kahyaoglu please go ahead shiela kahyaoglu jefferies analyst hey good morning everyone thank you so maybe it seems like capacity additions are coming back at a faster rate and i appreciate the coastal hub can you maybe provide a little bit more color around casm ex below 2019 in 2022 what are your assumptions around capacity and maybe mix of international and domestic gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer so it s still a little early to give you the capacity guidance we do that in a normal course but i can tell you just given the size of the fleet as it stands today we expect 2022 capacity to be higher than 2019 but we ll give you more precise numbers in the normal course shiela kahyaoglu jefferies analyst okay no andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer gerry is going to add i think with the incremental widebody jets that we have available along with our expectation about what the transatlantic market is going to look like next year it wouldn t shock me that we see international growth faster than domestic growth for next summer shiela kahyaoglu jefferies analyst yeah i guess on that note somewhat related to that big picture you mentioned in your prepared remarks on the international side you re one of the carriers that have kept your widebodies going so that supply demand picture might look more attractive as international comes back but domestically what we re seeing is low cost carriers are doubling their fleet or expanding their fleet substantially as you guys are too and increasing gauge how do you think the supply demand picture plays out through 2026 how do you think united is positioned with that gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer well i ll just go back to our united next plan where i think we thoughtfully talked about all the details there we are working to make sure that we build our connectivity our schedule depth and most importantly our gauge and we think those factors along of course with our customer focus are really going to drive our profitability in really unique ways relative to many of our competitors over the next few years in an industry where we absolutely expect elevated domestic capacity growth for everybody over the next few years so we feel really good that we ve identified this we ve articulated a way to manage it here at united together from a revenue and a cost perspective and a customer perspective to make sure that we can meet the targets that scott laid out in new york a few weeks ago and he laid out just a few minutes ago here operator from wolfe research we have hunter keay please go ahead hunter keay wolfe research analyst hey good morning do you think that investors scott should just ratchet down our permanent expectations for pricing power for this industry scott kirby chief executive officer no hunter keay wolfe research analyst why not i mean it s so clear that the market puts multiples on industries that can price and the decision to deflate pricing and outrun it with lower casm i just it s hard to see why that makes sense when it s such a clear track record for this industry works is when they re pushing price and look what you just did right now with the yield performance not suggesting you re going to be down 25 forever but i m sure it was pretty satisfying to be able to push that price scott kirby chief executive officer well first i disagree with the premise of the question hunter keay wolfe research analyst okay scott kirby chief executive officer and look i recognize that you ve got a perspective respect that but we had a pretty good track record in 2018 2019 i think it was your research report that pointed out we grew eps by 74 this is in a large degree a continuation of the strategy that is working well with the improvement i think that we re really focused on decommoditizing air travel and getting customer choice so it s about far more than growth but even the 2018 2019 plan was working it is in your research report it seems like the best evidence that we can do this without disinflating i think was the term you used i m confident that we re going to do that and particularly confident that when you take the mix of what the international market is going to look like and the percentage of our revenues combined with i think our ability to decommoditize travel domestically that our targets for 2023 2026 are arguably conservative and that s going to ultimately be good for our shareholders hunter keay wolfe research analyst okay yeah look thanks for the time scott i don t want to be disrespectful here i appreciate the conversation a quick modeling question for you too i have you gerry should we assume that the swb casm is going to be in 22 and 23 above or below 2019 if you are willing to help us out with that kristina munoz director investor relations i ll follow up with you offline hunter hunter keay wolfe research analyst okay scott kirby chief executive officer yeah hunter keay wolfe research analyst all right thank you scott kirby chief executive officer sorry we ll get you those numbers operator from cowen and company we have helane becker please go ahead helane becker cowen and company analyst thanks very much operator hi everybody and thank you very much for your time so kind of a different question you have an open contract with your pilots and i know you have the letter agreement to agree to the differentials so that you re able to ramp up as the recovery occurs can you just talk about how you re thinking about entering those negotiations again in i don t know whether it s 2021 or 2022 but when should we think about that contract again brett j hart president hi helane this is brett hart how are you doing helane becker cowen and company analyst fine brett brett j hart president look i think probably the underlying premise of your question also points out that we obviously will have a really good working relationship with our pilots throughout the pandemic worked hand in hand with them and at the end of the day we are confident that when we do get to an agreement that will be one that works for our pilots and for the overall company but as you can i m sure appreciate we don t get into discussing the specifics of our discussions or negotiations or the time frame for reaching agreements in public or on earnings calls but i appreciate the question helane becker cowen and company analyst okay well that s helpful thank you just the other question is as we think about the improvements that you re talking about and efficiency i don t know andrew or gerry how should we think about it like working through the next two and a half years are you just going to give us guidance every quarter for how we should think about those efficiencies or is there some number beyond minus 4 in 2023 that we will be able to mark to gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer helane that s really the heart of the 2 billion of structural cost savings and as i said earlier by next summer i would expect 100 of those in the numbers and then we will continue and will continue to provide guidance keep in mind those structural savings include savings that will continue to grow as we grow the airline so it will come out through our continuing casm guidance over the next few years operator from evercore isi we have duane pfennigwerth please go ahead duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst hey thanks i really appreciate the time just a couple for me on cargo andrew i think you said no more dedicated freighters i assume this is just a function of passenger demand coming back but maybe you could just expand on that and if we think about sort of your cargo capacity in total maybe no more freighters but more longer haul flights coming back how do you think about your cargo capacity in total brett j hart president sure correct we are not going to be able to do more cargo only flights we re obviously disappointed by that given where yields currently stand the reason for that is the aircraft can be better deployed in passenger markets however many of those passenger markets are also not exactly optimal cargo markets they do have cargo but they re not optimal cargo markets the 52 777s that are grounded means we just have less flexibility on this front than we would otherwise had if those aircraft were flying we clearly would continue our program missions because we d have the ability to do both so then when we look at capacity available to fly it s still really significant as we put all these passenger planes back in the air and we think we ve got this properly accounted for in our forecast and we think we are going to have another great cargo quarter in q3 and it s already gotten off to a really good start that being said it s going to be different in the amount of the all cargo flights so but i tell you all we don t really disclose details but all the numbers are in there and hopefully we can do a little better on cargo than we are currently planning but there is a marked change in our cargo footprint starting today really starting a few weeks ago obviously and we ll see where it goes but we are still very bullish on cargo for the remaining half of this year duane pfennigwerth evercore isi analyst that s super helpful and just for my follow up on scope scope is something that united talked a lot about in the past obviously in the recent investor update you talked about big upgauge from 50 seaters but i have to think just thinking about high frequency with 50 seaters going fully to mainline maybe that implies less frequency i have to think there are many markets where 70 or 76 seater would be optimal how should we be interpreting a kind of the lack of commentary around scope and is it something maybe longer term maybe beyond the forecast period that you offered that you think still makes sense scott kirby chief executive officer to be clear when we induct a max 10 or an a321neo it s not replacing a 50 seat rj route for route there is a cascade that starts at the top that goes all the way down so 50 seater routes today will often go to 76 seater route in the new united next vision so just the economics of that are a little bit different than maybe you described i m not 100 sure but so we still will do that as we look at our fleet counts and hubs and schedule depth it is not our intention to reduce service to smaller communities in the united next plan and we ve laid this out in great detail that being said it s also really not going to increase our schedule depth or size in smaller communities either we re going to grow via gauge which we think is the right way to do it given where our hubs stand particularly our mid continent hubs where again most of the growth is gauged there is a little bit of frequency but most of the growth is gauged so hopefully that helps answer the question operator from ubs we have myles walton please go ahead myles walton ubs analyst thanks good morning it s a bit of a follow up to hunter s question again but i m curious scott if you ve thought about perhaps using a return on invested capital or efficiency metric to go alongside your pre tax margin your pre tax income financial metrics which govern your long term incentive schemes as a way to sort of answer the question around the efficiency of assets being put underutilization gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer hey it s gerry we actually always look at the return on investments we want to make and kind of our rule of thumb is kind of mid teens to justify making those investments so that s always part of the equation but i do think at the end of the day pre tax ultimately is the best way to look at things the other components of it just all go into that but we do look at returns on investments we re making myles walton ubs analyst okay but not in the just pre tax income is the governing metric gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer i think it s just the one that reflects how well we re we expect to do michael leskinen vice president corporate development and investor relations hey myles this is mike leskinen i would just add that even if you think about replacing some of the older aircraft with new technology you look at the 787 or the 737 max aircraft even in that scenario you re getting a mid teen return on invested capital and so the return on invested capital is the gating item we re driving pre tax margin but roics are well ahead of our weighted average cost of capital and it is a hurdle operator and from bernstein we have david vernon please go ahead david vernon bernstein analyst hey good morning guys thanks for taking the time so scott i wanted to talk kind of at a high level here about how investors should think about the upside you see in decommoditizing travel we get a little pushback that this is just a buzzword if you will i m just wondering if you can talk about how much whether this is just about a revenue premium that you can earn for having higher priced seats on the departure and if so if there s a way to think about that relative to kind of maybe the revenue you might have earned without the strategy and also if you could talk a little bit about whether this is also about limiting how much of the inventory that you put out in the market is actually exposed to low cost competition on a day to day basis and how that might be changing over the next couple of years since you implement this united next strategy scott kirby chief executive officer well i ll start and andrew can add on if he wants on the point about decommoditizing air travel it s hard to put a precise quantification on it today but i think customers do care about quality and do care about the product if you get on airplanes and talk to customers or just watch airplanes and people flying i think that is an inescapable conclusion there is at least one airline in the us that embarked on this a decade ago and it was quite successful there s certainly room for two of us in the united states it s the largest travel market in the country for two of us to pursue that strategy and frankly united has i think the most opportunity because we re in the big our hubs happen to be in the biggest premium market where our seven hubs are and so i think there is more upside for us than there is for anyone to pursue this strategy and so i don t know for sure how much that turns into in terms of a revenue premium or growth that and rasm that s faster than the rest of the industry because it s not as easy to quantify some of the works that we do but confident that it will lead to strong results for united andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer yeah the only thing i would add is that flying approximately 300 single class 50 seaters with no premium product on board at all up against competitors that had premium products is just a step change function for united as we take that number down we already saw with the introduction of the crj 550 which is our 50 seat dual class aircraft really great progress prior to the pandemic on being able to monetize those premium seats we see our competitors do it all day long and we are simply underrepresented in this category and flying the wrong aircraft into big cities with no premium seats and by the way our hubs have a lot of premium demand and we just under index to it and that was wrong and we re going to correct it and we re going to correct it really quickly operator from stifel we have joseph denardi please go ahead joseph denardi stifel analyst thanks good morning scott or gerry can you talk about capex needs on the widebody side when do you need to address that with an order when does the delivery start do you think and then based on that in what year do you see yourselves getting below 7 billion in capex gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer actually i m looking at andrew who always wants to ask me for aircraft but keep in mind over the last few years we ve taken 20 some odd widebody aircraft we haven t retired any we have a lot of widebody aircraft andrew just talked about that and so the focus right now is really on the narrow body and andrew can provide some color but i can tell you that it really depends on both the speed of recovery throughout the world and then the opportunities that andrew and scott kirby chief executive officer yeah gerry i ll just add what i think i ve said but i just reiterated that because we took delivery of a large number of widebody aircraft or we ordered some right prior to the pandemic those aircraft are coming online over the next 12 months so we will have available to schedule up to 30 incremental widebody jets for the summer of 2022 so that really does provide a lot of growth possibly for a number of years depending on market condition so we ll watch this carefully the second thing that i said a few weeks ago that i ll say again is we re carefully looking at the lifespan the economic lifespan of these widebody jets and i can tell you prior to the pandemic we were thinking many of them particularly the 777 and 767 fleet could go 30 years or more and i ll give kudos to our maintenance team for keeping these aircraft in great shape to allow us to have that optionality so we do have optionality to fly these aircraft longer than i think people automatically assume and then the last thing i ll add is the interiors on all these aircraft including the older ones we ve just been describing have been recently retrofitted we ve completed our entire 777 fleet and we re close to completing the 767 fleet with brand new interiors from nose to tail to give a great great customer experience onboard so with that we have a lot of incremental widebodies that have just arrived and we have a lot of brand new aircraft on the inside that have a long lifespan left and so we have a lot of optionality and to the extent we want to grow it will be because we have growth opportunities but we ll monitor that over the next few years so that s a lot more details than you probably wanted but that kind of explains where we are from a widebody point of view gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer and i ll just add the fairly straightforward analysis to justify that growth it goes back to the financial targets that we just talked about that they need to demonstrate that we can hit those returns which they do by they way on a regular basis joseph denardi stifel analyst okay brett j hart president and i ll add one more because i feel so passionate about this point the retention of the 767 300s i think gives us and any of the airline that has done that a structural competitive advantage these aircraft between their size and trip cost casm and passenger comfort are really amazing machines and they enabled as i said earlier this new route to croatia and many new routes that we re talking about that could otherwise i don t think be flown over the next few years profitably joseph denardi stifel analyst okay so does 2025 capex come back down to 3 billion to 4 billion range or is it still elevated and then scott you talked i think last call or the call before about doubling loyalty ebitda and haven t heard much on that is that like an aspirational goal that we should kind of discount significantly what are the drivers behind being able to do that thank you scott kirby chief executive officer well it s our goal i wouldn t discount it because i think we re going to do it but you can choose to if you want and this is one of those that until we have something to announce it s another one of those that we re not going to have something to announce until we have something to announce though i saw the team meeting earlier this morning on it and they re looking for me later today to get an update so we are doing there is a lot of activity on it but we re not going to have anything to say publicly until we re ready to make probably a big announcement gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer and on capex it s too early to really give capex projections beyond 2023 operator thank you we will now take questions from the media from wall street journal we have alison sider please go ahead alison sider the wall street journal reporter all right regarding your conversations with the government about lifting travel restrictions is there anything that the administration is asking for from airline in terms of contact tracing or extending the mask mandate or checking vaccine status is there anything that you will have to do as part of an agreement to lift those restrictions eventually scott kirby chief executive officer hey ali we are working closely with the government and it s a two way conversation where they re getting input from us input from them all of us want to make sure we do this safely and comfortably that when people get back to flying it s not only safe that people feel confident in the safety and we certainly haven t advocated for any of those specific policies but if the government brought those things forward we indicated a willingness for example with vaccine requirements which are happening in much of the world already united uniquely our digital team has done a pretty amazing job of creating an automated way for customers to upload that information i think it s easier on united to deal with vaccine requirements around the world than any airline in the world so we re doing those kinds of things and we re very open to any requirements that they have but look forward to working with the administration to get it back open alison sider the wall street journal reporter got it thanks operator and from bloomberg we have justin bachman please go ahead justin bachman bloomberg deputy news director hi thanks for the time today this question is maybe for andrew or scott but it goes back to scott s comment at the top of the call on the delta variant any impact probably being short and people are confident in the rebound i m curious like as far as your business today is this a lot of people who are repeat customers and flying quite a bit compared to during the pandemic or are you seeing people come back who may not have flown since 2018 or 2019 i m just curious about the mix of who is flying today and your confidence about those habits continuing even if the pandemic takes another turn thanks scott kirby chief executive officer sure good morning justin we track this pretty carefully particularly from a mileageplus point of view and particularly from the premier population and mileageplus and what we can tell you is that while the penetration of mileageplus on the aircraft is still below our historic norms by about 7 or 8 points we see that number gaining strength each month and more and more customers are coming back and our premier members are back to flying again and using our credit card and the ones that aren t are because they only generally fly global long haul and those particular borders are closed or are difficult to get into so we do see this returning to normal from all the things we look at the other thing i would tell you is as we ve kind of gone through this crisis headlines have driven cancellation and no show factors higher and i can assure you right now no show and cancellation factors are completely normal we ve seen no change in them over the last few weeks and they re basically slightly above 2019 levels which they have been for quite some time so we don t see any change of course i m not saying exactly what s going to happen in the future but i can just tell you right now things look good and we do look like demand is recovering and maintaining a strong recovery even with the negative headlines justin bachman bloomberg deputy news director okay thanks for the help operator and from reuters we have tracy rucinski please go ahead tracy rucinski thomson reuters u s aviation correspondent hi i also wanted to go back to scott s comments at the top of the call scott you mentioned a potential temporary reopening pullback can you be more specific on what that pullback could look like and where and what kinds of scenarios you re preparing for from a demand perspective scott kirby chief executive officer well i don t know what it would look like i think it would be something government related that there are some new rules or recommendations which i don t think which i think is unlikely i mean i think the most logical and likely outcome is that we largely continue unabated but if something did happen we ve had a history going really all the way back to the last weekend of february of 2020 reacting quickly realistically nimbly and we put a team together last year to deal with kind of the shutdown in march of last year that team has not been disbanded that team continues to exist for managing the vagaries and the ups and downs because we ve known all along that there is going to be ups and downs and there s going to be up and downs between now and the time that enough of the world is vaccinated that this really recedes into the background which we look forward to but there will be ups and downs and we re prepared to deal with whatever those are knowing that we can t precisely forecast exactly what the ups and downs are going to be gerald gerry laderman executive vice president and chief financial officer hey it s gerry let me just add yeah one of the things we learned in the pandemic was the need to be able to be flexible financially so as we ve begun to invest money we also build an off ramp in case we have to bank in one direction or the other tracy rucinski thomson reuters u s aviation correspondent what are you hearing from your from corporations in terms of their reopening plans there were reports yesterday for example that apple is delaying its return to office by a month andrew nocella executive vice president and chief commercial officer hi it s andrew i did read that in the newspaper overall we re hearing a return to this new normal as the end of the summer occurs in september obviously some may come back in october or even november but we are anticipating a return to normalcy and therefore we re also anticipating the step up in business travel in september and then once again in january when the new budget seasons start we ve already seen for example our advanced business bookings for september are now only down i think about 50 and we expect that number to continue to get better and finish the month at around 40 to 45 down based on where we are right now operator thank you we will now turn it back to kristina munoz for closing remarks kristina munoz director investor relations from everyone

fool senior analyst asit sharma as we talk about the somewhat unexpected reemergence of crocs asit thanks for joining asit sharma thanks for having me emily i must say as we tape this in real time we re on live on motley fool live i m not wearing crocs i am curious and i don t own any crocs before we begin do you own a pair of crocs flippen i do not own a pair of crocs but the reason why i wanted to talk about this today was because my boyfriend of all people took me out to the mall dragged me out saturday evening to go to the crocs store because he wanted a pair of crocs i mean i m just thinking to myself this is the strangest thing that he s asked me to do but i m trying to be a good girlfriend so i go with him i stand in line for almost half an hour outside of this crocs store because they re limiting the number of people that can go in but the place was just packed and it got me thinking oh my gosh what is going on with crocs for the people out there the listeners who are the uncool fashion laggards like myself where if there is a curve you are always behind it you may be completely unaware like myself that there s been this huge comeback for crocs i was truly astounded that was a long answer to say no i do not own a pair of crocs but i m very close to maybe making a crocs purchase after having looked at a lot of their inventory this weekend sharma as i said on slack when you gave me that statistic about yourself 75 of the way there ay ay ay flippen well let me put it this way if there was ever a personality with crocs that fit it was probably mine i always value comfort over fashion but what s really interesting is that crocs are actually now becoming fashionable and i think that s probably where we will spend a lot of today s show talking about it s that crocs the gains that they ve made over the past few years is not because suddenly everybody cares about being comfortable again although i m sure there s an aspect of it to be attributed to that but it s because crocs are cool crocs stock if you just look at the performance of crocs i believe their ticker is crox it s up nearly 900 over the past five years with 250 of that occurring in just the past 12 months alone so certainly crocs are cool again sharma yeah crocs are cool and i should say they are i ve seen this described on the web as a binary brand choice either you love them or you hate them i myself aspire to comfort i wear converse chuck taylors just a very comfortable shoe and i don t have much fashion sense either emily but there s just something about them which i can t fit my own foot in a croc but i have bought them for my kids when they were younger i totally get the argument of comfort and functionality we will get into that but they do evoke some strong emotions flippen i feel like there s no correct way to talk about crocs without talking about i guess a brief history of crocs it s mostly what i associate with that i imagine that there s a lot of people listening who also associate crocs with their history they were really introduced i think it was in 2002 by just three co founders of crocs who had put together this comfy and ugly synthetic work shoe but i think it was around 2007 2008 crocs had just taken off and as you mentioned also it was just a really divisive brand yet all of these people coming out and speaking out against it while others were adamantly defending it and the argument was never really oh crocs are a reasonable shoe to wear it s that you are either giving up on life and all things fashion by buying a pair of crocs or you don t care about comfort or usability at all and you don t buy a pair of crocs there was really no gray area in between sharma well it s interesting emily that the three co founders hopped on the idea on a boating trip there was a small manufacturer that was making a shoe close to what we know today as the baseline croc shoe and they were just taken by how comfortable the shoe was they found out that the material itself croslite was patented so they basically acquired the rights to manufacture shoes made out of this material they were very focused on that idea of comfort and usability and function that i think by the time they took it to market it dawned on them that there was another part of this shoe that was going to be really great was the brand aspect of something that provoked a lot of different opinions on it stylistic value flippen that was actually part of the arguments that leadership had for crocs when it started to get popular as they were proud of how ugly this shoe was i don t think they ever tried to say that it wasn t ugly they even had a campaign running ads saying something along the lines of ugly can be beautiful so it was really something that leadership leaned into sharma yeah in doing that they expanded not just in the u s but globally the company was really gaining a lot of momentum after its ipo and they used capital that they raised from follow on offerings to buy businesses like jibbitz now jibbitz makes those little terms that you can insert anywhere into a crocs shoe for the two listeners who haven t seen a crocs shoe it s designed with a lot of holes on the exterior so that you can fit little charms inside those holes now that s not why it was designed this way it was designed for breathability but it enabled crocs to do something that adidas and nike and the largest athletic shoe manufacturers have literally spent billions of dollars doing in more sophisticated ways which is how do you customize a shoe for a customer you can go to the adidas store and build your own shoe you can do the same with nike crocs got onto this trend and really capitalized on it by having just a manual type of customization with the jibbitz which remains a very popular adornment to the crocs shoe today flippen not to make this too anecdotal and not to put my boyfriend on blast on this podcast but he went with the crocs shoe with the intent of getting something he could wear in the shower at the gym we left the store with yes a pair of crocs shoes but also probably more money spent in jibbitz than the shoes cost themselves i was amazed by how successful the jibbitz were something that when i look at it i think i associate it with maybe an eight year old girl would put on her shoes little charms that you accessorize with but in reality management thinks that the jibbitz are just an opportunity to play off this huge trend toward personalization that people are experiencing in my boyfriend s case he got a bunch of bananas to put on them because his coworkers always make fun of him for eating bananas a lot i don t know but the point is that everybody has little things that they associate with themselves or their personalities and jibbitz are a way for crocs to monetize off of that sharma yeah emily i know you re going to talk a little bit about variability of design and the tremendous amount of skus that crocs has traditionally put out to the number of unique styles that you can buy in stores and online jibbitz is one manifestation of that uniqueness and personalization but it s a double edge sword which i know you ll get to but maybe that s a good segue to talk about the business model which can offer teeter on the edge because it tends to lean into things like personalization massive suedes of inventory to suit different styles around the globe flippen it s an interesting question to think about what would have happened to crocs had the great recession not happened i tend to think that crocs to your point asit probably still over invested in a lot of things personalization being one inventory being one skus definitely being one but when you look at part of the reason why crocs had this big failure in 2008 2009 was largely because of the great recession that crocs plummeted it reached an all time high in 2007 and then discretionary spending really came to a halt in 2008 2009 and crocs suddenly was stuck with a ton of inventory tons of skus just sitting on their books alongside a decent amount of debt for a period people were convinced crocs was just going to go bankrupt as a result there was also this belief in saturation i think and maybe that s a problem that still exists today is that when people buy a pair of crocs they do last forever so you re not finding yourself needing to replace them feeling particularly compelled to go back and purchase more shares there s a washington post article i found from 2009 that talked a bit about the bankruptcy and i loved this quote they said who needs a second pair of crocs in a recession and that kind of i know colors i guess how crocs got to where it is today sharma i lift that emily because so here s my side of the story our kids were young during the great recession they were in middle and elementary school so we have three kids and we bought crocs for all of them and never replaced them i think maybe we might have replaced one pair because they were lost but they are very durable if you re buying them for utility you really don t need more than a couple of pairs some people buy the rain boots so that s one variation you can have in your closet but i saw that firsthand i also saw that it s a very personal choice i couldn t again imagine myself putting on a pair of crocs but my kids when they re younger really like this now footnote to that story none of my boys i have two in college and one in high school none of them like crocs or think that they created a shoe that they ve moved on to other types of shoe although that demographic is becoming once again a really avid buyer of this shoe flippen that s probably again what makes today different from crocs in the past was the move toward both gen z consumers as well as just streetwear and counter culture actually accepting crocs as a real fashion trend catalyzed by a lot of agreements and i guess partnerships crocs has made with big brands and big designers out there so when you look at what exists for crocs today versus the stagnation than it was in post recession i d say the fundamental difference between what we experienced in those periods where crocs was i guess performing well 2006 2007 before the great recession and what we re experiencing today is that crocs are fashionable maybe not to your kids asit but my very little level of primary research says people think crocs are cool sharma yeah for sure and they are doing a great job in targeting a young demographic and also a fun loving demographic it s a very irreverent brand they ve got a really nice presence on tiktok they tend to do very wild and crazy things there s a croc stiletto that is going to sell in 2022 for about a thousand bucks made by a major italian fashion designer so there you go i think that you have a brand which really knows how to appeal to a new audience i mean there is a younger audience younger than my kids who have grown up without seeing that whole cycle through the great recession where they became uncool after they were cool the cyclicality of this brand is just fascinating flippen when you look at the style differences between what crocs is doing today versus in the past and that cyclical nature is still there as you mentioned it i think that s always going to be there when you have a fashion brand in any sense maybe not to the extreme that crocs has had historically but there s always some aspect of cyclicality there i think one of the big focuses and maybe you can talk more about this as their management team has changed has just been moving away from having way too many skus the store keeping units so when you get on their website and you look through the different shoe offerings it s just the number of different offerings they provide and they had over 5 500 skus at their peak in 2007 which is a huge amount of skus for a crocs brand in particular it was part of the reason why they had over invested inventory that then had a really hard time moving and in recent years management has made it a priority to cut back on those skus while they haven t broken it down at least not in any of the reports that i read management has made comments saying they reduced skus count in the order of 40 to 70 sharma yeah i think that this is something that is going to be an ever present question for investors if you buy this company for the long term you ll have to monitor that sku count because they have to lean into capacity when interest is high as it s been through the great recession we haven t even mentioned yet how much of a boost this company got out of covid simply because it became a go to brand for at home comfort while people were on zoom calls in fact some surveys of the contemporary shoe market show that this is the only major brand to take market share during the great recession almost everyone else experienced a general decrease in market share last year as people stayed home some lifestyle brands were able to expand but among major brands crocs stood out for its acceleration last year and that s continued into 2021 now part of this i think it s just smarter management of inventory and of the life cycle mini life cycles of this brand you can trace this to a second wave of reorganization that occurred between 2014 and 2017 i see a second wave because they had a first wave of reorganization during the great recession what you were describing earlier emily when the company was flirting with bankruptcy they emerged from that but again started to see difficult times about seven or eight years later and this propelled one really prominent private equity firm to take an interest in crocs in 2014 blackstone bx 4 49 which is one of the largest managers of assets in the world bought 200 million worth of shares and that gave the company sort of a lifeline at the time i think its market capitalization made them like 800 million you re talking nearly a quarter of shares if i remember correctly they installed a gentleman named andrew rees as president who has a lot of brand acumen but also is very good at managing supply chains and operationally has a lot of strength rees was appointed ceo in 2017 blackstone essentially forced out anyone left who was originally associated with the company rees took over he was able to reduce overhead he focused on the classic brand sku so going back to the company s first iterations and making sure that where crocs was allocating capital it was promoting its evergreen brand because that is a core component of their revenue stream then he also started marketing to what were at that time millennials now they have followed on with the younger generations since 2017 over the last four years then also one thing that rees achieved was a lot of brand extensions the wacky one offs that we see today we should also mention here that emily this company reminds me in some ways of funko which makes the collectible bobblehead dolls that you see both online and even in walmart and target some crocs have become collectible items and they sell out i wonder if some of those might have been on sale when your boyfriend was trying to buy his crocs this weekend because they have been noted for the long lines around their stores some people are trying to get at inventory that s not going to be replaced so they can just keep it in their closet and watch it go up in value which i find to be a really savvy business move flippen look the crocs i ll let it fly but the moment he tries to bring funko toys into this house that s where the line is going to be drawn i can tell you that much sharma well i have to weigh in on his side because that may be a money making proposition you don t know flippen that would change everything wouldn t it sharma true that flippen before you move on one of the things that rees did that i thought was really interesting is as ceo you mentioned he focused on back to basics of the brand and that was the classic clog what he did was move the clogs to the back of the store so the best selling items pushed all the way in the back of the store so when people came in they had to walk all the way to the back just to get what they wanted the end result was not only building a brand by building more of that store presence but also higher sales it s an interesting move that i can t help but wonder how much of the success that we re seeing today is a result of his work as ceo and how much is a result of just fads and trends it s hard for me to separate these two things in my mind sharma it is for me as well and i wonder too if the pendulum doesn t swing back a bit now we know that crocs has really thrived during the recession it was doing pretty well though in 2019 and its comparable sales versus 2019 look strong early this year but the question is will there be another sort of full circle reckoning among buyers as they grow a little older i think you ll always have a core component of buyers who are sold on crocs for their comfort there is that little hitch though that you don t need ten pairs in your closet one pair is going to last a long time they are beloved i know in the medical industry for that reason think of the times you ve gone into a doctor s office or at least in a hospital and it seemed someone in scrubs and crocs walking by it seems almost like part of the uniform now but they are extremely durable so that does hit the extension a little bit in terms of sales per customer and lifetime value but i think this is such a company that rides on its brand strength and that is a little different than brands out there that are either higher or lower on the scale of desirability so if you look at really high end goods they tend to have a very steady state of demand and the same with goods which are relatively cheap but have a lot of brand love behind them coca cola ko 1 34 is an example of a company which has relatively inexpensive products and even as soda volumes have declined they ve been able to sell a lot of coke just because of the love for the brand then you ve got brands which can be found in major department stores like tiffany s and nordstrom jwn 0 05 which have just the sustained desire behind them on the consumers end crocs fit somewhere in the middle it s interesting emily they actually went through a phase where they tried to focus crocs as almost a luxury item and i believe there s a period early in the company s history where nordstrom was its biggest retail outlet it quickly moved back to a lower value or a lower cost proposition but when you do that and your brand has this as i named it before a bifurcated view in the wider fashion world then you ve got to lean on those times where the whole left side of that fork which are the people who love it are piling in because you ll never ever get the people on the right side of the fork those that are never going to have a pair of crocs in their closet flippen hey never say never part of the reason why their product is so popular with so many people is their proprietary material i was talking to my dad about this episode before i was making the outline he was like well can t people just 3d print their own crocs it gave me a chuckle but the answer is no they actually can t because crocs has a proprietary material that crocs are made out of i believe it s croslite if i m pronouncing it correctly and it s proprietary it s patented supposedly what makes a croc so special and so comfortable is this material that is hard to replicate i don t think we ve seen it replicated with such success in other brands i m convinced there are people out there who think i will never own a pair of crocs who may be surprised yet sharma i totally get that i remember waves of knockoffs that you could buy on amazon when we were buying crocs for our kids but the scuttlebutt from friends who had bought those was that they didn t feel the same and they weren t as durable with this patented material i think crocs has such a big advantage on the comfort scale for people who like it and the design has become iconic i will bring up one little drawback which i think could affect the cyclical popularity of this shoe because it was an issue during the great recession and that is the resin material itself this foam resin material it s chiefly made of something called ethylene vinyl acetate and this is a plastic like polymer this polymer gives crocs their elasticity and it also gives crocs that non porous resistance to water even though this shoe has holes in it they don t really absorb water so they are really easy to dry out and to shake off if you happen to get caught in the rain now this material because it is essentially a plastic like material is not recyclable because although it has certain elements of plastic that could be recyclable the injection of this resins material keeps that from being recycled they re non bio degradable so you can t compose them for example i wonder if that doesn t become a concern again i remember this was one of the reasons that we made the decision to move away because our friends were talking about the fact that they weren t very environmentally friendly now this could be said about a lot of footwear so i think we shouldn t unfairly dump on crocs for the fact that it s got a certain type of polymer that you can t recycle and it won t biodegrade at the same time this is something that s going to stick around in landfills for a long time i do think that you see this pop back into people s consciousness we ll see as we go along right now i was not able to find anybody online who s even talking about this issue unlike the days from 10 or 11 years ago where that was a bigger concern flippen yeah i wasn t even aware that that was a concern until you just mentioned it now which i think is a testament to maybe not my research skills hopefully not my research skills but to exactly what you said at the end there which is nobody seems to be talking about it i like that as a risk factor because i do think at one point especially when things catch fire the flip side always comes to light and with crocs the flip side of that durability and non porousness is something that is durable against human nature as well mother nature i should say definitely something to think about but let s move on to some recent performance for crocs we ve managed to avoid really talking about any numbers so far which i m proud of us for but let s get some numbers out there because i m sure everybody is wondering what could possibly have happened over the last five years to justify that 900 gain in crocs stock price i know when i looked at the most recent quarter i was pretty shocked by some of the numbers i was seeing they have record levels of revenue over the last three quarters and in the most recent quarter they had 64 year over year growth on top of that stellar 2020 largely driven by trends across the u s sharma this was really amazing to me after we decided on this ticker to take a look at it did not really cross my consciousness for so many years and here they are with this explosive growth really high gross margins for a company that s manufacturing and distributing essentially footwear i believe their gross margin hovers around 55 and operating margins are also very decent when you look at this company operating margins of 30 in the quarter they just reported on in april so they will be due for another report soon that is a company that looks like it s got a great business model if they can sustain the growth and continue with their strategy of expansion in asia and europe that they should be able to put a lot of excess cash on their balance sheet and maybe not be in quite the precarious situation they were during the great recession by the way emily i went back and glanced at those financials from 2008 and 2009 when the auditors were saddling them with a going concern comment as you mentioned to me in our notes which is one of the worst things that can happen that means that your auditors are unsure if you will be able to continue on within a year past the date they signed their letter that s a pretty big deal the balance sheet actually wasn t that bad in 2008 and 2009 and they still had positive operating cash flow but i think at the time because the environment was so poor and credit was so hard to access during the great recession that the auditors were probably worried if this brand had staying power and the thesis looked poor at that point but we should give crocs some credit in that their base margins seem to always supply them except in extreme circumstances with positive operating cash flow when you convert those sales into cash i think it s really a resilient business model from that standpoint i wanted to knock on this as i was going in because i don t like this shoe but i found to be honest that they seem to have a pretty resilient business model now let s talk a little bit about how those sales are composed when we look at that most recent quarter about 32 of the sales were digital and that includes wholesale and direct to consumer sales wholesale revenue grew about 50 versus direct to consumer and that itself was up about 131 year over year in the u s it s hard to really punch a hole in their growth story over the last year as i said before into 2021 emily they re succeeding both at a retail level in their own stores in other department stores and also with their direct to consumer business it reminds me a little bit of yeti which is a company which also has strong brand power that both of us have said many times on this podcast we missed it because of the strength of the brand there is something of a brand story that s propelling all these numbers you have to give crocs i think some long term sustainability from a brand perspective just to maybe make a counter to what we re saying before about the cyclicality of the brand and the peaks and troughs here when you look at the numbers to me it looks like the company that will be able to maintain a base case of profitability even in hard times what are your thoughts flippen the first thought i had when looking at the financial performance was similar to yours asit i was shocked at how free cash flow positive this business was even during challenging years even when crocs weren t suddenly a popular cool shoe to own i was just amazed that this seemingly great business has gone under my radar for so long i think management s aware of that brand power that you talked about they ve been increasingly i guess being skeptical is maybe a strong way to put it they ve been rethinking their relationships with a lot of their wholesalers people who they say they don t see as representative of its brand but i d take it to mean people who don t move a ton of their product don t have a lot of cache with consumers so they can drive more direct to consumer sales which are obviously more higher margin product sales in 2020 alone wholesale revenue was a pretty sizable portion of that top line around 50 of all sales there s a really big opportunity for crocs to pull more demand straight into croc stores as well as their website sharma certainly having said that what about this debt picture now in the 2008 2009 period the company was saddled with debt it eventually paid down some of that debt when looking at the balance sheet and do you have any concerns going forward about how that financial picture pans out are they exposed to too much long term debt or do you feel it s manageable flippen if you just look at the numbers i think as much as they re pulling in an operating profit right now you d probably say no that s fine i think i tend to be a little bit more concerned that this is a business that has been issuing a sizable amount of debt in part they re using that debt to pay off their higher interest debt so they can have an overall lower interest expense but it s still somewhat concerning to me because they are still spending a lot of money and they have money up to 1 billion in share repurchases this is a business taking on debt that tends to be cyclical admittedly in a low interest rate environment but also spending money on a lot of share repurchases it makes me nervous only because i m really familiar with the crocs history which as we mentioned their debt load was part of the reason why they were so close to bankruptcy back during the great recession i worry that they re setting themselves up in a similar position this time sharma i noticed just in the first quarter of this year their long term borrowings almost doubled from 180 million at the end of 2020 to 341 million at the end of the first quarter in 2021 that itself is a little concerning this chasing of expansion of course can be parsed in terms of a very long term growth story as they seek to expand in asia and europe as i was mentioning earlier looking at the rest of the balance sheet their current ratio the ratio of current assets it s ready money versus current liabilities liabilities that need to be paid within a year look fairly strong it s a more than 2 1 ratio they ve got about 27 million in current assets versus about 326 million in current liabilities i will point out though 200 million of those current assets are in their inventory and 229 million of those assets are in accounts receivable still what we call quick assets that is assets that can be readily converted to cash however that inventory balance has been rising alongside and emily i know you that s probably also a concern in your mind rising inventory rising debt levels starts to sound a little bit like 2006 2007 right before the hammer came down flippen that was actually the question i found myself coming back on at the end of all this research on crocs the question i had after all of this was just is crocs making the same mistake twice or is this time different because when i look at those numbers when i look at the increasing amount of debt when i look at the huge amount of inventory it s up over 50 in comparison to where it was in 2019 i see management taking the same moves that they took back right before the great recession that did not set them up for success when the tides turned against them the other aspect that i think is concerning is management has focused so much in prior years of bringing down the number of skus today we are talking about increasing the number of skus as crocs have become popular again it s almost like this fair weather strategy that when tides are in their favor they will make decisions that act as if the business is going to grow at infinite levels for the foreseeable future without really having a prudent plan in place for if and when crocs stop being so attractive and stop being so popular that makes me nervous and the other thing i ll quickly add is in the most recent earnings call management said this i think almost three or four times at the call was that they expect clog growth to outpace sandals this year but over the longer term sandals will grow faster than clogs clogs are over 75 of their total revenue right now they think that their sandal line is going to start ruminating i guess with customers i don t see that happening today at peak crocs popularity all of that makes me feel like i think crocs could be making the same mistake twice i really want to root for this business because i love a good underdog story and it was such a pleasure to walk around their store truly kiddish and fun and exciting i want them to succeed but i have a hard time swallowing this pill sharma let s break that down a little bit we ve got on the one hand what seems to be a story that repeats itself on the other hand andrew rees is still the ceo we should mention that the company bought back some of the shares that blackrock owned they called back a little bit of that investment nonetheless blackrock i think still owns about 17 of the company they still have board representation this big private equity concern is guiding crocs and i think that they are to step in when the company starts to extend itself the other side of the coin is why haven t they stepped in yet the message from blackrock seems to be yeah go ahead and plow into the demand right now go ahead and expand the footprint expand the styles what you just mentioned emily is a departure from the base case we ve mentioned this a few times already in this podcast that the company s best strategy has been the back to basics emphasis on its classic design clog will those sales materialize for sandals will that become an accelerated part of the revenue puzzle i don t know the other thing that i think we should be wary of is is management also keen on the growth rate of jibbitz jibbitz is growing at a much faster rate than the rest of the product lines but this little ornament which lets you customize your shoe only makes up about 4 of total revenue maybe it plays a role in the overall sale the fact that you can customize the shoe but jibbitz itself is not going to be the key to revenue growth if the sandals growth falls through what we could see is a deceleration of sales as people start to get back outside and do other things with their lives where the crocs shoe is a nice to have in the closet but not necessarily what you re putting on to go for a hike or even to go back to work unless of course you work in a hospital as i was saying earlier and that is for your daily outfit i think that what we ve got here is a company that s had some phenomenal success in terms of share price the future is just not as certain to me and i have to put my own thoughts and feelings about the shoe itself and give some props to the brand but i do think that the past history is weighing here on the forward case if crocs had a history of stable growth and stable brand management and was able to appeal to different generations of buyers in all kinds of weather it d be a lot easier to buy shares of this company maybe an example of a company that seems easier to invest in after accelerated growth which we talked about a few weeks ago is trex trex is an environmental company it makes outdoor decking and emily although we came away from that episode saying yeah trex s run up a bit both of us felt really good on how solid the demand has been an all environment since trex s became public this is not so this is more a company that is at the whim of the consumer and i think that it does have that opportunity for the love to swing to hate for a time scenario wise here what happens if this momentum reverses and instead of sales acceleration we see a return to the norm or worse just a slowdown in sales to think through what this would do to both the brand and the share price it makes me reluctant to want to go out and buy its shares flippen i find myself saying the age old adage of buying the product don t necessarily buy the stock i think that s where i find myself as a consumer i would be surprised after spending all of these hours thinking about crocs that i don t find myself eventually making a purchase especially of one of their sandals but at the same time i m also very aware of the fact that crocs in my mind are always going to be a little bit controversial always going to be a little bit fatty but if you re listening and you re like asit where you maybe you have this deep seated hatred toward the crocs and you can t quite figure out why there is a once popular blog that is still up and running today that i stumbled upon called ihatecrocs com and it made its last post in 2011 only recently last month having come back to make another post their first one in a decade but i liked the last post that that blog poster his name is escaping me right now made in 2011 he said crocs as a company really does try you have to give them that i thought that was a nice line to leave today s podcast on sharma i love that i have to say one more thing with the stock price which has rocketed up 229 over the last trailing 12 months there was something that needed to wake the sleeping giant i think it s more the resurgence of popularity in current culture than the stock price but they are the sleeping giant flippen asit thank you so much for joining in providing your valuable insight on crocs as always sharma thanks so much emily unlike you i think i ll pass on buying a pair in the near future flippen listeners that does it for this episode of industry focus if you have any questions or you want to reach out to say hey shoot us an email at as always people on the program may own companies discussed on the show and the motley fool may have formal recommendations for or against any stocks mentioned so don t buy or sell anything based solely on what you hear thanks to tim sparks for his work behind

hyperion s hamr and gsd technologies for the potential production of low cost low to zero carbon titanium metal powders the collaboration will focus on technical and economic evaluation of powders produced via the hydrogen assisted magnesiothermic reduction hamr and granulation sintering and deoxygenation gsd processes for use in additive manufacturing as compared to the current titanium metal powders recyclability of titanium metal powders using the hamr and or gsd technology processes environmental and sustainability evaluation of powders produced via the hamr and gsd processes for use in additive manufacturing versus other production processes sascha rudolph commercial director metal materials at eos commented our goal is to create innovative product and process solutions that help accelerate responsible manufacturing and sustainable solutions via industrial 3d printing technology what is exciting is the potential for new low cost low carbon titanium powders that will provide organizations with both significant economic benefits and more sustainable solutions the hamr and gsd technology has the potential to lower the barriers to entry for titanium into existing markets of more conventional materials and will enable completely new mass market applications where high strength to weight are critical such as electric vehicles titanium alloys are very widespread and versatile high performance materials in am used by our customers in ingenious part designs covering everything from hip implants to formula one parts to aircraft components one barrier to wider adoption of am is material cost caused on one hand by the scarcity of the raw material but on the other hand by the extremely complex and resource intense methods of extraction our partnership with hyperion changes this landscape and allows us to deliver cost and resource efficient next gen methods of extracting the value form this extremely valuable and scarce natural resource all the while reducing the negative impact on our environment this collaboration means more to us than two technology companies joining forces to drive development of am it is also another great step on the journey of realizing the eos vision of sustainable manufacturing anastasios arima ceo and managing director of hyperion metals said collaborating with eos significantly advances our vision to bring sustainably sourced low cost and zero carbon titanium metal powders to international metal markets more than any other 3d printing company eos has a similar value and vision in bringing sustainable manufacturing to the world and having a sustainable metal supply chain is crucial to that vision their experience in the additive manufacturing materials world is unparalleled they have more than 25 years of experience working with metal powders and have a dedicated facility in finland eos metal materials that is focussed on the development design and production of metal powders and processes titanium is a superior metal for a wide range of high performance applications in the aerospace medical space and defence sectors hyperion through its hamr and gsd technologies has the potential to produce zero carbon spherical titanium powders at a fraction of the cost of comparable titanium powders hyperion s technologies have the potential to disrupt not just the titanium market but also the far larger aluminium and stainless steel markets under the non binding mou hyperion and eos have agreed to negotiate in good faith to enter into definitive agreements to give effect to a partnership that allows hyperion and eos to work together to advance deployment of sustainably produced low cost and zero carbon spherical and non spherical titanium metal powders for use in the additive manufacturing industry the mou will terminate on 1 june 2022 unless extended by mutual agreement about eos eos provides responsible manufacturing solutions via industrial 3d printing technology to manufacturers around the world connecting high quality production efficiency with its pioneering innovation and sustainable practices the independent company formed in 1989 will shape the future of manufacturing powered by its platform driven digital value network of machines and a holistic portfolio of services materials and processes eos is deeply committed to fulfilling its customers needs and acting responsibly for our planet about hyperion metals hyperion s mission is to be the leading developer of zero carbon sustainable critical material supply chains for advanced american industries including space aerospace electric vehicles and 3d printing the company holds a 100 interest in the titan project covering nearly 6 000 acres of titanium rare earth minerals high grade silica sand and zircon rich mineral sands properties in tennessee usa the titan project is strategically located in the southeast of the usa with low cost road rail and water logistics connecting it to world class manufacturing industries hyperion has secured options for the exclusive license to produce low carbon titanium metal and spherical powers using the breakthrough hamr gsd technologies the hamr gsd technologies were invented by dr z zak fang and his team at the university of utah with government funding from arpa e the hamr technology has demonstrated the potential to produce titanium powders with low to zero carbon intensity significantly lower energy consumption significantly lower cost and at product qualities which exceed current industry standards the gsd technology is a thermochemical process combining low cost feedstock material with high yield production and can produce spherical titanium and titanium alloy powders at a fraction of the cost of comparable commercial powders hyperion also has signed an mou to establish a partnership with energy fuels nyse uuuu that aims to build an integrated all american rare earths supply chain the mou will evaluate the potential supply of rare earth minerals from hyperion s titan project to energy fuels for value added processing at energy fuels white mesa mill rare earths are highly valued as critical materials for magnet production essential for wind turbines evs consumer electronics and military applications appendix hamr non spherical titanium metal powder technology the hamr technology developed by professor zhigang zak fang of the university of utah with funding from the department of energy and assistance by boeing and arconic results in the production of titanium non spherical powders with characteristics similar or better than commercially available titanium sponge and which can be used as a replacement for sponge or as a feedstock into other processes near net shape applications or spherical powder production detailed energy economic analysis and process simulations were performed to estimate the energy consumption emissions and cost at mass production of titanium metal using the hamr technology the result indicated that the hamr process is more than 50 less energy intensive and cost competitive with the kroll process hyperion has an exclusive license over the hamr technology and is focused on scaling the technology targeting the use of titanium minerals produced in tennessee as initial feedstock this presents a significant opportunity to re shore a low cost fully integrated titanium metal supply chain with the highest standards in sustainability potentially zero carbon operations and full traceability in a safe jurisdiction in the u s this hamr process and the non spherical powder produced alone can feed into the current titanium metal supply chain in the u s and europe but can also be used for feedstock in further downstream processing gsd spherical titanium metal powder technology following the scientific principles underpinning the hamr technology prof fang also developed a process which could either utilize hamr powder ti scrap or ti sponge to produce spherical titanium metal powders for 3d printing applications this technology was named granulation sintering and deoxygenation gsd the technology is a novel method that synergistically combines granule spheroidization sintering and de oxygenation into one integrated process for producing low cost spherical titanium powder which significantly improves the yield and produces a spherical titanium alloy powder with low oxygen content controllable particle size distributions and excellent flowability this gsd process can also be utilized to recycle titanium metal powders that have been utilized in the additive manufacturing industry for low cost hyperion has exclusivity over this technology and aims to commence pilot production of spherical titanium powders in the 3rd quarter 2021 initially utilizing titanium scrap and or sponge but with the ability to also utilize used powders and eventually backward integrating with the hamr powders hyperion s vision is to scale both hamr and gsd to bring sustainably produced low cost and zero carbon metal powders to market which when coupled with additive manufacturing can disrupt not only the current titanium parts supply chain but also the stainless steel and aluminum supply parts chains

the moniker middle class joe as a result following a 44 year career in the federal government that spanned both the senate and the vice presidency biden made up for lost time after leaving office in 2017 and before moving into the white house in 2021 thanks to a book deal and the lucrative paid speaker circuit middle class joe became a multimillionaire take a look so how did biden suddenly come into such fortune after stubbornly refusing to identify with the upper class for over four decades as he hits his one year anniversary in office here s a closer look at how middle class joe got rich in a short period of time birthdate nov 20 1942 nov 20 1942 net worth 9 million 9 million sources of income currently 400 000 annually as president previously book deal paid speaking engagements currently 400 000 annually as president previously book deal paid speaking engagements career highlights president of the united states 2021 present vice president 2009 17 u s senator representing delaware 1973 2009 how much is joe biden worth joe biden s current net worth is estimated at 9 million by celebrity net worth and in june 2021 forbes pegged it at 8 million based on his financial disclosure report when he left the vice presidency in 2017 biden had a net worth of 2 5 million built on his real estate holdings and pension forbes said in his time out of office biden and his wife dr jill biden earned 17 3 million largely between a book deal and high paying speaking engagements they used some of their earnings to buy a 4 800 square foot summer home in rehoboth beach delaware for 2 7 million in june 2017 between the beach house and their permanent delaware home the bidens have more than half their assets tied up in real estate according to forbes how did joe biden make his money the moniker middle class joe isn t exactly right while relying on his senate salary alone might have made biden one of the poorest members of congress it still represents the sort of wages that most americans dream of when biden was first elected to the senate in 1972 senators were earning 42 500 per annum or a little over 275 000 a year after adjusting for inflation his final year in the senate 2008 saw that salary climb to 169 300 but that s more of a pay cut after factoring in inflation in today s dollars that represents just a little less than 225 000 during most of his time as vice president biden s salary jumped to 230 700 and he and his wife who is a community college professor reported a gross annual income of just under 400 000 for 2016 anyone earning the equivalent of over 200 000 a year for over 40 years can hardly be considered middle class however biden and his family have been a lot closer to that reality than almost any of his senate colleagues biden borrowed against life insurance policies to cover expenses beginning in 1983 and he took out mortgages against the value of his delaware home in fact opensecrets reported that the vice president was in the ballpark of 1 million in debt in 2014 a time when he was struggling with his son beau s cancer diagnosis and seriously considering selling the family home to make ends meet even then president barack obama offered him a personal loan to avoid such a fate however biden s upper middle class struggles from his time in office likely became a distant memory after he began earning more than 200 000 a pop for some of his speaking engagements much of the post vice presidential income the bidens pulled down in 2017 18 can be attributed to the deal they signed with flatiron books for two nonfiction works by biden and a third co written with his wife the deal reportedly was worth 8 million joe biden s background joe biden has committed almost his entire adult life to politics biden was born in blue collar scranton pennsylvania but moved to delaware at age 11 he graduated from the university of delaware in 1965 and syracuse university college of law in 1968 and then opened his law practice back home in wilmington delaware but politics awaited he served on the new castle county council from 1970 72 his election to the senate at age 29 made him the fifth youngest person ever to serve in the body at that time he won re election six times and ultimately became delaware s longest serving senator before leaving to become vice president in 2009 during his long senate career biden served as the chair of the senate judiciary committee during the controversial clarence thomas u s supreme court confirmation hearing and introduced the violence against women act in 1990 biden also ran for president twice his campaign for the 1988 nomination would be derailed over allegations of plagiarizing a speech and making false claims about his academic record biden made another attempt 20 years later in 2008 and while he again failed to secure the nomination he wound up making the ticket as the vice presidential candidate under obama and serving two terms in the white house biden s life has been marked by great tragedy mere weeks after his election to the senate in 1972 his first wife neilia and daughter naomi were killed in a car accident that also seriously injured his sons hunter and beau decades later beau biden a veteran of the iraq war and the attorney general of delaware was diagnosed with brain cancer he died in 2015 at age 46 joe biden s 2020 presidential victory biden was confirmed as the democratic nominee for president in august 2020 the party s choice to oppose incumbent donald trump biden ran as a relative moderate who aimed to carry on the political legacy of his former boss barack obama and to oppose the policies and procedures of the trump administration thanks to a steady economy trump was ahead of potential democratic challengers in polls in late 2019 but when the coronavirus pandemic hit and millions of jobs were lost the tide turned biden won the 2020 presidential election with 306 electoral college votes to 232 for trump far eclipsing the 270 needed for a win joe biden s first year in office the biden administration has had a broad agenda since the president s swearing in ceremony on jan 20 2021 which has included controlling the pandemic by immunizing americans providing economic relief addressing climate change improving the nation s infrastructure and restoring america s standing in the world among his achievements biden re entered the united states in the paris climate accords worked to reunite immigrant families that had been split apart in the trump administration and struck down rules banning openly transgender people from serving in the military still biden has had a rough road to navigate by mid january 2022 nearly 63 of americans had received two doses of the covid 19 vaccine with almost 75 getting one dose according to the mayo clinic still the u s continues to struggle against the virus with the omicron variant responsible for approximately 800 000 people in the u s testing positive every day at a time when the president likely thought the covid 19 threat would have passed his administration arranged to have free rapid tests sent to u s households that request them online beginning jan 19 his economic plan was sidetracked too during his first year in office gas prices have risen from an average of 2 38 to 3 31 per gallon according to aaa figures rising gas prices are part of why inflation increased 7 in december 2021 its biggest hike in nearly 40 years and biden s build back better plan has stalled because of the lack of necessary votes in the u s senate the plan includes provisions for increasing

earnings release and sec filings contain additional information about these non gaap measures why we use them and why we believe they re helpful to investors and contain reconciliations to the corresponding gaap data consistent with prior quarters we will speak to certain non gaap metrics as we feel they provide a better understanding of our operating results these measures are not a substitute for gaap data and we encourage you to review the gaap information in our earnings release and in our sec filings with that i ll turn the call over to todd adams chairman and ceo of rexnord todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer okay thanks dave and good morning everyone it s a great morning to be in milwaukee after the bucks won the nba title last night so 50 years since the last title so fantastic for the city of milwaukee as it relates to rexnord we had another terrific quarter with strong momentum in both platforms which creates a great backdrop for the pending rmt transaction with regal our margins and cash flow were very strong both sequentially and against the cost constrained prior year second quarter and our overall leverage dropped to only 1 7 times i want to recognize our teams really in both pmc and water for the way we ve navigated the first half of the year in the midst of a pretty complex transaction our relentless focus on leveraging rbs and now zbs to drive results and customer satisfaction truly without a blip speaks to the culture talent and commitment we collectively built here at rexnord in water we grew the topline 39 29 organically with margins right at 27 its core margins were exceptional while we continue to integrate hadrian and make significant organic growth investments in our business one additional point of perspective on the zurn performance in the quarter the comp from last year s second quarter wasn t all that easy we were down only 5 in a pandemic impacted quarter one of only two quarters we have been posted positive core growth in the last 11 plus years so when comparing to the 2019 second quarter second quarter sales this year are up 24 organically and core margins have expanded almost 200 basis points in pmc we re seeing continued recovery across really all of our end markets its core growth of 16 was split between 21 in our pmc businesses and down only 15 in aerospace and as we had anticipated we expect aerospace to be a contributor to core growth in the second half overall pmc order rates were up 40 on a core basis in the quarter and our backlog we start the second half of the year with 60 million higher than it was when we started in january at this point we expect pmc ebitda for 2021 to exceed 300 million up considerably from the announcement of the transaction with regal which puts the combined business and 120 million of announced synergies ahead of where we were all expecting at the time of the announcement as we get into the 2022 run rate as far as the rmt transaction you noticed that last night or probably really early this morning our proxy related to the transaction was declared effective by the sec and in there we ve set a date for the shareholder vote on september 1 after that we ve got to wait for the irs ruling to close but continue to believe that it s sometime early in the fourth quarter potentially even late in the third quarter and it s contingent upon that ruling to close on the second quarter the continued exceptional performance in water coupled with the momentum and recovery in pmc come at a perfect time to consummate the transaction and the merger of pmc with regal the stand alone water business is performing exceptionally and once we go through the separation it will be renamed zurn water solutions as i mentioned last quarter and trade under the ticker zws on the new york stock exchange upon separation if you then go to the next slide as i mentioned just a few minutes ago we ve significantly ramped our growth investment spend over the last couple of years to open up new parts of our served markets drive new markets drive greater levels of specification and continue to build on the competitive moat we built inside of our water management business first of all we ve taken all of our hygienic and environmental products and started to brand and market the entire portfolio under the brightshield by zurn banner brightshield equates to hygienic clean and safe public and private spaces with our unrivaled suite of products that are connected and paired for performance we re bringing together a package that can be used to create a safe haven inside of buildings where students fans medical staff customers and employees can walk in and know they are entering a clean and safe space and building owners can schedule maintenance based on demand replenish consumables and provide their patrons with a positive experience the relevance of brightshield is backed up with analytics that show people spend more money return more often and have a more favorable impression of a public or private space when it s clean and safe we ve even patented things like hand washing stores which are incredibly important in things like healthcare facilities and hospitals all of this really generate a positive tangible roi for building owners there s a lot more to come around brightshield in the coming months both from a product and capability offering as well as some adjacent channel opportunities that we see which will greatly enhance our served market if we turn to the next slide inside of brightshield we recently launched our hydro x sensor faucet a hydro power driven faucet that s built on our gear driven actuation platform with an embedded ceramic diaphragm belt creating a bulletproof sustainable energy solution for hand washing it drives higher performance at all types of water quality settings it s easier to install and maintain and creates the opportunity for us to become the basis of design as the only one in the marketplace with this compounding benefit of gear driven ceramic and sustainable solution if we turn to the next slide inside of flow systems we just launched the flo force stream this new patented technology is by far the best flow rates in the industry it allows building owners to use fewer drains to perform at a higher level reducing building costs through the cost of the product and the installation we ve developed it in our flow lab of industry experts and it s been an absolute home run since we launched it about 45 days ago to date we are betting 1 000 with establishing this as the basis design basis to design in over 50 active specifications and actually no competitor has anything close to this what i hope you are taking away from this all of this is that so many of these solutions are actually contributing to making the plumbing and mechanical part of the building more cost effective which is an increasingly important part of the equation for building owners when they deal with cost inflation superior solutions that reduce cost is a really powerful value proposition lean construction coupled with sustainable solutions is only going to become more important as we move forward and we see ample opportunities to exploit our unrivaled portfolio of water solutions for health human safety and the environment to drive growth over the coming years with that i ll turn it over to mark mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer great thanks todd let s start on slide number 7 please on a year over year basis our second quarter consolidated sales increased 27 to 568 million the growth was driven by a 300 basis point benefit from foreign currency translation a 400 basis point positive contribution from our hadrian acquisition on our water management platform partially offset by a small divestiture in our pmc platform that reduced our total sales by approximately 100 basis points and finally our core growth in the quarter of 21 with respect to profitability our adjusted ebitda increased 29 from the prior year second quarter to 133 million and our adjusted ebitda margin expanded 50 basis points year over year to 23 5 the incremental sales volume and the realization of our scope of three and other productivity actions drove the year over year improvement in our margin this quarter despite the headwinds we faced from the temporary cost reduction actions we took last year starting in the june quarter due to the covid 19 pandemic please turn to slide 8 and we will review our platform results at the platform level water management sales were up 39 from the prior year june quarter as the hadrian acquisition contributed 9 points of growth positive foreign currency translation contributed 1 point of growth and the core business increased 29 from the june 2020 quarter that was down only 5 continuing on the strength we experienced in the first quarter demand increased across our entire broad product portfolio in the second quarter as orders increased over 35 resulting in an improved backlog heading into the third quarter as we look to the back half of 2021 we see solid growth in the platform it s where we can deliver low double digit core growth for the year with respect to profitability our water management platform delivered a 28 increase in adjusted ebitda over the prior year as margins were at the high end of our expectations at 26 8 in the quarter inclusive of a step up in our growth investments the year over year margin comparison was impacted by the covid 19 related temporary cost reduction actions we took in the prior year second quarter as well the temporary mix impact from the recent hadrian acquisition both of which will impact year over year margin comparison in the third quarter as well turning to pmc sales increased 18 and that includes a 400 basis point benefit from foreign currency translation a 200 basis point reduction for the small 2020 fourth quarter divestiture in china and a core sales increase of 16 the core sales increase was driven by a 21 increase in our non aerospace end markets which was partially offset by the anticipated core sales decline in our aerospace end markets of 15 while our year over year sales declined in our aerospace end markets the demand trends continued to improve as orders grew sequentially from the first quarter of 2021 and year over year orders turned positive in the quarter and were up 50 from last year s second quarter which resulted in an increase in our backlog with a book to bill ratio of just under 1 1 demand trends in our non aerospace end markets continued to improve sequentially and core orders were up over 35 in the quarter with growth coming from nearly all end markets and geographies resulting in an increase in our backlog with a book to bill ratio of just over 1 1 with respect to north american distribution channel sell through again excluding our aerospace end markets we saw improvement in year over year growth rate each month of the quarter for the rest operating execution was again solid in the quarter as our adjusted ebitda margin was up 260 basis points year over year to 24 2 the benefits from the sales growth and our scofr and other structural cost reduction initiatives more than offset the year over year margin headwind from the temporary cost reduction actions we implemented in the second quarter of 2020 due to the covid 19 pandemic please turn to slide number 9 with a strong first half start to free cash flow generation and our adjusted ebitda our net debt leverage was reduced to 1 7 times at the end of the june quarter down from the 2 times at march 31 2021 please turn to slide 10 due to the anticipated timing of the rmt transaction we will continue to run our external outlook for the upcoming quarter with that said we re projecting total sales in our water management platform to increase by a high teens percentage and we are projecting that year over year total sales will increase by a mid teens percentage in our pmc platform based on our platform result expectations we d expect our adjusted ebitda margin in our water management platform to be between 26 and 27 and for our adjusted ebitda margin in our pmc platform to be between 23 and 24 we expect our corporate expenses to be approximately 10 million in the quarter before we open the call for questions a few comments on our tax rate interest expense stock comp expense and depreciation and amortization we anticipate our tax rate on adjusted pre tax earnings in the september quarter to be approximately 27 to 28 our interest expense for the september quarter is expected to be approximately 12 million our non cash stock comp expense should be about 12 million and our depreciation and amortization will come in around 24 million with that we ll open the call up for questions questions and answers operator thank you at this time we would like to take any questions you might have for the rest of the day we have our first question from the line of jeff hammond from keybanc capital markets your line is open jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst hey good morning guys todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer hey jeff mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer good morning jeff jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst so really just wanted to get a better sense of what s really driving the 2q water business i think that was the biggest surprise in my model is it more the hygienics momentum or is it more broad based and maybe within that just speak to what you re seeing on the broader non res side todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer yes frankly jeff it s really the entire business i think hygienics continues to be a huge opportunity for us but in flow systems we re seeing all the things that were supposed to start perhaps 12 to 18 months ago begin to start now we continue to have great traction in water safety and control with our backflow and a host of other products so it was really frankly much more broad based than just the hygienic and environmental part of the business and look i think it s non res look the end we said it before it s a hyper local market and there s always activity and you see california begin texas is doing great things and northeast is beginning to come back to life it s we think the rest of the year looks good and all signs indicate that 2022 is really good i mean the momentum index is strong so it s sort of what we had expected i think there was a big fear that there was going to be a dearth of activity in 2021 and hygienics was going to carry us through the reality is i think the end markets regionally are going to be fine and obviously we ve got this long tailwind in hygienic environmental and the conversion away from manual to sensor and so that s i think the way to think about it the rest of this year and into next year for sure jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay great and then just i know a lot of moving pieces in the margins a tough comp there maybe just talk about what the underlying incrementals are in the business if you kind of cut out the noise of fx hadrian some of the temp cost coming back and then maybe just speak to the hadrian integration and how it s progressing in terms of some of the margin improvement initiatives thanks mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer yes jeff this is mark like todd mentioned if you look at the underlying core business the zurn core business in the quarter was ebitda margins and the core business despite some of the headwinds from the cost out last year are performing very well continue to be managing the price cost equation effectively in the business so yes from a quarter standpoint everything we expected and i think the team needs to do a great job while at the same time as we mentioned we set up our investment in the business on multiple fronts to drive the near term growth opportunities as well the long term growth strategy so core margin is in a really good spot i ll turn it back to todd let him cover hadrian todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer yes in terms of hadrian we are really excited about the opportunity long term with hadrian obviously it s been a little bit difficult to do all the integration stuff and just given the inability to travel up till now so i suspect that we re going to really accelerate the margins in the second half of the year and into 2022 with hadrian and march them up the ladder for something that starts with a two on it in a relatively short period of time so we re thrilled to have it in the portfolio and now we re starting to be able to use it in the ways that we envision which is offering sku solutions in and around the commercial restroom that would include that the other thing to remember about hadrian is a lot of this is in schools and hospitals and things like that that really have done no retrofit upgrades for the past 12 months so the backlog the order rate the inquiry rate is substantially higher than what we would have envisioned just probably six months ago so i think we re on a good path to get hadrian right where we want it and we re thrilled to have it in the portfolio jeff hammond keybanc capital markets analyst okay great thanks guys operator thank you the next question is from bryan blair from oppenheimer your line is now open bryan blair oppenheimer co analyst good morning guys very strong quarter todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer good morning bryan bryan blair oppenheimer co analyst nice thought we could dig in a little more on what you re seeing in the education vertical specifically obviously core to your business and how the space is influencing zurn s current momentum and the revised 2021 growth outlook todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer well obviously when you look at some of the extra funding that s going to be a positive tailwind i don t think any people had anticipated over the course of last year and again i think the specific verticals follow the specific economic activity regionally and in these local markets and so when you think about places like texas arizona florida where you re seeing a significant population growth that drives all the other things around it whether that s additional healthcare facilities or schools high schools etc and now with this incremental extra funding that states are getting i think there s going to be a real opportunity we re tracking the levels of funding where it s going quotation opportunities and then you got to you got to just work through how that money is going to get spent and allocated through frankly things like school boards etc so it s going to be a positive tailwind for us that we probably didn t fully anticipate probably six months ago bryan blair oppenheimer co analyst helpful detail that makes sense and you touched on hadrian integration and the pandemic conditions that haven t been ideal for that but good momentum overall your revenue this quarter look like it should get in the high teens obviously above 60 million annualized what kind of growth are you expecting for the year from hadrian mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer it s basically yeah you look at the numbers it s a mid to high teens number so that feels relatively consistent as you look at the next few quarters and how it contributes to our overall growth the business itself is growing very well on a core basis year over year with more as todd mentioned quite a little more on the back half on a core basis given the opening up we re seeing momentum we are starting to see in some of these retrofit projects that are coming to fruition over time so more to come on that and then on the margin side i mentioned earlier maybe really good progress a meaningful improvement in the margin in the back half versus first half if we get into 2022 bryan blair oppenheimer co analyst got it and then one higher level one perhaps i was reading too much into this but the preliminary 2022 market outlook being decent for your press release can you offer some color on how your team is thinking about the puts and takes there i would think the outlook at least assuming we don t have a drastic shift in backdrop would be quite a bit more bullish given the indicators at hand and then certainly the momentum of your own business todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer well i guess the way to read it bryan is with six months to go or so in 21 i think decent is an appropriate way to characterize it as we get closer to that and things hanging in there i would we will upgrade our outlook accordingly so i think a year ago we had a view that the world wasn t going to end in 21 and everyone did and so i think the way to read into that is decent probably only gets upgraded as we go through the year but generally speaking i think we feel pretty good about it bryan blair oppenheimer co analyst very good fair thanks guys operator thank you the next one is from mig dobre from baird your line is open mig dobre robert w baird analyst thanks well as a bucks fan myself i was hoping around midnight last night that maybe you guys would delay the call but i guess that wasn t to be so i had a couple of strong coffees and here i am mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer that makes the two of us mig mig dobre robert w baird analyst yes of course i guess what i m wondering here as we re thinking about zws as a stand alone entity how are you planning on talking about the business are you going to provide some kind of a new segment structure either by end market or and even within the makeup of the business right i mean you re talking about institutional and then commercial and industrial but i m wondering based on questions that have been asked already are we going to be able to put maybe a finer point as to what the sub verticals if you would education versus healthcare versus true commercial is going to be as zws gets closer and closer to be a stand alone entity how do you think about that todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer well mig the one thing i ll say is last quarter we outlined a preview essentially a little bit on zws just in terms of what it is we do how we do it some of the product categories and we talked about three sectors water safety and control that would essentially cut across all different verticals we talked about hygienic and environmental which is i think that s the sensor category and other things and then finally flow systems which is primarily our drainage business which again cuts across all different verticals each has a little bit of a different dynamic with respect to retrofit but i think that s the the sector views how we re sort of planning on talking through the business on a go forward basis and as we get closer to the eventual stand alone pure play water business we will be out i think doing a little bit of a mini roadshow and getting people exposure to how we are going to about the business some of the dynamics and how we expect it to perform going forward mig dobre robert w baird analyst okay for several quarters now you ve been talking about new product introductions obviously focused on water management and i m sort of wondering how you re thinking about first the product vitality now versus say five years ago in terms of all the work that s been done here and how are you thinking about the growth algorithm in terms of at this point what s the fair expectations for new product contribution to organic growth but also what happens with margin right from all these new products that you re introducing that you re basically saying hey these are unique they are differentiated and they create a lot of value for our customers can you talk about that todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer well i ll start by saying there is without question far more innovation in new product development in the last five years than probably the 20 prior to that secondly every product that we ve been introducing is at a financial profile and margin better than probably the full average and number three you can t i think it s really important to understand that we develop a product to drive the best or highest level of specification that you can and so like and so you drive specification with an engineer architect or end user you don t want to introduce a new product that doesn t reap the rewards of having done that spadework on the specification so i don t think vitality is necessarily the right way to think about this it s the compounding moat of either basis of design or high level specification we re really driving within this because if you just want to look at pure product vitality numbers you re going to like walk down this road of doing all the work to get specified and when the time comes for it to get bought it goes into a construction site and you ve got a different product right so you want to make sure that you re pacing the new product innovation but equally important is the specification work upfront so i think there is a level of understanding on this that has to be well understood from your side and obviously investors but look i mean the business grew 29 24 on a stack basis core margins as mark said almost 28 i think we re doing something right and so as you think about the go forward again pounding new products creating a greater competitive moat and driving specification in those products is the focus organically and then obviously we can we expect to be able to do some m a in and around these three sectors that will drive even more overall growth beyond just core growth mig dobre robert w baird analyst yeah that s fair if i can ask a question on todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer well thanks mig well thank you mig dobre robert w baird analyst you re welcome if i can ask a question on pmc the recovery here like you said a little bit better than what you previously anticipated as you re looking at this business and you re comparing it to prior cycles probably downturns leaving aerospace aside right because that s kind of we all understand those dynamics there but i m curious what are you seeing that s maybe different in this upcycle and what do you think are some implications for the business down the line post transaction in the way maybe rbc is going to be able to drive either synergies or incremental growth based on that todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer well i think from an end market perspective i would say it s much less individual end market driven meaning looking back mining was great or looking back oil and gas was great this is far more broad based i think our level of diversification in and around more stable end markets like food and beverage is clearly playing through and i think as we look forward and partner with regal on this i think they see the opportunity to continue to own and win these more process based industries but continue to diversify the business into these more broadly stable end markets with a significant amount of content win the first fit and then win the aftermarket for a long period of time so i think it s coming together at the perfect time i think our teams are working together really really well and i think we re excited just to get down to the final strokes and get the merger done but i think generally speaking i think it s just far more broad based and far more focused on more stable end markets and the diversification that we ve done over the last whatever five or six years mig dobre robert w baird analyst great thanks for taking the question operator thank you the next question is from the line of andrew obin from bank of america please go ahead emily shu bank of america analyst hi good morning this is emily shu on for andrew obin todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer good morning emily shu bank of america analyst good morning i just wanted to dig deeper on the school vertical for zurn is there any way to break down how much of the current backlog is existing retrofit work that was pushed out from last year and then what is new work that s being spent on by the stimulus money thanks todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer yes emily if that exists we d love to have it too i think we just think that we re looking at each of these opportunities on a very hyper local regional basis but i don t think we have the ability to break that out for you emily shu bank of america analyst okay no problem and then my follow up question is on supply chain what types of challenges are you and your suppliers experiencing particularly in asia and how do you think your supply chain strategy has allowed you to navigate through all the shortages that are going on right now thank you todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer well we obviously leverage a heavily leverage a design procure assemble test model we ve done a i think an outstanding job over the last 10 years to establish that establish multiple sources of supply diversify out of china as appropriate and then run a sign up process that is very strong to be able to predict demand and then ensure that we get the things that we want on time the challenges are numerous from individual component suppliers supplying our suppliers whether it s shipping costs shipping lanes but that s the business we ve chosen to be in and i think our sign up process in general it has to be super robust because we do rely on third party suppliers for helping us bring products to market and so that s been i think the thing that s helped us the most our teams have done a terrific job of staying in front of what we think the expected demand may be in order to ensure that lead times and availability are best in class and that s also helping us win business so it s really a multifaceted view of what we ve done and continue to do i mean like anybody else we have challenges day to day but the ability to navigate through those keep lead times and service levels super high is allowing us to win more often than not emily shu bank of america analyst great thank you i ll pass it on operator thank you the next one is from joe ritchie from goldman sachs joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst thanks good morning guys and congrats on the bucks win last night it looks like mick wasn t the only one partying todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer we ll put it that way joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst yes last night but couple of quick ones from me i guess maybe just comment kind of following on that the line of questioning that you just got on the supply chain and really this inflation in general we heard from dover yesterday that in one of their segment they built backlog this quarter because didn t have enough labor really to ship out some of their products and they highlighted kind of like inflation being a little bit more of a headwind in the second half of the year particularly on the labor and freight side so i d be curious to hear any comments that maybe you guys make along those lines and what you re seeing within your business todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer well obviously the outlook we provided for q3 has our best view on all of that we are not seeing the labor challenges that you just spoke out and i guess it s our view that when you have the dynamic that we have in the world the last couple of years starting with tariffs and then you have a pandemic on top of it and then you try to start the world up in a synchronous fashion it never comes back on the same straight line as you shut it off and obviously there are labor shortages in certain industries and certain parts of the market that are of course impacting that ability to get capacity back online across a wide array of interconnected suppliers and industries and so it s our view that the inflation that we re seeing now is a little bit transitory and by the time we get to winter we ll see that abate but everything that mark talked about and i spoke about in terms of how we re seeing the topline and our margins and things like that have all of that sort of with our best cut of what we re seeing and expect in it mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer i guess that we would expect to see some of the trend for freight costs shipping costs become a little frequent in the back half the year one reported in the world we agree with it with that point we know that we see it we built it in and we re managing around it joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst got it okay that s fair that s helpful and then maybe just my one follow on would be just around like m a so clearly nice job and then working down the leverage numbers again continuing to work it down i m sure once the transaction is completed i guess maybe just any color you can give us on your pipeline today how you re thinking about where valuations sit and how robust the pipeline is today todd adams chair of the board president and chief executive officer look when we made the decision to do this we made it with knowing that we were going to be we were going to be stand alone and we better have a robust enough of pipeline to begin to acquire and leave ourselves with a balance sheet to be able to do that and so i think i think we see a number of opportunities i don t think we re going to predict the time or the timing but i think we feel really good about m a opportunities in and around our core business and maybe some line extensions over time and in terms of valuation obviously we ve been a disciplined acquirer for a long long time i think we re going to continue to do that our philosophy has been cultivate things that make a lot of sense and due to the value of the discipline it creates a high roic in a relatively short period of time and that s not going to change so you listen to some of these calls and people just gripe about how expensive things are we get paid to get these things done and create value for shareholders and so that s what we re going to continue to do joe ritchie goldman sachs analyst yes that s great to hear thanks guys nice quarter mark peterson senior vice president and chief financial officer thanks joe operator thank you there are no further questions at this time presenters please continue todd adams chair of the board president and chief

join us some weeks my neighbors might really question what i do for a living with one or two different vehicles in my driveway week to week they probably think i either work for a car dealer or a drug dealer this week especially it looked more like the latter with not one but two very fast and furious cars in my driveway this week i got to experience the 2021 ford mustang shelby gt500 i wrote my full thoughts and review here on this extraordinary muscle car to summarize but really click the link this muscle car is super fast to the tune of 760 horsepower emphasis on the word tune as the throaty growl of the shelby was absolutely amazing not to be outmatched by the pristine seven speed dual clutch transmission in short the shelby was awesome but i had a choice to drive another vehicle too in fact it s my job to drive it it s a hard life i tell you also in my driveway for the week was the acura nsx in indy yellow pearl the shelby gt500 i had was also in a new color for the model year antimatter blue the impressive paint coats alone having nearly 300 000 in cars in front of your house can garner attention of note i also had a third vehicle the lexus nx 300h the same week it says something when a lexus is the shabbiest of your vehicles for the week but for the sake of this article we re going to look at these two vastly different but equally appealing cars i realize that this might be the only comparison between a shelby mustang and an acura nsx ever done so hurray for a unique google search and obviously these two cars have little to nothing in common and really can t be compared instead i ll focus on what these cars do best shelby gt500 the muscle car of all muscle cars that above statement alone might have the mopar community up in arms with hellcat enthusiasts weighing in but for me the 2021 shelby gt500 is the perfect muscle car it is the total package with looks performance and sound to go along with a competitive price point it s almost as value oriented for what you get as the c8 corvette is my tester came in with a price tag around 78 000 but many shelbys have been selling for more than six figures and certainly this muscle car has the opportunity to retain its value or even grow its value it should be an instant collector car acura nsx supercar with big price tag i have yet to write my official review of the acura nsx so i ll hold back some of my thoughts for a later date but i was thrilled to be given a chance to drive the nsx it was one of the few supercars i had yet to experience and truth be told the one thing that works against the nsx is that it lacks cache it s not an audi r8 it s not a lamborghini it s not even a ford gt and really the gt not the shelby gt500 is the fairer ford comparison to the nsx the nsx looks the part of being special with the new special paint color that indy yellow pearl makes it stand out more i received a lot of thumbs up second looks and people taking photos of the nsx during my time with it the msrp of my beautiful yellow supercar came in at a staggering 197 995 which makes the shelby s price of 78 000 look like quite a bargain heck you can get two shelbys for the price of nsx that brought me to the next question is the acura nsx better than a shelby gt500 better is a subjective word is it twice better than shelby since the price would dictate that it is i can t really say as the two cars are just so vastly different let s break down the powertrain and performance the shelby gt500 has a 5 2 liter supercharged v8 engine that produces 760 horsepower stock the growl and sheer muscley performance is tough to rival and i ve sang the praises of the seven speed tremec transmission seriously it s the best transmission i ve ever experienced as for the nsx it also has a dual clutch transmission but with a 9 speed you d think two extra gears would make it better but the engineering of the shelby outshines the very good transmission of the nsx that s not to say the nsx s transmission isn t stellar because it is the nsx is technically considered a hybrid with an electrified drivetrain mated to a 3 5 liter twin turbo v6 that s right it s a v6 but remember so is the ford gt out of that v6 engine acura manages to pull an impressive 573 horses and the tune of the nsx is very sweet with a much different sound than the shelby but still very exhilarating four modes includes track mode change up its dynamics if you re comparing strictly by horsepower numbers there s no comparison but that s where trying to compare the two is really not fair the nsx actually is faster in 0 60 mph testing with a rating of 2 9 seconds the shelby which is a lot heavier clocks in just over 3 seconds both cars are blazing fast and both cars are super fun to drive but the experience is totally different as each car has a different driving dynamic and personality the differences are easy to tell not just by looks but by the numbers which tell the tale the shelby weighs 4 182 pounds compared to the light acura nsx which weighs in at 3 878 the nsx s wheelbase is smaller too at 103 5 inches to the gt500 s which is 107 1 conclusion both cars are special and both cars are amazing i ll remember my time with them mostly because it happened during the same week both cars begged to be driven i made a loose comparison that it was comparing which you like better nascar or indy car the raw power and popularity of nascar is what the shelby represents while the more exotic and refined performance and handling of the all wheel drive acura nsx represents indy cars both are fun to watch for different reasons just as both of these cars oh so fun to drive for different reasons i was sad to see both cars this week was a blast and will be a lasting memory for sure as

share 13 growth in core earnings non gaap 0 97 return on assets 1 01 core return on assets non gaap 8 annualized total commercial loan growth excluding ppp loans 14 annualized increase in core deposits 13 increase in fee income exceptional credit quality president and chief executive officer curtis c simard stated we had another quarter of double digit core earnings growth and core return on assets of over 1 00 profitability increased on higher fee income driven from growth in core deposits and assets under management aum customer service income returned to pre pandemic levels suggesting a potentially meaningful recovery in regional activity augmented by a lift from our previously announced fee strategies implemented at the start of this year the 8 annualized growth in commercial loans during the quarter excluding ppp reflects our commitment to meeting the needs of our existing customers and developing new relationships as we navigate past ppp activities our wealth management business continues to be a significant contributor to total non interest income while our retail and commercial loan teams continue to generate new core deposit accounts especially in dda categories more than 1 000 new banking relationships were created in the second quarter highlighting both existing customer retention efforts and new customer initiatives with the increase in mortgage rates late in the first quarter we chose to opportunistically add balances to the balance sheet which helped stem the attrition however a focus on irr management remains top of mind mr simard continued we continued to organically grow our capital levels expanding tangible equity to tangible assets non gaap to 8 23 while maintaining exceptional credit quality all credit metrics remain strong and further improved in the quarter primarily marked by lower past dues minimal net charge offs and improved coverage ratios overall we continue to see favorable migration in risk ratings across most loan categories loan modification concessions made during the pandemic have essentially all resumed normal repayment schedules as of the end of the quarter mr simard stated as we think about net interest margin nim quarter over quarter the second quarter had substantially less ppp fee acceleration and was further impacted by the excess cash on hand of note 105 million of wholesale deposits matured on the last day of the quarter which will benefit our cost of funds going forward we are starting to see a leveling off of nim excluding non recurring items as reliance on wholesale borrowings continues to be reduced and dda growth continues given our overall asset sensitive balance sheet position and a more core funded profile we are well positioned for when rates start to move back up excluding the effects of one time items our second quarter nim was 2 95 compared with the same adjusted metric of 2 86 in the first quarter 2021 mr simard commented in the first quarter we announced the initiation of a comprehensive review of our non interest expenses which included an annual reduction to salary and benefits of more than 3 0 million along with additional cost savings associated with vendor contracts and process efficiencies while some savings have been immediately realized in our second quarter run rates others will be phased in depending on contract timelines as we continue to resume business as usual activities we are also rolling out cost containment initiatives to absorb any potential increases associated with pandemic delayed expenses lastly we evaluate profitability at each branch within our footprint at least annually taking into consideration the unique geography of northern new england and our customer needs mr simard concluded as we move into the second half of the year we are encouraged by an improving economic outlook and better operating conditions our collective resilience has prepared and positioned us to move forward with the same resolve that has sustained us throughout the pandemic we have a unique complementary footprint that is enabling us to utilize all earnings levers that align with our model and strategy we look forward

credit losses for the quarter was a benefit of 765 thousand compared to an expense of 1 4 million in the second quarter of 2020 the provision recapture in the second quarter 2021 is attributable to

file in this oct 10 2019 file photo a pacific gas electric sign is shown outside of a pg e building in san francisco pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation sprawling across its drought stricken service ap photo jeff chiu file pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles 16 000 kilometers of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation across drought stricken california the daunting project announced wednesday aims to bury about 10 of pg e s distribution and transmission lines at a projected cost of 15 billion to as much as 30 billion based on how much the process currently costs the utility believes it will find ways to keep the final bill at the lower end of those estimates most of the costs will likely be shouldered by pg e customers whose electricity rates are already among the highest in the u s pg e stepped up its safety commitment just days after informing regulators a 70 foot 23 meter pine tree that toppled on one of its power lines ignited a major fire in butte county the same rural area about 145 miles 233 kilometers northeast of san francisco where another fire sparked by its equipment in 2018 killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands of homes advertisement since it started july 13 in a remote area of butte county the dixie fire has churned northeast through the sierra nevada by wednesday the fire spanned a 133 square mile 344 square kilometer area forcing the plumas county sheriff on wednesday to order evacuations along the west shore of popular lake almanor the backlash to pg e s potential liability for the dixie fire prompted the company s recently hired ceo patricia patti poppe to unveil the plan for underground lines several months earlier than she said she planned previous pg e regimes have staunchly resisted plans to bury long stretches of power lines because of the massive expense involved but poppe told reporters on wednesday that she quickly realized after she joined pg e in january that moving lines underground is the best way to protect both the utility and the 16 million people who rely on it for power it s too expensive not to do it lives are on the line poppe told reporters pg e said only that burying the lines will take several years however getting the job done within the next decade will require a quantum leap in the few areas where pg e has already been burying power lines it has been completing about 70 miles 123 kilometers annually pg e expects to eventually be able to bury more than 1 000 miles 1 600 kilometers of power lines annually said its chief operating officer adam wright while wright likened the project to the marshall plan that helped rebuild europe after world war ii poppe invoked president john f kennedy s 1962 pledge for the u s to land on the moon pg e s path to this point has been strewn with death and destruction after previous leaders allowed its equipment to fall into disrepair in a apparent attempt to boost profits and management bonuses the utility s grid was blamed for igniting a series of devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that prompted the company to file for bankruptcy in 2019 the biggest fire in butte county wiped out the entire town of paradise and resulted in pg e pleading guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter last year just weeks before it emerged from one of the most complex cases in u s history as part of its bankruptcy pg e set up a 13 5 billion trust to pay victims of its past wildfires but that fund is facing a roughly 2 billion shortfall because half its money is supposed to come from company stock that has been a market laggard since getting out of bankruptcy pg e also has been rebuked by california power regulators and a federal judge overseeing its criminal probation for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the utility has also been charged with another round of fire related crimes that it denies committing poppe insisted things are getting better this year under a plan that calls for pg e to spend 1 4 billion removing more than 300 000 trees and trimming another 1 1 million but she conceded the utility is not making enough progress since it s only a fraction of that 8 million trees within striking distance of its power lines but she also defended pg e s handling of the tree that may have caused the dixie fire and its response the tree looked healthy and was about 40 feet 12 meters from power lines she said making it a low risk danger when a pg e troubleshooter was sent out to inspect a potential problem he noticed the tree had fallen and may have started a fire in a treacherous area that he tried to put out before firefighters arrived his efforts can be called nothing less than heroic poppe said

a new uranium etf and japan s renewed interest in nuclear energy powered these three companies what happened shares of junior uranium miners shot through the roof today as of the market s close on wednesday uranium energy uec 3 48 energy fuels uuuu and ur energy urg were up 6 1 9 5 and 8 2 respectively as if the emergence of the world s first exchange traded fund etf that invests in physical uranium wasn t enough to stir up frenzied buying in uranium stocks big nuclear energy news from japan this morning added fuel to the enthusiasm so what miners profitability depends a great deal on uranium prices after a lull that lasted years uranium spot prices crossed 30 per pound in 2020 only to give up some gains as 2021 kicked off prices have bounced back by double digits since though triggering hopes of better days ahead for uranium miners the enthusiasm hit a whole new level when the sprott physical uranium trust fund started trading on the toronto exchange on july 19 the prospects of an actively traded fund that invests in physical uranium with more than 600 million in assets under management cannot be underestimated especially given that it s the first such uranium etf in the world and comes with a large capital pool and expertise in dealing in metals the etf saw a lot of investor interest on its first day and bought 100 000 pounds of the metal uranium bulls believe this could just be the beginning with mining giant cameco ccj 2 63 even mentioning during its last earnings call how the entry of such a large active uranium fund could not only boost uranium prices but also create transparency in the spot market cameco s views matter as it s one of the world s largest producers and is striving to boost uranium prices not surprisingly uranium stocks are soaring importantly even junior miners stand to benefit from any uptick in uranium prices thanks to recent moves by the miners the best example is uranium energy uranium energy hasn t generated any revenue from uranium since 2015 but it started buying physical uranium aggressively this year to take advantage of low uranium prices by may 20 it had accumulated nearly 2 3 million pounds of warehoused uranium at an average price of around 30 per pound management hopes to be able to secure supply contracts now that it has uranium inventory and also to sell uranium as prices appreciate using the proceeds to ramp up production and strengthen its balance sheet ur energy already has a producing mine lost creek and recently received a permit to begin construction at shirley basin both are in wyoming importantly the company held roughly 285 000 pounds of uranium ready for sale as of june energy fuels shares have outperformed peers so far this year partly because the company has also entered the rare earth market even so energy fuels only uranium producing mine white mesa has a licensed capacity to produce nearly 8 million pounds annually which means it can expand production rapidly when uranium markets recover now what there are four broad triggers for uranium prices buying activity from the sprott physical uranium trust potential investments in clean energy under the biden administration production curtailment from the world s largest uranium producers like cameco and kazatomprom and higher global investment in nuclear energy while the first three are self explanatory the last point warrants attention japan has been bringing dormant nuclear reactors back to life in anticipation of the summer olympics and now has nine operating reactors it s highest number since the fukushima daiichi disaster in 2011 and the country is reportedly considering doubling the share of renewables in its power grid over the next decade that includes aggressive investments to restart its dormant capacity according to a wall street journal report today since japan is a nuclear powerhouse and nuclear energy is the key to uranium s survivability and growth you can understand why this is such big news for the industry couple that with the sprott fund s potential to boost the uranium market and it s clear why uranium stocks were heading skyward today
aurora il accesswire july 21 2021 old second bancorp inc the company we us and our nasdaq osbc the parent company of old second national bank the bank today announced financial results for the second quarter of 2021 our net income was 8 8 million or 0 30 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2021 compared to net income of 11 9 million or 0 40 per diluted share for the first quarter of 2021 and net income of 9 2 million or 0 31 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020 net income for the second quarter of 2021 reflected a 3 5 million pre tax release of provision for credit losses compared to a 3 0 million pre tax release in the first quarter of 2021 and a 2 1 million pre tax provision expense in the second quarter of 2020 mortgage banking income totaled 1 6 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 5 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 5 1 million in the second quarter of 2020 mortgage servicing rights experienced a mark to market loss of 1 0 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared to a 1 1 million gain in the prior quarter and a 445 000 loss in the second quarter of 2020 net gain on sales of mortgage loans totaled 1 9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 3 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 4 6 million in the second quarter of 2020 as mortgage origination and refinancing volumes declined in the current period operating results second quarter 2021 net income was 8 8 million reflecting a decrease in earnings of 3 1 million from the first quarter of 2021 and a decrease of 418 000 from the second quarter of 2020 net interest and dividend income was 22 0 million for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 1 6 million or 6 8 from the first quarter of 2021 and a decrease of 754 000 or 3 3 from second quarter of 2020 interest and dividend income for the second quarter of 2021 was 24 2 million or 1 2 million less than the first quarter of 2021 and 1 5 million less than the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates over the past year interest and dividend income was favorably impacted by loan fees earned on forgiven paycheck protection program ppp loans during the first and second quarters of 2021 we originated 746 ppp loans totaling 136 7 million in 2020 and as of june 30 2021 11 6 million on 35 ppp loans originated during the first round of the ppp loan program remained outstanding during the first and second quarters of 2021 we originated 62 3 million or 574 loans under the second round of the ppp loan program of which 58 6 million or 483 loans remain outstanding as of june 30 2021 net loan interest and fee income recorded in 2021 year to date on all ppp loans totaled 1 6 million and approximately 2 3 million of net ppp loan fees remain unearned as of june 30 2021 interest expense for the second quarter of 2021 totaled 2 2 million compared to 1 8 million for the first quarter of 2021 and 3 0 million for the second quarter of 2020 the 393 000 increase in interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to the april 6 2021 issuance of 60 0 million of 3 50 fixed to floating rate subordinated notes due april 15 2031 which bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 3 50 until april 14 2026 the reduction in interest expense in the year over year period was due to a decrease in market interest rates which impacted all interest bearing deposit categories we recorded a 3 5 million release of provision expense in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a 3 0 million release of provision expense in the first quarter of 2021 and a 2 1 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2020 as the projected impact of the covid 19 pandemic on future credit losses is currently anticipated to be less than prior projections our allowance for credit losses acl on loans in the second quarter of 2021 consisted of a release of the acl on loans of 2 3 million as well as 65 000 of net charge offs recorded during the quarter in addition the acl for unfunded commitments decreased by 1 2 million in the second quarter of 2021 due to an updated forecast of credit line utilization rates noninterest income was 7 9 million for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 3 4 million or 29 9 compared to 11 3 million for the first quarter of 2021 and a decrease of 2 8 million or 26 0 compared to 10 7 million for the second quarter of 2020 the decrease from the linked quarter was primarily driven by a 4 1 million decline in residential mortgage banking revenue attributable to a 2 1 million decrease in the mark to market adjustment on msrs and a 1 8 million decrease in net gain on the sales of mortgage loans in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the prior quarter these decreases to noninterest income were partially offset by a 238 000 increase in wealth management income and a 218 000 increase in card related income in the current quarter compared to the linked quarter the decrease in noninterest income in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 was primarily due to a 3 5 million decline in residential mortgage banking revenue attributable to a 588 000 increase in mark to market loss on msrs and a 2 7 million decrease in net gain on sales of mortgage loans in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 noninterest expense was 21 4 million for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 337 000 or 1 6 compared to 21 7 million for the first quarter of 2021 and an increase of 2 5 million or 13 3 from 18 9 million for the second quarter of 2020 the decrease from the linked quarter was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense stemming from additional officer incentive compensation expenses paid out in early 2021 and the related increase in payroll taxes and 401k company match expense in addition a decrease in occupancy furniture and equipment costs was related to snow removal costs and building maintenance due to weather conditions in february 2021 the increase in noninterest expense in the year over year period was primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense occupancy furniture and equipment expenses card related expense and other expense the provision for income taxes expense was 3 2 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 4 2 million for the first quarter of 2021 and 3 1 million for the second quarter of 2020 the decrease in tax expense for the linked quarter was due to lower pre tax income in the second quarter of 2021 and the increase in tax expense for the year over year period was primarily due to a decrease in tax deductible expenses in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 during the second quarter of 2021 we repurchased 310 900 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 13 55 per share pursuant to our stock repurchase program on july 20 2021 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0 05 per share payable on august 9 2021 to stockholders of record as of july 30 2021 president and chief executive officer jim eccher said an improving economy and conservative positioning resulted in solid bottom line earnings and a continued return of excess capital to our stockholders through the recent increase in the common dividend and continued share repurchases while challenges remain our credit quality metrics and expectations have continued to improve as the chicago area moves towards a more normalized environment loan demand continued to remain soft in the second quarter with utilization rates remaining low and customers using excess liquidity to pay down existing debt the end result was a somewhat disappointing 21 9 million linked quarter decline in loans and leases held for investment exclusive of ppp loan activity deposit inflows remain robust and resulted in a further increase in excess liquidity as evidenced by a 140 0 million increase in average cash on the balance sheet during the quarter we continue to deploy a portion of the excess liquidity on our balance sheet in short duration securities with yields far below the aggregate portfolio yield the combination of these factors largely resulted in a 39 basis point sequential quarter decline in our net interest margin but a far more modest sequential decline in net interest income looking forward i am more optimistic on loan growth for the remainder of the year and believe reported margin trends are more symptomatic of the profound increase in liquidity on our balance sheet rather than any fundamental change in our business i believe old second remains conservatively positioned to meet these challenges as our expenses remain well controlled our business is well diversified customer activity is increasing and our underwriting has remained disciplined and consistent i would like to thank our employees for their continued hard work in delivering a solid quarter while delivering exceptional customer service as we move towards a more normal routine covid 19 update late in the first quarter of 2020 we began granting loan payment deferrals to certain borrowers affected by the pandemic for the period april 1 2020 through june 30 2021 our clients had requested loan payment deferrals on 506 loans totaling 237 8 million as of june 30 2021 488 loans representing 228 7 million outstanding or 96 2 of the original loan balances deferred have resumed payments or paid off active payment deferrals remain on 18 loans with 9 1 million of balances outstanding we are participating in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act during 2021 we processed 574 loan applications for ppp loans representing a total of 62 3 million as of june 30 2021 we had 11 6 million of ppp loans outstanding that were originated under the first round of the ppp loan program and 58 6 million of ppp loans outstanding that were originated under the second round of the ppp loan program early in the fourth quarter of 2020 we started to submit applications for ppp loan forgiveness to the sba and as of june 30 2021 128 8 million on 802 loans have been forgiven we anticipate receiving the remaining funds for our first round of ppp loan forgiveness from the sba through the third quarter of 2021

and year over year periods were primarily due to 128 8 million of ppp loan paydowns in our commercial portfolio net of ppp loan originations of 62 3 million in 2021 as borrower liquidity is at a high level due to federal stimulus programs and there is a general lack of incentive for making capital expenditures average loans including loans held for sale for the second quarter of 2021 totaled 1 93

the unrealized mark to market adjustment on securities increased by 3 3 million since march 31 2021 and increased by 8 6 million in the year over year period due to market interest rate fluctuations non gaap presentations management has disclosed in this earnings release certain non gaap financial measures to evaluate and measure our performance including the presentation of net interest income and net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis our efficiency ratio calculations and core net interest margin on a taxable equivalent basis the net interest margin fully taxable equivalent is calculated by dividing net interest income on a tax equivalent basis by average earning assets for the period we consider the use of select non gaap financial measures and ratios to be useful for financial and operational decision making and useful in evaluating period to period comparisons we believe that these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by excluding certain expenditures or assets that we believe are not indicative of our primary business operating results or by presenting certain metrics on a fully taxable equivalent basis we believe these measures provide investors with information regarding balance sheet profitability and we believe that management and investors benefit from referring to these non gaap financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning forecasting analyzing and comparing past present and future periods these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as a substitute for gaap financial measures and we strongly encourage investors to review the gaap financial measures included in this earnings release and not to place undue reliance upon any single financial measure in addition because non gaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare the non gaap financial measures presented in this earnings release with other

file in this oct 10 2019 file photo a pacific gas electric sign is shown outside of a pg e building in san francisco pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation sprawling across its drought stricken service ap photo jeff chiu file san ramon calif pacific gas electric plans to bury 10 000 miles 16 000 kilometers of its power lines in an effort to prevent its fraying grid from sparking wildfires when electrical equipment collides with millions of trees and other vegetation across drought stricken california the daunting project announced wednesday aims to bury about 10 of pg e s distribution and transmission lines at a projected cost of 15 billion to as much as 30 billion based on how much the process currently costs the utility believes it will find ways to keep the final bill at the lower end of those estimates most of the costs will likely be shouldered by pg e customers whose electricity rates are already among the highest in the u s recommended videos pg e stepped up its safety commitment just days after informing regulators a 70 foot 23 meter pine tree that toppled on one of its power lines ignited a major fire in butte county the same rural area about 145 miles 233 kilometers northeast of san francisco where another fire sparked by its equipment in 2018 killed more than 80 people and destroyed thousands of homes since it started july 13 in a remote area of butte county the dixie fire has churned northeast through the sierra nevada by wednesday the fire spanned a 133 square mile 344 square kilometer area forcing the plumas county sheriff on wednesday to order evacuations along the west shore of popular lake almanor the backlash to pg e s potential liability for the dixie fire prompted the company s recently hired ceo patricia patti poppe to unveil the plan for underground lines several months earlier than she said she planned previous pg e regimes have staunchly resisted plans to bury long stretches of power lines because of the massive expense involved but poppe told reporters on wednesday that she quickly realized after she joined pg e in january that moving lines underground is the best way to protect both the utility and the 16 million people who rely on it for power it s too expensive not to do it lives are on the line poppe told reporters pg e said only that burying the lines will take several years however getting the job done within the next decade will require a quantum leap in the few areas where pg e has already been burying power lines it has been completing about 70 miles 123 kilometers annually pg e expects to eventually be able to bury more than 1 000 miles 1 600 kilometers of power lines annually said its chief operating officer adam wright while wright likened the project to the marshall plan that helped rebuild europe after world war ii poppe invoked president john f kennedy s 1962 pledge for the u s to land on the moon pg e s path to this point has been strewn with death and destruction after previous leaders allowed its equipment to fall into disrepair in a apparent attempt to boost profits and management bonuses the utility s grid was blamed for igniting a series of devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that prompted the company to file for bankruptcy in 2019 the biggest fire in butte county wiped out the entire town of paradise and resulted in pg e pleading guilty to 84 felony counts of involuntary manslaughter last year just weeks before it emerged from one of the most complex cases in u s history as part of its bankruptcy pg e set up a 13 5 billion trust to pay victims of its past wildfires but that fund is facing a roughly 2 billion shortfall because half its money is supposed to come from company stock that has been a market laggard since getting out of bankruptcy pg e also has been rebuked by california power regulators and a federal judge overseeing its criminal probation for breaking promises to reduce the dangers posed by trees near its power lines the utility has also been charged with another round of fire related crimes that it denies committing poppe insisted things are getting better this year under a plan that calls for pg e to spend 1 4 billion removing more than 300 000 trees and trimming another 1 1 million but she conceded the utility is not making enough progress since it s only a fraction of that 8 million trees within striking distance of its power lines but she also defended pg e s handling of the tree that may have caused the dixie fire and its response the tree looked healthy and was about 40 feet 12 meters from power lines she said making it a low risk danger when a pg e troubleshooter was sent out to inspect a potential problem he noticed the tree had fallen and may have started a fire in a treacherous area that he tried to put out before

and net income of 9 2 million or 0 31 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2020 net income for the second quarter of 2021 reflected a 3 5 million pre tax release of provision for credit losses compared to a 3 0 million pre tax release in the first quarter of 2021 and a 2 1 million pre tax provision expense in the second quarter of 2020 mortgage banking income totaled 1 6 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 5 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 5 1 million in the second quarter of 2020 mortgage servicing rights experienced a mark to market loss of 1 0 million during the second quarter of 2021 compared to a 1 1 million gain in the prior quarter and a 445 000 loss in the second quarter of 2020 net gain on sales of mortgage loans totaled 1 9 million in the second quarter of 2021 compared to 3 7 million in the first quarter of 2021 and 4 6 million in the second quarter of 2020 as mortgage origination and refinancing volumes declined in the current period operating results second quarter 2021 net income was 8 8 million reflecting a decrease in earnings of 3 1 million from the first quarter of 2021 and a decrease of 418 000 from the second quarter of 2020 net interest and dividend income was 22 0 million for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 1 6 million or 6 8 from the first quarter of 2021 and a decrease of 754 000 or 3 3 from second quarter of 2020 interest and dividend income for the second quarter of 2021 was 24 2 million or 1 2 million less than the first quarter of 2021 and 1 5 million less than the second quarter of 2020 primarily due to a decrease in market interest rates over the past year interest and dividend income was favorably impacted by loan fees earned on forgiven paycheck protection program ppp loans during the first and second quarters of 2021 we originated 746 ppp loans totaling 136 7 million in 2020 and as of june 30 2021 11 6 million on 35 ppp loans originated during the first round of the ppp loan program remained outstanding during the first and second quarters of 2021 we originated 62 3 million or 574 loans under the second round of the ppp loan program of which 58 6 million or 483 loans remain outstanding as of june 30 2021 net loan interest and fee income recorded in 2021 year to date on all ppp loans totaled 1 6 million and approximately 2 3 million of net ppp loan fees remain unearned as of june 30 2021 interest expense for the second quarter of 2021 totaled 2 2 million compared to 1 8 million for the first quarter of 2021 and 3 0 million for the second quarter of 2020 the 393 000 increase in interest expense in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the first quarter of 2021 was primarily due to the april 6 2021 issuance of 60 0 million of 3 50 fixed to floating rate subordinated notes due april 15 2031 which bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 3 50 until april 14 2026 the reduction in interest expense in the year over year period was due to a decrease in market interest rates which impacted all interest bearing deposit categories we recorded a 3 5 million release of provision expense in the second quarter of 2021 compared to a 3 0 million release of provision expense in the first quarter of 2021 and a 2 1 million provision for credit losses in the second quarter of 2020 as the projected impact of the covid 19 pandemic on future credit losses is currently anticipated to be less than prior projections our allowance for credit losses acl on loans in the second quarter of 2021 consisted of a release of the acl on loans of 2 3 million as well as 65 000 of net charge offs recorded during the quarter in addition the acl for unfunded commitments decreased by 1 2 million in the second quarter of 2021 due to an updated forecast of credit line utilization rates noninterest income was 7 9 million for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 3 4 million or 29 9 compared to 11 3 million for the first quarter of 2021 and a decrease of 2 8 million or 26 0 compared to 10 7 million for the second quarter of 2020 the decrease from the linked quarter was primarily driven by a 4 1 million decline in residential mortgage banking revenue attributable to a 2 1 million decrease in the mark to market adjustment on msrs and a 1 8 million decrease in net gain on the sales of mortgage loans in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the prior quarter these decreases to noninterest income were partially offset by a 238 000 increase in wealth management income and a 218 000 increase in card related income in the current quarter compared to the linked quarter the decrease in noninterest income in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 was primarily due to a 3 5 million decline in residential mortgage banking revenue attributable to a 588 000 increase in mark to market loss on msrs and a 2 7 million decrease in net gain on sales of mortgage loans in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 noninterest expense was 21 4 million for the second quarter of 2021 a decrease of 337 000 or 1 6 compared to 21 7 million for the first quarter of 2021 and an increase of 2 5 million or 13 3 from 18 9 million for the second quarter of 2020 the decrease from the linked quarter was primarily attributable to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits expense stemming from additional officer incentive compensation expenses paid out in early 2021 and the related increase in payroll taxes and 401k company match expense in addition a decrease in occupancy furniture and equipment costs was related to snow removal costs and building maintenance due to weather conditions in february 2021 the increase in noninterest expense in the year over year period was primarily due to salaries and employee benefits expense occupancy furniture and equipment expenses card related expense and other expense the provision for income taxes expense was 3 2 million for the second quarter of 2021 compared to 4 2 million for the first quarter of 2021 and 3 1 million for the second quarter of 2020 the decrease in tax expense for the linked quarter was due to lower pre tax income in the second quarter of 2021 and the increase in tax expense for the year over year period was primarily due to a decrease in tax deductible expenses in the second quarter of 2021 compared to the second quarter of 2020 during the second quarter of 2021 we repurchased 310 900 shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of 13 55 per share pursuant to our stock repurchase program on july 20 2021 our board of directors declared a cash dividend of 0 05 per share payable on august 9 2021 to stockholders of record as of july 30 2021 president and chief executive officer jim eccher said an improving economy and conservative positioning resulted in solid bottom line earnings and a continued return of excess capital to our stockholders through the recent increase in the common dividend and continued share repurchases while challenges remain our credit quality metrics and expectations have continued to improve as the chicago area moves towards a more normalized environment loan demand continued to remain soft in the second quarter with utilization rates remaining low and customers using excess liquidity to pay down existing debt the end result was a somewhat disappointing 21 9 million linked quarter decline in loans and leases held for investment exclusive of ppp loan activity deposit inflows remain robust and resulted in a further increase in excess liquidity as evidenced by a 140 0 million increase in average cash on the balance sheet during the quarter we continue to deploy a portion of the excess liquidity on our balance sheet in short duration securities with yields far below the aggregate portfolio yield the combination of these factors largely resulted in a 39 basis point sequential quarter decline in our net interest margin but a far more modest sequential decline in net interest income looking forward i am more optimistic on loan growth for the remainder of the year and believe reported margin trends are more symptomatic of the profound increase in liquidity on our balance sheet rather than any fundamental change in our business i believe old second remains conservatively positioned to meet these challenges as our expenses remain well controlled our business is well diversified customer activity is increasing and our underwriting has remained disciplined and consistent i would like to thank our employees for their continued hard work in delivering a solid quarter while delivering exceptional customer service as we move towards a more normal routine covid 19 update late in the first quarter of 2020 we began granting loan payment deferrals to certain borrowers affected by the pandemic for the period april 1 2020 through june 30 2021 our clients had requested loan payment deferrals on 506 loans totaling 237 8 million as of june 30 2021 488 loans representing 228 7 million outstanding or 96 2 of the original loan balances deferred have resumed payments or paid off active payment deferrals remain on 18 loans with 9 1 million of balances outstanding we are participating in the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act during 2021 we processed 574 loan applications for ppp loans representing a total of 62 3 million as of june 30 2021 we had 11 6 million of ppp loans outstanding that were originated under the first round of the ppp loan program and 58 6 million of ppp loans outstanding that were originated under the second round of the ppp loan program early in the fourth quarter of 2020 we started to submit applications for ppp loan forgiveness to the sba and as of june 30 2021 128 8 million on 802 loans have been forgiven we anticipate receiving the remaining funds for our first round of ppp loan forgiveness from the sba through the third quarter of 2021

skip to comments posted on by seekandfind under the biden administration the us continued escalating the economic and geopolitical frictions with china at the recent g7 summit in carbis bay president biden sought to rally a united front against china with traditional g7 allies and new ones such as australia india south korea and south africa and rebuked china on economic policies human rights and tensions in the east and south china seas the us also persuaded its g7 allies to back a massive infrastructure support package for developing countries the so called build back better world partnership b3w is a de facto rival to china s belt and road initiative bri but it is far from obvious what the west stands to gain by emulating china s exorbitant and highly controversial modern silk road venture the us s ambitious global infrastructure plan the b3w wants to mobilize hundreds of billions of dollars of infrastructure investment in order to narrow an estimated infrastructure need of 40 trillion plus in the developing world the b3w financing is expected to come from us budgetary instruments such as the development finance corporation and the united states agency for international development usaid from multilateral development banks mdbs such as the world bank and from the private sector and g7 partners as the b3w is meant to challenge china s project we expect it to at least match the chinese financial envelope most commonly estimated at more than 1 trillion in investment and lending commitments so far this is more than eight times higher than the nearly 113 billion in official development assistance and 22 billion in private sector investment provided by g7 countries for foreign infrastructure projects during 2015 19 graph 1 graph 1 g7 infrastructure development assistance source center for strategic and international studies csis in order to surpass china the b3w aims at having a broader geographical coverage a wider focus and better project governance and standards the bri comprises a silk road economic belt trying to link china with asia russia and europe by land and a maritime silk road connecting china s coastal regions with asia the south pacific africa and europe but its western challenger aims at being global in scope while the chinese initiative is focused on traditional infrastructure projects highways railroads ports and power plants the b3w wants to invest also in climate health and digital technology and because chinese projects have been heavily criticized for lack of transparency corruption unsustainable debt and adverse environmental and social impacts the b3w advertises itself as a values driven high standard and transparent infrastructure partnership led by major democracies holes in china s silk road from its announcement in 2013 china s megainfrastructure project has been met with suspicion in the west most important it was feared that china had geostrategic ambitions to bring smaller bri partners under its sphere of influence it was also claimed that china was pursuing a debt trap diplomacy in order to take over key strategic assets such as electric grids and ports while the latter could be also used for military purposes with time many analysts realized that much of this criticism was exaggerated first almost 140 countries have signed on to the bri as of this writing of which eighteen are from the eu showing that many governments find the chinese deal beneficial and although china has not financed in full the promised 1 trillion in projects so far it did make 190 billion worth of investments and 390 billion in construction work financed by chinese loans in general during 2014 18 this is more than the 467 billion of development loans provided by the world bank during 2008 19 second while the number of requests for debt renegotiation and relief has increased overseas asset seizures have rarely occurred third many pundits concur that the bri ports are commercially designed and almost impossible to employ militarily undeniably china has been trying to enhance its political influence through the bri and is now perceived as the most influential economic actor in southeast asia and africa but resentments over some onerous projects corruption scandals and increasing debt burdens mean that such gains could be easily reversed and china has started to improve its lending and investment standards the bri focus has been widened from traditional infrastructure to telecommunications digital technology and fintech and china also expanded the bri s overarching goal to helping build a free trade and investment area which would accelerate economic growth for all partner countries but bri s economic benefits are skewed in favor of chinese construction companies at the expense of taxpayers the bri provided much business for china s overstretched construction sector after the end of the domestic stimulus binge following the great recession almost 90 percent of the construction works funded under the bri went to chinese contractors fueling criticism that the bri creates unfair advantages for chinese companies which have become global leaders seven of the ten largest construction companies in the world by revenue were chinese in 2017 at the same time if china wanted to set a debt trap with the bri it seems that it is the country which has fallen into it the pandemic has accelerated the already growing debt defaults and renegotiations and an estimated 94 billion or a quarter of china s overseas lending has come under renegotiation so far graph 2 it shows that the bri s most important lenders i e china s two main policy banks the china development bank and the export import bank of china have done a poor job of financing viable projects for which the chinese taxpayer is likely to foot the bill eventually and given the sizeable amount of investments put on hold scaled back or cancelled and the very low participation of private lenders it is obvious that the bri participating governments have made several bad investment decisions too graph 2 china s debt renegotiation cases source rhodium group research over 2013 17 the bri looked pretty successful and was growing fast in terms of contracts signed and loans after high profile contracts were cancelled and debt renegotiations surged the project ran out of steam china s big banks started rethinking and reducing their overseas lending and the number of construction contracts went down too graph 3 this was also driven by the deleveraging of chinese banks after the large credit expansion following the global financial crisis china s large domestic growth stimuli weakened its external competitiveness and reduced current account surpluses and outward fdi foreign direct investment the balance of payments crisis of 2015 16 which was accompanied by a drop in international reserves of more than 1 trillion and imposition of capital controls reduced china s ability to fund the massive overseas demand for infrastructure projects and investment in addition domestic voices started to question why chinese people also relatively poor should subsidize unprofitable capital investment overseas graph 3 china s overseas construction contracts source rhodium group should the west go down china s road before pouring money into b3w the us should heed important lessons from china s bri venture and its own past first trying to fill in the 40 trillion plus infrastructure gap in the developing world requires a massive amount of resources just printing trillions of us dollars will not be enough because real savings i e goods and services will need to be transferred abroad as current account surpluses in order to carry out mammoth bri projects china recorded large current account surpluses and drew on its huge international reserves japanese companies also have a long history of building infrastructure across southeast asia which was also backed by substantial current account surpluses for several decades on the other hand both the us and the uk have been running chronic current account deficits while the euro area started to register small surpluses only a few years ago graph 4 graph 4 current account balances source oecd statistics in addition both the us and the eu are about to launch large domestic growth stimuli including substantial green and digital investments which are likely to strain further their feeble domestic real savings moreover president biden s economic agenda includes important measures such as tax and minimum wage hikes and higher social spending that are likely to increase consumption while depressing economic activity and savings lastly investment as a share of gdp is already relatively low in both the us and eu calling into question the economic rationale for a government led transfer of capital overseas graph 5 graph 5 domestic investment ratios source world bank data the second lesson is that bri slowed down not only when domestic resources dwindled but also when the wasteful projects and bad debts became visible the us and its allies seem convinced that unlike the bri their projects will be profitable and transparent but this is not what history tells us jeffrey tucker shows that the true intent of the much hailed marshall plan was not to help foreign countries but to internationalize the new deal and for the american taxpayer to subsidize us corporates the plan drained private capital out of the us economy and the country fell into recession shortly thereafter it also helped entrench unionism welfare states and heavy regulations in europe according to ryan mcmaken the history of building transcontinental railroads in the us is also rife with crony capitalism and corruption the track record of conditional development lending from the international monetary fund the world bank and other institutions that are supposed to back the b3w is not spotless either these institutions are rarely able to support viable projects and economic liberalization given their role as global lenders of last resort they must prop up foreign governments that are usually overbureaucratic and corrupt in conclusion if the us wants to strengthen its economic and geostrategic position versus china it needs to apply the same free market principles that made it prosperous and powerful in the first place launching a second marshall plan which mirrors china s wasteful bri will only consolidate big government crony capitalism and corruption eroding the us economy s capital stock and competitiveness
on july 21st 1987 guns n roses released their debut album appetite for destruction to mark the iconic record s 34th anniversary here are 30 things you might not know about it 1 most of the songs from the record were written during a time that the group was performing on the la club circuit some tracks however were begun or written by the band members before gn r existed duff mckagan penned it s so easy izzy stradlin did think about you slash duff and steven adler wrote rocket queen for their earlier band road crew and axl rose did anything goes for his pre gn r group hollywood rose 2 later gn r songs like november rain don t cry you could be mine and back off bitch were considered for appetite but shelved for various reasons in the case of november rain it wasn t included because appetite already had a ballad with sweet child o mine 3 when choosing a producer the band considered kiss singer paul stanley but opted against it after he considered changing some of the songs as well as steven adler s drum set up 4 the band selected mike clink as their producer he previously was at the helm for some triumph albums and recorded the gn r how they wanted to be recorded 5 after basic tracks were laid in a two week period mike worked 18 hour days splicing together the best takes using a razor blade 6 the total budget for the album was 370 000 7 while the percussion was completed in just six days vocals took a lot longer with axl a perfectionist doing them one line at a time 8 the original cover for the album was based on artist robert williams painting appetite for destruction and featured a monster about to attack a robotic rapist but music retailers said they d refused to stock the album with it the artwork was a statement with the robot representing the industrial system that is polluting our environment 9 the actual cover wound up being an image of a cross with skulls of the five band members it was originally designed as a tattoo and the knot work in the cross is a reference to one of axl s favorite bands thin lizzy 10 in 2011 axl revealed his original idea for the cover art was a photo of the space shuttle challenger exploding but the band s label said no because it was in bad taste 11 vinyl and cassette versions of the albums didn t have sides a and b rather they had sides g and r the g or guns side was the first six tracks which all dealt with drugs and hard city life while the r or roses side were the remaining songs which were about love sex and relationships 12 axl wrote the lyrics to welcome to the jungle while in seattle visiting a friend he also said he was inspired by a homeless man he encountered as a runaway while coming out of a bus into new york the man shouted at axl and his friend you know where you are you re in the jungle baby you re gonna die 13 slash said that welcome to the jungle took about three hours for the band to write 14 it s so easy is about a time when duff and gnr songwriting collaborator west arkeen didn t have any money but had a lot of groupies and girls they could live off of so things were easy 15 it s so easy was originally a light acoustic song but slash turned it into a rocker 16 nightrain is a tribute to the cheap california wine night train express which the band drank in their early days because it was inexpensive and had high alcohol content 17 mr brownstone is about the band s problems with heroin 18 mr brownstone was the band s first single released outside of america 19 out ta get me tells of axl s trouble with the law growing up in indiana 20 slash said that paradise city was written in the back of a rental van on their way back from a gig in san francisco the band was drinking and playing acoustic guitars when the song started to come together slash thought the lyrics should be take me down to the paradise city where the girls are fat and they ve got big t ies but the band went with axl s line of where the grass is green and the girls are pretty 21 the song my michelle is about a friend of the band named michelle young who is thanked on the cover sleeve axl was in a car with her when elton john s your song came on the radio and michelle mentioned she always wanted someone to write a song about her so he did he first wrote a track that had nothing to do with her but at the suggestion of the band he changed the lyrics so they told her life story 22 sweet child o mine started during a jam session after slash jokingly played a circus melody and made faces at steven adler izzy had him play it again and added some chords while duff made a bass line and steven put a beat to it meanwhile upstairs axl listened and wrote lyrics 23 unsure of what to do at one point towards the end of sweet child o mine axl wondered aloud where do we go where do we go now and they decided to have him sing that 24 axl wanted pornographic sounds in the song rocket queen so he propositioned a female friend of the band to have sex with him in the vocal booth at the new york studio where they were mixing the record she agreed allegedly saying she would do it for the band and a bottle of jack daniels 25 rose said that he wrote the song rocket queen for a girl who was going to have a band and call it rocket queen he once stated of that girl she kinda kept me alive for a while 26 the rocket queen is likely barbi von greif who is credited in the notes for appetite as barbi rocket queen von greif slash once said of her that even though she was just 18 at the time she was a queen of the underground rock scene she eventually became a madam 27 appetite for destruction debuted at number 182 on the billboard 200 but as the band toured and released singles the record worked its way up the chart topping it on august 6 1988 for four non consecutive weeks 28 the record spent 147 weeks on the billboard 200 29 appetite has been certified 18 times platinum for sales over 18 million copies in america 30 approximately 30 million copies of the album have sold worldwide
