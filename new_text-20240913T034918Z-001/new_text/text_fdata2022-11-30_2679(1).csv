autodesk s management just issued a 5 billion share repurchase program some software products are critical in the daily jobs of many workers take autodesk adsk 0 60 for example architects and engineers utilize its software daily to create drawings and design products without it they couldn t do their jobs effectively i like to invest in these types of companies as users cannot afford to cut their subscriptions just because times are tough as another boost for autodesk its stock is undervalued in my opinion and management s latest action affirms this assessment an aggressive buyback plan autodesk recently reported results for the third quarter of its fiscal 2023 ended oct 31 and with it came a huge announcement the board of directors approved a 5 billion share repurchase plan for context autodesk s current market capitalization is 42 6 billion so this would reduce the outstanding shares by around 12 at today s price but that s not the complete picture stock based compensation adds to the share count quarterly so it must be considered in the first nine months of its current fiscal year autodesk paid 493 million in stock based compensation extrapolating from last year it looks like this fiscal year s total stock based compensation will be about 657 million with the company on pace to buy back around 1 2 billion in stock this year that means about half of autodesk s repurchases will go to retiring shares instead of offsetting compensation indicating a reduction in shares outstanding of about 6 still a respectable level management is also talking about accelerating repurchases opportunistically this all leads me to think the stock is undervalued but is it autodesk s valuation is reasonable in q3 autodesk s revenue rose 14 to 1 28 billion and it converted 36 of revenue into free cash flow unlike many companies autodesk s operating margin rose in the quarter showing it knows how to control its expenses in its q3 earnings release autodesk gave full year guidance of 1 94 billion in free cash flow pricing autodesk shares at 22 times free cash flow taking the inverse of this metric is the free cash flow yield which is often compared to the rate of a 10 year treasury note with that investment yielding 3 83 currently versus autodesk s 4 6 autodesk is a reasonably valued stock revenue guidance for q4 was a bit conservative with only 8 growth expected however management stated its long term goal is still double digit revenue and free cash flow growth annually autodesk also has significant global exposure region revenue makeup yoy growth americas 42 3 17 europe middle east and africa 37 2 10 asia pacific 20 5 14 this can cut both ways as autodesk is seeing strong new business growth in north america but weakness in russia and china global diversification can help stabilize the company if the u s heads into a recession next year overall autodesk is a very balanced company with a strong global presence autodesk s products are both useful and required for many businesses without them buildings couldn t be designed and parts couldn t be made couple this necessity with a reasonably valued stock price and i think autodesk is primed to outperform the markets in 2023 and beyond autodesk is an outstanding stock to balance out high fliers in your portfolio and investors should take advantage of its low stock price today

superior area of the market to invest in highlighting the sector s reasonable valuation and long term growth trajectory at an event wednesday in new york city while the chief investment officer of u s fundamental equities also sees opportunities in utilities and staples he views healthcare earnings as slightly more reasonable trading at a roughly 10 discount to the market you get better long term growth better recession resiliency and you got a better valuation despirito said noting the sector is a large overweight in a slew of blackrock s funds the sector should also benefit from the aging population given that individuals consume more healthcare as they age he said that should also strengthen the demand outlook despite the tough macro climate despirito said investors should stay invested in the market with this year s multiple contraction putting equities at a discount versus the start of 2022 i think we should stay invested because equity is on sale but we should do so in a resilient way because of the earnings risks that are out there he said samantha subin nasdaq briefly flashes red the tech heavy nasdaq composite briefly turned negative for the day bringing at one

takeaways from powell speech federal reserve chairman jerome powell in a speech later wednesday likely will confirm expectations of smaller rate increases ahead while also signaling that he s still worried about inflation according to goldman sachs in a client note wednesday morning the wall street firm s economists outlined a few primary expectations when the central bank leader speaks at the brookings institution powell is likely to hint that the will slow the pace of rate hikes at the december meeting but push back against the recent easing in financial conditions with two hawkish counterpoints goldman economist ronnie walker wrote first powell is likely to suggest that the fomc will need to raise the funds rate to a higher peak than it projected at the september meeting echoing his remarks at the november press conference and following similar comments from several other fomc members over the last few weeks walker added second he is likely to emphasize that inflation remains too high and the labor market remains extremely tight goldman expects the fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by 0 5 percentage point in december followed by three successive hikes of 0 25 percentage point before pausing the powell speech is due at 1 30 p m et a question and answer session will follow jeff cox new addams family show wednesday could help boost netflix according to keybanc the new addams family show wednesday is now netflix s most watched series in a week with viewers logging 341 million hours in the first week of its release keybanc says netflix s successful launch of wednesday screens as an incremental positive against rather underwhelming viewership for the crown consistent w w declines and perceived viewership competition from world cup keybanc capital markets analyst justin patterson said many investors have pointed to the declining viewership of the crown as an incremental risk factor to netflix s paid net additions particularly amid concern about world cup competition and a lighter content slate he wrote in a note tuesday we believe wednesday s strong start changes the conversation patterson said as such we believe wednesday s performance over the next few weeks will be highly tracked both at the aggregate viewership level and country level whether the performance becomes a more meaningful drive of gross additions remains to be seen at a minimum the success of wednesday and less viewership competition are positives for retention he added michelle fox third quarter gdp gets revised higher the u s economy grew at a slightly faster pace

a key part of the yield curve closely watched by wall street investors and analysts alike inverted further on tuesday potentially signaling a recession ahead the yield on the 10 year u s treasury ticked up about 4 basis points to trade at 3 752 on tuesday at the same time the two year yield rose slightly to 4 481 yields move inverse to price and a basis point is equal to 0 01 the difference between yields called the yield curve is a recession signal when investors are getting better payback for snapping up shorter term bonds than longer term ones currently the spread between the 10 year and 2 year treasury bonds is more than 73 basis points the widest in decades what this inversion signals is that the fed may have tamed inflation enough to cool down the economy and may be able to

oman s significance in the middle east and therefore the world is much greater than its 5 4 billion barrels of estimated proved oil reserves the 22nd largest in the world implies its true importance to both the u s and china is its critical geographical position which makes it perhaps the most important oil and gas hub in the world specifically the sultanate has long coastlines along the gulf of oman and the arabian sea offering unfettered access to the markets of the east and the west equally as such oman and its key ports and storage facilities offer the only true alternative in the middle east to the strait of hormuz controlled by iran through which passes at least one third of the world s crude oil supplies therefore any major developments in oman are minutely scrutinised by washington and beijing alike and much has been happening recently in the sultanate of interest to both sides the key to all these developments is that the western alliance finally appears to have noticed that it was losing out in oman to china as has been happening in so many other countries in the middle east in recent years particularly after the unilateral withdrawal from the joint comprehensive plan of action nuclear deal with iran in may 2018 as highlighted repeatedly by oilprice com over this period china has used its standard chequebook diplomacy to expand its presence in oman already accounting for around 90 percent of oman s oil exports and most of its petrochemicals exports china was quick to pledge a further us 10 billion immediately for investment into oman s flagship duqm refinery project although further investment from china was notionally geared towards completing the duqm refinery chinese money was also funnelled towards the construction and building out of an 11 72 square kilometre industrial park in duqm in three areas heavy industrial light industrial and mixed use this has enabled china to plant a flag in deeply strategic areas of land in the sultanate related u s drivers could get under 3 gasoline for christmas what china really seems to want from oman is to control all the major crude oil shipping route chokepoints from the middle east into europe and the west that avoid the more expensive and more nautically challenging cape of good hope route around south africa and the more politically sensitive strait of hormuz route this is entirely aligned with beijing s broad strategic goal encapsulated in the one belt one road multi generational power grab project china already has effective control over the strait of hormuz by dint of its all encompassing 25 year deal with iran in a worldwide exclusive by me published on 3 september 2019 the same deal also gives china a hold over the bab al mandab strait through which crude oil is shipped upwards through the red sea towards the suez canal before moving into the mediterranean and then westwards this has been achieved as it lies between yemen which is being disrupted by iran backed houthis just as china wants and djibouti over which china has established a stranglehold as highlighted by oilprice com given the money that china had already spent in the sultanate beijing was ready to move into the next phase of its standard colonialisation plan as seen recently across the middle east and elsewhere but most notably perhaps in iran iraq sri lanka and djibouti which is to switch oman into longer term hotel california deals you can check out any time you like but you can never leave the phase after that involves beijing just waiting for the time at which the host country can no longer afford the dramatically rising principal and interest payments at the back end of the contract period whereupon china rolls out its standard loan shark style debt recovery methods and seizes the strategic lands that had been pledged by the host country as collateral for the deals cue the west which may seem to china to be a collection of soft skinned accountancy types but it didn t get to build the two greatest empires since that of rome great britain s and the u s s without knowing a thing or two worth knowing a key development in this context was the signing of an exploration and production sharing agreement epsa deal between oman s ministry of energy and minerals and shell integrated gas oman bv a subsidiary of britain s shell along with its partners oman s oq and france s totalenergies to explore appraise and develop natural gas resources and condensate in block 11 the key geopolitical positive about these types of deals in particular is that they require a significant on the ground presence of foreign nationals including security personnel and other support staff as part of the deal this deal is no different establishing shell as the operator of block 11 holding a 67 5 percent working interest with oq and totalenergies holding 10 percent and 22 5 percent respectively according to information released by the companies the epsa exploration activities will see seismic acquisition of 1 400 square kilometres in late 2022 with several planned exploration wells to follow as highlighted by oman s minister of energy and minerals eng salim bin nasser al aufi this agreement strengthens the strategic relations with partners in the sector such as shell totalenergies oq and others to ensure oman s energy security and attract more foreign investment adding the highest value to the local supply chain following this according to legal sources exclusively spoken to in oman by oilprice com last week further investments may be forthcoming from western companies even in the matter of duqm and through work undertaken with the oman investment authority oia duqm to begin with is the landmark petrochemicals centred project for oman that has been delayed in completion for several years as the sultanate struggled with budgetary constraints due to low oil prices as highlighted in several pieces in oilprice com over the years the now us 8 billion duqm refinery project occupies 900 hectares of the special economic zone of duqm and is a 50 50 joint venture between oq group and kuwait petroleum international kpi in addition to the main site of the duqm refinery the refinery project also includes the build out of storage and export facilities for liquid and bulk petroleum products at duqm port crude oil storage facilities at ras markaz and an 80 kilometre crude oil pipeline line from ras markaz to the refinery when operational the duqm refinery is expected to refine 230 000 barrels per day of crude oil products according to a very recent comment from shafi al ajmi the chief executive officer of kpi duqm will start its commercial operation in 2023 the oia in the meantime is looking for would be international investors is a series of planned stock flotations of several of oman s key assets founded in 2020 following the merger of oman s state general reserve fund and oman investment fund the oia is seen as the key to the oman 2040 development plan that aims to reduce hydrocarbons contribution to gdp to less than 10 percent by that year the oia controls assets in its national development portfolio and futures generations fund with the former vehicle holding stakes in around 160 national assets and companies while the latter holds mainly foreign assets and includes public and private market investments among the many high value state assets under the oia s control are state oil and gas producer oq the muscat stock exchange and oman lng oq itself comprises the previously separate assets of the oman oil company oman oil refineries petroleum industries company and the oman gas company in 2019 oman sold 49 percent of its electricity holding co to the state grid corporation of china for around us 1 billion however given the renewed awareness in the west of oman s crucial strategic importance to the middle east s oil and gas flows it would appear unlikely that it will allow china free reign to

the european electric vehicle ev market has recorded significant growth in recent years powered by sustained demand and support from regulators however the market is battling an economic slowdown alongside a subsequent decrease in consumer spending presumably leading to a lacklustre electric vehicle space but that appears not to be the case in particular data acquired and calculated by finbold

represents a quarterly increase of about 1 98 from q2 s value of 560 266 during the first three months of the year the region recorded registration of 562 276 units a breakdown of the car types indicates that bevs stood at 355 336 in q3 slightly increasing from q2 s figure of 322 144 elsewhere during the third quarter of 2022 the total registered phevs was 216 041 a drop from q2 s 238 122

electric vehicle space hard interestingly some manufacturers like tesla nasdaq tsla delivered a record number of vehicles in q3 despite the prevailing conditions key drivers of european ev market growth in general the european ev market s previous growth has been attributed to factors like increased income levels within a climate conscious population robust government support for the ev industry and an extensive public private partnership for ev charging infrastructure at the same time due to the lucrative european market manufacturers especially from the united states and china are increasingly targeting consumers in the region indeed chinese carmakers are building a foothold on the market especially for bevs european carmakers will likely attempt to wane off the competition from foreign entities by increasing their ev production potentially new ev manufacturers interested in establishing a foothold in the industry will likely locate their operations in europe for instance rivian nasdaq rivn which is anticipated to increase production in 2023 to meet the growing demand is one example the firm will likely begin sales in europe at some point in the not too distant future for the time being however the company is concentrating primarily on the north american market in an effort to challenge tesla s position as the industry leader furthermore the sales data is a welcomed development for regional regulators as the european commission seeks to achieve a climate neutral economy by 2050 in this case regulators have put restrictions on automotive emissions with most governments expressing commitment toward climate friendly mobility initiatives consequently several countries are driving ev adoptions by establishing friendly incentives targeting consumers and manufacturers additionally consumers are increasingly getting a wide range of options especially with traditional manufacturers including bmw audi and volvo venturing into the electric vehicle industry with an array of options manufacturers have been focusing on improving some of the concerns among concerns for instance driving range has been a significant consideration among consumers with automakers aiming for longer ranges to boost sales especially for bevs in this case manufacturers focused more on increasing driving range through adjustments like larger batteries furthermore the availability of charging stations around the driving range appears to have been taken care of the future of the european ev market however despite the impressive ev sales for the third quarter it is worth noting that the sector is yet to become a phenomenon across europe amid several challenges for instance consumers still need to overcome the hurdle of high ev costs and a need for sufficient charging infrastructure over the years the affordability of electric vehicles has been a critical concern forcing budget conscious buyers to stay on the sidelines with premium pricing furthermore ev sales across europe will likely accelerate fueled by the possible extended energy crisis notably following russia s invasion of ukraine the region is grappling with high energy prices a factor acting as a catalyst to transitioning from reliance on fossil fuels overall how the sector will hold up against the extraordinary conditions remains to be seen
uk says will allow banks to take more risk to stay competitive britain will change its rulebook to allow banks to take more risks in order to keep the city of london a leading global financial centre a government minister said on tuesday the city was largely cut off from the european union by brexit and faces greater competition from centres like paris and frankfurt as well as longstanding rivals like new york and singapore next week the eu will set out a new law to force banks in the bloc to shift some of their euro derivatives clearing from london to frankfurt city minister andrew griffith said a new financial services bill now being approved in parliament will bring financial rule books up to date make regulators nimbler cut insurance capital buffers though maintain high standards the overall thrust of things is to allow more risk you get reward from taking risks you shouldn t be risk off we just need to manage that in an appropriate way griffith told a financial times event we can make the uk a better place to be a bank to release some of that trapped capital over time around the ring fence he added banks have lobbied to ease rules that force them to ring fence or insulate their retail arms with a bespoke cushion of capital a set of rules the bank of england has vigorously defended the finance ministry has promised a big bang 2 0 shake up of financial rules to boost the city s global competitiveness though griffith said he would be pragmatic and selective when it comes to scrapping any eu originated rules the focus will be on keeping britain an open financial market which allows skilled labour to move in and out reducing friction through proportionate rules and alignment with regulation elsewhere wherever possible griffith said uk discount britain s reputation as a stable location for financial services took a severe knock in september when a mini budget led to turmoil in bond markets forcing the bank of england to intervene charlie nunn chief executive of britain s biggest domestic bank lloyds lloy l told the event that while new prime minister rishi sunak had calmed markets the period of political chaos had had a lasting effect on investor appetite there is nervousness about the uk overall nunn said referring to the period of political instability and concern over the nation s finances the uk still has that discount nunn said he welcomed increased emphasis on the city s competitiveness adding that it had not been a focus over the last decade nunn said that in response to britain s growing cost of living crisis the lender had begun offering struggling mortgage borrowers interest only or lower cost products to help them cope starting three to four months ago alison harding jones head of emea m a at us bank citi told the event that britain remained a strong place and open for business i hope what we ve seen over the course of the past few months is a wobble that doesn t make a difference in the strength of the uk but we will have to see she said source reuters reporting by huw jones and iain withers editing by ed osmond

franklin in accesswire november 29 2022 ibc advanced alloys corp ibc or the company tsxv ib otcqb iaalf announces its financial results for the quarter ended september 30 2022 consolidated sales declined 16 4 over the prior year period driven largely by lower demand for the engineered materials division s beryllium aluminum beal products used to manufacture semiconductor chips as compared to the prior year period where demand was at a historic high copper alloys division improved by 25 1 in the quarter and rose sequentially by 21 6 gross profit and gross margins in the quarter improved in the copper alloys division to 432 000 and 9 8 respectively as compared to the prior year periods but declined in the engineered materials division due to lower sales to commercial markets and by lower yields consolidated adjusted ebitda for quarter was 936 000 which compared to adjusted ebitda1 of 209 000 in the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2022 the company reported a loss for the quarter of 2 million 0 02 per share as compared to a loss of 581 000 0 01 in the quarter ended september 30 2021 it was a challenging quarter for our engineered materials division but the copper alloys division continued on its growth trajectory since completing our consolidation and modernization of our indiana foundry facility with the copper alloys team booking their fourth consecutive quarter of higher sales said ibc ceo and chairman mark a smith in fact copper alloys sales gains in the quarter were primarily due to the demand and availability of internally produced alloys from our vertically integrated indiana foundry the engineered material division s lower sales are largely due to lower demand for beryllium aluminum products used to manufacture semiconductor chips as compared to the prior year period where demand was at a historic high mr smith said profitability in the engineered materials division was also impacted by a decline in yield but it appears that the team has largely addressed this issue as yields are showing considerable improvement so far in the current quarter we continue to pursue many exciting new sales opportunities for beryllium aluminum products in the defense sector and i and the board look forward to seeing more of those efforts begin to reach fruition in 2023 mr smith added full results can be seen in the company s financial statements and

u s senators from both parties expressed skepticism tuesday that a proposed merger between grocery giants kroger and albertsons would result in lower prices for consumers fewer local options mean less competition to keep prices low said sen alex padilla a california democrat in a hearing before the antitrust subcommittee of the senate judiciary committee padilla said kroger and albertsons compete in many california cities but the ceos of kroger and albertsons insisted there will still be competition and said a merger will help them counter growing rivals like walmart costco and amazon kroger ceo rodney mcmullen said the days of shoppers buying all their groceries at one store once a week are gone shoppers often get their groceries at five or six different locations he said i just don t see less competition going forward mcmullen said it s easy for customers to take a left turn or a right turn kroger announced its plan to acquire albertsons for 20 billion in mid october together the companies would control about 13 of the u s grocery market if it s approved by u s antitrust regulators the deal is expected to close in early 2024 sen mike lee a utah republican noted the subcommittee would have little say in whether the merger will go through that will be a decision for the federal trade commission and the justice department but he said the hearing was an important opportunity for the public to understand a merger that could impact their lives lee needled kroger for approving a 1 billion stock buyback last year even as food prices were jumping for consumers lee said u s households paid an average of 110 more for food in october than they did a year ago if kroger wasn t passing on savings to consumers when it was competing with albertsons then why would we think it would pass on savings after it eliminates competition he said but mcmullen said kroger has lowered prices after other mergers like its 2013 acquisition of harris teeter from a business standpoint that is our commitment he said mcmullen reiterated kroger s plan to spend 500 million reducing prices 1 3 billion updating albertsons stores and 1 billion on higher employee wages and improved benefits if the merger goes through sen amy klobuchar a minnesota democrat asked about the timeframe for that spending and wondered who would make sure the company met its commitments mcmullen said those investments would be spread over four years others peppered the companies with questions about potential store closures or employee layoffs kroger and albertsons have said they will sell or spin off up to 375 albertsons stores in markets where they currently compete the intent is not to close stores the intent is to divest stores albertsons president and ceo vivek sankaran said but that didn t ease lawmakers concerns several noted that when albertsons acquired safeway in 2015 for 9 2 billion the ftc required it to divest 168 stores the largest buyer of those stores filed for bankruptcy protection nine months later and albertsons wound up buying back some of the locations when divested assets head into bankruptcy in less than a year that remedy is an embarrassing failure lee said sankaran said the ftc approved the buyer in that merger this time he said albertsons __ pending the ftc s approval __ may spin off stores into a separate company that would be led by experienced leaders kroger based in cincinnati ohio operates 2 800 stores in 35 states including brands like ralphs smith s and harris teeter alberstons based in boise idaho operates 2 273 stores in 34 states including brands like safeway jewel osco and shaw s together the companies employ around 710 000 people federal lawmakers aren t the only ones scrutinizing the merger plan earlier this month a bipartisan group of state attorneys general sued to block albertsons from paying a 4 billion dividend to its shareholders until they have reviewed the merger that payout is temporarily on hold after a state judge in washington said he needed more time to consider the matter copyright the associated press all rights reserved this material may not be published broadcast rewritten or redistributed

any other rate non gaap financial measures in evaluating our business we consider and use certain non gaap measures including primarily adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss adjusted gross profit loss adjusted operating income loss adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u s gaap we define adjusted gross profit loss from continuing operations as gross profit loss from continuing operations excluding amortization of intangible assets we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss excluding interest income expense net income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization share based compensation expense impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on property and equipment and income loss from discontinued operations net of tax we define adjusted net income loss as net income loss excluding share based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets tax effect of amortization of intangible assets impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on property and equipment and income loss from discontinued operations net of tax we define adjusted operating income loss from continuing operations as operating income loss from continuing operations excluding share based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill and impairment loss on property and equipment additionally we define adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted as adjusted net income loss attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders net income loss to ordinary shareholders ads holders excluding share based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets tax effect of amortization of intangible assets impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on property and equipment and income loss from discontinued operations net of tax divided by the weighted average number of basic and diluted ordinary shares or adss we incur amortization expense of intangible assets related to various acquisitions that have been made in recent years these intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition and are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition we believe that exclusion of these expenses allows greater comparability of operating results that are consistent over time for the company s newly acquired and long held business as the related intangibles do not have significant connection to the growth of the business therefore we provide exclusion of amortization of intangible assets to define adjusted gross profit from continuing operations adjusted operating income loss from continuing operations adjusted net income loss and adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted in addition due to the impact of the amended implementation regulations of the law on the promotion of private education of the people s republic of china the implementation rules the affected entities 7 deconsolidated is classified as discontinued operations which is a non recurring item the exclusion facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period to period basis therefore we provide exclusion of income loss from discontinued operations net of tax to define adjusted net income loss adjusted ebitda adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted we present the non gaap financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans such non gaap measures include adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss adjusted gross profit loss from continuing operations adjusted operating income loss from continuing operations adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted non gaap financial measures enable our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of non cash charges including depreciation and amortization and share based compensation expense and without considering the impact of non operating items such as interest income expense net income tax expense benefit share based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets tax effect of amortization of intangible assets and without considering the impact of non recurring item i e income loss from discontinued operations we also believe that the use of these non gaap measures facilitates investors assessment of our operating performance the non gaap financial measures are not defined under u s gaap and are not presented in accordance with u s gaap the non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools one of the key limitations of using these non gaap financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations interest income expense net income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization share based compensation expense tax effect of amortization of intangible assets and income loss from discontinued operations have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of these non gaap measures including adjusted ebitda or adjusted net income loss further these non gaap measures may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including peer companies and therefore their comparability may be limited 7 affected entities refers to private schools entities holding such private schools as well as other enterprises within china that are affected by the implementation rules

measures this press release includes certain non ifrs financial measures including on a forward looking basis and industry metrics such as ebitda ebitda margin adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin

provisions expenses related to our stock option plans and other expenses related to our expansion including our recently completed business combination and other acquisitions in addition other

metrics may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies additionally to the extent that forward looking non ifrs financial measures are provided they are presented on a non ifrs basis without reconciliations of such forward looking non ifrs measures due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations other business metrics proprietary saas and resale of third party software proprietary saas consists of semantix s data platform software while resale of third party software consists

topeka volatility in the stock market will push annual return on investment to the kansas public employees retirement system into negative territory at close of the year the pension system s executive director said tuesday the assumed investment return for kpers was adjusted downward in may from 7 75 to 7 to strengthen the bottom line the kansas legislature agreed to pump an extra 1 1 billion into the system the snapshot on investment return will be calculated based on financial position of the portfolio dec 31 said alan conroy executive director of kpers if you have the strength to watch the markets these days the volatility october was a great month but some of the months have not been so good conroy told house and senate members at the capitol we ll see where we end up at the end of december but i think where we stand right now the return will probably be negative for calendar year 2022 conroy didn t offer a projection as to how far under water the 24 8 billion portfolio would be at close of this year s business advocates of kpers 300 000 members with careers in schools the judiciary law enforcement firefighting and other government entities have pressured the legislature for years to approve a cost of living increase with many of those proposals ranging from 1 to 5 in kansas the last cost of living adjustment was issued in 1998 and the last one time cash bonus to retirees was made in 2008 the legislature authorized 16 cost of living adjustments from 1971 to 1997 sen rick billinger a goodland republican and chairman of the senate ways and means committee said he wasn t convinced the state should grant a cola because it would inflate the system s long term unfunded liability above the current 9 8 billion kpers is a prefunded system that invests employee and employer contributions to pay benefits years into the future a cola which can be viewed as an unfunded benefit change would exacerbate the unfunded liability the stock market is down today billinger told conroy during a meeting of an interim house senate committee and you re going to probably be negative or this year we re not going to short anybody what we have been paying them all along they re going to continue to get that check even though the market is down the senator said a cola would repeat mistakes of the past when the legislature made a series of insufficient contributions to kpers that s the problem with our whole system now billinger said we didn t make the required contributions when we were supposed to rep brandon woodard d lenexa said only 10 of current kpers retires were around in 1998 when the last cola was approved he said various legislative committees with ties to kpers ought to seriously consider making the first adjustment in a quarter century

melanie dool s gardening column in association with orchardstown garden centre we are all dependent on plants and for many it has become an addiction we humans are always searching for something else even though we might not know what that is but we can put it down to curiosity for now scented plants are something to be treasured nonsense all plants have an attractant in order to entice a living animal or insect to help in the pollination process we do not help by that method but are drawn to many plants by one of our senses including scents where we have a sniff in case there is a fragrance not to be missed roses are one of the plants that we expect to have a nice perfume and are disappointed when there is nothing there such as the shop bought florist roses scented plants are something to be treasured it might take time to acquire them but they are definitely a bonus from plants that are nonsense addiction if we move outside the simple sensory stimulants that we get from our ornamental plants and see what we consume in our daily lives very soon we will realise that there is a huge range of plants that we use every day and some we try to abstain from because we become or feel addicted to them such as our common beverage tea or coffee tea it is interesting that the name of the tea plant is camellia sinensis and a relation to one of our favourite garden shrubs it has been grown since 2737 bc when the emperor shen nung discovered a potion of dried green leaves in hot water made a satisfying beverage while it is considered a calming drink it certainly excited many people and nations to go to extreme lengths over the humble or not so humble tea such as the boston tea party and the opium wars coffee cafes originated as coffee houses to drink the caffeine flavoured drink from which we enjoyed the good feeling it produced also many soft drinks are caffeinated for the buzz and perhaps addiction caffeine was thought to have evolved in plants to repel destructive insects sending them mad and an easy prey to other predators and in reverse it attracts some pollinators i feel caffeine makes us think that we can do things faster but not more efficiently so i am not sure that is a good thing in the long term with an over dependency of our increasingly favourite drink leap of madness there are many plants that have been in use without ill effect for thousands of years by the native peoples until they were processed further into a form that has had a demonising effect in the world one is a derivative from cacti called mescaline and used as a pick me up by those overworked people in high intensity jobs such as operators of hedge funds in the stock exchange and currency speculators where the flood of data is slowed down to a gentle trickle and everything becomes incandescently wonderful but too bad for their clients the same applies to the coca leaves chewed by south americans which release dopamine producing a feeling of wellbeing energy pleasure and endurance including being much used by the miners in bolivia tip of the week we have not started feeding the birds as there is an abundance of food around and will only begin when the bad weather hits us for a long period and it is a saving as some seed is in short supply as it is grown in ukraine now that the leaves of many plants have dropped we are pruning any damaged or diseased shoots including moving down the height of the bush roses to around 60cm 2 for the winter so they will not blow around the same applies to other plants that have become overgrown if you have any queries or comments you are welcome to share them with me on 051 384273 or and if of general interest i will share them in a future article

including primarily adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss adjusted gross profit loss adjusted operating income loss adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u s gaap we define adjusted gross profit loss from continuing operations as gross profit loss from continuing operations excluding amortization of intangible assets we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss excluding interest income expense net income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization share based compensation expense impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on property and equipment and income loss from discontinued operations net of tax we define adjusted net income loss as net income loss excluding share based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets tax effect of amortization of intangible assets impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on property and equipment and income loss from discontinued operations net of tax we define adjusted operating income loss from continuing operations as operating income loss from continuing operations excluding share based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill and impairment loss on property and equipment additionally we define adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted as adjusted net income loss attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders net income loss to ordinary shareholders ads holders excluding share based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets tax effect of amortization of intangible assets impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on property and equipment and income loss from discontinued operations net of tax divided by the weighted average number of basic and diluted ordinary shares or adss we incur amortization expense of intangible assets related to various acquisitions that have been made in recent years these intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition and are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition we believe that exclusion of these expenses allows greater comparability of operating results that are consistent over time for the company s newly acquired and long held business as the related intangibles do not have significant connection to the growth of the business therefore we provide exclusion of amortization of intangible assets to define adjusted gross profit from continuing operations adjusted operating income loss from continuing operations adjusted net income loss and adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted in addition due to the impact of the amended implementation regulations of the law on the promotion of private education of the people s republic of china the implementation rules the affected entities 7 deconsolidated is classified as discontinued operations which is a non recurring item the exclusion facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period to period basis therefore we provide exclusion of income loss from discontinued operations net of tax to define adjusted net income loss adjusted ebitda adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted we present the non gaap financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans such non gaap measures include adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss adjusted gross profit loss from continuing operations adjusted operating income loss from continuing operations adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted non gaap financial measures enable our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of non cash charges including depreciation and amortization and share based compensation expense and without considering the impact of non operating items such as interest income expense net income tax expense benefit share based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets tax effect of amortization of intangible assets and without considering the impact of non recurring item i e income loss from discontinued operations we also believe that the use of these non gaap measures facilitates investors assessment of our operating performance the non gaap financial measures are not defined under u s gaap and are not presented in accordance with u s gaap the non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools one of the key limitations of using these non gaap financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations interest income expense net income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization share based compensation expense tax effect of amortization of intangible assets and income loss from discontinued operations have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of these non gaap measures including adjusted ebitda or adjusted net income loss further these non gaap measures may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including peer companies and therefore their comparability may be limited 7 affected entities refers to private schools entities holding such private schools as well as other enterprises within china that are

eight on the long end short muni ust ratios fell on the day s moves the three year muni ust ratio tuesday was at 61 the five year at 68 the 10 year at 70 and the 30 year at 92 according to refinitiv mmd s 3 p m read ice data services had the three at 61 the five at 67 the 10 at 76 and the 30 at 95 at a 4 p m read tax exempt munis have now regained late september levels and november s rally has eclipsed october s selloff noted matt fabian a partner at municipal market analytics despite continuing net outflows he said that mutual fund navs are trending positively and have now regained 21 24 of year to date losses at some point and seasonal expectations would argue for december assuming the fed actually slows its hiking cycle this is likely to translate into sustained mutual fund inflows fabian said which would be very likely to propel tax exempts to lower yields and albeit at a lag tighter spreads almost regardless of usts current and expected tax exempt scarcity remains a key factor in this expectation he said through oct 31 tax exempt issuance was 13 6 billion 4 2 behind 2021 and 25 billion 7 5 behind 2020 through friday year to date tax exempt issuance was 33 3 billion 9 4 behind 2021 and he said the forward calendar is not encouraging into year end muni ust ratios are therefore running near the lower end of recent ranges and last week notwithstanding are likely to show tax exempts as relatively rich for an extended period he said worse off is the short term market where the sifma 7 day index is 190 bps below sofr and represents just 50 of that reference rate he said this is very likely about supply with few vrdos and stubsecurities being available for sale to the 2a7 funds with mutual funds disinclined to finance new purchases via synthetic floaters and with two

outflows has resulted in the worst downturn in 40 years said megan poplowski director of municipal research at mfs calendar year returns for 2022 she said may go down as the worst annual return on record since 1980 she noted there have only been five other calendar years with negative returns she expects the fed to remain committed to hiking rates to bring down persistently elevated inflation hawkish policy coupled with the market s efforts to divine the fed s path will likely keep rate volatility elevated in the near term she said given this rate environment we believe outflow pressure and choppy performance is likely to persist for the asset class in the near term however there are some bright spots investment grade municipal bonds have never experienced back to back negative calendar years and historically municipal bonds have delivered attractive returns after periods of outflows poplowski said yields on investment grade munis have reached their highest level in over a decade income has been the largest component of fixed income total return and historically higher starting yields have been strongly correlated with higher subsequent five year total returns she said additionally given higher yields from higher quality assets such as investment grade municipal bonds investors may not have to reach for yield or take on more credit risk to achieve their desired income needs as they have in the past she added moreover municipal issuers are generally in strong fundamental positions healthy tax collections and high property valuations should buffer state and local governments against economic softening she said tax receipts are up while state rainy day funds have reached all time highs also although property values have historically declined during periods of economic softness assessments typically lag the peak of the downturn thus providing a degree of tax revenue stability to localities poplowski said the normalization of economic activity supports revenue backed sectors including airports toll roads and higher education while the health care sector should benefit from efforts to contain inflation she believes upgrades will likely continue to outpace downgrades and default rates should remain low and while the economic outlook is uncertain investment grade municipal bonds have been relatively resilient during recessionary

get started now types of land investments investing in land isn t a one size fits all proposition investors with varying amounts of wealth and risk tolerance might gravitate toward a specific type of land investment use the following list to gauge which land investments appeal to you commercial and residential land investments commercial and residential properties have broad appeal because investors of all sizes can access them for example you might not be able to afford an apartment building but you can purchase shares in a real estate investment trust reit as you would purchase shares of a company s stock reits allow you to focus on one type of real estate such as residential properties or combine any number of types from every sector of land investments that said reits are generally diversified whether you choose one or multiple types of real estate investments in addition as with investing in company stock your investments can typically be as small or large as you like the downside of investing in reits is that you won t have any actual land to use or inhabit therefore if owning your investment properties appeals to you purchasing land may be a preferable route if you can afford it livestock and crop farmland becoming a homesteader allows you to directly own your investment in a specific property living on and running your farm or ranch might be your dream come true and the potential returns are icing on the cake however raising crops and livestock is expensive and risky as a result deep pockets and the ability to shoulder stress are all but necessary to manage this type of investment crops and livestock are just the beginning of investing in agricultural land for instance you could cultivate an orchard vineyard mineral development land timber farm or recreational land generally these investments require less up front capital than crops and also allow you to live on the land specialized agricultural investments on the other hand if farming interests you but owning land doesn t exchange traded notes etns and exchange traded funds etfs are a less costly way to get exposure to agricultural land for example the teucrium corn fund provided a 35 1 return over the past year through investments in corn futures like crops and livestock you can purchase shares of etfs and etns for specialized land if running your own timber operation seems overwhelming through these funds you ll have exposure to land rich in timber oil and more and see healthy returns without owning an acre tips for investing in land if investing in land seems daunting following these tips can help you make the most of your investments understand your investment dotting each i and crossing each t can be irritating but it s usually worthwhile details like zoning laws property lines parking and whether an old apartment building has lead paint can make the difference between a profitable investment and a financial headache additionally a title search can help ensure you would own the land outright with no disputes research the region every piece of land sits in a place where employment household income and population interact and fluctuate ideally the land you invest in will be located in a region on track to experience upticks in these crucial factors follow your risk tolerance it s recommended that investors don t go against the grain of their preferences if you re risk averse investing in areas with high population and income might be the solution buying land in a region with consistent demand and healthy economic activity can help offset the possibility of losing a fortune on a land investment check the water waitlist some municipalities forbid new hookups to city water because of water shortages for example the city of cambria in california hasn t approved new water connections for two decades as a result reviewing your city s water situation is critical before building new residential or commercial properties verify the tax situation every municipality has different tax stipulations that can affect your investment s profitability for example your city might charge income tax to residents and businesses in addition you might receive special tax breaks for using land in a specific way such as farming review your mineral rights as with taxes mineral rights can vary based on region for instance your investment might grant ownership of the land you want but not what lies a few feet beneath the surface this scenario could lead to legal mining or drilling by other parties with no financial benefits for you play it cool during negotiations when haggling over a desired piece of land it s recommended to leave your emotions at the door even if you re excited about the deal allowing emotions to lead the way can result in poor judgments and mistakes during negotiations key considerations when investing in land investing in land involves more than finding a plot and making an offer legal issues can render the most attractive land a lousy investment for reasons out of your control for example your municipality might tightly control how you can use the land in question ruining plans for potential buildings or farms plus part of the property might be legally accessible to your neighbors due to land easements furthermore bordering a body of moving or standing water can affect land accessibility and create floodplain conditions as a result it s essential to review the land s deed to understand the legal ramifications of ownership once you ve ruled out legal impingements examine the land s utility connections paying for new water or electrical lines can eat into investing profits significantly in addition proximity to towns and cities the likelihood of attracting trespassers and how the land will impact your taxes are all vital to consider is investing in land right for you several solid reasons might lead you to invest in land first you might aspire to own and operate a farm or vineyard and enjoy the financial returns as a side benefit or as an investor looking to diversify their portfolio you might invest in reits with a proven track record on the other hand you might do your homework on a commercial or residential property and start collecting rent investing in land might not be suitable for you if you don t want to do extra research on your investments or take on more risk while real estate in its many forms can be a lucrative investment uninformed decisions generally result in losing money the bottom line you can invest in land through residential and commercial property farmland and specialized agricultural investments in addition you can invest by directly purchasing land or buying shares of reits which give you a diversified slice of the real estate market spreading risk across numerous assets when investing in land it s recommended to research the relevant factors in your situation such as tax obligations title status and environmental implications that said the work is typically worth it and land can be a profitable asset for any investor investment tips land investments can be intimidating especially if you ve never purchased property other

stubbornness but he worries about who will take care of him as he gets older donna selman a 55 year old college professor in illinois is mostly grateful to be single she said because her mother and aunts never had the financial and emotional autonomy that she enjoys mary felder 65 raised her children now grown in her row house in philadelphia her home has plenty of space for one person but upkeep is expensive on the century old house felder miles and selman are members of one of the country s fastest growing demographic groups people 50 and older who live alone in 1960 just 13 of american households had a single occupant but that figure has risen steadily and today it is approaching 30 for households headed by someone 50 or older that figure is 36 nearly 26 million americans 50 or older now live alone up from 15 million in 2000 older people have always been more likely than others to live by themselves and now that age group baby boomers and gen xers makes up a bigger share of the population than at any time in the nation s history the trend has also been driven by deep changes in attitudes surrounding gender and marriage people 50 plus today are more likely than earlier generations to be divorced separated or never married women in this category have had opportunities for professional advancement homeownership and financial independence that were all but out of reach for previous generations of older women more than 60 of older adults living by themselves are female there is this huge kind of explosive social and demographic change happening said markus schafer a sociologist at baylor university who studies older populations in interviews many older adults said they feel positively about their lives but while many people in their 50s and 60s thrive living solo research is unequivocal that people aging alone experience worse physical and mental health outcomes and shorter life spans and even with an active social and family life people in this group are generally lonelier than those who live with others according to schafer s research in many ways the nation s housing stock has grown out of sync with these shifting demographics many solo adults live in homes with at least three bedrooms census data shows but find that downsizing is not easy because of a shortage of smaller homes in their towns and neighborhoods compounding the challenge of living solo a growing share of older adults about 1 in 6 americans 55 and older do not have children raising questions about how elder care will be managed in the coming decades what will happen to this cohort schafer asked can they continue to find other supports that compensate for living alone planning for the future for many solo adults the pandemic highlighted the challenges of aging selman the 55 year old professor lived in terre haute indiana when covid 19 hit divorced for 17 years she said she used the enforced isolation to establish new routines to stave off loneliness and depression she quit drinking and began regularly calling a group of female friends this year she got a new job and moved to normal illinois in part because she wanted to live in a state that better reflected her progressive politics she has met new friends at a farmers market she said and is happier than she was before the pandemic even though she occasionally wishes she had a romantic partner to take motorcycle rides with her or just to help carry laundry up and down the stairs of her three bedroom home she regularly drives 12 hours round trip to care for her parents near detroit an obligation that has persuaded her to put away her retirement fantasy of living near the beach and move someday closer to her daughter and grandson who live in louisville kentucky i don t want my daughter to stress out about me she said watching their own parents age seems to have had a profound effect on many members of gen x born between 1965 and 1980 who say they doubt that they can lean on the same supports that their parents did long marriages pensions homes that sometimes skyrocketed in value when his mother died two years ago miles the videographer took comfort in moving some of her furniture into his house in new haven connecticut it was a coming home psychologically he said allowing him to feel rooted after decades of cross country moves and peripatetic career explorations shifting from the music business to high school teaching to producing films for nonprofits and companies i still feel pretty indestructible foolishly or not he said still caring for his divorced mother made him think about his own future she had a government pension security he lacks nor does he have children i can t call my kid he added the way i used to go to my mom s house to change light bulbs his options for maintaining independence are all terrible he said i m totally freaked out by it several gen x solo dwellers said they had begun exploring options to live communally as they age inspired in part by living arrangements they had enjoyed in college years and young adulthood with space to spare living solo in homes with three or more bedrooms sounds like a luxury but experts said it is a trend driven less by personal choice than by the nation s limited housing supply because of zoning and construction limitations in many cities and towns there is a nationwide shortage of homes below 1 400 square feet which has driven up the cost of the smaller units according to research from freddie mac forty years ago units of less than 1 400 square feet made up about 40 of all new home construction today just 7 of new builds are smaller homes despite the fact that the number of single person households has surged this has made it more difficult for older americans to downsize as a large aging house can often command less than what a single adult needs to establish a new smaller home and pay for their living and health care expenses in retirement people in this group often face the reality that it s more expensive to get a smaller condo than the single family you re selling and that presumes the condo exists which may not be the case said jennifer molinsky director of the housing an aging society program at harvard university and when they hold onto family size houses well into retirement there are fewer spacious homes placed on the market for young families who in turn squeeze into smaller units or withstand long commutes in a search for affordable housing both ends of the age distribution are getting squeezed said jenny schuetz an expert on housing and urban economics at the brookings institution the constraints are especially severe for many older black americans for whom the legacy of redlining and segregation has meant that homeownership has not generated as much wealth the percentage of people living alone in large houses is highest in many low income historically black neighborhoods in those areas many homes are owned by single older women one of them is felder of strawberry mansion a neighborhood in philadelphia she and her ex husband bought their two story brick row house in the mid 1990s for a song after it was damaged in a fire while raising three children felder worked a series of jobs including retail hotel housekeeping and airport security she retired in 2008 and has lived by herself for more than a decade although her sisters children and grandchildren live nearby maintaining her home is a challenge in rainstorms she sometimes had to use every piece of fabric in the house to sop up water pouring down a kitchen wall and she worries about her safety at times she dreams about relocating to small town south carolina where she was born and raised but the median value of a home in her neighborhood was 59 000 according to recent census data felder thinks she could sell her house and net about 40 000 that s not enough to retire down south she said sighing sitting in her living room filled with plants but in september living alone became harder while she was cleaning the trash out of a nearby alley with neighbors a masked gunman looked her in the eyes and shot her twice in the legs felder had no clue who shot her and there has been no arrest she recovered at her daughter s home across town where the ground floor has a bedroom and bathroom unlike in her own house by late november she was feeling much better physically if not mentally she said but she had not stayed overnight in her own home she is still a little afraid but i m working on it she said i really love my house this article originally appeared

including primarily adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss adjusted gross profit loss adjusted operating income loss adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted as supplemental measures to review and assess our operating performance the presentation of these non gaap financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with u s gaap we define adjusted gross profit loss from continuing operations as gross profit loss from continuing operations excluding amortization of intangible assets we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss excluding interest income expense net income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization share based compensation expense impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on property and equipment and income loss from discontinued operations net of tax we define adjusted net income loss as net income loss excluding share based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets tax effect of amortization of intangible assets impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on property and equipment and income loss from discontinued operations net of tax we define adjusted operating income loss from continuing operations as operating income loss from continuing operations excluding share based compensation expense and amortization of intangible assets impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill and impairment loss on property and equipment additionally we define adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted as adjusted net income loss attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders net income loss to ordinary shareholders ads holders excluding share based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets tax effect of amortization of intangible assets impairment loss on operating lease right of use assets impairment loss on goodwill impairment loss on property

assets related to various acquisitions that have been made in recent years these intangible assets are valued at the time of acquisition and are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition we believe that exclusion of these expenses allows greater comparability of operating results that are consistent over time for the company s newly acquired and long held business as the related intangibles do not have significant connection to the growth of the business therefore we provide exclusion of amortization of intangible assets to define adjusted gross profit from continuing operations adjusted operating income loss from continuing operations adjusted net income loss and adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted in addition due to the impact of the amended implementation regulations of the law on the promotion of private education of the people s republic of china the implementation rules the affected entities 7 deconsolidated is classified as discontinued operations which is a non recurring item the exclusion facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period to period basis therefore we provide exclusion of income loss from discontinued operations net of tax to define adjusted net income loss adjusted ebitda adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted we present the non gaap financial measures because they are used by our management to evaluate our operating performance and formulate business plans such non gaap measures include adjusted ebitda adjusted net income loss adjusted gross profit loss from continuing operations adjusted operating income loss from continuing operations adjusted net earnings loss per share attributable to ordinary shareholders ads holders basic and diluted non gaap financial measures enable our management to assess our operating results without considering the impact of

expense benefit share based compensation expense amortization of intangible assets tax effect of amortization of intangible assets and without considering the impact of non recurring item i e income loss from discontinued operations we also believe that the use of these non gaap measures facilitates investors assessment of our operating performance the non gaap financial measures are not defined under u s gaap and are not presented in accordance with u s gaap the non gaap financial measures have limitations as analytical tools one of the key limitations of using these non gaap financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect our operations interest income expense net income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization share based compensation expense tax effect of amortization of intangible assets and income loss from discontinued operations have been and may continue to be incurred in our business and are not reflected in the presentation of these non gaap measures including adjusted ebitda or adjusted net income loss further these non gaap measures may differ from the non gaap information used by other companies including

industry metrics such as ebitda ebitda margin adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda margin annual recurring revenue and net cash debt these measures are an addition and not a substitute for or superior to

performance and therefore semantix s non ifrs measures and industry metrics may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies additionally to the extent that forward looking non ifrs financial measures are provided they are presented on a non ifrs basis without reconciliations of such forward looking non ifrs measures due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting

indianapolis ap an unspent bullet found between the bodies of two teenage girls slain in 2017 had been cycled through a pistol owned by the suspect in their deaths according to court documents an indiana judge ordered released tuesday court records were sealed last month at the request of the local prosecutor after richard matthew allen 50 of delphi indiana was arrested oct 28 and charged with two counts of murder in the killings of liberty german 14 and abigail williams 13 the redacted probable cause affidavit released tuesday states investigators seized allen s 40 caliber pistol during an oct 13 search of his home testing determined an unspent bullet found within 2 feet of one of the girls bodies had been cycled through allen s pistol investigators determined allen had purchased that gun in 2001 allen said in an oct 26 interview with police that he had never allowed anyone to borrow the gun according to the affidavit requests from the public and the media for additional information in the case were granted tuesday by allen county judge fran gull s order the killings have haunted delphi a northwestern indiana city of about 3 000 where allen lived and worked at a local cvs store gull wrote that the public interest is not served by prohibiting access to the documents and that witnesses safety and allen s personal information could be protected by redacting some parts of the records several news organizations including the associated press had filed a brief with the court nov 21 urging gull to unseal the affidavit and charging information that detail the evidence authorities have linking allen to the killings the affidavit says investigators reviewing prior tips found allen had been interviewed by an officer in 2017 at the time allen said that on feb 13 2017 the day the girls went missing he was walking on a trail when he saw three females at a bridge called the freedom bridge but did not speak to them he told the officer that as he walked from that bridge to the monon high bridge an abandoned railroad bridge he did not see anyone but that he was watching a stock ticker on his phone as he walked allen was interviewed again by investigators on oct 13 and repeated he had seen three juvenile girls during his walk he said he walked across the monon high bridge s first platform then walked back sat on a bench on the trail and then left a relative had dropped off liberty and abigail known as libby and abby at a trail near the bridge close to their hometown delphi about 60 miles 100 kilometers northwest of indianapolis hours later the girls failed to show up at their pick up spot and the next day their bodies were found in a rugged area near the trail according to the affidavit allen said he had never been to the location where the unspent bullet was found between the girls bodies that he did not know the owner of that property and had no explanation as to why a round cycled through his firearm would be at that location the document redacted the names of witnesses including three juveniles who said they were on the trail on feb 13 2017 and saw a male walking toward the bridge who was kind of creepy one of the juveniles said she said hi to the male but he just glared at them another witness told police she was traveling along a carroll county road that day when she saw a man walking away from the monon high bridge wearing clothes that looked muddy and bloody he appeared to have been in a fight the witness said before tuesday state police had revealed incremental details about the investigations into the 2017 killings the deaths of libby and abby were ruled homicides but police had never disclosed how they died or what evidence they gathered the probable cause affidavit does not state how the girls died within days of the killings investigators released two grainy photos of a suspect walking on the abandoned railroad bridge and an audio recording of a man believed to be the suspect saying down the hill authorities also released an initial sketch of the suspected killer in july 2017 and then another in april 2019 based on cellphone video recorded by libby showing a suspect on the bridge the affidavit states investigators believe allen was the man seen in the bridge video as the male subject approaches victims 1 and victim 2 one of the victims mentions gun near the end of the video a male

example video title will go here for this video example video title will go here for this video cosumnes river college is aiming to be the first to offer free textbooks student housing and a more flexible class schedule sacramento calif cosumnes river college crc is reinventing what community college looks like following a multiyear decline in enrollment at community colleges angling to be the first community college in the nation where students don t have to buy textbooks they plan to reach that goal by fall 2023 for students like austin newton in the nursing program the cost of a textbook is also the cost of gas to get to school in my physiology class there was a book you had to buy twice cause you can rent it for a certain period of time but then you had to rent it again because it goes away by the time the term is over so then you have to buy the same book again said newton andi adkins pogue is the public services librarian in charge of getting faculty on board and 45 of faculty have already made the switch we found that the average cost at our campus of a single class textbook was about 100 and when you are talking about 15 units that starts to add up said pogue in the spring semester alone that saved cosumnes river college students 1 2 million dollars in the cost of textbooks for the current fall semester 1 5 million in savings if a student is on financial aid they actually don t get that payment until after the semester starts so they might try to get through the first few weeks of the class without the textbook and that can be really challenging and it already puts them at a disadvantage said pogue and that s if there are textbooks left for some students saving money now can be an investment in future education i m transferring so that money can go towards college apps and for more colleges since each is 70 bucks to apply said newton but crc doesn t want to be first in just textbooks they also have plans to be the first in the los rios district to offer affordable housing units the barrier which is a huge barrier of knowing where they are going to sleep where they are going to eat it removes that barrier it takes a lot of stress off their everyday life knowing they have a safe place to sleep said michele steiner regional director of philanthropy they received 44 million in a grant from the state that will cover the cost of construction expecting to break ground in fall 2023 with completion by 2025 it really does elevate the community college status and we know most four year institutions do feel that sense of community said steiner the community college s goal is to align students with a four year institution the college itself is embracing some traditional aspects of four year institutions whether it s the housing project that is looking to provide the same sense of community or class programs when students arrive at crc they are presented with a full time 15 credit schedule that includes transferable math and english credits it s connected to the program that they are interested in the major they are interested in that s what s unique about it instead of just taking courses that may not have anything to do with their program of study we want them to come in and stay focus on the area they are interested said tadael emiru chief student services officer but also to graduate in two years by being and staying a full time student students get a choice with their schedule giving them the flexibility for family commitments or jobs for those like rebecca sutera in a demanding program of vet technician she can choose to balance the course work i ve done variations depending on how hard the class is said sutera while still feeling confident she will transfer at the two year mark i haven t been on a waitlist at all yet so that s been the good thing said sutera first year biology student lailoni street says she was also able to get the classes she wanted and feels confident in a transfer after two years it was a little bit stressful i did procrastinate a little bit on trying to get the enrollment stuff down said street another barrier the college is removing is its covid 19 vaccine requirement that will start next semester crc president dr edward bush says it served its purpose during the height of the pandemic but it lost students in vulnerable populations low income and students of color our african american and latinx students we also saw that we had a decline in those student populations so we are doing targeted equity focus outreach said bush bush says they want to make sure communities of color know crc is here for them and to continue to honor the native american land the school sits on the college says one of the largest losses of students are those they consider re entry those 25 and older that maybe didn t take to online instruction during the pandemic or weren t able to attend because they were working according to los rios district the current rate of students at crc who complete their degree in the time allotted for the program is 8 almost 30 need an extra semester and almost 40 need an extra year abc10 watch download read 1 8 2 8 3 8 4 8 5 8 6 8

listen to this article listen to this article two federal reserve officials said monday that they favor raising the fed s key rate to roughly 5 or more and keeping it at its peak through next year longer than many on wall street have expected john williams president of the federal reserve bank of new york who is among a core group of officials around chair jerome powell said in a speech to the economic club of new york that the central bank has more work to do to reduce inflation closer to its 2 target and james bullard president of the st louis fed suggested that financial markets are underestimating the likelihood the fed will have to be more aggressive in its fight against the worst inflation bout in four decades the fed has raised its benchmark short term rate six times this year to a range of 3 75 to 4 with each of the last four hikes being a historically large three quarters of a point the central bank is expected to raise rates by an additional half point when it next meets in mid december though that would represent a reduction in the size of its rate hikes fed officials have stressed that they expect to keep their key rate at a historically high level well into the future because the fed s benchmark rate influences many consumer and business loans its aggressive series of hikes have made most loans throughout the economy sharply more expensive that has been particularly true of mortgage rates which have risen dramatically over the past year and have severely crimped home sales on wednesday powell is scheduled to address the fed s policies and their effects on the job market in a speech in washington in an interview with marketwatch bullard suggested that the speed of the fed s rate hikes isn t as important as the ultimate level of its benchmark rate which he said could exceed the 5 that financial markets have priced in markets are underpricing the risk that the fed will have to be more aggressive rather than less aggressive in order to contain the very substantial inflation that we have bullard said the central bank he added will likely have to keep its benchmark rate above 5 all through 2023 and into 2024 he also reiterated his view that the fed should be prepared to raise that rate to the lower end of a range between 5 and 7 by contrast financial markets have projected that the fed will have to reverse course and start cutting rates by next september presumably in response to a recession that many economists expect will occur next year williams suggested that there are some positive signs that inflation is easing noting falling prices for lumber oil and other commodities supply chains are also loosening he said a measure of supply chain snarls maintained by the new york fed has declined by three quarters from its pandemic peak yet the job market has stayed stronger than he expected williams said with the unemployment rate at 3 7 still near a half century low that argues that we ll need to have a somewhat higher path for interest rates than the fed projected in september williams said at that time the officials forecast that their benchmark rate would reach a range of 4 5 to 4 75 by early next year he said he now expects the unemployment rate to rise to 4 5 to 5 by the end of next year with inflation falling to 3 to 3 5 by then at that level inflation would still exceed the fed s target of 2 thereby extending its inflation fight into 2024 williams said like this article gain access to all of our great content with a month to month subscription start your subscription here

by eleanor wilson precede barbara muma developed her green thumb as a child living near the old kooweerup swamp today she is the proud owner of a two acre garden filled with flora fauna and boundless views to boot star news journalist eleanor wilson visited the narre warren north property as barbara prepares to open it to the public next month in collaboration with open gardens victoria breakout quote as roses lose their vigour they are not replaced wonderful as they are i find the the thorns grab hold of my skin now and don t seem to let go off the beaten track of the casey foothills is a perennial paradise where homeowner barbara muma spends her days among shades of forest green burgundy and sage but it s the vivid fuchsia bushes purple flax lillies and radiant orange california poppies that bring the two acre garden to life there s a discreet reason for the bursts of yellow and blue that are peppered throughout barbara s narre warren north garden her partner david david is colourblind so by incorporating bits of yellow and blue into the garden he can see those flowers and he can enjoy them barbara said while barbara s act of love for her partner was a considered decision she said there was no great plan that went on when she began designing the garden over 30 years ago it was certainly a gradual process she chuckled barbara will swing open the gates to her narre warren north property at 149 a beckett road on 3 and 4 december as part of an open gardens victoria viewing she hopes the open garden will be a chance for families to revel in her most prized possession which gazes at uninterrupted views towards dandenong stretching out to port phillip bay if its a nice day like this i would hope that people bring some food of their own if they want to sit down and have a picnic of their own on the grass barbara said that s what i hope to achieve people having a nice time growing up on the old kooweerup swamp barbara said her love for gardening came from her mother s example i can t say that i was very good at weeding as a child but i took an interest in the plants and i enjoyed them and appreciated them she said and then when i was able i started to make little gardens in the different places that we moved to so when i came here and saw this place i thought hmm this has got a potential for a good garden here that was 1990 barbara her then husband and three children had recently moved back home after 20 years living in canada back then the owners of the narre warren north property had a driveway that traversed the front entrance to the house now occupied by a lush green lawn there were sort of random garden beds stuck in the middle of the lawn and it was very basic she said i immediately began the process of removal and replacement of existing trees and garden beds rose and perennial beds were laid out and developed she spends about an hour each day in the garden weeding pruning cutting back shrubs dividing perennials ahead of the winter season the garden s acre long dam arguably the crowning glory of the property has 50 years of its own history it was dredged and built with the overburden from the former quarry site which was located to the east of the property and later irrigated crops to provide stock water to the valley below today clusters of flowering water lilies line its outer edges while australian coots frogs and resident snake necked turtles enjoy its cool waters below the lake is the native section of the garden where melaleuca green globe agonis flexuosa nana and striking myrtaceae bottlebrush flourish an ode to the indigenous beginnings of the land on bunurong country barbara s fondness for nature is clear as she sits on a stool on her front porch presenting photos of a nest of grey fantails which have made their home amongst a wall of climbing hydrangeas at the property s rear i remember going to music lessons as a kid and i absolutely loved it on a nice sunny day like today getting out of school early not because i was going to piano lessons but because i could have a look at everything that was going on in the trees and the birds and all that i ve always enjoyed it blue wrens scrub wrens grey fantails eastern spinebills new holland honeyeaters red browed finches willie wagtails rainbow lorikeets barbara s knowledge of the bird life that inhabits the garden could rival the most experienced bird watcher it s good to have a focus she says it takes your mind off all the general concerns of the day it s amazingly therapeutic actually she reasons and there s nothing like a bit of hard work to make you sleep at night entry to barbara s garden will cost 10 per person with children s entry free there is a toilet located at the back of the house past the vegetable garden and crab apple archways the proceeds from the garden viewing will be split between open gardens victoria and the narre warren scout group an organisation close to barbara s heart a scout group leader for three years in vancouver barbara said she hopes the event can give the local scout group an added funding boost one of the reasons i chose the scout group is because they don t get funding from the government she said both david and i were involved with them and its great for kids its absolutely great to get them outside and doing things that are practical barbara s garden

ended september 30 2021 it was a challenging quarter for our engineered materials division but the copper alloys division continued on its growth trajectory since completing our consolidation and modernization of our indiana foundry facility with the copper alloys team booking their fourth consecutive quarter of higher sales said ibc ceo and chairman mark a smith in fact copper alloys sales gains in the quarter were primarily due to the demand and availability of internally produced alloys from our vertically integrated indiana foundry the engineered material division s lower sales are largely due to lower demand for beryllium aluminum products used to manufacture semiconductor chips as compared to the prior year period where demand was at a historic high mr smith said profitability in the engineered materials division was also impacted by a decline in yield but it appears that the team has largely addressed this issue as yields are showing considerable improvement so far in the current quarter we continue to pursue many exciting new sales opportunities for beryllium aluminum products in the defense sector and i and the board look forward to seeing more of those efforts begin

a former j p morgan advisors broker who once had a billion dollar book of business and was praised by jamie dimon has been banned from the industry after costing the firm nearly 50 million in payments to his ex clients edward l turley s customers have already received 47 4 million in a finra arbitration award plus five other settlements paid by j p morgan securities the traditional brokerage unit that j p morgan chase acquired from bear stearns in 2008 and later rebranded to its current name j p morgan advisors with turley s finra brokercheck record displaying three other pending client complaints seeking a combined 78 6 million in damages the regulator barred turley on nov 17 for refusing to provide testimony in an investigation into one of the nine customer cases turley lost his job last year and has denied wrongdoing internet searches of his name bring a deluge of announcements by plaintiff attorneys calling on any harmed clients to come forward for consultations including a lengthy discussion of the case on the website of a lawyer representing a texas client who has filed a claim for more than 55 million the complaints revolve around allegations of unsuitable investments without written discretionary authority that caused massive losses to clients portfolios at the beginning of the pandemic in addition to further client complaints j p morgan could file its own arbitration claim against turley to recoup some of the losses from the nine existing cases said arbitration insight s louis straney a former regulator who often serves as an expert witness the investigation of turley has got legs that will probably go on for some period of time straney said in an interview they probably need him to cooperate in these hearings and in these investigations he said it s probably a little early to determine whether or not j p morgan is going to come after him for any assistance they should be freezing assets so he can t sell the boat and keep the money or sell the ferrari and keep the money these are big dollar amounts representatives for j p morgan declined to comment turley s lawyer in the finra proceeding andrew harvin of doyle restrepo harvin robbins didn t respond to an email seeking comment in interviews with other industry publications harvin rejected the allegations mr turley at age 76 has retired from the industry and denies that he has engaged in any wrongful sales practices harvin told advisorhub earlier this month as a 28 year veteran of the industry working out of the san francisco branch of j p morgan advisors turley once generated about 30 million a year from 1 6 billion in assets under management through his base of clients according to a detailed briefing of the case posted on the website of the law offices of robert wayne pearce usually on a quarterly basis turley would visit the texas client by flying his own jet across the country to wine dine and curry favor with the customer and his family pearce s firm wrote j p morgan ceo dimon complimented turley at lunches with the star advisor and the client as well not only did turley receive free lunches from management but he also received free passes when it came to compliance with finra rules and the brokerage firm s policies and procedures in place to protect j p morgan customers from sales abuse and unreasonable losses pearce wrote the client accuses turley of placing him in a risky fixed income credit strategy composed of high yield junk bonds foreign securities preferred stocks master limited partnerships and other products without gaining the formal required discretion to do so adding to the risk turley carried out foreign currency transactions to secure more capital and generate undisclosed commissions rather than using traditional margin accounts according to the client many of the products came from the financial and energy sectors which hit bottom in march 2020 another client won 4 million in damages in arbitration last year after making similar allegations asked about the client complaint seeking 55 6 million turley s attorney told financial advisor that they are going to fight that claim vigorously and i will run through a wall for the guy on that claim because this gentleman has been a risk taker all of his life he was perfectly happy with the recommendations for about a decade harvin said of the client it was only when the energy markets collapsed with the onset of covid that he sustained losses and the losses pale in comparison to how much he s worth finra s settlement with turley barring him from the industry doesn t identify which client claim out of the nine since may 2020 led to the regulator s investigation finra sent its request for testimony in late october seeking information about turley s trading in customer accounts including but not limited to the use of foreign currency and margin and the purchasing and selling of high yield bonds and preferred stock earlier this month turley s lawyer informed the regulator that he was refusing to testify he later agreed to the letter of acceptance waiver and consent banning him from the field to straney the arbitration expert the explanation that j p morgan chase bank supplied to brokercheck about turley s august 2021 termination left out many details the megabank rather than the subsidiary unit that had employed him since 2009 discharged turley due to a loss of confidence concerning adherence to firm policies and brokerage order handling requirements according to the disclosure firms often use language without the full findings of any investigation into a former broker out of fear of further lawsuits straney said it was so vague and benign that it really is not in the best interests of the investor or the consumer i ve run across this for more than 40 years straney said i dont think it s in the spirit of why you have brokercheck

federal reserve chair jerome powell seems poised to do another jackson hole on wednesday afternoon meaning douse recent optimism that the fed s interest rate hikes will taper off and perhaps reverse for the last couple of days investors have displayed concern about powell s speech at the brookings institution expecting a hawkish tone that might send stocks lower the s p 500 which has dipped over the past two trading days this week after rising last week could be in for another slump following powell s speech at brookings powell last gave investors a cold bath in his remarks at the kansas city fed s annual policy forum in jackson hole wyoming in august on that occasion he signaled that the u s central bank was likely to continue its tightening campaign and leave rates elevated for a while to push down high inflation the index which had been going up promptly lost 6 over the next few days doves have taken heart last week from the release of the fed policymaking panel s minutes of its november meeting the minutes stated that the fed might soon moderate the pace of rate boosts with a half point increase at its december meeting many investors took that to mean the fed s rate escalation was near or at an end after the last four increases at a 0 75 point rate a substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate according to the minutes several fed officials such as st louis fed president james bullard and fed vice chair lael brainard have given hawkish speeches in recent days seeming to pave the way for powell s brookings appearance they are all setting the stage for a hawkish performance from chairman powell on wednesday despite the step down in the pace of rate hikes wrote mike o rourke chief market strategist at jonestrading in a client note per bloomberg
last week a tree as old as the united states itself came down in front of the first united methodist church 919 60th st the burr oak stood on the northwest corner of the church property about 54 inches across at its widest it was estimated to be about 248 years old meaning it was just a sapling the day the american colonies sent a strongly worded letter to the king of england in 1776 lloyd kirk a member of first united methodist church and the trustee in charge of the tree recalled the day he first moved into kenosha it was 1944 and kirk was about 7 years old riding in a car away from the family farm i was impressed even then said kirk now 85 as crews stripped away its branches he remarked on the change taking the tree down created sheesh it looks kind of naked now in the more than two centuries that it stood the oak was witness to radical changes in kenosha the small settlement at the mouth of the pike river created in 1835 by the western emigrating company slowly transformed into the city we know today with homes stores and factories popping up as the oak reached skyward the tree would see some of the greatest wealth the city could offer in the late 19th century standing in the yard of zalmon simmons kenosha home the wealthy businessman manufacturer and politician founded the simmons bedding company which still exists today decades later it would see kenosha manufactured automobiles puttering around town with the first jeffery rambler rolling off the production line in 1902 through the 20th century kenosha s automotive industry would rise around the stately oak american motors ramblers matadors and gremlins and renault alliances all drove past the tree and in the early 2010s perhaps it saw the dust from the 52nd street chrysler plant s demolition for the last 93 years the tree has been a fixture at first united methodist church the seventh methodist church in kenosha built in 1929 through the stock market crash and dedicated in late december of the same year by then the oak tree was already 150 years old kirk said he was told it s likely the drought last summer ultimately killed the ancient tree despite attempts to revive it kirk said they realized the tree had to be removed or it could cause serious damage or even injury we re all saddened by it kirk said to me it was a kenosha landmark it took more than a day of work to take down the burr oak cassity tree service of sturtevant brought in wood chippers multiple trucks a crane and more to safely remove the tree workers were impressed when they arrived wednesday morning to begin their work i ve worked in this company for eight years and i ve never cut down a tree like this said jose villagomez it s pretty big now all that s left is an 54 inch wide stump and a few logs that kirk said he hopes to turn into souvenirs for church members although kirk said the church will likely do something eventually with the tree s former spot on the church grounds there are no immediate plans photos first united methodist tree first united methodist tree first united methodist tree first united methodist first united methodist tree first united methodist tree first united methodist tree first united methodist tree first united methodist first united methodist tree first united methodist tree first united methodist tree first united methodist tree first united methodist tree
my small contribution to raise your level of consciousness as you transition from buying food to buying more things the illusion of choice americans think they have a lot of choice but most of the brands they buy are wholly or partially owned by only a handful of companies don t believe me pick an industry and see for yourself papa johns pizza hut and dominos dominate online sales the same applies to fast food overall with mcdonalds pepsi and starbucks dominating the rest of the industry in retail 55 of americans buy from target and walmart at the high end nordstroms saks fifth and bloomingdales dominate social media facebook which includes instagram and whatsapp holds nearly 70 of the market the newest entrant to the market tiktok arose from outside the united states nothing wrong with foreign companies building a business in the u s but it is a problem when that happens due to a business climate where domestic competition is impossible some of these companies dominate to such a degree that they hold significant market share in multiple industries at t isn t just a telecommunications company after a recent 85 billion dollar merger with time warner which even the trump administration sued to stop it now owns tv studios like warner bros and new line cinema online streaming services like hbo channels like cnn and discovery and satellite providers like directv amazing what you can find in legal briefs amongst the legacy companies disney is probably the most egregious behemoth in an earlier newsletter i wrote about how it is almost impossible to avoid daily interaction with some part of disney s massive global enterprise amongst the new kids on the block amazon is the largest conglomerate owning everything from movie studios like mgm to groceries stories like whole foods wasn t it always this way no let s stick with media in the 1980 s 90 of american media writ large was owned by 50 separate companies today five companies own 90 of the american media market this consolidation of vertical markets was incentivized by government deregulation which started around 1978 and continued through the early 90s in the 1980 s 90 of american media writ large was owned by 50 separate companies today five companies own 90 of the american media market initially deregulation was a bipartisan effort both progressives and conservatives agreed that regulation encouraged price inflation and economic stagnation the stagflation of jimmy carter s presidency but over time deregulation became part of conservative dogma and its no coincidence that the period of deregulation from 1978 90s coincided with the presidency of ronald reagan under whom deregulation reached its philosophical zenith what bipartisanship looked like in the 70 s an advertisement by delta airlines arguing against the deregulation of the airline industry deregulation was championed by a democratic president jimmy carter we live in the age of oligopolies government deregulation has encouraged significant consolidation over the last three decades to the point where only 2 3 companies dominate in each industry e g an oligopoly oligopolies make products expensive for everyone over time contrary to how markets usually work where products usually get cheaper over time take insulin the drug many diabetics need to survive it is readily available and inexpensive to manufacture and has been around for over a century as products mature and manufacturing processes are perfected prices drop over time you can buy toasters for 8 now but today the price of insulin in the u s is at an all time high even when adjusted for inflation the average price in america across all types of insulin was more than ten times higher than the average for the other ten most expensive countries combined why because the insulin market in the u s is an oligopoly in which three companies eli lilly novo nordisk and sanofi share the spoils the multinational triumvirate has a stranglehold on the american insulin supply negotiating double digit percentage price rises seemingly in lockstep the second major problem with oligopolies is that the people who work at these companies as well as those vendors who supply parts to them get paid less take apple and samsung for example which together dominate the smartphone market in the u s the phones you buy from them are often produced in factories with questionable labor practices but what is samsung s incentive to demand fair working conditions for its contracted factory workers if apple decides to accept say 1 a day wage all samsung has to do is match it paying its workers more won t help it gain any market share against apple there s many other problems with oligopolies but over time these two problems low wages and expensive products lead to a cycle of diminishing economic returns that create stagnant and inequitable economic systems where no one makes enough and even if they did everything they could buy is too expensive so what can you do support innovative scrappy competitors if it works for your budget why not fly jetblue instead of united or buy the fairphone instead of a stock android device vote for representatives who want to strengthen the nation s antiquated anti trust laws and support the appointment of bureaucrats like lina khan who now heads the ftc and is an advocate for breaking up consolidated industries choose to buy from local independent merchants whenever possible instead of supporting anti competitive platforms like amazon often you ll find better quality products better vendor support and the same or similar prices buying direct share now playing on the unfairnation podcast catch me if you can lake arrowhead ca dec 9 11 friends in la join me at my home for an interesting conversation

dollarama stock tsx dol remains at all time highs while the rest of the market drops does this mean it s due to drop as well dollarama tsx dol has been one of the top performers in 2022 and that s saying a lot while other companies including many retail stocks are seeing shares drop into oblivion dollarama stock remains upward in fact it continues to surpass all time highs but does this mean dollarama stock is due for a drop or is this a defensive play perfect for your portfolio today we re going to see if dollarama stock remains a buy on the tsx today analysts weigh in we re still waiting on third quarter earnings from dollarama stock and already analysts are weighing in on expectations and what analysts really like is that other similar stores are doing so well this includes walmart which recently saw incredibly strong same store sales growth in canada in fact over the last few quarters dollarama stock has outperformed compared with walmart the point here is that consumers are looking to cheaper areas to make purchases and fight back inflation in particular it s not just the holiday season that investors should look to when it comes to spending halloween and back to school will also be high notes for dollarama stock and its q3 report the company has a strong track record of growth and during a recession and even poor economy the stock continues to do well because of this analysts believe it s a strong defensive stock to keep in your portfolio growth should continue analysts also believe that same store sales growth will continue not just for the next quarter but for full year 2023 at least again this is pointing to the potential of a recession this will allow the company to continue its domination of the low cost retail space not only will dollarama stock then see more stores increase its growth trajectory but this will allow it to bring in more superior products there has already been an increase in more well known brands over the last few years which has driven more canadians who want to keep more cash in their wallets to its aisles and you really do save with products offering a discount of up to 50 to 60 compared with comparable products according to a recent analysis great protection but is it a buy so right now yes dollarama stock does seem like a buy during this down market it s acted like a cyclical stock before doing well in a recession as canadians look to save money it certainly offers protection as inflation and interest rates rise however what about the long term analysts remain impressed by the growth in stores as well as sales and from opportunities abroad this includes in latin america dollarama stock therefore seems to be using its cash from its growing operations effectively and it looks like a solid long term hold i do however stress long term it s hard to tell what the future holds especially during a recession dollarama stock isn t immune to drops and it has yet to go through a major recession so time will tell how it performs in the next year and those to come shares of dollarama stock are up 31 year to date trading at 33 1 times earnings as of writing
precious metals holders and dividend collectors are opposites right not always as first majestic silver nyse ag tse fr allows financial traders to participate in the silver market indirectly while also receiving quarterly cash payments that combination is hard to resist so i am bullish on first majestic silver stock first majestic silver is a canadian company that actually mines both gold and silver primarily in mexico and the u s however as the companys name implies first majestic silver is mainly focused on silver exploration and production lets be honest some commodities miners are trying to get people to purchase their shares but they dont have any productive mines yet thankfully first majestic silver has multiple producing assets so the shareholders can be investors instead of just speculators besides not every silver producer is a dividend payer so ag stock offers benefits for income focused investors why invest in silver and in ag stock historically first majestic stock has followed the direction of the silver price fairly closely there is a magnified effect though so be aware that youd be somewhat leveraged as an ag shareholder compared to the silver price thats not a bad thing as silver can move frustratingly slowly sometimes and a little bit of leverage is certainly a good thing when silver is slowly going up first majestic stock green vs silver black there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about silver people call it an industrial metal because its used in a variety of industries including jewelry electronics medicine dentistry water purification and more of course we cant ignore silvers use in electric vehicle batteries as well as in solar panels consider collecting and reinvesting dividends with ag stock one of the downsides of holding physical silver is that youd need the silver price to go up in order to book a profit also trading physical silver typically involves paying a dealer more than the silver spot price first majestic silver shares on the other hand dont involve precious metal dealer fees and fee free stock trading is available through many different brokers nowadays furthermore ag stock can offer profit potential even if the silver price doesnt move thats because first majestic silver unlike some other silver miners proudly provides dividend payments the company is on record as having paid out quarterly dividends for over a year now first majestics current policy is to target quarterly per share dividend payouts that are equal approximately 1 of the company s net quarterly revenues divided by the company s then outstanding common shares you probably wont become fabulously wealthy overnight from those dividend distributions as the dividend yield is only 0 26 but consider the long term effect of compounding if you were to reinvest those dividends and the potential for dividend growth if silver rises between the dividends and the leverage ag stockholders could significantly outperform silver holders if the silver price heads north first majestic silver has multiple producing assets before you jump into the trade with any silver miner make sure that the company isnt just speculating on possible silver producers theres no need to worry about first majestic as the company has not just one but three currently productive silver properties all three of them are located in mexico theres san dimas with estimated 2022 silver production of 6 6 million to 7 million ounces then theres santa elena which is estimated to yield 1 6 million to 1 7 million silver ounces in 2022 finally theres la encantada which is expected to produce 3 million to 3 2 million ounces of silver this year by the way first majestic silver also owns the jerritt canyon property which is located in the u s state of nevada this is a gold mine with estimated 2022 gold production of 96 000 to 103 000 ounces thus while first majestic is silver focused its not a bad idea for the company to diversify into gold with a currently productive mine is first majestic silver stock a buy according to analysts turning to wall street ag stock is a hold based on one buy and three hold ratings the average first majestic silver price target is 9 58 implying 2 9 downside potential conclusion should you consider first majestic silver stock you can buy ag stock because of its income generating potential or because youre bullish on silver maybe you also dont want to pay dealer fees or youre looking to get some leverage compared to silvers price moves finally you might want to own ag stock because first majestic owns silver assets that are already productive for any or all of these reasons it makes sense to consider a long term position in first majestic silver disclosure

the stock market is not out of the woods yet and could face further volatility next year as a result of the federal reserve s quantitative tightening according to bank of america strategists in an analyst note this week the analysts led by savita subramanian warned the fed s shrinking of its balance sheet could fuel liquidity risks in different areas of the market bank of america projected a base case scenario of flat returns in 2023 with the s p 500 finishing the year at 4 000 up just 0 9 from monday s close but it warned of major volatility in the market throughout the year and said that in a so called bear case scenario the s p benchmark index could tumble another 24 from current levels to 3 000 economic index flashes major recession warning sign in the case of a bull market subramanian estimated the s p could close out the year at 4 600 the uncertainty stems from the unprecedented leverage risk in governments and central banks which could lead to liquidity risks popping up in odd places as the federal reserve reduces its roughly 8 6 trillion balance sheet at a pace of 95 billion a month inflation fight could last until 2024 fed official warns the fed began unwinding its balance sheet in june deploying one of its lesser known tools to combat the hottest inflation in decades the balance sheet which consists mostly of bonds and other assets that it has purchased nearly doubled in size during the pandemic as the fed bought up mortgage backed securities and other treasurys in order to keep borrowing cheap policymakers say the portfolio runoff will work in tandem with a series of aggressive interest rate increases to bring prices down by slowing growth and tightening credit the fed has also voted to raise interest rates at six consecutive meetings including approving four 75 basis point rate hikes as it tightens policy at the fastest pace since the 1980s even though inflation cooled slightly last month the consumer price index rose 7 7 annually the slowest pace since january officials have shown no signs of slowing rate increases click here to read more on fox business let me say this fed chairman jerome powell told reporters on nov 2 it is very premature to be thinking about pausing when people hear lags they think about pauses it s very premature in my view to talk about pausing our rate hikes we have a way to go there is a growing concern among economists and some lawmakers over the impact of higher interest rates on the u s economy and there is a broad consensus on wall street that the fed will trigger a recession with its war on inflation
