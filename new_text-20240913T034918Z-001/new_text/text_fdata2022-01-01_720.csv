omicron covid 19 variant could give way to an investment community more intent on a reset of expectations for where interest rates are heading over the course of 2022 the employment report is the most important data on a calendar that also includes the ism manufacturing survey data and auto sales both slated for tuesday international trade data is released thursday according to dow jones economists expect 405 000 jobs were added in the final month of 2021 up from 210 000 in november the unemployment rate is expected to slide to 4 1 from 4 2 it s the start of a new year history would tell you we should kick it off in a pretty strong way especially considering we ve seen this kind of rolling correction said sameer samana senior global equities strategist at wells fargo investment institute we appreciate the fact the s p has been making new highs but when you look at the average stock or small cap stocks they ve had a very different experience the 2021 market was bifurcated with an initial surge in some high flying growth stocks but then many of those names fell hard and some of the big cap names in the s p 500 turned in super charged performances microsoft was up 51 for the year while apple gained 34 home depot was up 56 and american express gained 35 ford was up 136 the ark innovation etf a high flying collection of growth stocks in 2020 was down 24 for the year fed ahead on wednesday the fed will release minutes from its december meeting following that meeting the central bank announced it would speed up the tapering of its once 120 billion a month bond buying program now ending it by march instead of june the march meeting is now viewed as the first opportunity for the fed to move on a rate hike the fed has forecast three for 2022 i think next week people start to shift to this changing monetary landscape it s such a big deal said peter boockvar chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group the liquidity flows over the past two years has been nothing we ve ever seen before strategists expect 2022 to be choppier for the stock market as the fed ends its bond purchases and moves to raise interest rates from zero stock strategists have a median target of 5 050 for the s p 500 according to cnbc s strategist survey boockvar said the impact of tightening policy will be felt globally as other central banks also reduce their asset purchase programs and move toward raising interest rates that liquidity flow is slowing down and we know how much of a help it s been boockvar said you can t separate a fed tightening cycle from the stock market you can t separate the market they re all connected there s no such thing that you can avoid the tightening of financial conditions wells samana said he is focused on quality in big cap u s stocks for the new year you ve got to take what the market gives you and what it s giving you now is there s not a lot of reasons to step away from u s large cap he said we like tech we like communications services we like financials and we like industrials two growth sectors and two cyclical sectors we ve been boiling it down to anything but defensives samana said wells strategists downgraded the materials and energy sectors at the same time they upgraded tech we want to have a much more balanced position going into 2022 we just don t know what opportunities will present themselves energy was the top performer of the major sectors in 2021 up 48 its best increase ever it was followed by real estate which jumped 42 technology was up 33 and financials also gained 33 matt maley of miller tabak pointed out the consumer staples select sector spdr fund has outperformed tech and semiconductors in december the fund was up nearly 10 while the technology select sector spdr fund gained 3 for the month in other words that action in the stock market over the past several weeks has been a lot different than it has seemed to a lot of people we have not seen a melt up and the tech stocks have not done as well as most people think maley wrote in a note more importantly one of the most defensive groups in the marketplace has been the one that has been rallying nicely in our opinion this tells us that investors are quite worried about the effect that the fed s new more aggressive tightening cycle could have on the stock market next year what else to watch the actions of opec have been an important

as 2021 closes it s time to consider how sector themes in the markets are likely to perform in 2022 years like 2021 saw a solid broad based performance in many stock market sectors relatively simple approaches such as indexing and sector rotation did well but with macro changes in play and many uncertainties for 2022 we may very well see broad indexes underperforming while individual sectors dominated by a few stocks really shine dips will continue to be bought unless something significant changes but let s not forget that we re long overdue for a substantial correction significant risk catalysts are fed actions international conflicts i e russia and china pandemic developments that are not currently known there s always the risk of the unknown the literal definition of a black swan event we shouldn t get too complacent knowing that we may need to get defensive to protect capital suddenly when it s time to be defensive let s not forget that cash is a position sector theme drivers for 2022 many uncertainties about covid and the lingering effects on the economy remain inflation has roared back to 30 year highs strong employment numbers and consumer spending are fuelling significant growth in corporate earnings we also have a shift in bias at the fed on interest rates and quantitative easing these are the knowns and are theoretically priced in for these reasons and more we should expect more of a stockpicker s market in 2022 certain sectors will do well and weather corrections better than the broader markets even short term traders can gain an edge by paying attention to what sectors are strongest traders tend to benefit most from playing the strongest stocks in the strongest sectors for bullish trades and choosing the weakest stocks in weaker sectors for bearish trades that tailwind can make a significant difference in results let s look at some sector themes and individual names to keep an eye on in 2022 economic normalization a long anticipated return to a normal economy will continue to be a theme we just don t know if that will be post covid or co covid or when air travel theme parks hotels cruise lines etc have all suffered in the persistent pandemic what does seem to be changing is the idea of a new normal where virus variants may be with us for years to come we will adjust socially and economically to that for the foreseeable future delta air lines nyse united airlines nasdaq southwest airlines nyse and american airlines nasdaq are airlines to watch and the u s global jets etf nyse may be a good way to play a general recovery in this sector 5g internet the much hyped rollout of 5g network technology had its share of setbacks and technology disappointments but 2022 should see the 5g deployment start to take off as

number of specialty semiconductors as conventional vehicles ai crypto 5g mobile devices and ubiquitous computing should drive growth in the semiconductor sector for some time to come real estate real estate and homebuilders should continue to do well while employment numbers remain strong and if interest rates don t rise too quickly the inventory shortage in most real estate markets will likely persist well into the new year storage reits like public storage nyse life storage inc nyse and cubesmart nyse have been big winners in the covid economy and still have room to run summary many sectors still look bullish after gains in 2021 but there are storm clouds on the horizon and we must not take future performance for granted lastly one of the simplest ways to assess how sectors are measuring up is to watch the charts for the s p spdr series sector etfs and a few others here are some notable ones to watch these can give us a good starting place to look for leading stocks in winning sectors as the year unfolds let s remain vigilant for possible market corrections and may the wind be at our backs

well at least there were no wildfires perhaps that s the best thing that can be said about a year marked by severe drought legal strife the closure of an iconic local business and a seemingly endless pandemic here s a look back at st helena s top 10 news stories of 2021 drought causes water emergency st helenans will long remember 2021 for one of the worst water emergencies in its history st helena ended the 2020 2021 rainfall season with only 10 32 inches of rain the driest year on record during the drought of the 70s by comparison st helena got 12 39 inches in 75 76 and 13 54 inches in 76 77 the city declared a phase ii water emergency in october 2020 residential customers were limited to 65 gallons per person per day plus 2 500 gallons per month for irrigation non residential customers had to reduce their consumption by 10 the penalties that took effect in june looked small on paper starting at just 1 3 cents per gallon but quickly added up due in part to leaks customers racked up 2 9 million in penalties that first month with 290 penalties exceeding 10 000 conservation efforts improved after that and the city offered a generous forgiveness program conservation became a way of life as st helenans shortened their showers let their lawns and plants die and invested in flume water monitors a major october storm dumped over 10 inches of rain on st helena just weeks before bell canyon reservoir s official diversion season on nov 15 or had the season had already started the city s permit says about nov 15 whether st helena could keep that water seemed to depend in all seriousness on the definition of the word about the issue might have been rendered moot when december rainfall filled bell canyon allowing the city to scale back the water emergency from phase ii to phase i on tuesday however officials are still urging customers to conserve water into the new year pandemic drags on the year began with great promise as the st helena hospital foundation mounted an ambitious ongoing effort to vaccinate st helenans yet the coronavirus and its tiresome restrictions on everyday activities proved to be tenacious starting in january with seniors 75 and over covid 19 vaccines gradually became available to kids as young as 5 however variants like delta and omicron kept cropping up and indoor mask requirements are still in place there were signs of recovery tourism rebounded significantly as hotels and wineries reopened events like the harvest festival pet parade and festa italiana returned innovative businesses like legit provisions and crisp kitchen juice opened their doors and the st helena historical society periodically opened its long awaited heritage center at the former st helena catholic school however the upcoming bookmark napa valley has been postponed due to the omicron variant a reminder that the pandemic still isn t done with us city settles hall lawsuit the legal battle between the city of st helena and the owners of the former vineland vista mobile home park appears to be over with the city council approving a settlement agreement requiring the city to provide water to the property and pay 950 000 to the owners hall vineland and hall vista the case was based on the city s issuance of a will serve letter pledging to continue providing water to the property a letter that was rescinded after city officials became concerned that the halls were planning to build a hotel on the property which is just south of the city limits the property owners filed suit to preserve their water rights the terms contained in the settlement appear highly favorable to the halls although the city was able to cap water use at the former mobile home park and at the adjacent winery city officials say the settlement will avoid the possibility of a worse outcome at trial and allow them to move on to more important matters city battles pacaso in court just as uber and lyft disrupted the taxi industry and facebook disrupted just about everything pacaso set out to disrupt the second home industry those efforts hit a nerve in st helena where high prices and a dwindling supply of middle income housing had already put second home ownership and timeshares under the microscope the wealthy startup sued the city in april after officials tried to enforce its timeshare ban against pacaso which uses a similar model in which up to eight parties can purchase shares in a company that holds title to a house the federal lawsuit claims that pacaso houses are not timeshares and that the city s enforcement efforts are the latest chapter in a long history of improper attempts by the city to exclude outsiders from the community the dispute played out not only in court but also in st helena neighborhoods like vineyard avenue kearney street and riesling way where anti pacaso activists from st helena and beyond criticized the company for transforming middle class housing into party houses occupied by part timers with little or no connection to the community a federal judge dismissed part of pacaso s suit in july but the larger case is still pending vasconi s closes vasconi s pharmacy a symbol of old st helena and a throwback to the town s norman rockwellian past closed in june after 70 years in business hap and patty vasconi s decision to retire triggered a wave of nostalgia among st helenans who remembered the store to stock up not only on prescription drugs but on local gossip and a heady dose of small town americana we had a good run patty told the star it was just time to get out said hap a new clothing store tweed vine took over part of the old vasconi s space in november but it s still unclear what will happen over the long term to one of downtown st helena s most visible and fondly remembered storefronts city leases nvc space everybody loves a good will they or won t they story generation x had ross and rachel muppets fans had kermit and miss piggy and devotees of st helena politics had the city of st helena and napa valley college this summer they did as the city finally entered into a five to seven year lease to use part of the napa valley college upper valley campus as the next city hall city workers and police haven t moved in yet pending tenant improvements but the impending move triggered talks of how best to use the city s own buildings moving forward in november the city council told staff to investigate affordable housing at the temporary city hall on railroad avenue a commercial or mixed use project at the old smoke damaged city hall on main street and leasing out the carnegie building hunter project gets a chilly response after almost 10 years of start and stop progress the 87 unit hunter project finally reached the public hearing stage in november public comments were uniformly negative with criticisms ranging from water consumption to emergency egress to the visual impacts along the trail that leads past the library to the napa river the housing project wouldn t directly affect the trail and 597 000 in lieu fee for water saving retrofits would theoretically make the project water neutral but if public comments are any indication st helenans aren t happy their comments will be incorporated into a final environmental impact report slated for public hearings in the first quarter of 2022 candidates line up for dillon s seat five term supervisor diane dillon announced in january that she wouldn t run for reelection in 2022 within days district 3 hopefuls were jockeying for her seat st helena city councilmember anna chouteau and

city the city found itself with another lawsuit on its hands when water audit california accused the city in june of mismanaging its water to the detriment of the napa river and its aquatic habitat the environmental group which had recently sued napa county on similar grounds said the city was failing to account for a cause and effect relationship between groundwater extraction for municipal use and diminished surface flows in streams like the napa river the lawsuit came after months of prior negotiations resulted in the two parties issuing a joint statement in february announcing that the city would collect more water data and make it publicly available something water audit says never happened our town expands housing efforts somebody forgot to tell our town that 2021 was supposed to be all doom and gloom instead what started as a homegrown housing advocacy group continued its transformation into a full fledged developer and landlord on pope street where our town had acquired land for five affordable housing units a donation by jim and stephanie gamble allowed our town to buy an adjacent lot and double the project to 10 units on hunt avenue with financial help from the city our town acquired the 4 unit christine apartments which will be converted into regulated affordable housing and on mccorkle avenue the 8 unit brenkle court project is nearing completion as eight local

washington chief justice john roberts made a case friday for maintaining the independence of the federal judiciary after a year in which the other branches of the government eyed changes big and small to the way the courts do their business roberts used an annual year end report on the federal judiciary to draw attention to one of his predecessors william howard taft the 27th president of the united states who went on to serve as chief justice the only person in history to hold both jobs he understood that criticism of the courts is inevitable and he lived through an era when federal courts faced strident calls for reform some warranted and some not roberts wrote of taft in his nine page report as chief justice taft took vital steps to ensure that the judicial branch itself could take the lead in fulfilling that duty roberts message wasn t hard to glean the judiciary can take care of itself the report came at the end of a year in which a commission created by president joe biden studied a wide range of potential changes to the supreme court including the possibility of adding justices to the nine member bench or setting term limits the panel was created in response to calls on the left to blunt the impact president donald trump s three nominees to the court where conservatives now enjoy a 6 3 advantage prep for the polls see who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our voter guide the commission which wrapped up its work in early december noted profound disagreement over adding justices and made no recommendations scotus study supreme court commission submits report to white house congress meanwhile is considering legislation that would change how the federal courts are run including some bills that have bipartisan support lawmakers have advanced a measure that would make opinions and other legal documents free online another bill would require federal judges to provide additional information about their financial investments that legislation which has already passed the house gained momentum this year after an investigation by the wall street journal found more than 130 federal judges oversaw court cases involving companies in which they or their family owned stock roberts wrote in his annual report that judiciary officials were responding to the story by increasing training and reviewing software judges use to identify financial conflicts of interest let me be crystal clear the judiciary takes this matter seriously roberts wrote adding that the violations likely entailed unintentional oversights in which the judge s conflict checking procedures failed to reveal the financial conflict roberts response was unlikely to satisfy advocates who have called for significantly more transparency from federal judges including members of the supreme court chief justice roberts is taking a page from his old playbook acknowledging institutional deficiencies in the judiciary but telling the public that only we judges can fix them said gabe roth executive director of fix the court a nonpartisan group that has pushed for greater transparency and other changes to federal courts the problems of overlooked financial conflicts and sexual harassment are endemic and harm the public s trust in our courts roth said so congress has every right to step in and via legislation hold the third branch to account which i expect to happen in 2022 roberts who has tried to steer the court clear of partisan politics throughout much of his tenure made no mention of criticism that has been lobbed directly at the supreme court for its handling of major controversies on its emergency docket or shadow docket to the high court s critics that pushback grew this summer when the court allowed a texas ban on most abortions after six weeks of pregnancy to remain in effect abortion texas abortion ruling renews criticism of supreme court s shadow docket without oral argument or signed opinions the court also unwound biden s eviction moratorium required the biden administration to keep migrants seeking asylum in mexico and rebuffed a series of challenges to state vaccine mandates since then the court has sent signals it is prepared to respond to the criticism most recently it took the unusual step of scheduling oral arguments for jan 7 in a high profile emergency challenge to biden s federal covid 19 vaccine or testing mandate the court also held subsequent arguments over the texas abortion ban and issued a signed opinion on dec 10 that once again allowed the law to remain in effect roberts also used his annual report to discuss inappropriate behavior in the judicial workplace allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination within the federal court system have been amplified by a lawsuit brought by a former public defender from north carolina that is pending in the virginia based u s court of appeals for the 4th circuit olivia warren a former law clerk to judge stephen reinhardt of the u s court of appeals for the 9th circuit also drew attention to the issue when she told members of congress in 2020 that she and other female clerks were routinely sexually harassed and that she was afraid to report it reinhardt died in 2018 2020 report amid election turmoil roberts lauds judiciary for pandemic response congress is considering legislation to extend federal prohibitions on discrimination in the workplace to judicial employees who are currently not covered by those laws roberts wrote that he appreciated that members of congress have expressed ongoing concerns and said judicial officials remain fully engaged in addressing the issue the judiciary s power to manage its internal affairs insulates courts from inappropriate political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust in its work as a separate and co equal branch of government roberts wrote

cnn chief justice john roberts stressed the importance of the judiciary s institutional independence friday in an annual report that comes as the supreme court is considering some of the most important issues of the day and critics are seeking to dilute the court s conservative majority roberts did not directly address the term s explosive docket that includes cases on the future of roe v wade the biden administration s vaccine mandates and the expansion of gun rights but he emphasized the need to insulate the courts from what he called inappropriate political influence decisional independence is essential to due process promoting impartial decision making free from political or other extraneous influence he wrote besides his duties on the high court roberts presides over the judicial conference a body responsible for making policy regarding the administration of the courts and releases a report each new year s eve on the state of the judiciary friday s report was ostensibly aimed at matters closely related to the court s internal administration but it was carefully crafted to make clear that the court s ability to manage its own affairs is vital roberts said to safeguarding and fortifying the independence of the branch the justices are currently on their winter recess but they will return in one week to hear expedited oral arguments concerning the biden administration s attempts to impose requirements to combat the resurgence of covid 19 behind closed doors the justices are also mulling a direct challenge to roe v wade and another case that could expand the reach of second amendment protections roberts did not mention a recent study commissioned by president joe biden to explore court reform or proposals from progressives to add more members to the bench and impose term limits but he said the political branches should stay out of the court s internal workings the judiciary s power to manage its internal affairs insulates courts from inappropriate political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust in its work as a separate and co equal branch of government he said he noted that 2022 will mark the centennial of the creation of the judicial conference and said its role has never been more vital besides dealing with issues having to do with the pandemic and cybersecurity roberts highlighted other areas that he said would receive the attention of the judicial conference in the coming months they include a renewed focus on the recusal obligations of judges from cases that involve companies in which a judge may own stock roberts nodded to a wall street journal report from september detailing incidents when judges had failed to appropriately recuse themselves in violation of ethics rules let me be crystal clear roberts said the judiciary takes this matter seriously he also provided an update on inappropriate behavior in the judicial workplace a topic that had been the subject of previous reports he said that a working group consisting of judges and senior administrators had made recommendations to revise codes of conduct streamline internal procedures aimed at identifying misconduct and expand training programs roberts repeatedly referred to former president william howard taft who also served as chief justice of the united states from 1921 1930 he understood that criticism of the courts is inevitable and he lived through an era when federal courts faced strident calls for reform some warranted and some not roberts said

toronto canada s main stock index ended the year up almost 22 per cent for its second straight year of double digit gains even as it ended the last day of 2021 in the red the s p tsx composite index was down 71 80 points at 21 222 84 on light trading to close the year up 21 7 per cent surging cases of covid 19 from the latest variant continued to weigh on markets with little other news of note friday said angelo kourkafas investment strategist at edward jones many stock markets around the world are closed ahead of the new year and there were no canadian or u s economic releases he said in an interview the focus really remains on the surge of the omicron variant nonetheless the tsx ended the week higher than it began kourkafas noted while capping off a historically strong year in new york the dow jones industrial average was down 59 78 points at 36 338 30 the s p 500 was down 12 55 points at 4 766 18 while the nasdaq composite was down 96 59 points at 15 644 97 looking back on the year investors have much to celebrate kourkafas said there s been a few twists and turns but the year really has given investors the best of both worlds on the upside he pointed to the strong returns the canadian index posted 62 new highs over the course of 2021 on its climb and overtook the 20 000 point milestone for the first time and even on the downside investors saw pretty infrequent and short lived pullbacks compared with typical tsx performance commodities too had a strong year which benefits the energy and mining heavy toronto exchange north american benchmark west texas intermediate crude is up more than 50 per cent on the year and has now gained for seven straight quarters the longest streak since 1983 the february crude contract was down us 1 78 to us 75 21 per barrel on friday and the february natural gas contract was up 17 cents us at us 3 73 per mmbtu the february gold contract was up us 14 50 at us 1 828 60 an ounce and the march copper contract was up 7 1 cents to us 4 46 a pound along with giving a boost to the stock market strong commodities have helped lift the canadian dollar which kourkafas said is the only advanced economy currency major currency that has actually advanced against the u s dollar this year the loonie traded for 78 88 cents us friday compared with 78 27 on dec 30 as everyone turns their sights to the new year kourkafas said there is room for optimism the pandemic continues to pose unique challenges we re still talking about record cases in many parts of the world but the economy has proven to be resilient and in our view that resiliency is going to be maintained next year he said we have strong consumer and corporate finances still low interest rates and we shouldn t forget that we haven t seen yet the full reopening of the economy so all of these things we think provide a pretty steady foundation for the bull market to continue next year that doesn t necessarily mean another year of gains over 20 per cent with returns expected to moderate volatility will also be closer to normalized levels he said usually we see on an average year three per cent and five per cent pullbacks and one 10 per cent correction we haven t seen a correction yet this year and probably that s in the cards for next year but it s the economy s demonstrated ability to weather the recurrent storms of the pandemic that market watchers should consider for 2022 he said we have seen that again and again this year we ve been through multiple waves of the virus and each successive wave has had less and less economic impact the negative impact has been lower every time consumers and corporations have in a sense adapted and learned to live with the virus so hopefully what s going on with omicron is a near term setback but that doesn t necessarily change the overall trajectory this report by the canadian press was first published dec 31 2021 companies in this story tsx gsptse tsx cadusd x the canadian press
this year 52 members of the house and senate violated the stock act a 2012 law that requires prompt and accurate reporting of stock trades by members of congress insider reported apparently they were too busy trading to focus on filing accurate reports in a timely manner the very people who make the laws members of congress as well as the president and the vice president are exempt from this law it seems like the simple solution would be to prohibit congressional members from trading individual stocks to avoid potential foul play yet house speaker nancy pelosi d calif recently announced that she would oppose efforts to prohibit members of congress and their spouses her own husband being one of them from trading individual stocks this is a dangerous move for many reasons ordinarily pelosi s stubborn defense of congressional stock trading would be an opportunity for house republicans to take the high ground on ethics put their assets in mutual funds or blind trusts and then promise that if they get control of the house in 2022 stock trading by all members will be prohibited good luck with that republicans in congress are way too busy trading their own stocks to worry about ethics the hypocrisy of congress is astonishing when you look at the fact that every other federal employee is subject to a criminal statute that prohibits financial conflicts of interest with official duties it is a crime for a federal officer to participate in a particular government matter including supporting or opposing a bill in congress that has a direct and predictable effect on the federal officer s financial interest of course the very people who make the laws members of congress as well as the president and the vice president are exempt from this law they are allowed to have financial conflicts of interest with their official duties that for other federal employees are a crime then there is the insider trading problem members of congress know a lot of information the rest of us don t know and some of this information can be useful for stock trading trading on the basis of nonpublic information misappropriated from congress or any other employer however is a crime investment bankers and corporate officers routinely go to jail for insider trading and the securities and exchange commission when it suspects insider trading can commence an investigation and subpoena corporate emails texts and other records showing what traders knew and when they knew it it s not so easy in the case of congress because the speech and debate clause of the constitution is interpreted to severely limit the ability of federal investigators to obtain records and find out who said what to whom in congressional offices and on the floor investigating allegations of congressional insider trading is thus left to the house and senate ethics committees which have little experience with such investigations and furthermore report to the very members of congress they are investigating alexander hamilton s first bank of the united states was mired in controversy because of leaks to speculators about congress plan to use the bank to pay off the state s revolutionary war bonds at 100 cents on the dollar congressional insider trading is as old as the republic alexander hamilton s first bank of the united states was mired in controversy because of leaks to speculators about congress plan to use the bank to pay off the state s revolutionary war bonds at 100 cents on the dollar before approving this plan in the assumption act of 1790 members of congress themselves bought up the bonds at a fraction of their face value u s representatives and senators thus were already mimicking the corrupt practices of british members of parliament who had spent much of the 18th century speculating wildly in stocks including the infamous south sea company whose stock price skyrocketed before it crashed in 1720 fast forward to today and little has changed in 2020 both of georgia s then senators were accused of insider trading during fluctuations in stock prices in the early months of the covid 19 pandemic even fox news recognized that this was a political problem in georgia not only did president joe biden win georgia in the general election but both stock trading senators were turned out of office in runoff elections in january regardless of party affiliation voters know the difference between an honest public servant and someone who is in it for themselves one congressman rep chris collins r n y pleaded guilty to charges related to insider trading albeit for misappropriating nonpublic information from a publicly traded company not from congress itself in 2020 he was pardoned by president donald trump a man who apparently relishes financial conflicts of interest the new york times reported recently that politicians and their immediate families bought 267 million and sold 364 million worth of assets this year pointing out that democrats are really into tech stocks which accounted for some 35 million and that republicans are more about energy buying 32 million worth of stock in companies in the sector during the year predictably in the partisan divide over investments west virginia sen joe manchin aligns with the republicans more than the democrats his strong preference is for coal there are so many stock trades that many congressional traders lose track and fail to meet their reporting obligations a year ago i joined donna nagy of indiana university maurer school of law in bloomington an expert in insider trading law in writing a letter to the house and senate leadership urging that both chambers by rule or statute prohibit members from trading in individual stocks our letter was ignored and to this day we have not received an answer nagy and i also co wrote an op ed arguing the same point which was published by bloomberg law on jan 6 the only day this year on which members of congress probably were not trading stocks because they feared for their lives more than for their portfolios it s time for new leadership in congress giving control of either the senate or the house to the republicans won t help in fact it would probably make things worse congressional republicans refused to acknowledge trump s financial conflicts of interest throughout his presidency making it impossible to believe that they would do anything about their own conflicts of interest but democrats need to promise voters that there will be new congressional leadership and that the financial conflicts of interest tolerated by pelosi and other leaders will not be tolerated anymore congressional stock trading must come to an end members should be required to place their assets in blind trusts or diversified mutual funds and focus their attention on the nation s business not their own anyone in congress unwilling to make this commitment should find another job

photo credit imagenet shutterstock the covid 19 pandemic has brought many changes to the economy and one of the most profound impacts has been on the residential real estate market in the u s for more than a year and a half an unusual combination of factors has left would be homebuyers navigating a highly competitive market with prices growing at an extremely rapid pace one of the major challenges has been supply late in 2020 the inventory of homes for sale fell to all time low levels while supply chain challenges and a tight labor market have made it difficult for builders to complete new homes on the demand side more homebuyers many of them first or second time buyers of the millennial generation have been enticed to enter the market thanks to low mortgage rates and high savings and investment returns during the pandemic and while recent months have shown signs that the market may be cooling off elevated prices may be the new normal in the residential market the s p case shiller home price index is one of the leading tools for tracking changes in u s home prices over time and the growth in the index shows just how sharply home prices have risen in august 2019 the percent change in home prices year over year dropped to 3 2 the lowest rate of growth since the end of the great recession by august 2020 six months into the covid 19 pandemic the rate of growth had accelerated to 5 9 and in august 2021 home prices were nearly 20 more expensive than they were the year before rising home prices have been a nationwide phenomenon but some markets have seen sharper increases than others at the state level many of the locations where prices have risen most rapidly are areas that had already been experiencing significant population growth including idaho arizona and utah these states were also popular destinations for people who moved during the pandemic many of whom left expensive coastal states in search of more space and more affordable cost of living housing markets at the local level show similar trends many of the counties with the highest increases in home prices were high growth locales like travis county tx austin and maricopa county az phoenix which have emerged as more affordable alternatives to more expensive cities on the coasts the list of counties with the biggest home price increases also includes many suburban counties of

the omicron variant of covid 19 threats of war in ukraine trade hassles with china suddenly soaring inflation risk of rising interest rates and as always uncertainty about next year s stock market

financial planning making financial new year resolutions resolution no 1 make a general financial plan if you don t have one list your near term goals as well as long term ones buying a home educating your kids retiring how much will each cost how soon will you need the money how do you plan to invest to pay for each goal in deciding how you will invest the size of your goals and your time frame are two key factors a third one is how much market volatility can you stomach along the way that s your risk tolerance those three factors are the keys to the types of investments you ll aim for especially in the diversified fund portion of your portfolio stocks and stock funds typically are more volatile than bonds small stocks and foreign stocks tend to take bumpier rides than large u s stocks you know how this works in the diversified section of your portfolio choose funds that reflect your goals time frame and risk tolerance see the top performing mutual funds in q4 and 2021 see ibd s stock market outlook for 2022 does your fund own any of these top performing companies of 2021 time to rebalance resolution no 2 is to rebalance your asset allocation in the mutual funds and etfs section of the portfolio in a good year some assets like large cap stocks will grow much more than say bonds so once a year see if your asset allocations still match your targets if not restore them the easiest way to do that is by shifting contributions during 2022 to the categories that have shrunk below your target weights make sure your investments are aligned with your long term

due to divorce remarriage having children having grandchildren speaking of insurance policies is your life insurance coverage still up to date resolution no 5 involves asking key insurance questions and making sure you and your loved ones are covered if you die what percentage of your income would your family need to replace and for how long cannon said are there any major debts that would burden loved ones left behind does your family have upcoming goals that need to be funded such as education for your children does your policy provide a large enough death benefit if not how much would it cost to buy what you really need and what about long term care for yourself resolution no 6 is another potential family aid make or budget for contributions to college costs for any loved ones you want to help new year resolutions pay down debt resolution no 7 pay down debt debt is a financial noose around your neck remember that fidelity poll about americans 2022 financial goals paying down debt was one of the top three goals stoddard said another top three goal and your no 8 resolution is to fund emergency savings shockingly an estimated 50 of american adults would have trouble paying for a 400 emergency expense according to the federal reserve bank of minneapolis but if you set aside just 8 a week in less than a year you ll have 400 saving 10 per week leads to a 1 000 savings balance in less than two years the top 2022 financial resolution in the fidelity poll save more that s resolution no 9 your retirement savings are a priority can t afford it you say try saving even a small amount it adds up stoddard said if you save 50 a month even with zero interest rate you ve got 600 at the end of one year after 10 years you ve got 6 000 and it s almost a slam dunk that your savings will earn some rate of return over the 20 years ended nov 30 for instance the broad stock market in the form of the s p 500 gained 9 33 per year on average according to morningstar direct if

toronto canada s main stock index ended the year up almost 22 per cent for its second straight year of double digit gains even as it ended the last day of 2021 in the red the s p tsx composite index was down 71 80 points at 21 222 84 on light trading to close the year up 21 7 per cent surging cases of covid 19 from the latest variant continued to weigh on markets with little other news of note friday said angelo kourkafas investment strategist at edward jones many stock markets around the world are closed ahead of the new year and there were no canadian or u s economic releases he said in an interview the focus really remains on the surge of the omicron variant nonetheless the tsx ended the week higher than it began kourkafas noted while capping off a historically strong year in new york the dow jones industrial average was down 59 78 points at 36 338 30 the s p 500 was down 12 55 points at 4 766 18 while the nasdaq composite was down 96 59 points at 15 644 97 looking back on the year investors have much to celebrate kourkafas said there s been a few twists and turns but the year really has given investors the best of both worlds on the upside he pointed to the strong returns the canadian index posted 62 new highs over the course of 2021 on its climb and overtook the 20 000 point milestone for the first time and even on the downside investors saw pretty infrequent and short lived pullbacks compared with typical tsx performance commodities too had a strong year which benefits the energy and mining heavy toronto exchange north american benchmark west texas intermediate crude is up more than 50 per cent on the year and has now gained for seven straight quarters the longest streak since 1983 the february crude contract was down us 1 78 to us 75 21 per barrel on friday and the february natural gas contract was up 17 cents us at us 3 73 per mmbtu the february gold contract was up us 14 50 at us 1 828 60 an ounce and the march copper contract was up 7 1 cents to us 4 46 a pound along with giving a boost to the stock market strong commodities have helped lift the canadian dollar which kourkafas said is the only advanced economy currency major currency that has actually advanced against the u s dollar this year the loonie traded for 78 88 cents us friday compared with 78 27 on dec 30 as everyone turns their sights to the new year kourkafas said there is room for optimism the pandemic continues to pose unique challenges we re still talking about record cases in many parts of the world but the economy has proven to be resilient and in our view that resiliency is going to be maintained next year he said we have strong consumer and corporate finances still low interest rates and we shouldn t forget that we haven t seen yet the full reopening of the economy so all of these things we think provide a pretty steady foundation for the bull market to continue next year that doesn t necessarily mean another year of gains over 20 per cent with returns expected to moderate volatility will also be closer to normalized levels he said usually we see on an average year three per cent and five per cent pullbacks and one 10 per cent correction we haven t seen a correction yet this year and probably that s in the cards for next year but it s the economy s demonstrated ability to weather the recurrent storms of the pandemic that market watchers should consider for 2022 he said we have seen that again and again this year we ve been through multiple waves of the virus and each successive wave has had less and less economic impact the negative impact has been lower every time consumers and corporations have in a sense adapted and learned to live with the virus so hopefully what s going on with omicron is a near term setback but that doesn t necessarily change the overall trajectory this report by the canadian press was first published dec 31 2021 companies in this story tsx gsptse tsx cadusd x the canadian press

a record number of pass holders arrive at vail resorts but a critical labor shortage and quarantined workers has delayed terrain openings and cut services alex kaufman thought it would be an amusing website something to poke fun at the largest resort operator in north america so he bought epicliftlines com for 12 last march just as vail resorts announced a plan to slash the price of its popular epic pass by 20 i thought oh this could become a thing this could be a situation said kaufman who worked in the ski industry and at resorts in new england oregon and colorado for 20 years it has become a situation the epicliftlines instagram page has grown into a nationwide vent for thousands of resort workers most of them he said employed by vail resorts which owns 34 ski areas in 14 states and canada the website gets thousands of clicks a day the epicliftlines instagram handle has more than 15 000 followers even though kaufman made only a handful of posts kaufman this fall started getting dozens of direct messages a day last week he said the account was getting a thousand every day vail resorts this year sold 2 1 million prepurchased tickets and season passes that s a 76 increase over the 2019 20 season the epic passed hordes have collided with rippling effects of the pandemic that vail resorts did not predict when it launched its season pass fire sale a pandemic triggered escalation of real estate prices has reduced the number of homes available to local workers and without workers resort community businesses are struggling vail resorts ceo kirsten lynch in a year end pep talk for employees described a global talent shortage in addition to the challenges from weather and the pandemic and said no doubt we have had to overcome much this year the labor crisis is indeed global health care travel restaurant and retail industries are limping as workers delay their return to the workplace or seek out better jobs employers across the country are struggling with post peak pandemic staffing especially as workers test positive in this latest wave of the coronavirus a report by the world travel tourism council estimated a labor shortfall of 700 000 workers in the tourism and travel industries in 2021 the problem is acute at ski resorts hosting holiday crowds right now resorts across the country are issuing pleas for patience and apologies for delayed openings one patroller at breckenridge who cannot speak on record due to vail resorts policy on talking with media said a lack of chairlift operators lift mechanics and snowcat drivers has slowed the resort s ability to open terrain sources at vail beaver creek crested butte and keystone which has only 32 of 130 runs open told the colorado sun the same thing crested butte mountain resort which has been hammered with new snow this week opened its east river chairlift on wednesday but that meant there were not enough lifties to keep the teocalli lift running the slow start to the season gave resorts more time to get terrain ready but recent storms have exposed the lack of help in lift operations it s not that there are not enough talented people there is a shortage of people who will get duped into working for 15 an hour the breckenridge patroller said of lynch s assessment this is about communities running out of cheap labor people are realizing they are worth more and their quality of life is worth more than an extra dime an hour or whatever kaufman who this week handed control of the epicliftlines com website and instagram account to a new anonymous administrator said he was shocked and saddened by the tsunami of comments he s received this month they are from staff former staff locals guests everybody touched by vail resorts has started realizing they could trust this faceless instagram handle and they started pouring their guts out kaufman said they told him how vail resorts gutted middle management positions when it slashed spending during the pandemic they showed how the company was stacking bunk beds into apartments so four workers can share a room they blasted the company s new human resources app which is replacing people and departments at all of the company s 34 north american ski areas in the outpouring kaufman said a theme emerged especially at the company s newly acquired resorts which are lagging behind nearby resorts in washington minnesota and new hampshire when it comes to opening terrain when vail resorts acquires a new resort they assimilate departments into the company s headquarters in broomfield the career types in each ski area s finance marketing and human resources departments are let go they direct all hourly workers there are tens of thousands of seasonal hourly workers supporting vail resorts to an app for all daily tasks like tracking benefits pay and covid policies they made a bet on automating everything and eliminated institutional knowledge and careers and really the culture at all these resorts in the name of efficiency and it might have worked kaufman said then a pandemic came and they have a broken hr app that does not work as they try to navigate through a quote global talent shortage the pandemic called their bet and now they don t have veterans or institutional knowledge like fred rumford a resort industry veteran whose 20 year career with vail resorts saw him directing ski schools and skier services at beaver creek keystone and vail ski areas in march he was fired from his job as director of skier services at vail in a 30 second zoom call by the time i had questions the zoom call was over and then they didn t want to talk to me anymore said rumford who is teaching part time at aspen skiing co resorts that was the part that hurt the most rumford who suspects he was fired because he was reluctant to transfer from his longtime home in vail to work at vail resorts ski areas back east keeps in close touch with his fellow colleagues they are very understaffed rumford said they streamlined management last year and let go of a lot of people and they are trying to recoup losses from last year by not hiring anyone back that has increased the workload for those remaining rumford said lift operations restaurants and ski school are severely understaffed add in covid outbreaks and the remaining employees are stretched to their limits they tried to drive the bottom line so hard they put employees last rumford said they didn t invest in their workers they found workarounds that become the standard operating procedure they don t like to reinvest unless it s showy and glitzy like chairlifts or terrain vail resorts is an easy target and always has been the company is publicly traded so all its financial statements are open for public scrutiny where every other operator like alterra mountain co powdr aspen skiing and boyne are privately held with undisclosed numbers workers at several of those companies resorts also reported challenges with fewer workers and increasing covid cases the national ski areas association estimated that 60 of u s ski areas were unable to fill all open jobs last season and early indications show the 2021 22 season has a similar share of resorts unable to fill seasonal positions a vail resorts spokeswoman said the company anticipated hiring challenges and this season raised starting wages at its larger ski areas to 15 an hour the company requires employees to be vaccinated but the rise of the omicron variant during the busy holiday season created staffing shortfalls she said but ski patrols at all resorts are fully staffed she said we profoundly understand the challenges our employees are facing after nearly two years of dealing day in and day out with the impacts of covid 19 our employees are now up against the impacts of staffing shortages in some cases having to work longer hours or in new roles said james o donnell president of the company s mountain division in an emailed statement every holiday season is busy and tiring for our teams but this has been an incredibly hard few weeks especially for those who just came off of dealing with challenging early season weather conditions aspen skiing co recently required visitors to wear masks in line for gondolas vail resorts issued the same policy this week and officials in pitkin summit san miguel and eagle counties have reinstated indoor mask policies all three resort anchored counties are reporting skyrocketing covid cases and impacts to the workforce during the holidays i think we might feel it after the holidays hiring was so hard this year but everyone seems to be rallying right now said a telluride ski patroller who is unable to talk on record per the ski area s policy for talking to reporters but i think the canceled flights and covid might be leaving us a little light on the customer side right now too vail resorts earlier this month told investors it had 1 5 billion in cash in hand and another 637 million available under debt agreements the company cut prices for season passes by 20 earlier this year the volume of sales set records with vail resorts reporting 2 1 million sales of pre purchased tickets and season passes before the resorts fully opened a 76 increase in passes sold vail resorts stock price has been in record high territory since october all of that while they are having a labor shortage i ve never seen morale so low at the resort said a longtime vail ski instructor noting how supervisors at the ski area had their pay frozen last year and annual raises were not reinstated despite the record number of passes sold working there is like having a front row seat watching vail burn from the inside the company s labor issues reach just about every state where it operates skiers from vail resorts stevens pass ski area in washington on thursday created an online petition to hold vail resorts accountable more than 11 000 people signed the petition in the first 24 hours we are disgusted with the mismanagement of the ski area the failure to treat employees well or pay them a livable wage and the failure to deliver the product we all paid for reads the petition at change org there is a clear

there are a handful of halfwheel traditions none of them have a longer history than this one ten questions started before halfwheel under a simple premise what were the 10 cigar related questions i was most interested in regarding the upcoming year since then the tradition has expanded to go from 10 questions and accompanying thoughts about those questions to now include predictions for each question that s followed up by an article 363 days later where patrick lagreid judges how well my predictions fared on each topic this year i m embracing an attitude of less is more i gave myself a 350 word limit for the body text of each question that ended up being tough with two questions but it made the article a bit more enjoyable to write alas 10 questions for 2022 1 where does substantial equivalence for cigars end up in 2022 currently the product approval part of the u s food drug administration s fda regulations of tobacco is on hold for cigars that meet certain qualifications i e pretty much every cigar sold in a humidor today except flavored cigars the basics of the convoluted story are a court order signed last august delayed that part of the regulations until after a national academy of sciences panel delivers a report to fda expected this spring and fda decides whether it should follow through with what it planned to do or do something different for premium cigars at least four different government entities the panel fda the department of justice and a federal judge must all sign off on what fda decides to do which complicates things to say the least but even that might not be the end of it thanks to an ongoing lawsuit many cigar companies have looked at this period of waiting as a green light to release new products and many have been releasing new cigars but beyond that the delay also means the cigar industry still has not gone through the most strenuous part of the regulations that were introduced in 2016 for example new products have not stopped coming out since 2016 to me the likeliest scenario is that fda ultimately decides to treat cigars like it said it would in 2016 i e just like every other tobacco product but i probably wouldn t even peg that at 50 50 odds what i do know is that whatever world comes after this is very different than the one the cigar industry has lived under for the past five years even if fda were to give the cigar industry the most favorable outcome and just drop product approval altogether seemingly the least likely scenario that s a different world than the one we live in now because it removes a large chunk of uncertainty that has persisted for the past five years i am much more interested in the effects the decision has on the cigar industry than i am the decision itself but that s too much speculation for this editorial prediction i am really torn about the prediction here particularly the timeline being the end of 2022 because i think it could be very close to the end of the year but my official prediction is substantial equivalence applications for cigars will be due in the first half of 2023 2 by the end of the year do inventory levels look like december 2019 or december 2020 the end of 2019 was not the most upbeat time for the u s focused cigar industry for reasons predicted here inventories had reached unsustainable levels across many of the retail channels in the u s and by q4 it was quite apparent that the bubble was bursting then a global pandemic happened and suddenly the supply demand issues were flipped on their heads this was due to a number of factors i d argue both a push factor because cigar factories were producing fewer cigars after february 2020 but also a noticeable pull factor because demand increased suddenly companies who routinely did not have backorder issues had backorders and those issues have persisted into most of 2021 but it seems like things have started turning a corner demand has probably cooled a bit and cigar companies are certainly shipping more cigars to the u s after talking to a number of retailers in different parts of the country it seems like the backorder issues are trending in the right direction the problem is i think the overall supply issues are heading in the wrong direction none of the issues that caused the down year in 2019 seem to be fixed the manner in which many but not all retailers make purchasing decisions remains broken in talking to manufactures i don t get the sense many retailers know how many cigars they should have let alone how many of a specific sku they should have cigar manufacturers aren t going to make fewer cigars in a world where their retailers are asking for more inventory and i don t fault them for it once the retailers are oversupplied and cut back their buying a race to the bottom exists where cigar manufacturers begin offering more and more aggressive discounts to entice retailers to purchase and since everything must roll down hill consumers end up paying the price as manufacturers offset increased manufacturing costs and lower volume with higher msrps while simultaneously offering more aggressive discounts to retailers most of which are rarely passed onto consumers at the brick and mortar level prediction from a cigar inventory level the end of 2022 will look much closer to 2019 than 2021 3 does the shortage of cuban cigars get any better by the end of 2022 my understanding of cuban cigars and the market for them is largely based on retailers who are willing to sell to overseas customers as such before i broached this subject patrick and i emailed about a dozen different people who would have a far better understanding of this than i did while many were unwilling to talk the responses we did get back paint a picture far worse than i imagined from what i can tell the supply of cuban cigars has been the worst it s been in a decade noticeably worse than any stretch of time i can remember and it seems to be a global problem obviously some countries are faring better than others but it seems there are extreme issues when it comes to the consistent availability of cuban cigars that are a robusto size or larger yes some brands are still in stock but staple cigars that were rarely if ever out of stock seem to be regularly unavailable at many stores turns out that seems to be what many distributors are seeing as well i heard about warehouses being empty and one distributor suggested this problem could persist for years plural getting information out of cuba is a tough task but if i had to guess the reasons for the shortage are numerous and include habanos s a s general inability to supply the demand for cuban cigars pre pandemic the increased demand for cigars in the post covid 19 world the aforementioned issues with workforces at cigar factories poor harvests in previous years and the increased civil unrest in cuba in 2021 side bar i d be curious to know if more cubans are entering the private sector in wake of some planned policy changes prediction there s no real reason why i think this gets much better next year but it s difficult to imagine a world where it gets much worse than this i suspect it s more or less the same though there might be slight improvements in specific areas second prediction patrick is going to hate me for making him grade this 4 does cuba s next humidor auction take place in february or september cuba s annual cigar festival the festival del habano typically takes place in february in havana the 2021 event was canceled due to covid 19 and habanos s a conducted a virtual event in may the virtual event included many of the various parts of the festival del habano new product announcements tours of factories or farms pairing events and contests with one major exception the auction while habanos s a has still not announced anything regarding the 2022 event some outlets notably cigar aficionado reported in october that the event would take place from feb 21 25 2022 a little more than a month later we started hearing rumors that the festival had been canceled despite numerous attempts over many months we have not been able to get an on the record statement from habanos s a one way or the other for its part habanos s a has not done anything publicly that would suggest it plans on holding the event in february there is still no official announcement and there s no way to register to attend the event beyond just canceling the 2022 festival we ve heard from some people that habanos s a was looking at holding a humidor auction in september the humidor auction normally takes place at the conclusion of the festival during a gala evening in 2020 six lots sold for a combined 4 27 million 4 71 million at the time with the proceeds designated to go towards funding cuba s healthcare system but beyond the money the auction also serves a number of other purposes for habanos s a it can flex its muscles a bit to show the premium prices that cuban cigars can command it s a way for habanos s a to interact with some of its best customers and there s a lot of publicity so i can understand why habanos s a wants to hold the auction even if it doesn t hold the other parts of the festival if habanos s a does what the rumors suggest and hosts the auction in september it also raises another question do we see multiple humidor auctions per year so habanos s a can generate even more auction results prediction it s not taking place in february but i expect habanos s a to hold a humidor auction at some point in the second half of 2022 if i had to guess a month i d say september i don t know anything specifically but that s what people on the internet are saying and when have people on the internet ever been wrong 5 when are these new premium cigar association initiatives going into effect also what are they after many years of many issues plaguing the industry s most notable trade organization the 2021 pca convention trade show seemed to mark a turning point in how the organization was responding to these issues there was a mea culpa and public acknowledgements that there were problems there was also talk of new initiatives some disclosed some not that the pca was planning on doing to try to not only address these issues but also to expand the usefulness of the organization it s been five months since the trade show and i can t point to anything that i ve seen that would suggest that these changes or really any notable changes are being implemented other than a gofundme campaign that launched in august no changes that i ve heard about officially or through the grapevine regarding the trade show i can t point to any new initiatives that the pca has launched in regards to its much talked about efforts to increase retailer participation on local issues and certainly nothing that would suggest the pca is doing the messaging to make sure people know about what it s doing given how much i ve written about the pca over the years i m guessing if the pca was making major changes one of my sources might have said something as i ve mentioned before the pca does more than just host a trade show and partially fund a lawsuit that lawsuit has been much more successful than many would think and the impacts of the lawsuit are benefits that are enjoyed by the full cigar ecosystem from consumers to manufacturers the pca and its fellow plaintiffs in the lawsuit have not done a great job hammering these points home particularly on a consistent basis given the issues the pca faces within the industry i d argue the messaging about what the organization is doing is almost as important as the actions themselves what s disappointing is that it seemed like the pca understood this and wanted to do something about it but instead it seems a gofundme not withstanding it s been more of the same one day after writing the above the pca published this article outlining its accomplishments from a lobbying standpoint this type of messaging is new to me and i think it should happen more often i am glad to see them publishing things like this prediction i m going to try to be optimistic and say that we ll hear a lot more about them at the 2022 pca convention trade show but i m not sure why there s any reason to believe that words have turned into actions given what s taken place in the latter half of 2021 6 how many companies are making advent calendars in 2022 we try to avoid declaring any year in the cigar industry as the year of ____ but at times it felt like 2021 was the year of samplers and there were a few that really caught my eye advent calendar samplers from oliva smoke inn and tatuaje though the latter was delayed until 2022 based on early feedback from the oliva holiday countdown calendar it seemed like sales were better than expected and strong overall given the copycat nature of this business i have to imagine we will see more companies enter into this space while i purchase a lot of cigars i m far from a normal consumer given that almost all of my buying is based on the needs of halfwheel but i still struggle to see why advent calendars at these price points make sense to me it seems like a pretty expensive advent gift and buying someone an advent calendar as a christmas gift is not something i would do but to each their own what i can say is that the two entries that went on sale this year from oliva and smoke inn were very impressive the oliva sampler ended up being a great value if you like most of what oliva sells and the quality of the packaging smoke inn used for its sampler was extremely impressive some of the best built packaging i ve seen from any company this year let alone a retailer if i was working for a cigar manufacturer and sitting in a brainstorming meeting for new products i think it would be negligent to not mention the advent calendar idea as such i suspect many companies are seriously considering doing it for next year prediction patrick set the over under on the number of companies making advent calendars in 2022 at 4 5 i will take the over 7 what will come out of eladio diaz s new factory this editorial used to be the questions i personally had heading into a new year but as time has gone on it seems the focus is more on writing about the most impactful topics for the new year and the accompanying predictions on a personal level there s no question outside of fda that i am more interested than what kind of cigars eladio diaz s new factory will be making once it opens diaz spent 35 years at tabadom holding inc the company behind davidoff s dominican factories starting at tabadom when it was still owned by henke kelner and before davidoff bought the manufacturing operation earlier this year he left davidoff his title was quality director but the more i learned about diaz i came to understand he played a major role in the company s blending what s particularly fascinating to me is that while he was tasked with developing blends for davidoff the cigars he seems to personally enjoy aren t necessarily a list of davidoff s popular sellers from what i ve been told by many close to him diaz s profile of cigars is noticeably stronger than many if not most davidoff cigars the body is usually on the richer side though the complexity is similar to what you might find in a davidoff over the years i ve had a chance to smoke some of the cigars eladio diaz makes for his birthday and those cigars certainly meet that description in a couple of weeks diaz and his family will open up their own factory tabacalera diaz cabrera the plan is to focus on client brands and i imagine diaz s expertise will be in demand but there s one major caveat diaz presumably won t be working with davidoff s extensive tobacco library i have no doubt that diaz will be able to procure many of the same tobaccos he s worked with over the years but few companies have the collection of tobaccos that davidoff boasts as someone that has been a fan of both diaz s personal cigars and the davidoffs that seem to show more of his personal style i cannot wait to begin smoking these cigars prediction cigars will come out of eladio diaz s new factory 8 how many companies stop selling flavored cigars in california by the end of 2022 last year the california legislature passed a bill that would ban the sale of most flavored tobacco products in the state there were exemptions included for a few products hookah tobacco pipe tobacco and premium cigars for cigars the bill would allow flavored large cigars to continue to be sold but they must have a wholesale price of at least 12 meaning the cigars would retail for nearly 40 given california s tobacco tax and the way retailers typically set margins while the bill was signed into law it s still not in effect because of california s unique use of direct democracy california allows for bills passed by its legislature to be overturned by voters and that s what could happen to this law in november it will be on the ballot for voters in california who will be asked whether they would like the law to take effect or be rescinded in the mean time some cities have decided to introduce their own bans on flavored tobacco some of which have passed if the law survives the ballot referendum it could go into effect as early as dec 8 2022 the timing will likely depend on two factors how quickly california certifies the vote and whether lawsuits delay implementation for a number of reasons it s going to be fascinating to see what happens in california if the law does go into effect would enough retailers adjust their margins so that these cigars remain somewhat affordable this is rather relevant as i m not sure there are very many flavored cigars that have a wholesale cost of 7 let alone 12 will some companies decide to stop selling flavored cigars in california because it s not worth the hassle for what s likely to be a huge drop in sales while california could become the first state to more or less ban flavored cigars it s not going to be the only state to seriously try and the 12 price point is also an interesting topic to follow in the court system because fda previously considered though abandoned using a price point to differentiate types of cigars prediction zero i suspect that the law won t actually be enforceable by the end of the year i don t have any polling data that would indicate whether the law will survive the referendum but there have already been lawsuits filed to overturn the law and i suspect at least one of them will be able to find a judge to issue an injunction that will at least delay implementation until after 2022 9 will fda advance plans for a federal ban on flavored tobacco in 2022 earlier this year the biden administration announced plans to ban flavored tobacco products on the federal level an april 2021 press release didn t say much in the way of specifics but did say that fda was looking at banning both menthol and the use of all flavors in cigars for those wondering flavored cigarettes were already banned except for menthol cigarettes since then little has been said publicly about the matter including whether the ban might apply to larger cigars like premium cigars which is something that was rather unclear to my sources when the announcement was made i suspect we won t hear more about this until after the senate has confirmed a permanent fda commissioner and after fda appoints a new director of its center for tobacco products there are a laundry list of other political factors that will influence what and when a decision is made and then even after fda announce its plans which is likely years away there will be inevitably be some very expensive lawsuits even if you don t smoke flavored cigars the nature of the premium cigar industry means that a ban on flavored cigars would affect you given it will have a massive impact on companies like tobacco growers retailers and many manufacturers there s also the bigger picture to think about such as how many people would lose their jobs because of this while i don t think it will have much impact in 2022 this is a major threat looming for the future of the cigar industry it s also one that might be very much out of this industry s hands as there are larger factions big tobacco swisher and its machine made competitors the anti tobacco groups who have more at stake and more money to spend on the fight than the premium cigar companies if i m certain about one thing it s that this won t be the last time a question regarding a federal flavored tobacco ban is mentioned in a ten questions editorial prediction i don t think there will be much done on this in 2022 my best guess is fda gets as far as issuing an anprm next year to get some comments which would be an early step in what s likely to be a long and contentious process towards an eventual ban 10 do the quality control issues improve in 2022 i don t need some sort of deep dive into our reviews to tell you that we ve encountered more construction issues with cigars this year than any other year since halfwheel started it s worth pointing out that halfwheel s reviews and by extension the bulk of my smoking are focused on a very narrow subset of cigars new cigars usually the first batch of those cigars that leave a factory my point is we aren t reviewing macanudo cafés arturo fuente 8 5 8s or a lot of other mainstay cigars i ll also admit i don t think the issues have affected every factory though it also doesn t seem like the uptick in issues is isolated to one country but i d argue the cigars we are smoking should have even fewer issues as they likely get more attention than the mainstay cigars as companies are going to try to make sure their new cigars are ready for their debut what concerns me the most is that the issues have been wide ranging in the types of problems and the factories affected also we ve purchased a handful of different cigars this year that shouldn t have passed even the most basic forms of quality control as for what s causing the issues i think there are two major factors first like many workplaces cigar factories are having staffing issues not only is it just being understaffed but i ve heard numerous people mention issues with turnover leading to experienced workers leaving and inexperienced people being asked to take their positions second the uptick in demand has meant that many factories have spent the past year just trying to get caught up on backorders i don t know how much of the issue is related to companies rushing cigars to the market but i don t really see a scenario where this isn t part of the problem prediction as mentioned above i think the demand for cigars is going to reduce in 2022 as such that alone is likely to mean that these issues should be alleviated particularly in the second half of the year overall

letting passengers disembark in the americas last week due to covid 19 cases on board other ships have reported outbreaks since cruising re started last summer after being shut down for over a year due to the pandemic in recent days the rate of cruises forced to alter their itineraries appears to have ticked up it has affected a small fraction of operating cruise ships and positive covid tests aren t unique to travel this month passengers who test positive during a cruise generally are required to isolate themselves in their cabins u s based cruises require masks be worn in indoor public areas recently that policy was updated to include fully vaccinated passengers being required to mask up indoors advertisement even though it is a small percentage of ships passengers being infected the cdc raised cruise travel to level 4 from level 3 on thursday it points to an increase in cases since the identification of the omicron variant since the identification of the omicron variant there has been an increase in the number of covid 19 cases among cruise passengers and crew reported to cdc additionally there has been an increase in the number of cruise ships meeting the covid 19 case threshold for cdc investigation i e yellow status on the cruise ship color status webpage cdc has temporarily extended the cso through january 15 2022 with minor modifications the cso as modified applies to foreign flagged cruise ships operating or seeking to operate in u s waters u s flagged cruise ships previously covered by the cso may continue to participate voluntarily passenger operations have now resumed on cruise ships as modified the cso aligns with current public health considerations and other factors onboard cruise ships information about the covid 19 status of ships sailing under the cso is available on cdc s website as of july 23 2021 the cso and accompanying measures such as technical instructions are nonbinding recommendations for cruise ships arriving in

washing and social distancing the cdc also recommends that passengers purchase travel insurance get fully vaccinated against covid 19 and get a covid 19 vaccine booster dose if eligible get tested with a covid 19 viral test 1 3 days before your departure even if you are fully vaccinated if you test positive isolate and do not travel get travel insurance make sure you have a plan to get care overseas in case you need it consider buying additional insurance that covers health care and emergency evacuation especially if you will be traveling to remote areas this newest guidance puts travelers in a tough spot do they go ahead and avoid losing money and use their tickets do they cancel and hope to rebook a cruise in the future people know the risks when they cruise under the best of circumstances there is a risk of people getting sick with or without a pandemic many of us think of cruise ships as floating petri dishes anyway but as far as the omicron variant goes for those who are vaccinated and boosted the symptoms are mild and don t require hospitalizations unless there are underlying complications for older cruisers it will be up to their own risk assessment the virus is here to stay just like other contagious viruses so far cruise ships operating in u s waters reported about 5 000 covid cases to the cdc between dec 15 29 in the first two weeks of december a total of 162 cases were reported so you can see how quickly the cases have spiked advertisement the cruise industry was particularly hard hit during the first year of the pandemic it was the last to resume

by ariane de vogue cnn supreme court reporter chief justice john roberts stressed the importance of the judiciary s institutional independence friday in an annual report that comes as the supreme court is considering some of the most important issues of the day and critics are seeking to dilute the court s conservative majority roberts did not directly address the term s explosive docket that includes cases on the future of roe v wade the biden administration s vaccine mandates and the expansion of gun rights but he emphasized the need to insulate the courts from what he called inappropriate political influence decisional independence is essential to due process promoting impartial decision making free from political or other extraneous influence he wrote besides his duties on the high court roberts presides over the judicial conference a body responsible for making policy regarding the administration of the courts and releases a report each new year s eve on the state of the judiciary friday s report was ostensibly aimed at matters closely related to the court s internal administration but it was carefully crafted to make clear that the court s ability to manage its own affairs is vital roberts said to safeguarding and fortifying the independence of the branch the justices are currently on their winter recess but they will return in one week to hear expedited oral arguments concerning the biden administration s attempts to impose requirements to combat the resurgence of covid 19 behind closed doors the justices are also mulling a direct challenge to roe v wade and another case that could expand the reach of second amendment protections roberts did not mention a recent study commissioned by president joe biden to explore court reform or proposals from progressives to add more members to the bench and impose term limits but he said the political branches should stay out of the court s internal workings the judiciary s power to manage its internal affairs insulates courts from inappropriate political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust in its work as a separate and co equal branch of government he said he noted that 2022 will mark the centennial of the creation of the judicial conference and said its role has never been more vital besides dealing with issues having to do with the pandemic and cybersecurity roberts highlighted other areas that he said would receive the attention of the judicial conference in the coming months they include a renewed focus on the recusal obligations of judges from cases that involve companies in which a judge may own stock roberts nodded to a wall street journal report from september detailing incidents when judges had failed to appropriately recuse themselves in violation of ethics rules let me be crystal clear roberts said the judiciary takes this matter seriously he also provided an update on inappropriate behavior in the judicial workplace a topic that had been the subject of previous reports he said that a working group consisting of judges and senior administrators had made recommendations to revise codes of conduct streamline internal procedures aimed at identifying misconduct and expand training programs roberts repeatedly referred to former president william howard taft who also served as chief justice of the united states from 1921 1930 he understood that criticism of the courts is inevitable and he lived through an era when federal courts faced strident calls for reform some warranted and some not roberts said the cnn wire 2021 cable news network inc a warnermedia company all rights reserved
