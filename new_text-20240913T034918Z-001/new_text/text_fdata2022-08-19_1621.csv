the report said that of the more than 1 300 people subjected to police use of force in 2019 and 2020 38 were black 33 were white and 20 were hispanic hartford conn connecticut released data thursday for the first time showing the race of people subjected to police use of force a reporting practice that many states are beginning to adopt in the wake of nationwide calls for more police accountability the data from 2019 and 2020 appeared to show connecticut police used force on black people at disproportionate rates compared with white people but the analysts who released the data cautioned that there were limitations in the reporting saying it was insufficient and could not be used for a comprehensive assessment the state is just the second in the country after new jersey to publicly report statewide police use of force data officials said several other states have passed similar requirements in recent years and will soon be reporting their results the changes have come in response to fatal shootings and other uses of force by police officers against black people that sparked outrage and protests across the country several cities in the u s including new york have been reporting use of force data for years the fbi has been gathering data nationally but has not yet released the raw data or analyses the connecticut report said that of the more than 1 300 people reported to have been subjected to police use of force in 2019 and 2020 38 were black 33 were white and 20 were hispanic the connecticut population is 13 black 65 non hispanic white and 18 hispanic according to u s census data analysts and police officials said comparing the use of force data to the census data was neither valid nor fair for a host of reasons the bulk of use of force reports came from police departments in the state s largest cities which have much higher minority populations said analysts in the report by the institute for municipal and regional policy at the university of connecticut ken barone associate director of the institute said it may be better to compare the use of force data with arrest data in 2019 and 2020 about 34 of people arrested in connecticut were black 44 were white and 21 were hispanic the number of use of force incidents was just 1 of the number of arrests a disparity still appears to exist in reported incidents of force involving black individuals when compared to available arrest data the report said scot x esdaile president of the state chapter of the naacp said the racial demographic data was troubling it s not something that i think i m surprised about because we see on a regular basis the heavy hand of law enforcement on black communities and we ve seen it for decades he said this kind of validates that something seriously needs to be done david mcguire executive director of the american civil liberties union of connecticut also said he found some of the data disturbing of the more than 1 300 people subjected to police use of force over the two years police reported that 31 were said to be emotionally disturbed 9 were said to be suicidal and more than 40 were said to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol the report says and about a third of the people subjected to police force was fleeing at the time it is another clear indication that there needs to be a very intentional move by government to move money out of policing and into services people need mcguire said according to the report 1 058 officers used force on 650 people in 2019 and 977 officers used force on 663 people in 2020 some incidents involved multiple officers there are about 7 250 police officers in connecticut bridgeport the state s largest city led all departments that reported data with 264 use of force incidents over the two years waterbury reported 229 incidents followed by state police with 181 new haven with 161 and hartford with 91 connecticut has more than 100 police agencies the data included incidents reported by 60 departments other agencies reported they had no use of force incidents or did not submit data the data included the use of guns stun guns pepper spray fists and physical restraining most of the uses of force were physically restraining more than 800 incidents over the two years while incidents involving deadly force and firearms totaled nearly 280 in most cases involving police drawing guns officers only displayed them and did not fire the report said in 2019 and 2020 11 people were killed by police officers deadly use of force most of the people subjected to police force were unarmed 90 in 2019 and 85 in 2020 the report said officials believe a standardized form for all departments that were rolled out in july 2022 for use of force will take care of some of the inconsistencies in reporting cheshire police chief neil dryfe president of the connecticut police chiefs association said police leaders will be closely watching future reports that include better data including race and ethnicity numbers to see if any changes in policing are warranted the big takeaway i think for me and many other chiefs is that force is used in just a small tiny fraction of police community

there s something strange in the d c air these days it smells a bit like competence seriously it has been amazing to watch the media narrative on the biden administration change just a few weeks ago president biden was portrayed as hapless on the edge of presiding over a failed presidency then came the inflation reduction act a big employment report and some good news on inflation and suddenly we re hearing a lot about his accomplishments but i still don t think the media narrative gets it quite right biden has indeed accomplished a lot in some ways more than he s getting credit for even now on the other hand america is a huge nation with a huge economy and his policies don t look as impressive when you compare them with the scale of the nation s problems furthermore at this point biden is arguably benefiting from the soft bigotry of low expectations his policy achievements are big by modern standards but they wouldn t have seemed astounding in an earlier era the era before the radicalization of the republican party made it almost impossible to pursue real solutions to real problems so what has biden accomplished as i see it he came into office with three main domestic policy goals investing in america s fraying infrastructure taking serious action against climate change and expanding the social safety net especially for families with children he got most of two and a bit of the third

rooms have been smitten with a movement of esg principles which elevate environmental social and governance issues fancy words to describe a preference for progressive policies over profits when making business decisions the movement encompasses everything from reducing their carbon footprint to expanding employee benefits lobbying legislators to using rainbow logos in june the well intentioned activism can sometimes fulfill expectations but often it causes harm instead for example at least 60 corporations responded to the dobbs v jackson women s health organization decision by expanding employee abortion benefits corporations believed woke activism would win over progressives by demonstrating that they were one of the good businesses while the pro business policies of republicans would prevent them from retaliating oh how wrong they were as major corporations have increasingly embraced esg activism conservatives have increasingly requited their animosity u s house minority leader kevin mccarthy r calif publicly broke with the u s chamber of commerce last fall saying i didn t even know it was around anymore not too long ago such a public break between republican leadership and the chamber of commerce would have been unthinkable but the era of good feelings between republicans and major corporations is no longer the american legislative exchange council a right leaning association of state legislators recommended this spring that state pension funds remove their investments from stocks associated with esg politically motivated investing by definition takes rates of return off the table explained jonathan williams chief economist for the american legislative exchange council one state this summer to begin divesting from woke funds is florida whose governor ron desantis a republican called the esg movement a type of financial fraud florida cfo jimmy patronis called esg political activism anti american anti freedom a deliberate attempt to subvert our democracy adding for years now the cult of esg economic activists has been working overtime to infuse unwanted woke ideology into the american economic system because they know their social policies wouldn t pass the sniff test from voters desantis also gained national attention earlier this year for out boxing the florida based heavyweight disney disney abandoned its brand to publicly criticize the state for passing a law protecting parental rights and childhood innocence florida republicans not only evaded the blow but landed one of their own in return stripping disney of long standing privileges to essentially act as its own government the fight ended with disney crying uncle now west virginia has opened a new chapter in the fight against woke corporations by severing state banking contracts legislators in at least 16 states have proposed legislation to follow suit state officials in kentucky oklahoma and texas are compiling lists of financial institutions that discriminate against energy companies officials in arizona arkansas florida idaho louisiana south carolina utah wyoming and north dakota are also open to taking action after briefly believing in the myth of their own invulnerability america s mega corporations are slowly waking up to the reality that alienating half of the country half of their potential market is not a sound business model after years of gratuitous opining and baseless boycotts this year corporations have grown more cautious meta facebook s rebrand shut down in office abortion discussions after the dobbs opinion leaked and netflix stood up for controversial programming targeted by trans activists could it be that these corporations are finally ashamed of their hypocritical moralizing against the free open prosperous american society while they remain simultaneously mute against the many human rights abuses of communist china you could give a c suite a conscience just as easily as you could squeeze honey from a rock no the bacchanalia of wokeness was sobered up by its own colossal failure courageous state legislators and governors in north carolina georgia alabama and elsewhere considered the apocalyptic threats of woke corporations dismissed them and did the right thing anyway this bitter medicine popped big business inflated opinion of its own power it demonstrated to it that solemnly invoking the name of democracy was not a magic stone proverbs 17 8 empowering it to override the will of the people and their elected representatives big business has really painted itself into a corner to leftists it has made promises it can t keep to conservatives those same promises are declarations of war pinched between inflation and recession and trapped in no man s land of a culture war they

home sales in the u s fall for the sixth month in a row the nar said the fall now has both realtors and homebuilders thinking the market is in a housing recession meanwhile home prices across the country still remain high compared to this time a year ago for the sixth straight month existing home sales in the u s continue to slide sales in july fell by nearly 6 compared to the previous month according to findings by the national association of realtors nar on thursday the dip equates to about 4 81 million units the nar said marking its slowest sales pace since november 2015 with the exception of the drop seen at the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic two years ago the nar said sales fell about 20 compared to july 2021 when the housing market remained hot chief economist lawrence yun of nar said in a statement that the ongoing sales decline reflects the impact of the 30 year fixed rate mortgage peaking as high as 6 in early june before settling currently into a still high 5 range compared to record low rates the past few years the latest figures further fuel a simmering debate about whether the once scorching housing market after two years is in the midst of a recession or a correction earlier this week the national association of home builders monthly survey said there s a strong consensus that there is a housing recession in terms of economic impact we are surely in a housing recession because builders are not building the nar s yun said however are homeowners in a recession absolutely not homeowners are still very comfortable financially why is it a bit cozy for homeowners the median existing home price for all housing types in july was 403 800 up about 10 8 from july 2021 364 600 as home prices increased in all four regions the nar reported that makes more than 10 years of year over year increases the longest running streak on record the nar said are we in a housing recession so why all of the talk about a housing recession well nahb chief economist robert dietz reiterated to usa today earlier this week that he and various experts still estimate that a housing shortfall in the u s ranges from 1 million to nearly 4 million homes low confidence us homebuilders say there s a housing recession sentiment falls for 8th month in a row bracing ourselves economy shrank 0 9 marking second straight contraction and stoking recession worries and while america is fighting off an economic recession generally defined as when the gross domestic product gdp declines for two straight quarters roughly a six month period the nar informally but similarly defines a housing recession as when home sales decline for six straight months nar top researcher yun said thursday that while the u s is witnessing a housing recession in terms of declining home sales and home building it s not seeing a recession in terms of home prices inventory remains tight prices continue to rise nationally with nearly 40 of homes still commanding the full list price yun said home sales may soon stabilize since mortgage rates have fallen to near 5 thereby giving an additional boost of purchasing power to home buyers possible upside buying a home how the 2022 housing market could be shifting in your favor second time around as housing cools some buyers get a second chance to grab their first choice neda navab president of brokerage operations at real estate company compass echoes a similar sentiment she said while sales have fallen to pre pandemic days there are several reasons to be optimistic the housing market hit its trough this summer and will rebound in the fall navab said more recent developments including reductions in gas prices slowing inflation stabilizing mortgage interest rates and a recovering stock market have yet to show up in stronger housing data to come persistent underlying housing demand from aging millennials and others hasn t evaporated overnight even in the face of strong headwinds this year navab said in a statement millions of hopeful buyers still want and need to buy a home for the same reasons they always have a relocation a change in lifestyle and or a need for more or less space

wolfforth when the supreme court ended the constitutional right to abortions in june destiny adams felt the country was taking a step backward so she decided to push her small west texas town a step forward to do her part adams began leaving free emergency contraception kits neatly packed in white plastic bags in the bathroom of her coffeehouse tumbleweed sage the kits which retail for up to 60 go quick adams said the first 50 were gone within a week we don t charge people or ask questions we don t take names we don t even know who grabs them adams said with the steady flow of caffeine and plan b available at tumbleweed sage adams has drawn the ire of protesters from the area s anti abortion movement to her shop some in this lubbock suburb of about 5 100 have even reported her shop to the wolfforth police department for giving away the emergency contraceptive pills the clash between the coffee shop owner and abortion opponents is the latest salvo in a long debate in the region last may lubbock became the biggest city in texas and the only one with an abortion provider to ban the practice within city limits months later texas lawmakers passed a law banning abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy the lubbock area was and is a harbinger in the debate over reproductive rights and the new epicenter might just be tumbleweed sage with abortion outlawed in the lone star state the fight in large part is turning to contraception the fault lines are familiar abortion rights activists are pushing multiple forms of contraception including plan b abortion opponents are lobbying for additional bans on the medicine lubbock led the way in curtailing abortions getting access to abortion has rarely been easy in lubbock and the nationwide debate has played out here in remarkable ways planned parenthood reopened its clinic in late 2020 after closing in 2013 due to another texas law blocking abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy the facility which is still open and offering other services is tucked away near a residential area at the end of the city s medical district at its peak it saw patients from rural areas all over west texas the texas panhandle and new mexico we saw people from all over which really stresses how important the service was here and how needed it is said angela martinez manager of the lubbock clinic then the sanctuary city vote happened and we had to go back to offering referrals and sending people out the heated debate for lubbock to become a sanctuary city for the unborn started as planned parenthood prepared to reopen its clinic in september 2020 state lawmakers representing lubbock pushed city officials to create the measure two months later the city council heard nearly six hours of public comments before unanimously voting to reject the sanctuary city ordinance most members of the council said that while they opposed abortion they had concerns about the enforcement and constitutionality of the ordinance then more than 4 500 lubbock voters signed a petition to force a special election on the issue churches in the area were vocal supporters of the ordinance and encouraged their congregations to vote in support of it vote for life signs dotted the city on the eve of the special election a banner supporting a proposed city ordinance that would ban abortions inside lubbock city limits hangs from southcrest baptist church on april 27 2021 voters approved the measure credit justin rex for the texas tribune ultimately the ordinance passed on may 1 2021 by 62 with just a quarter of registered voters 34 260 participating the sunday after the vote local pastors declared it a victory the ordinance empowered private residents to bring lawsuits against anyone who was aiding and abetting someone getting an abortion the ordinance went into effect two weeks before state lawmakers passed a similar statewide law known as senate bill 8 which effectively banned abortions statewide after six weeks of pregnancy planned parenthood provided abortion services to the lubbock region for just two months before it had to stop i think people were stunned because they had no idea the hurdles they had to go through next martinez said planned parenthood challenged the ordinance in a lawsuit but dropped the case eight months later saying it is clear we cannot depend on the courts to protect our constitutional rights terisa clark is part of the leadership team at project destiny the organization that spearheaded the lubbock ordinance according to the group a section in the ordinance makes an exception if a pregnant person s life is at risk but clark said that other than that the group wants abortion to be unthinkable while there have been a lot of victories it is still working to push for more abortion bans we will continue to do everything we can to make sure that abortion is illegal as much as we can influence that and the people in each community and each day can influence that clark said neither side is backing down lubbock s planned parenthood is still open and provides women s health services but not abortions among those services is empowerment kits which include emergency contraception pregnancy tests and condoms also included a voter registration card and information on senate bill 8 women who go to planned parenthood are still occasionally confronted by protesters serving as a reminder that the clinic is not welcome by some in conservative lubbock if planned parenthood can figure it out and be supportive of women s health and caring for women without abortion services then that s better clark said my suspicion is if they exist in a city they re probably only there to refer to the other states where they can perform abortions adams the suburban coffee shop owner faced those anti abortion protesters when she visited the clinic for a pregnancy test last year they were just there to hoot and holler to make me feel ashamed in some way adams recalled they still made me feel sick to my stomach i just thought why are these people like this in lubbock of all places despite the string of victories stretching from the voter approved ban the lubbock anti abortion movement is not finished in fact the changes in the state and by the u s supreme court over the last year have only invigorated people clark said the fight for life is not over and probably never will be over to be honest she said martinez said planned parenthood still has a lot of people reaching out to it every day for various resources so the clinic will stay in lubbock to offer support to the people in the region who need it there are needs that need to be met in lubbock martinez said so us being here is really important to the community and i know we re needed i don t see us going anywhere anytime soon destiny adams stores plan b test kits in the restroom of her tumbleweed sage coffeehouse in wolfforth credit mark rogers for the texas tribune destiny adams keeps a display of plan b test kits in her tumbleweed sage coffee shop in wolfforth tx credit mark rogers for the texas tribune first destiny adams stores plan b kits in the restroom of her tumbleweed sage coffeehouse in wolfforth last adams keeps a display of the kits in her shop credit mark rogers for the texas tribune a new fight after supreme court decision among the new fronts in the battle over reproduction rights is contraception including plan b an emergency contraceptive that can prevent pregnancy but does not cause abortions and abortion rights activists have stepped up their effort to increase access to such pills that can prevent pregnancy adams joined the fight after a friend asked her to work with jane s due process a texas based nonprofit that helps teens access abortions and reproductive health care when adams posted on tiktok for the first time that she would be distributing emergency contraception kits the video garnered attention overnight by morning protesters gathered outside the shop holding graphic photos of aborted fetuses at one point she extended a symbolic olive branch taking cold water to them in the 100 degree weather but she said they were rude and she regretted it afterwards it s ironic because my baby gets to see them now out of the womb yelling at us as we walk into our coffee shop adams said the kits made by jane s due process and distributed at adams coffee shop include two pills since the amount taken depends on the weight of the person taking it two packs of condoms a pregnancy test and a booklet of information containing resources there are more than 100 worth of products in the kits and they are possible through 17 7 million in funding for texas from the federal title x family planning program what adams is doing is legal emergency contraception is sold over the counter in stores such as walgreens and cvs and it does not require a doctor s prescription or parental consent to people over 17 years old despite this the wolfforth police department has been called several times about the kits west texans for life members linda brown and dianne peden protest outside of the tumbleweed sage coffeehouse in wolfforth credit mark rogers for the texas tribune we have received many calls and emails questioning the legality of this practice the department said in a statement unfortunately the legality of the practice is not a simple question to answer we have been researching the matter and have reached out to many state and local officials for help in determining the lawfulness of the issue adams expected the response and has even told her supporters to not send negative comments to the police because they re just doing their job the intimidation hasn t scared her and for all the attacks there has been community support we saw grandmas talking to their granddaughters about the kits we saw college aged women women my age and young mothers adams said the people that have come and asked for them seemed like they truly

major owns in indus towers india s largest mobile tower installation company said multiple people aware of the negotiations both sides have had management meetings and a formal due diligence is expected to start as the stake sale process has been revived in recent weeks the discussions are still preliminary in nature and there is no guarantee that they will translate into a transaction said people aware of the development spokespersons of cdpq and vodafone declined to comment indus towers and airtel did not respond to et s queries based on current market price vodafone s 21 stake in indus is valued at around 11 270 crore based on the tower company s 53 669 67 crore market capitalisation on thursday the stock ended the day flat at 199 15 jp morgan and citi have been mandated to find potential suitors for the vodafone stake et in its march 9 edition had reported vodafone was negotiating with american tower co and crown castle international the report also mentioned discussions with long term infrastructure investors such as brookfield and other sovereign wealth and pension funds but those talks remained inconclusive vodafone has to make up its mind this process has seen several starts and stops moreover it s an open debate if a tower company should be capitalised before the mother ship that is vodafone idea said an official privy to the discussions another person aware added that an incoming investor like cdpq may only be keen on a partial stake a final decision will evolve in the coming days if vodafone sells its residual stake in indus it would mark the british telco s exit from the passive telecom infrastructure business in india it would also be the largest deal by the canadian pension fund that has taken big bets in indian toll roads power utilities among others in the country till date any further share sale by vodafone in indus can only happen if the uk company ensures its indian jv vodafone idea will clear its payment arrears to the tower company a person aware of the discussions told et back in february and march vodafone uk had sold 7 1 in indus 2 4 via a block deal and 4 7 to bharti airtel raising around rs 3 831 crore of this it invested rs 3 375 crore in vodafone idea by subscribing to newly issued shares the proceeds were used by vi to partly settle outstanding payments to indus vi is the telecom jv between vodafone plc and india s aditya birla group earlier this month the tower company reported a 66 3 on year fall in its june quarter net profit to rs 477 3 crore stung largely by heavy receivables due from a key customer that analysts said was cash strapped vi indus s trade receivables stood at rs 6 249 6 crore in the april june period largely due to delayed payments by vi in fact the prolonged trade receivables issue prompted indus to recently take a provision for doubtful debts of rs 1 230 crore for aging receivables analysts at icici securities said indus receivables have grown by rs 420 crore in q1fy23 or 6 sequentially if adjusted for the provisioning indus towers may have to take additional provisions over the next couple of quarters as vodafone idea receivables keep increasing management mentioned that vi is currently making payments for only 50 60 of billings apart from repayments from periodic infusion from vodafone plc as part of the security package for indus towers but most of which is now exhausted said varun ahuja analyst at credit suisse our back of envelope calculations indicate that the receivables could increase by another rs 2000 2 500 crore by december 2022 until when vi has proposed to make part payments vi s latest proposal offers to make payments in full from january 2023 onwards as well as repaying the outstanding dues up to december 2022 between january 2023 and july 2023 with interest analysts though expect indus to benefit from accelerated 5g rollouts that are likely from fy24 the first wave of 5g rollouts could start from next month itself but indus executives expect the initial rollouts to be largely via loading that means operators would mount 5g network gear on existing tower sites but given that 5g sites would be bulky and require more energy solutions indus could demand higher loading charges for 5g gear compared with 3g 4g vi had recently raised another rs 436 21 crore from vodafone plc through a preferential issue of convertible warrants as part of its efforts to mop up all available funds ahead of the 5g spectrum sale bharti airtel is the largest shareholder in indus with a near 48 stake it will have right of first refusal if uk s vodafone decides to sell its 21 stake in the telecom tower company to an external investor following the merger of bharti infratel with indus towers in end 2020 canadian pension fund cppib ended up owing a 2 17 block of the merged company along with us pe fund kkr that owns 4 85 there have been reports that both are keen for an exit too

democrats justify the fbi s raid on former president donald trump s home as even handed enforcement of the law yet illegally allow many southern economic migrants into americans workplaces noted a washington post op ed we ve been hearing a lot about the rule of law lately wrote henry olsen a gop aligned moderate on the washington post s roster of mostly pro establishment op ed writers biden s look the other way immigration policy is in effect an ingenious way to avoid that rule that mocks the principle he piously says he supports he added for example attorney general merrick garland justified the fbi raid on donald trump s florida home saying on august 11 upholding the rule of law means applying the law evenly without fear or favor under my watch that is precisely what the justice department is doing all americans are entitled to the evenhanded application of the law to due process of the law and to the presumption of innocence in december the supreme court will hear arguments that biden and his deputies are willfully ignoring their obligation to detain job seeking border crossers the laws include 8 u s c 1226 c 1 1231 a 2 and 1231 a 1 a which say the attorney general shall take into custody shall detain and shall remove migrants olson s op ed is headlined biden s failed immigration policy should be a scandal he notes that the mass migration is not being treated as a scandal by the establishment despite the job impact on ordinary americans including those who oppose the labor migration this is bad for the country for a host of reasons it s bad because it does a nation no good to disrespect its own borders it s bad because as the country recovers from the pandemic allowing massive numbers of people to join the economy means legal residents will have to compete with them for jobs and it s bad because it divides our country by flagrantly ignoring the sentiments of the half or so of voters who want illegal immigration to be controlled so much for healing the nation olson argues that biden s policy has failed the huge numbers of migrants crossing the border make it clear biden s immigration policy has failed not so responded jon feere a former top enforcement official in president donald trump s border agency the biden administration s immigration policy is to allow foreigners to break our laws en masse and to that extent the administration is succeeding in their goals this massive illegal immigration we re experiencing is not something the administration is trying to avoid they ve created it they ve encouraged it and they re continuing to welcome it the biden administration would feel that they were failing if ice officers were still doing their jobs to the fullest extent possible the biden policy is viewed as a success by pro migration advocates even if voters pushed back by electing the gop to the house and senate said feere who works with the center for immigration studies for them losing an election in the short term is worth adding millions of illegal aliens they don t care about any negative fallout they aren t concerned about the public safety threat the national security threat or even the political threat in the short term nothing matters more than allowing mass illegal immigration by any means necessary to turn the united states into california in contrast he continued the gop is failing from a political standpoint they have no actual plans to oppose migration if was an actual concern for the gop the gop would have some sort of a plan to boost up the middle class he said extraction migration wall street is built on extraction migration the policy extracts human material migrants from poor countries and uses them as workers renters and consumers to shift vast wealth from ordinary people to billionaires and wall st since at least 1990 the d c establishment has extracted tens of millions of legal and illegal migrants plus temporary visa workers from poor countries to serve as workers managers consumers and renters for various u s investors and ceos this policy of labor inflation makes it difficult for ordinary americans to advance in their careers get married raise families or buy homes extraction migration slows innovation and shrinks americans productivity partly because it allows employers to boost stock prices by using cheap stoop labor instead of productivity boosting technology the flood of cheap labor tilts the economy towards low productivity jobs and has shoved at least ten million american men out of the labor force migration undermines employees workplace rights and it widens the regional wealth gaps between the democrats big coastal states and the republicans heartland and southern states an economy built on extraction migration also drains americans political clout over elites alienates young people and radicalizes americans democratic civic culture because it allows wealthy elites to ignore despairing americans at the bottom of society the economic policy is backed by progressives who wish to transform the u s from a society governed by european origin civic culture into a progressive directed empire of competitive resentful identity groups we re trying to become the first multiracial multi ethnic superpower in the world rep rohit khanna d ca told the new york times in march 2022 it will be an extraordinary achievement we will ultimately triumph he boasted the progressives colonialism like economic strategy kills many migrants it exploits the poverty of migrants and splits foreign families as it extracts human resources from poor home countries to serve wealthy u s investors this migration policy also minimizes shareholder pressure on u s companies to build up beneficial and complementary trade with people in poor countries business backed progressive advocates hide this extraction migration economic policy behind a wide variety of noble sounding explanations and theatrical border security programs progressives claim that the u s is a nation of immigrants that migration is good for migrants and that the state must renew itself by replacing populations establishment republicans and major gop donors hide the wealth shift towards investors by amplifying the conservative media coverage of border chaos welfare spending migrant crime and drugs many polls show the public wants to welcome some immigration but they also show deep and broad public opposition to labor migration and the inflow of temporary contract workers into jobs sought by young u s graduates this third rail opposition is growing anti establishment multiracial cross sex non racist class based bipartisan rational persistent and recognizes the solidarity that american citizens owe to one another
europe set for another rate hike as prices surge inflation now at a record 8 9 across the single currency area with recession looming europe s economic headache intensified last night as inflation hit 9 8 per cent in july and a leading central banker signalled the prospect of another steep interest rate hike official figures confirmed that annual price growth hit a record 8 9 per cent in the eurozone but was even higher when including eu countries outside the single currency area data published on wednesday showed uk inflation above 10 per cent for the first time in four decades inflation has been spurred on by vladimir putin s invasion of ukraine which has pushed up energy prices and is still going up in britain and europe in contrast the us where energy markets are far less connected to the whims of the kremlin has seen inflation slip back from its peak isabel schnabel a member of the european central bank s rate setting board said europe s inflation outlook had failed to improve since a surprise half percentage point interest rate hike last month she told the reuters news agency that the concerns which had motivated that hike have not been alleviated i do not think this outlook has changed fundamentally schnabel said i would not exclude that in the short run inflation is going to increase further these inflationary pressures are likely to be with us for some time they won t vanish quickly she added that it would take some time before inflation falls back to the ecb s 2 per cent target the comments implied that schnabel will argue for another half point hike in september yields on german ten year government bonds a benchmark for eurozone borrowing costs turned higher following the remarks however any appetite for rate hikes would be cooled if the closely watched purchasing managers index figures due next week point to an economic slowdown yesterday s official eurostat figures showed that inflation in the single currency area last month was largely caused by energy prices representing just over four percentage points with food alcohol and tobacco responsible for two percentage points across the eu it ranged from 6 8 per cent in france and 8 5 per cent in germany to 10 7 per cent in spain 14 2 per cent in poland and more than 20 per cent in lithuania latvia and estonia a complication for the ecb as it tries to tame inflation is that a recession is looming which could be exacerbated by rate hikes schnabel acknowledged the slowdown fears could worsen should gas supplies from russia that are already being choked off to a trickle are reduced further germany which is also suffering because of low water levels on the rhine a major industrial artery looks set to be hit the hardest but schnabel added even if we entered a recession it s quite unlikely that inflationary pressures will abate by themselves the growth slowdown is then probably not sufficient to abate inflation yesterday german chancellor olaf scholz acknowledged that soaring energy costs were a big burden for many citizens as he announced a temporary cut in vat on natural gas from 19 per cent to 7 per cent until march 2024 in the united states data showing falling unemployment claims yesterday helped allay fears that the economy is in recession that could give more leeway for its central bank the federal reserve which has already been hiking interest rates aggressively to try to tame inflation to proceed with further increases the fed is expected to raise rates by half or three quarters of a percentage point next month minutes of the fed s latest policy meeting released on wednesday showed its officials saw little evidence late last month of inflationary pressures easing

according to stefan angrick senior economist at moody s analytics on friday japan posted a lift in headline inflation to 2 6 year on year for july rising from 2 4 in june we don t expect the bank of japan to change major policy levers the fact is that there is still little evidence of a demand driven price increases most of what we re seeing is supply driven angrick told cnbc asia squawk box on friday wage growth hasn t really picked up all that much gdp that we got earlier this week showed that economies are finally back above pre covid levels of output but that s compared to q4 2019 and that s a quarter when the economy has contracted 3 he added so isn t really all that much the bank of japan can do it might tighten policy to bring down demand but demand is already weak angrick said overall we expect them to stay on hold higher gas prices take centerstage in japan s rising costs particularly as the ukraine war continues to curtail gas supplies in europe causing import pressures of lng to spill over to asia pacific however there are some signs of easing in commodity prices angrick noted while it is true that you have northeast asian gas prices picking up commodity prices more broadly seem to be coming down a little bit he said we re also seeing signs that global supply chain conditions seem to be improving bottlenecks are easing so that should help bring global inflationary pressures down a little bit but even if that s true consumer price inflation within japan certainly won t come down right away said angrick over the coming months all of these things are going to come together that s why we expect inflation to remain at the level where it is actually towards the end of the year su lin tan malaysia s strong economy may support fiscal consolidation

that prospects of a post omicron rebound for china were poor especially against a backdrop of a spiraling housing market and slow credit appetite despite policy easing more support is on its way but it will probably be too late too little to prevent output from stagnating this year and once the economy does return to growth it will be at a slower pace than in the past he said china s current economic problems would worsen if not for exports that have boomed lately evans pritchard said but there are signs that demand is now dropping due to a global economic slowdown and a reversal in the pandemic induced shift toward goods consumption he added the chinese central bank surprised this week with a 10 basis point cut to its key interest rate on monday we now expect two more 10 basis points cuts over the remainder of this year and continue to forecast a rrr cut next quarter these moves will be largely symbolic however evans pritchard said the pboc wants to reassure market participants and its political bosses in zhongnanhai that it is taking action to shore up the economy but in practice the central bank still appears reluctant to slash rates on the scale needed to

that s a quarter when the economy has contracted 3 he added so isn t really all that much the bank of japan can do it might tighten policy to bring down demand but demand is already weak angrick said overall we expect them to stay on hold higher gas prices take centerstage in japan s rising costs particularly as the ukraine war continues to curtail gas supplies in europe causing import pressures of lng to spill over to asia pacific however there are some signs of easing in commodity prices angrick noted while it is true that you have northeast asian gas prices picking up commodity prices more broadly seem to be coming down a little bit he said we re also seeing signs that global supply chain conditions seem to be improving bottlenecks are easing so that should help bring global inflationary pressures down a little bit but even if that s true consumer price inflation within japan certainly won t come down right away said angrick over the coming months all of these things are

s gdp growth citing weaker demand uncertainties stemming from zero covid policy and an energy crunch capital economics senior china economist julian evans pritchard also said in a note on thursday that prospects of a post omicron rebound for china were poor especially against a backdrop of a spiraling housing market and slow credit appetite despite policy easing more support is on its way but it will probably be too late too little to prevent output from stagnating this year and once the economy does return to growth it will be at a slower pace than in the past he said china s current economic problems would worsen if not for exports that have boomed lately evans pritchard said but there are signs that demand is now dropping due to a global economic slowdown and a reversal in the pandemic induced shift toward goods consumption he added the chinese central bank surprised this week with a 10 basis point cut to its key interest rate on monday we now expect two more 10 basis points cuts over the remainder of this year and continue to forecast a rrr cut next quarter these moves will be largely symbolic however evans pritchard said the pboc wants to reassure market participants and its political bosses in zhongnanhai that it is taking action to shore up the economy but in practice the central bank still appears reluctant to slash rates on the scale needed to make a meaningful difference to loan demand he added su lin tan cnbc pro investment pro says don t be a hero in markets market veteran nancy tengler says talk of a new bull market is premature as she

washington federal reserve fed officials agreed last month on the need to eventually dial back the pace of interest rate hikes but also wanted to gauge how their monetary tightening was working toward curbing us inflation as the stance of monetary policy tightened further it likely would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation according to minutes of the federal open market committee fomc meeting released in washington many participants remarked that in view of the constantly changing nature of the economic environment and the existence of long and variable lags in monetary policy s effect on the economy there was also a risk that the committee could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary to restore price stability the minutes showed fed officials raised their benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points at that meeting for a second straight month marking the fastest pace of tightening since the early 1980s in a battle against red hot inflation even so the s p 500 index of us stocks has risen about 9 since the july gathering fed officials will have a chance to offer fresh views on the outlook during their aug 25 to aug 27 retreat in jackson hole wyoming following the minutes release two year treasury yields and the dollar pared gains while us stocks trimmed losses swaps traders increasingly bet that the fed will boost rates by a half percentage point next month rather than three quarters of a point while the fomc minutes continue to emphasise the need to contain inflation there is also an emerging concern the fed could tighten more than necessary said christopher low chief economist at fhn financial there is an inkling of improvement on the supply side of the economy there is a bit of hope in some product prices moderating but there is still a great deal of concern about inflation and inflation expectations the language used in the minutes echoed what powell said at the press conference after the july meeting his comments ignited the move higher in stocks when he suggested that the central bank could transition to smaller rate hikes going forward even so he left the door open to another unusually large increase at the next meeting in september depending on economic data to be published in the interim a labour department report published aug 5 which showed companies added 528 000 employees to payrolls last month more than double what forecasters were expecting prompted investors to bet on a third straight 75 basis point hike when the fed meets sept 20 to sept 21 at the july meeting participants judged that a significant risk facing the committee was that elevated inflation could become entrenched if the public began to question the committee s resolve to adjust the stance of policy sufficiently according to the minutes but the department s aug 10 readout on consumer prices showed they rose 8 5 in the 12 months through july down from the 9 1 increase the month before that marked the highest inflation rate since 1981 the softer july inflation figures gave legs to the stock market rally as previous bets on a big rate hike in september were unwound and investors are now assigning similar odds to a half point or a three quarter point increase according to prices of futures contracts tied to the fed s benchmark rate august numbers on jobs and consumer prices are due out before the september meeting bloomberg

ryan breslow has had a tumultuous 2022 it s not slowing him down few outside of breslow s world even knew his name a year ago then bolt a one click checkout tech company that evolved from an earlier idea of his announced 355 million in series e funding at a reported 11 billion valuation suddenly the startup was on everyone s radar as was breslow the now 28 year old miami resident was riding so high that he couldn t help but take a kind of victory lap having struggled at one point to win over silicon valley investors he began publishing thoughts on twitter that most might never dare share publicly including to call rival stripe and famed accelerator y combinator mob bosses that will pull every power move imaginable to squash competitors while breslow found some support for his perspective online he was also criticized for the comments including by powerful investors and one week later he stepped down as the ceo of bolt and became its executive chairman breslow who still owns a major stake in bolt told us the development had nothing to do with his antics but it was hard to believe breslow s attention grabbing tweets which kept coming weren t rattling bolt s investors to some degree certainly it has been a rocky road since further funding that was reportedly in the works has not materialized the company has been accused in the press of inflating its customer metrics and overstating its tech capabilities by late may citing market conditions that have impacted the entire payments industry bolt announced it was laying off roughly one third of its employees or 250 people some of whom had taken out personal loans from the company in order to exercise their stock options meanwhile partnerships that breslow teased publicly have yet to be announced bolt employees are also reportedly frustrated that breslow sold 10 million worth of shares to investors during that series e round back in january when bolt s board had not allowed them to sell their own holdings some founders might lay low after so much blowback breslow who is both affable and cagey in conversation is instead barreling ahead with several decentralized autonomous organization dao infrastructure projects including a programmable funding protocol called juicebox he is also at work on several other startups including a people powered pharma startup called love that he co founded and which just announced 7 5 million in seed funding love aims to launch a dao where members who buy love tokens with ethereum or another reserve currency can discuss homeopathic and other pharmaceutical alternatives then vote on which of them should be tested in clinical trials the dao will then underwrite the studies the idea and it s all theoretical at this point is to take on big drug companies by copying how they work if you re thinking that it could be challenging to produce concrete clinical data about homeopathic treatments breslow argues that s precisely the point right now he says it s all stories and some scientists say some of it is bs and some say it s true so we re finally going to show people the data and let the ones who believe fund it and see if it actually works as for how love makes money off this whole process breslow says it will be purchasing some love tokens itself it will also be selectively launching different health related brands under the love umbrella if it s all fairly squishy right now human capital and mac venture capital don t seem to mind they provided love s seed round notably both firms are also investors in bolt breslow said when asked though he suggests that if there s a tie in to bolt it s that running bolt for eight years is what led him to alternative thinking about wellness according to breslow he had chronic back pain for many years that he thought was incurable because the many doctors and established medical experts he saw only made things worse pointed later to an alternative healer who introduced breslow to yoga meditation and mental therapy he says his back pain quickly disappeared even social media breslow suggests remains a therapeutic outlet for him indeed asked if he could walk back his tweets of earlier this year given all that followed he says he has no regrets says breslow i m going to continue to be fairly active on social and i think it s been a net positive in terms of increasing bolt s awareness a year ago most people that i know did not know what bolt was or is now almost everyone does

a government agency that regulates the secondary mortgage market is recommending a change in affordable multifamily housing goals for fannie mae and freddie mac for the next two years in a bid to improve affordable housing stock in north texas the need for affordable housing only continues to grow a report by the child poverty action lab found that between 2008 and 2018 there was a 42 percent decrease in units renting for less than 800 and the dallas fort worth arlington metropolitan statistical area lost more than 230 000 low rent units during that time a minimum wage worker paying the fair market value rent for a one bedroom apartment pays almost 90 percent of his income in rent the federal housing finance agency tuesday proposed a new rule for measuring the two federally backed home mortgage companies multifamily housing goals right now the freddie and fannie are required to show that out of all the multifamily properties they finance a set number of units are affordable by government standards the new rule would instead measure those goals by a percentage of each lender s annual multifamily loans while current goals call for 415 000 low income units for example the proposed rule would require 61 percent of units fall under that category a subgoal of 88 000 units for very low income units would change to 12 percent and low income small multifamily loans would have a 2 percent subgoal why would this help for one it should spur the creation of more affordable units the current rules don t actually provide any incentive for freddie or fannie to continue to acquire affordable mortgages after they ve met the benchmark number of units the new rule doesn t change any criteria on what units qualify as affordable but it does mean that as either lender continues to purchase mortgages the number of affordable units they re expected to report also increases the proposed change to the methodology will make the multifamily housing goals more responsive to market conditions fhfa director sandra thompson said this new incentive will come at a pivotal moment nationally almost 60 percent of renters say their rent has increased and 1 and 3 said they saw increases of more than 10 percent or higher a new freddie mac survey found just 38 percent of renters also saw their pay increase and a third of respondents said that their raise this year can t cover their increased rent almost 1 in 5 said they are extremely likely to miss a payment in texas there is a shortage of somewhere around 614 000 rental homes that would be affordable to extremely low income renters who make a median wage annually of 26 200 the national low income housing coalition said to afford a two bedroom home at fair market rent in texas a household would need almost 47 000 in dallas fort worth the nlic says there are almost 200 000 low income renter households and a mere 38 785 affordable and available units now that the fhfa has proposed the rule change it must allow for a 60 day public comment period if the proposed rule is adopted it will likely go into effect in january get the d brief newsletter dallas most important news stories of the week delivered to your inbox each sunday

according to stefan angrick senior economist at moody s analytics on friday japan posted a lift in headline inflation to 2 6 year on year for july rising from 2 4 in june we don t expect the bank of

friday wage growth hasn t really picked up all that much gdp that we got earlier this week showed that economies are finally back above pre covid levels of output but that s compared to q4 2019 and that s a quarter when the economy has contracted 3 he added so isn t really all that much the bank of japan can do it might tighten policy to bring down demand but demand is already weak angrick said

of lng to spill over to asia pacific however there are some signs of easing in commodity prices angrick noted while it is true that you have northeast asian gas prices picking up commodity prices more broadly seem to be coming down a little bit he said we re also seeing signs that global supply chain conditions seem to be improving bottlenecks are easing so that should help bring global inflationary pressures down a little bit but even if that s true consumer price inflation within japan certainly won t come down right away said angrick over the coming months all of these things are going to come together that s why we expect inflation to remain at the level where it is actually towards the end of the year su lin tan malaysia s strong economy may support fiscal consolidation

soleio is a software designer turned investor as a former fund manager and now angel investor he has backed some of the most successful tech startups of the last few years including figma vanta and vercel soleio has a background in design including work at facebook and dropbox where he led early design efforts i spoke to him about his experiences designing for the early web how successful technology companies approach design his involvement with figma and vercel and how a career in software design led to a career in investing soleio soleio matthew tyson as a programmer i have to admit that design is something of a dark art to me i know good design when i encounter it and i can build all of the logical structures to back it but that s it can you tell me what a developer should know about good design and how you developed a passion for it soleio sure thing i got my start over my high school summers as an intern working on an alumni magazine that job introduced me to desktop publishing the end to end process of coming up with content producing visual and written media then editing and laying it all out for print later in college i parlayed that work experience into web development thanks to a borrowed copy of macromedia dreamweaver a tool that introduced website creation to designers familiar with desktop publishing i fell in love with creating things for the internet and spent my nights and weekends teaching myself html flash and later css javascript and php my passion for design sprang from studying and reverse engineering the work of other people designing web experiences people like joshua davis and dan cederholm in particular i was fascinated with the emergence of web apps at the time it seemed that distributing software via the browser was going to be the next big phase of consumer technology after google announced gmail one of the earliest examples of this transition i decided to move to san francisco to try my hand at being an independent designer and developer tyson you did a lot of early design at facebook what was it like being part of that watershed moment for the web soleio facebook was the first social media startup to see itself primarily as a technology company as such we focused on hiring very technical people this included the early designers there all of whom wrote production code and contributed directly to building the early products our work as designers spanned the entire product development cycle from conceptualizing and prototyping early ideas through creating and coding up features we would often jump between product strategy and architecture discussions to fine tuning the visual ui design to owning core aspects of front end development to my knowledge we were the first startup to use the term product design in the context of creating software our view was that to be relevant in a fast and highly technical culture like facebook s the design team had to work closely with engineering to help everyone move faster i didn t fully appreciate how unusual that approach was back when it was far more commonplace for teams to follow a waterfall method to product development we were designers who could ship tyson after facebook you worked at dropbox kind of moving up to managing the design efforts what was your transition to management like soleio it was a choppy transition to be honest when i started at dropbox full time i was joining a startup that had already existed for four years they had a pre existing culture and approach to product development and design moreover dropbox s commercial success was a result of a very different value proposition to consumers people paid dropbox to keep their most valuable digital files safe no one wanted to hear about move fast and break things in that context neither customers nor employees this new work environment forced me to confront some long held assumptions about what drove the success of facebook s design culture and to carefully consider what we needed to foster at dropbox by comparison it also meant i needed to adapt to a team that adhered to a different set of values and sought leadership qualities that varied from what facebook rewarded i had to navigate when to discard my prior experiences and when to stick to my guns in all it was a period of rapid personal growth and development we made dropbox an attractive place for designers to join and we built an industry renowned team if i made a list of all the people who designed for that company it would contain a who s who of industry talent my experience at dropbox led me to a more general theory of what makes design teams and startups successful tyson i believe your first move into investing was with figma where you invested and acted as an advisor was that as an angel soleio my start as an investor actually began the year i left facebook shortly after my departure i was approached by a cohort of friends and colleagues who had also left the company and needed help recruiting designers for their own startups they all had the same question how did facebook do such a great job of hiring software designers naturally i had strong opinions on the matter because of all the time and energy i had put towards design recruiting in my last few years there design hiring became as critical to the company s success as product development along the way i discovered a passion for talent spotting finding exceptional designers in unexpected places and persuading them to join facebook little did i know my conversations with these new founders on how to build great design teams led to the second act of my career partnering with startups as an investor and advisor in fact dropbox was among my earliest investments advising that team eventually led to me joining full time as head of design at the end of 2012 so what about figma fast forward to 2014 i had the chance to host dylan field at dropbox headquarters for a conversation over lunch about his startup which was still in stealth dylan was introduced to me by dropbox coworker and dylan s college classmate ryan kaplan dylan brought his laptop with him to the cafeteria and walked me through some zany webgl demos before showing me the earliest prototypes for their new product a collaborative web based design editor i remember that conversation vividly because a couple of things locked into place in my head as dylan described their plans first i was personally grappling with the challenge of managing a large team that used two different tools for creating and managing design assets photoshop and the fledgling sketch app this dichotomy led to a lot of redundant and costly work second i felt that both photoshop and sketch were fundamentally single player tools and thus didn t reflect how design was actually done which is collaboratively as a team sport multiple designers often worked together in small teams on shared projects figma solved both of these problems by using the modern web browser to power a real time multiplayer experience that was more easily available to people who worked with designers in addition to the designers themselves this was a consequential idea that wasn t immediately obvious to most folks who made software i believed figma could lead a tool driven revolution that would change how startups thought about and practiced design the figma team still had a mountain of work ahead of them but their ambition and strategy were too promising to ignore i was lucky to join them as an investor and advisor later that year i helped the co founders with hiring and mentoring the early designers i also advised the team on their initial product and go to market strategies sometimes even playing the role of figma s first design evangelist my work with figma cemented how i wanted to work with startups going forward i decided to leave my full time role at dropbox and begin a new career path as a full time investor this felt like the right level of abstraction in which to have an impact on the field of design while supporting multiple teams at once tyson you are also an angel investor in vercel i am a big fan of vercel every time i deploy an app to global infrastructure with one button click i smile in amazement how did you come to work with them soleio vercel is a happy example of how startup investing is primarily a relationships profession i first met guillermo rauch when dropbox was in talks to acquire his previous startup cloudup his team came through our office for a round of interviews but it felt as though they were evaluating us as much as we were evaluating them in our first conversation guillermo and i saw that we were remarkably aligned on product philosophy and design he has impeccable taste a strong bias for action and a hacker s mindset unfortunately dropbox didn t win that acquisition but guillermo and i agreed to remain in touch and when he embarked on founding zeit now vercel a few years later i was thrilled to be one of his first angel checks i knew that guillermo was a founder who both valued design and had a principled view on how to build software from his direct experiences as a developer he s a classic example of how clear thinking is often the precursor to great design and innovation tyson startup investing is primarily a relationships profession very interesting i have to ask now what is your investing philosophy or approach how do you identify and evaluate these great businesses soleio even though i m now 10 years into this line of work i still feel as though i m very early in my practice so i reserve the right to evolve my thinking here these days i primarily care about hearing how founders think about their competitive strategy and how this strategy translates into a company roadmap it requires founders to articulate both a sizable market opportunity and potential pathways to creating and capturing the lion s share of value some investors see this as an exercise in problem finding and solution building but i see it more as an exercise in accumulating and wielding power a successful strategy can t happen at the expense of customers or business partners nor through sheer effort alone at its heart a competitive strategy must be a vision and a plan for long term value creation in a dynamic world a plan to win big that also takes full stock of one s current capabilities and position in the market i think richard rumelt said it best when he wrote a master strategist is a designer tyson this tweet is a kind of call to arms about identity design and new online communities can you expand on it is there a hint toward a web3 identity here soleio i have a working theory that more online communities would exist if people had easier access to alternative identities than their irl selves this is one of the big limiting factors for how ideas and relationships get formed today the plain fact of the matter is that much of the world s knowledge is still bound up inside closed communities increasing the number and access to online communities can have a tremendous effect on what we can learn and accomplish i see this less as a web3 development and more of a natural evolution for the internet going forward especially in the run up to spatial computing ar vr going mainstream how we present in immersive virtual worlds must look and function very differently from how we present in the real world i m excited to have backed one particular startup that has a fascinating perspective on what sort of product experience might unlock this latent opportunity i ll share more when they re ready to tyson i look forward to that thanks again soleio thankee sai

视频播放位置 下载安装flash播放器 the so called chinese debt trap is a lie made up by the united states and some other western countries to deflect responsibility and blame chinese foreign ministry spokesperson wang wenbin said on thursday their allegation against china is simply untenable wang said in response to the accusation made by u s secretary of state antony blinken during his visit to africa wang said developing countries mainly borrow from commercial and multilateral lenders according to the world bank s international debt statistics by the end of 2020 commercial and multilateral creditors accounted for 40 percent and 34 percent respectively for the public external debt of 82 low income and lower middle income countries bilateral official creditors took up 26 percent and china less than 10 percent said wang he said that in recent years developing countries have mainly borrowed their new debts from western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions according to world bank statistics between 2015 and 2020 commercial multilateral and bilateral official debts accounted for 42 percent 35 percent and 23 percent respectively of the 475 2 billion dollar new public external debt of low income and lower middle income countries most of the commercial debts or 39 percent of the total new debts are financed by sovereign bonds in the international financial market a research by eurodad on 31 key indebted countries found that 95 percent of the countries sovereign bonds were held by western financial institutions wang said he stressed that the developing countries medium to long term debt payment mainly flowed to western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions according to world bank estimates low income and lower middle income countries have to make 940 billion u s dollars worth of principal and interest repayments in the next seven years including 356 6 billion u s dollars to western commercial creditors and 273 billion u s dollars to multilateral institutions 67 percent of the total payments due only 14 percent of their total payments or 130 8 billion u s dollars will go to the chinese government and commercial institutions they will have to pay more than 300 billion u s dollars to sovereign bond holders most of which are western financial institutions who are clearly the biggest source of debt service pressure for the borrowing countries said wang he said that it is much more expensive to borrow from western commercial creditors than from china take africa as an example according to the estimates of the uk s debt justice based on world bank data the interest rates of china s official and commercial loans to african countries are lower than the interest rate of 5 percent on commercial loans from other countries they are also far lower than the interest rates of 4 10 percent on the 10 year government bonds according to the numbers disclosed by the african development bank besides the sovereign loans provided by china come with a fixed interest rate while western commercial creditors often apply fluctuating interest rate as the u s dollar enters its rate hike cycle the debtor countries are facing growing pressure on repayment wang said the spokesperson pointed out that western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions have been absent from the global debt relief and service suspension effort china has been implementing the g20 debt service suspension initiative and the biggest contributor to the effort by contrast western commercial creditors and multilateral institutions who hold the biggest share of debts claimed they need to maintain their credit rating and have thus refused to be part of the effort and failed to make proportionate contributions to relieving the debt burden of developing countries wang added when certain politicians and media in the u s and some other western countries hype up the so called chinese debt trap despite those facts their real aim is to create a narrative trap to sow discord between china and other developing countries impede their cooperation and disrupt the growth of developing countries wang said but the developing countries and people with insight from the rest of the international community will not fall for this he said
