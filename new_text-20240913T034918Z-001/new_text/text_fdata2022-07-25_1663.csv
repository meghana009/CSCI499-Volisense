a view of downtown hong kong gettyimagesbank by kim bo eun hong kong hong kong has been engulfed by a series of major events in recent years which have continuously raised questions about the city s future as an international financial center months of intense protests took place in 2019 against a now shelved extradition bill which extended into 2020 as controversy continues over the beijing backed national security law hong kong s electoral system also became subject to greater control by the mainland the covid 19 pandemic then unfolded to which the city introduced relentless measures such as flight bans and weeks of mandatory hotel quarantine upon arrival hanscom smith the u s outgoing consul general to hong kong said earlier this month the policies of the governments of beijing and hong kong have changed to the detriment of hong kong s status as a financial hub attempting to maintain hong kong s unique economic and financial systems while degrading its political institutions is not a viable strategy he said in a statement by constraining political and social freedoms china will inevitably compromise the attributes that have allowed hong kong to develop as a global services hub travel restrictions have also been placed and observed elsewhere around the world since the start of the pandemic but most of these have been lifted for the majority of countries as they seek to normalize business operations but hong kong which follows policies toward curbing virus spread similar to china s zero covid policy has maintained quarantines for arriving travelers this has exasperated the business community which continues to appeal to the government to relax the quarantine measures the measures have led to a significant outflow of the foreign workforce from hong kong reports state that 93 000 residents left the city in 2020 with another 23 000 leaving in 2021 singapore which has relaxed several of its measures has seen a rise in foreign professionals entering the city with some coming from hong kong a business confidence survey of german companies in hong kong released last month shows they are less positive about the city s business environment this year than in 2021 the figure for this year was 2 3 on a scale of one to five down from 2 8 last year the environment was gauged based on the ease of attracting overseas talent its appeal as a regional headquarters location and the political climate protesters carrying umbrellas march during a rally against the china backed national security law in causeway bay hong kong may 24 epa yonhap hong kong s financial services development council chairman laurence li recently stated the city had benefited from the tendency of businesses and people staying in hong kong due to the infrastructure developed over time and the human resources present referring to this attribute as stickiness but firms and people are increasingly willing to pay the cost of relocating if the roles and people are relocated over time they will become sticky in another place attracting them back will be an uphill task he said in a report issued earlier this month nonetheless despite the continued covid 19 quarantine for travelers as well as concerns about china s increasing influence over the city the business community has been in hong kong because of the opportunities available in china and they expect this will remain the case in the decades to come over 70 of the world s top banks have maintained solid operations in hong kong korean banks are also expanding their operations here the korea development bank kdb opened a new branch in april the state run bank s hong kong subsidiary dates back to 1986 the kdb s plan is for its subsidiary to focus on investment banking services and for its branch to mainly deal with corporate banking hong kong offers a diverse array of financial products as a private equity hub a senior kdb official said the city is becoming increasingly influenced by china but it will still serve as a gateway to the mainland he also noted that hong kong is making efforts to develop its infrastructure as a financial hub hong kong is the largest private equity hub in asia excluding mainland china the number of private equity and venture capital firms here has grown steadily with 565 firms as of 2019 up from 412 in 2015 hong kong ranked third in a global financial centers index published in march by the london based think tank z yen after new york and london hong kong continues to perform well against a wide range of the measures used in the z yen global financial centers index and its capitalization and expertise remain strong mike wardle ceo of z yen group and author of the index said in an email as for the future we would expect hong kong to continue to offer a wide range of high quality financial services and to act as a conduit for finance between china and the rest of the world so long as it retains sufficient strength in skills and human capital in z yen s survey of around 12 000 respondents in the financial sector around the world released in march hong kong was also cited as the third most desirable place to live and work after new york and london thanks to the depth and breadth of the financial sector in the city and opportunity in places with large well established markets hong kong will continue to be a global financial and business hub because of its low and relatively simple tax system and a strong and independent legal system said joseph chow a partner at hong kong based law firm wellington legal it is one of the most if not the most efficient metropolitan cities and it will continue to attract talent from all over the world the financial industry also expects hong kong to benefit from the greater bay area initiative which seeks to create a major business cluster with hong kong macau and nine cities in southern china the combined gdp of the 11 cities is 1 6 trillion which compares with the gdp of south korea cross border initiatives have been taken to enable investors based in the mainland hong kong and elsewhere around the world to trade in stocks and exchange traded funds listed in shanghai shenzhen and hong

eric gay ap saul loeb getty images the threat of higher taxes on corporations wealth taxes and windfall profits taxes would diminish investment stimulus payments extended and super sized unemployment benefits student loan payment suspensions and eviction moratoriums not only increased consumer spending but bit into the incentive to work diminishing the labor supply by decreasing the opportunity cost of choosing leisure or activism over a paying occupation the possibility of lifting tariffs would discourage the reshoring of manufacturing leaving the u s economy vulnerable to supply constraints from abroad prospective spending contributes to inflation by shifting expectations about the availability and pricing of resources labor and goods arrowly based extreme price surges often reflect supply demand imbalances that can potentially affect prices for a broader range of goods and services while these imbalances initially show up in pce components with more flexible faster moving prices they eventually bleed into more moderate increases in a broader range of slower moving prices tom williams getty images getty images g k chesterton once said that he owed his success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice and then doing the exact opposite this is how we have felt over the past year and half while the vast majority of establishment economists consistently were wrong about inflation they forecast that inflation would stay mild that it would stay confined to a few things related to passing shortages and the reopening that it would prove transitory and that it had peaked there were of course some establishment types who got things right and plenty of heterodox economists especially on the left who were as wrong as the establishment types all thoroughly establishment and left of center than the rest of the establishment including federal reserve and biden administration officials were forecasting how exactly did we get it right the answer is not as complicated as many of those who are now re assessing their errors suspect when the biden administration took office from its height of 14 7 percent in april 2020 to 6 4 percent in january of 2021 maybe in the history of the world there were 7 9 million job vacancies in march of 2021 one of the reasons for this boom was thefrom a deep and lasting recession that would likely have otherwise gripped the nation on the coattails of the pandemic the trump administration together with allies on capitol hill crafted a plan that was heavily criticized before and during its deployment but was also highly effective by keeping interest rates low and providing an immense amount of liquidity to credit markets which filtered through to broader financial markets and the real economy we supported the rescue efforts of 2020 indeed we were advocates for something like the plan that was adopted early in 2020 even before it was announced we argued thatbecause so much of the economic pain was the result of measures undertaken to protect public health when you ask people to stay home to close their businesses to school their children at home for the sake of the public good it is imperative that you compensate them for their sacrifices that is what the u s did so effectively in 2020 the trouble set in when the biden administration decided that it needed to make its mark on the pandemic response bythe economy very simply did not need the additional deficit spending the time for stimulus had passed in which supply chains could be unsnarled consumer spending could peaceably migrate back toward a more typical balance of goods and services and production allowed to catch up with demand if the biden administration did not enact a rescue plan history would show that it was the trump administration that had rescued the american economy this was not an acceptable outcome for a political party and its establishment media arm that had insisted that trump had badly damaged the economy with his allegedly bungled response to the pandemic the argument from summers and blanchard against the rescue plan was mainstream keynesian they argued that the additional spending was too large and that if it had a normal sized fiscal multiplier it would overheat the economy this was right as far as it went but our analysis went further from our point of view that had declared war on fossil fuels this would cause fuel shortages and drive up energy prices hurting production what s more it was not just the spending in the american rescue plan that the biden administration was pushing there wasmore spending was looming as far as the eye could see fed officials insisted that inflation was transitory and would likely remain confined to a relatively narrow part of the economy positions that were adopted by the biden administration whole cloth making matters worse the fed began to announce that it was now applyingto its maximum employment goal it was not enough for unemployment to fall the fed said it now would work to reduce racial gaps in unemployment this was an incredible undertaking because although it did narrow dramatically during the pre pandemic trump era in effect the fed was saying it would let inflation run hot until it had squeezed systemic racism out of the unemployment rate one of the most frustrating things aboutis that there was good economic research from the federal reserve bank of dallas no less suggesting exactly the opposite in an article we published in august of 2021 we pointed to a recently published piece by a team of economists at the dallas fed that explained which is exactly what happened we were encouraged in our confidence that inflation would not fade by the insistence of the biden administration and fed officials that it would this was undermining public confidence that the political fiscal and monetary authorities would act to tame inflation contributing to even more inflation hyman minsky taught us long ago he pointed out that when people are optimistic about the present economic outlook they tend to increase spending borrowing and investment to such an extent that the economy becomes fragile risk laden and eventually panic ensues for fiscal and monetary authorities a similar rule applies stable prices breed inflation this is because the stability encourages policymakers to ignore the risks form narratives explaining away signs of inflation and refuse to recognize disastrous price instability until it s too late we do not mean to claim too much credit the point after all is not to bruise our own backs with self congratulatory pats but to explain to our readers why we were right where so many others were wrong as we noted there were others who saw inflation coming in addition richard curtin the long running and recently retired guru of the university of michigan survey of consumers warned month after month that consumer sentiment risked tipping into an inflationary beast mode wherethat behavior of course contributes to inflation becoming a self fulfilling prophecy now it looks as if the economy is heading towardas consumers pull back on discretionary spending due to the high cost of living this too was something we saw coming early when we noticed that many apparent indicators of expansion were nothing of the sort this was at first confined to a narrow group of products especially household goods and discretionary or even luxury items that had been the focus of intense spending throughout the pandemic like inflation it has spread from narrow to broad andthis too we had been warned about by professor curtin who repeatedly forecast that eventually consumers would balk at high prices and pull back from spending initiating a contraction chesterton got it right and by following his example so did we
the industrial sector is just a leadership shakeup away from having one of the highest rates of female chief executive officers ceo in the s p 500 before you get too excited the numbers are still small there are 69 industrial companies on the benchmark index and as of the beginning of the year four of them had female ceos according to data compiled by bloomberg but cummins inc announced on july 14 that jennifer rumsey the company s president and chief operating officer will take over as ceo from tom linebarger on aug 1 rumsey will be the first female ceo at the columbus indiana based maker of truck engines and power generation equipment and only the seventh leader of the company in its more than 100 year history another industrial stalwart may soon follow cummins example trucking company jb hunt transport services inc announced this week that longtime ceo john roberts iii will hand the title of president to chief commercial officer shelley simpson on aug 1 that likely makes simpson the heir apparent for the ceo job too bloomberg intelligence analyst lee klaskow wrote in a note the number of industrial female ceos is rising with rumsey set to assume the top job at cummins should simpson eventually become jb hunt s ceo and no existing women leaders hand over the baton to men before then the percentage of industrial female executives on the s p 500 would rise to about 9 putting the sector just behind financials in terms of gender diversity that s not a herculean ratio by any stretch but it still represents a meaningful step forward for an industry that has long nursed a reputation for being a boys club that s less progressive than other corners of the economy for context only about 5 of the technology companies on the s p 500 as defined by bloomberg have female executives the culture and the diversity within cummins is one of our strengths i don t always experience that same level of diversity when i go out to other companies it still happens sometimes at cummins and more times outside of cummins where i look around the meeting or a dinner and i m the only woman rumsey said in an interview customers and suppliers often want to talk about how do you do that at cummins one thing that is important is that you can look up to the top of the company and see people that look like you and believe you can advance rumsey has a background in engineering and previously served as cummins chief technical officer it was actually the cummins executive whom she succeeded in that post in 2015 john wall who encouraged her to pursue a career in engineering in the first place she said rumsey grew up in columbus indiana where cummins was founded and got to know wall through her church she showed math and science skills in high school and wall pushed me to think about this opportunity rumsey said there s a lot you can do with an engineering degree indeed these days a lot of engineering experts gravitate toward software or hot shot startups rumsey briefly worked for a fuel cell company after getting a master s degree in mechanical engineering from the massachusetts institute of technology but she found a home in the industrial sector early in her career joining cummins in 2000 i need to know what i m working on makes a difference to people in the world she said it s somewhat unusual for industrial companies to pluck ceo candidates from the engineering ranks most tend to go the business school route but rumsey s technical background is exactly what cummins needs right now as the company pivots from its legacy as a maker of diesel engines and plots its role in the energy transition rumsey co developed cummins destination zero initiative with departing ceo linebarger the strategy calls for a dual pronged approach to decarbonisation reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the internal combustion systems that will likely still dominate commercial and industrial applications over the near term while also investing in next generation renewable technologies that lack the infrastructure and economics to be viable options now but are essential to combating climate change over the long term investors tend to give established manufacturers like cummins less credit for decarbonisation initiatives than high profile startups and companies like tesla the stock has traded in line with broader benchmarks over the past year cummins has used a string of acquisitions in recent years to help it diversify into greener technologies including the 2017 purchase of battery pack maker brammo inc and the 2019 takeover of hydrogen fuel cell company hydrogenics corp most recently cummins acquired jacobs vehicle systems a supplier of engine braking and thermal management technologies from altra industrial motion corp for us 325mil rm1 4bil earlier this year it announced a us 3 7bil rm16 5bil purchase of meritor inc a maker of axle and brakes that will help the company offer a more complete suite of products for electric and hybrid vehicles bloomberg brooke sutherland is a bloomberg opinion columnist covering deals and industrial companies the views expressed here are the writer s own

commentary new york it s rare that one would find socialist sen bernie sanders i vt and conservative fox news commentator steve moore on the same side of an issue let alone legislation but the chips bill expected to go before the senate next week is just such an instance i happily oppose both of them though moore more so than sanders the creating helpful incentives to produce semiconductors for america act or the chips for america act hr 7178 provides a wide variety of incentives and grants to support domestic chip production innovation and expertise see this link for specific details the congressional budget office cbo has scored the cost of the bill at 79 billion over nine years to 2031 sanders sees the bill as corporate welfare largely for intel texas instruments micron technology global foundries and samsung and is demanding that the chip manufacturers give the united states an equity stake in their companies in exchange for taxpayer support abstain from stock buy backs not outsource their work overseas stick with their existing collective bargaining agreements and remain neutral in union organizing efforts as what former sen rick santorum once dubbed a blue collar conservative there s not much in sanders position with which i take issue perhaps his requirement that the company remain neutral in union organizing efforts to the extent allowed by law i think companies have a right to present the case as to why their workers should not be unionized so that they can make an informed decision but other than that they seem reasonable and lest you doubt my own conservative bona fides my liberal friends think i make steve bannon seem like mr rogers moore s opposition is more generalized and more ideological like most conservatives who came of age in the 1970s and 80s he has a libertarian bent so he is opposed to government support of private companies it s a view he shares with sanders who says it socializes all the risk and privatizes all the profits sanders called such subsidies crony capitalism in a recent press release but both of them are wrong for different reasons particularly moore moore s view is wrong as is most economics that is borne of blind fealty to ideological dogma while it is taboo among my fellow conservatives to choose winners and losers in the economy that seems to be the case only when one reaches the pinnacle of politics in the national arena i say that because virtually every republican governor who has sought the presidency in my lifetime has engaged in some form of what economists call industrial policy industrial policy as defined by the oecd is any type of selective government intervention or policy that attempts to alter the structure of production in favour sic of sectors that are expected to offer better prospects for economic growth in a way that would not occur in the absence of such intervention in the market equilibrium did your governor cum presidential hopeful sign over an abandoned factory for 1 to a manufacturer who promised to make it productive again or engage in payment in lieu of taxes or a pilot agreement to subsidize a new commercial development then he or she engaged in industrial policy even republican presidential flavor of the month gov ron desantis does industrial policy but if desantis gets on the 2024 presidential campaign trail you can probably bet your next month s rent or mortgage payment that he will loudly condemn picking winners and losers at some point on the campaign trail ditto that with former south carolina gov nikki haley another of the wannabe republican nominees for president she s voiced her opposition to the chips bill as that evil picking winners and losers industrial policy that real conservatives are supposed to eschew like the black death and sure enough to signal to the conservative republican base haley resigned from the boeing board of directors in 2020 to prove her conservative bona fides because her colleagues on the board all voted to receive federal government funding to help boeing get past the pandemic i had to chuckle at haley s move a bit because there would be no boeing if it were not for u s industrial policy the reason that boeing even exists and that boeing has led the world in the production of commercial jetliners is because it developed the first commercially viable jetliner the legendary boeing 707 but the 707 was built on the airframe of the boeing kc 135 stratotanker the flying gas station of the u s air force after it adopted the practice of mid air refueling of other aircraft in the 1950s the industrial policy that created boeing continues even to this today with the boeing 767 shown in this link being built on the same airframe as the kc 45 pegasus tanker shown in this one boeing kc 135 stratotanker at kandahar international airport in 2019 via wikimedia commons shown here with an engine upgrade it is indistinguishable from the legendary boeing 707 shown in this link here with its original 1950 60 s era engine configuration in the civilian sphere patent no us6799176b1 described as a method for scoring documents in a linked database was funded by a national science foundation government grant you know it better as google the internet itself was derived from a program of the defense advanced research projects agency darpa and even before that in the earliest days of the nation the government was picking winners and losers while congress shelved hamilton s report on manufactures when he presented it in 1791 it enacted the tariffs he recommended just six months later everything from the telegraph to the trans continental railroad would come from the government picking winners and losers our course politics and business can breed if not corruption then at least the appearance of it and certainly the opportunity for it that s been proven from the teapot dome scandal to the solyndra scandal of the obama administration so it s a prerequisite that government funding or incentives of private businesses be thoroughly transparent with detailed reporting of expenditures in an online checkbook as well as stringent and continuous oversight frequent audits and other tools to ensure money is not being wasted the chips bill is a necessary element in maintaining both our national defense and our economic security it should not be thwarted by libertarian dogma that in many instances is simply wrong chips today are as critical to maintaining a resilient national defense infrastructure as ball bearings were to the greatest generation s defense infrastructure in world war ii not only must there be a source of supply here in the united states but we must innovate and maintain it including legacy chips for our older defense systems fun fact while it s been overhauled and upgraded the boeing b 52 will have been a critical element of the u s defense arsenal for 75 years by the end of this decade and all that is to say nothing of the chips we use for our cars our computers our major appliances and internet infrastructure they are what the logistics and supply chain experts call mission critical what you want done cannot get done without chips and a ready supply of them i speak from experience when our old dishwasher broke down in october but was still under warranty we were told the chip to fix it would not be available until february february an important word re shoring u s chip manufacturing might be misinterpreted by china as our stepping back from taiwan because taiwan s chips are so critical to our economy it could send a dangerous and unintended message to beijing and the belligerent elements of the chinese communist party it should not and congress and the president should ensure that it doesn t to make that clear to all the world simultaneous with the signing of the chips bill president joe biden should announce clearly and unequivocally and surrounded by the leadership of both houses of congress as well as the ambassadors of australia india japan and south korea that we have abandoned our policy of strategic ambiguity with respect to taiwan in favor of strategic certainty that the united states will fully defend taiwan from chinese aggression particularly invasion and that any attempt to quarantine blockade the island by the chinese navy or interfere with taiwan s airspace will be treated by the united states as an act of war upon both taiwan and the united states to back it up further we should offer an additional sale of weaponry to taiwan to defend itself and schedule joint exercises with the quad japan australia india and us to protect the straits of taiwan taiwan represents so much more for the united states than being the world s biggest chip manufacturer it is an issue for our defense of the freedom of the seas and support for refugee populations fleeing persecution by nations hostile to american interests the very reason taiwan came to be after the communist takeover in

quick takes from around the market philippine national bank updated shareholders on the property dividend of shares in its property owning subsidiary pnb holdings corporation only to say that the dividend will be given once the relevant approvals and permits are received kind of a non update and must be frustrating to shareholders that have been waiting for this liquidity event for a year now ac energy amended its articles of incorporation to remove any references to oil exploration mining and related activities both because acen doesn t participate in these industries but more importantly because removing these potential activities places acen outside of the rule that caps foreign ownership as acen says making this change an increase in foreign equity participation in the company s business this is good for shareholders as it increases the potential market for acen shares in theory the more people that can buy a stock the higher its price oh and they ve also officially changed their name to acen corp and that change will take effect on july 29 now corp signed a memorandum of understanding with the philippine based subsidiary of an american cell tower provider for the roll out of 5g cell towers now notes that the companies are still just negotiating the lease terms for the build to suit sites towers and passive telecommunications infrastructure and facilities with a change in president and a change in leadership at the department of information and communications could now be in a position to actually make good on its plans to become a viable 4th national telco as now notes it is only one of four companies that has a cellular mobile license bdo leasing and finance board of directors voted to approve a name change to dominion holdings inc to align with the sy family s wish to convert the shell company into a holding company now just change that clumsy ticker symbol i feel like this group has it in their dna to just name it something boring like dhi but it might be interesting to see something spicier like dmnin or domho haha on second thought this might be one of those times to stick with the boring legal name initialism merkado barkada is a free daily newsletter on the pse investing and business in the philippines you can subscribe to the newsletter or follow on twitter to receive the full daily updates merkado barkada s opinions are provided for informational purposes only and should not be considered a recommendation to buy or sell any particular stock these daily articles are not updated with new information so each investor must do his or her own due diligence before trading as the facts and figures in each particular article may have changed
the who has declared monkeypox a public health emergency of international concern a case of monkeypox has now been reported in delhi that does not have an international travel history is it a community spread how can you protect yourself from this infectious disease origin monkeypox is not a novel disease it was first isolated in the late 1950s from a colony of monkeys the virus is in the same genus as variola causative agent of smallpox and vaccinia viruses the virus used in one of the available smallpox vaccines it gets its name from a 1958 outbreak among a group of laboratory test monkeys inside a research facility in copenhagen denmark advertisement zoonotic disease how does it spread there is a significant role of animals in the spread of monkeypox man and monkeys are both accidental hosts and wild rodents are usually seen harbouring this virus the strain isolated from west africa appears to be less virulent than the one from central africa it s clad 2 i e west african strain is spreading all over world said dr dhiren gupta intensivist and senior consultant at sir gangaram hospital prolonged contact with animals monkeys squirrels wild rodents or animal meat wild animals or close contact with infected persons primarily it doesn t spread via air but if someone is in close contact with the infected patient 3 hours within 2 meters can get infection via large droplets secondary attack rates are around 7 percent it s less infective than smallpox and chickenpox who is at high risk of contacting monkeypox men most cases of monkeypox have been seen in men lgbtq men who have sex with men and the lgbtq community have been flagged by the who healthcare workers prolonged and close exposure to treating the patient could lead to spread through droplets to skin contact as well immunocompromised people people with prolonged health complications it is a sexually transmitted disease std only the who pointed out for the moment this is an outbreak that is concentrated among men who have sex with men especially those with multiple sexual partners dr tedros added it s therefore essential that all countries work closely with communities of men who have sex with men to design deliver effective information services and to adopt measures that protect both the health human rights dignity of affected communities but is it an std health experts and epidemiologists disagree we have not generated evidence to say that it is only an std or spreads through the sexually transmitted disease modes of sexual contact only it is not like hiv we can t categorise it explicitly as hiv only but these men are in close contact with each other there are other modes of spread such as unsafe and unchecked blood transfusions also said dr sanjay rai professor community medicine aiims dr rai is also a national trainer on hiv aids counselling and sexually transmitted infection sti for naco ministry of health and family welfare govt of india since 1997 and 2008 advertisement the categorisation of patients of high risk status has been given to men who have sex with men but that is not the case anyone can get monkeypox if they come in contact with those who have these skin regions up until scabs are formed and a normal skin comes back said dr giridhar babu professor and head life course epidemiology at public health foundation of india dr gupta explains the stages of symptoms prodromal phase typically lasts up to five days is characterised by fever intense headache lymphadenopathy back pain myalgia and severe fatigue swelling of the lymph nodes may be generalised involving many different locations on the body or localised to several areas rash the skin eruption usually begins within one to four days of appearance of fever and continues for a period of two to three weeks although rashes without a prodrome have been reported rash is painful to start with but becomes itchy the rash typically begins as 2 to 5 mm diameter macules macules subsequently evolve to papules vesicles and then pustules advertisement lesions are well circumscribed deep seated and often develop umbilication a central depression on the top of the lesion this could begin from the face then go to the palm of the hands and soles of the feet multiple nonspecific laboratory findings can be seen in patients with monkeypox these include abnormal aminotransferases leukocytosis thrombocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia what to do when you come in contact with monkeypox a smallpox vaccination if given within 4 days can prevent disease although vaccination can be considered for up to 14 days of exposure if given between days 4 and 14 vaccination is thought to reduce the symptoms of disease but not prevent the disease said dr gupta indicated treatment suggests those with severe disease and those at risk for severe disease eg those younger than 8 years of age pregnant or breastfeeding women patients with complications of the infection immunocompromised patients at this time tecovirimat is the treatment of choice although some experts may suggest dual therapy with tecovirimat and cidofovir in patients with severe disease says dr gupta however experts also say few people require active intervention through medical treatment in younger people how can you prevent the spread advertisement isolate yourself to room for three weeks till all lesions scab and fall incubation period the incubation period of monkeypox virus infection is usually from 5 to 13 days but can range from 4 to 21 days fastest rate of spread in last 50 years initially this year 3040 cases of monkeypox had been reported to who from 47 countries since then the outbreak has continued to grow and there are now more than 16 thousand reported cases from 75 countries and territories and five deaths said dr tedros ever since the first human case was detected in 1970 in republic of congo experts have not seen it spread at a rate in the last 50 years since it was found the first time this disease was reported in human beings in 1970s in the republic of congo there were outbreaks in many african countries in 2003 an outbreak was seen in the us also but the transmission of zoonotic diseases has increased in the past few years whether it is covid19 or any other we need to conduct further investigations it could be because animal and human contact has increased meat consumption of incomplete and uncooked food said dr sanjay rai once it is in the community within a country then the travel history is of no relevance traveller history is not an important criteria there have been guidelines issued by indian government said dr giridhar babu vaccines against monkeypox there are two available vaccines that can reduce the risk of developing monkeypox the modified vaccinia ankara mva vaccine jynneos in the united states imvanex in the european union and imvamune in canada and acam2000 vaccine the small pox vaccine only provides 82 85 protection against monkeypox even anti viral that has been recommended has no proven efficacy said dr rai vaccines are also not free of complications the vaccines are also known to have serious side effects they are not to be used randomly said dr babu india could need to stockpile these vaccines for any impending emergency in the future indian vaccine stockpile for smallpox was abandoned after the eradication of smallpox we need a renewed focus on having vaccine stocks he said no need to panic low mortality rate monkeypox is a self limiting disease with low mortality doesn t leads to scarring unless immunocompromised said dr gupta adding those who were born before 1977 likely to have received smallpox vaccination and should offer some protection dr rai also points out over the years the rate of mortality has been low a person s immunity is reduced 0 10 deaths are reported in the last many years in africa recently 3 deaths have ben reported in africa he said

it looks like we are going to get official confirmation that a recession has already begun when the gdp number for the second quarter comes out later this week but that isn t what we should be focusing on yes things weren t great during the first half of 2022 but they are going to be significantly worse during the second half small businesses are starting to fail all over the country a housing crash of potentially epic proportions has started layoffs are on the rise from coast to coast and economic activity is really slowing down all around us so if you think that things are bad now just wait because they will soon be a whole lot more painful in recent days we have gotten more new numbers which seem to confirm that a major economic slowdown is upon us the following are 14 signs that the u s economy is poised to crash really hard during the second half of 2022 1 one survey that was just released discovered that 35 percent of all small business owners in the u s could not pay their rent in full or on time in june 2 a different survey found that 51 percent of all small businesses owners in the u s believe that rising prices could force them to close their businesses within the next six months 3 it is being reported that 45 percent of all small businesses in the u s have already decided to freeze the hiring of new workers 4 sales of previously owned homes dropped 5 4 percent during the month of june that is now the fifth month in a row that we have seen a decline 5 in three fourths of the metro areas that redfin tracks at least 25 percent of home sellers reduced their asking price during the month of june 6 blackstone has prepared a war chest of 50 billion dollars so that it can scoop up depressed real estate all over the country after housing prices have crashed in the months ahead 7 the number of americans applying for jobless benefits has risen to the highest level in eight months 8 employment postings for software development jobs have dropped off by more than 12 percent during the past four weeks 9 the conference board s index of leading economic indicators has now fallen for four months in a row 10 the s p global flash u s pmi composite output index just went negative for the very first time since the last recession 11 the latest number for the philadelphia fed manufacturing index came in at 12 3 and that was much worse than what most experts were anticipating any reading below zero indicates contraction and needless to say this reading was way below zero 12 inflation continues to rage out of control even as economic activity in the u s significantly slows down if you can believe it the average price of a used vehicle in the united states has now risen to a whopping 33 341 13 the atlanta fed is now projecting that u s economic growth for the second quarter will come in at 1 6 percent if it is ultimately confirmed that the u s economy has already been contracting for two quarters in a row that would mean that we are officially in a recession right now 14 thanks in part to the rapidly tanking economy joe biden s approval rating has plunged all the way down to 31 percent at this point even the tech giants are extremely concerned about what is coming for years nothing could seem to quash the relentless optimism of the big tech companies and their stocks soared to absolutely absurd heights but now everything has changed as we head into the second half of this year the following comes from the washington post big tech is bracing for an economic recession and an uncertain future that in turn is triggering more economic angst the biggest tech firms most of whom report quarterly earnings next week have offered recent hints they are hunkering down news of layoffs and hiring slowdowns have become commonplace across silicon valley start ups are saying capital is drying up workers are being put on notice that businesses are changing i don t remember ever seeing such pessimism from silicon valley incredibly even the biden administration is admitting that the economy is slowing down but janet yellen insists that what we are witnessing is quite appropriate for a healthy economy treasury secretary janet yellen acknowledged sunday that the u s is experiencing an economic slowdown but downplayed the potential for a recession arguing that the country is in a period of transition following rapid economic growth the economy is slowing down yellen said on nbc news meet the press adding that a correction is appropriate for a healthy economy you can believe her if you want but she also told us that inflation would be transitory and we can all see how that prediction turned out even though we are still only in the early stages of this new recession lines are already getting really long at food banks all over the nation the cost of living continues to soar to unprecedented heights and this is hitting the poor harder than anyone in the months ahead we should expect to see a tsunami of layoffs stunning declines in housing prices hordes of small businesses going under and a tremendous spike in the number of bankruptcies needless to say all of this will not be good for the financial markets either the stage is clearly set for the sort of historic economic meltdown that i have been warning about for a long time and the pain that our society will experience will be extremely severe i hope that you are using this summer to get prepared for the difficult times that are ahead of us the remainder of 2022 is not going to be pleasant and 2023 is going to be even worse

a fragment of a rocket from a multiple rocket launcher is seen embedded in the ground on a wheat field in the ukrainian kharkiv region on july 19 2022 amid russian invasion of ukraine afp photo a fragment of a rocket from a multiple rocket launcher is seen embedded in the ground on a wheat field in the ukrainian kharkiv region on july 19 2022 amid russian invasion of ukraine afp photo menafn jordan times kyiv russian missiles hit ukraine s port of odessa saturday in what kyiv called a spit in the face of a day old deal between the warring sides to resume cereal exports blocked by the conflict the ukrainian military said its air defences had shot down two cruise missiles but two more hit the port threatening the landmark agreement hammered out over months of negotiations aimed at relieving a global food crisis the ukrainian foreign ministry spokesman said the strike was a spit in the face by russian leader vladimir putin against the deal brokered by turkish president recep tayyip erdogan and united nations chief antonio guterres ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky claimed the strikes on odessa showed moscow could not keep its promises this proves only one thing no matter what russia says and promises it will find ways not to implement it he said during a meeting with us lawmakers according to a statement from the presidency odessa is one of three export hubs designated in the agreement and ukrainian officials said grain was being stored in the port at the time of the strike although the food stocks did not appear to have been hit guterres who presided over the signing ceremony on friday unequivocally condemned the attack his deputy spokesman said and urged all sides stick to the deal these products are desperately needed to address the global food crisis and ease the suffering of millions of people in need around the globe he said the eu s foreign policy chief josep borrell directly blamed russia for the strikes striking a target crucial for grain export a day after the signature of istanbul agreements is particularly reprehensible and again demonstrates russia s total disregard for international law and commitments he said there was no official comment from moscow but turkish defence minister huluski akar said russia had denied carrying out the attack the russians told us that they had absolutely nothing to do with this attack and they were looking into the issue very closely akar said in comments to state news agency anadolu we will continue to fulfil our responsibilities under the agreement we reached yesterday he added 20 million tonnes of wheat the first major accord between the countries since the february invasion of ukraine aims to ease the acute hunger that the united nations says faces an additional 47 million people because of the war hostility between moscow and kyiv spilled over into friday s signing ceremony in istanbul delayed briefly by disputes about the display of flags around the table and ukraine s refusal to put its name on the same document as the russians ukraine had entered the ceremony by bluntly warning it would conduct an immediate military response should russia violate the accord and attack its ships or stage an incursion around its ports the two sides eventually inked separate but identical agreements in the presence guterres and erdogan at istanbul s lavish dolmabahce palace guterres then hailed the agreement as a beacon of hope zelensky said just after the deal was signed that responsibility for enforcing it fell to the united nations which along with turkey is a co guarantor of the agreement the agreement includes points on running ukrainian grain ships along safe corridors that avoid known mines in the black sea huge quantities of wheat and other grain have been blocked in ukrainian ports by russian warships and the mines kyiv laid to avert a feared amphibious assault zelensky said that around 20 million tonnes of produce from last year s harvest and the current crop would be exported under the agreement estimating the value of ukraine s grain stocks at around 10 billion russian defence minister sergei shoigu told kremlin state media he expected the deal to start working in the next few days although diplomats expect grain to only start fully flowing by mid august strikes on central ukraine the ornate halls of istanbul s dolmabahce palace felt far removed from east ukraine s donbas war zone where saturday was another day of relentless shelling across the front russia is trying to fight deeper into the war zone s donetsk region after securing full control of neighbouring lugansk the us state department on saturday said that two americans had died in the area without saying whether the pair were in the country for combat purposes russian missile strikes on railway infrastructure and a military airfield in the central area of kirovograd on saturday also killed at least three people and wounded 16 more regional governor andriy raikovych said at least one of the dead was a serviceman he said earlier in a rare admission of a military casualty in a conflict in which military deaths have been closely guarded by both sides
energy expert badrul imam tells star the current energy crisis in the country has more to do with the government s reluctance to explore natural gas than the ongoing russia ukraine war observes prominent energy expert prof badrul imam over the last 20 years bangladesh drilled 26 exploratory wells making it one of the least explored countries with high hydrocarbon potential he said at an inhouse discussion at the daily star centre in the capital on saturday badrul former chairman of dhaka university s geology department noted that the russia ukraine war just exposed bangladesh s vulnerability in energy security thanks to the country s growing reliance on costly lng import instead of emphasis on gas exploration today s crisis has not hit us suddenly it has been coming slowly but surely we predicted that there would be a point in time when the crisis would arise said the noted geologist he further said it s not possible for bangladesh to attain energy security with this low rate of exploration it s the result of the government s wrong planning and its decision to import liquified natural gas the crisis was in the making and would have arisen any time when the government decided to import lng in late 2018 the country s energy experts protested it as the lng price fluctuates often in the international market he mentioned but the government didn t pay any heed to the experts opinion though it was well aware of the fact that the lng price fluctuates the lng now costs 40 per unit in the global market while locally produced natural gas costs 1 3 mentioning that bangladesh the biggest delta in the world has huge unexplored gas resources he said we find gas in one in three wells we drill while the global average is five we have survey reports and we know that about two thirds of the country s gas resources are yet to be explored citing two studies conducted over a decade ago badrul said the first survey carried out jointly by the united states geological survey and state run petrobangla in 2001 showed that bangladesh had potential reserves of 32 trillion cubic feet tcf gas in another study a year later the norwegian petroleum directorate and bangladesh s power energy and mineral resources ministry put the potential gas reserves at 42 tcf our tendency is to look for things that we can find easily we are not carrying out the second and third phases of exploration said badrul no comprehensive programme for offshore exploration had been taken up since the country won nearly four fifths of over 25 000sqkm area in the bay of bengal ending a three decade old dispute over maritime boundary with myanmar in 2012 and with india in 2014 he noted when both india and myanmar have been exploring natural gas in their parts in the bay we are yet to conduct a survey he said adding that myanmar has already started exporting gas from its offshore blocks in the bay to china petrobangla in 2015 floated a tender for conducting a multi client survey a necessary step for inviting international oil companies to carry out exploration in the deep sea but the energy ministry scrapped it a fresh tender was floated the following year in both cases a joint consortium of norway s tgs and the usa s schlumberger won the bid but they couldn t start work we are yet to know its fate it s puzzling he said the multi client survey would cost the government nothing as the company that conducts it sells the report to international oil companies and gives a portion of the proceeds to the country where the survey is carried out the government has taken initiatives as part of its austerity measures to save fuel and power amid soaring energy prices in the global market but the shutdown of diesel run power plants and one to two hours of countrywide load shedding are piecemeal measures he said these piecemeal decisions won t solve it and we have to get back to the basics the government should draw up specific and effective plans we have the key to solving this problem we need to find the gas reserves that remains undiscovered and extract gas as soon as possible the main focus should be on energy generation from native sources he said adding that the country spends tk 44 000 crore a year to import lng which meets only 25 percent of the total demand for gas about the underused gas field in north bhola he said a pipeline is required to supply gas from there to the national grid the government however has not taken any initiative to that end the government can also set up a hub of power plants in bhola to produce electricity that can be supplied to the national grid but that has not happened yet he also voiced worries about the current stock of domestic gas and dependency on bibiyana gas field which accounts for around 50 percent of domestic gas supply when bibiyana stopped producing gas from its six wells due to technical glitches for a while before the ramadan households industries and all other sectors dependent on gas felt the pinch gas production at bibiyana will start declining after three to four years what will happen then he asked the government should strengthen the state run bangladesh petroleum exploration and production company bapex instead of prioritising foreign companies i don t know why the government paid a hefty sum to russian company gazprom to develop the gas field in bhola after bapex had explored it a foreign company asks for tk 180 tk 200 crore to develop a well while bapex needs only tk 80 tk 100 crore to do that he said badrul further said he became thrilled when bapex early this year decided to conduct 55 exploratory drillings in the next five years it meant 11 exploratory drillings would be done a year if we could carry out at least three to four drillings the whole scenario would change but one fine morning the whole thing was scrapped i don t know why they cancelled it
andrey znamenskyi istock via getty images the dollar fell against all the major currencies last week but pared the losses ahead of the weekend the sub 50 emu flash composite pmi unwound the half cent gain the euro recorded after the ecb delivered a 50 bp hike to kick off its first tightening since 2011 disappointing us economic data housing leading economic indicators the philadelphia fed survey and the flash composite pmi drop into contraction territory weighed on us 10 year yields this helped support the yen after the boj kept its policy stance unchanged the benchmark us yield fell by more than 14 bp last week after shedding 15 bp the previous week and posted its lowest weekly close since the end of may note that the 30 day correlation between the change in wti and us 10 year yields is at its highest since january 0 35 for the first time since april the september wti settled the week below 100 we had anticipated the dollar s pullback ahead of the ecb meeting however that modest correction appears to have run its course and we suspect the greenback may enjoy a firmer bias ahead of the fomc meeting that said the risk is for the greenback to trade lower as soon as the post fed press conference after the 75 bp hike next week the market favors a 50 bp hike in september the day after the fomc meeting the us reports its first look at q2 gdp the atlanta fed gdpnow warns of the second consecutive quarterly contraction while economists for the most part are looking for a small expansion dollar index the dollar index pulled back after visiting a 20 year high near 109 30 on july 14 it found support around the 50 retracement of the latest leg up that began in late june around 106 50 which was also near the 20 day moving average it frayed after the pmi surprise a break of 105 95 would be significant from a technical perspective the close below the 20 day moving average 106 55 was the first since mid june the momentum indicators are trending lower and the five day moving average may push below the 20 day moving average for the first time in over a month euro the euro recovered to about 1 0275 last week after falling to a 20 year low near 0 9950 in the previous week it met the 50 retracement objective of the loss since the late june high near 1 0615 the next retracement 61 8 is around 1 0360 the poor eurozone pmi spurred euro sales to about 1 0130 a break of the 1 0080 1 0115 band would confirm the end of the upside correction and signal a return toward the lows however the momentum indicators are constructive even with the shockingly weak us pmi the euro was unable to take out the previous day s high or even close higher on the day japanese yen the key driver of the exchange rate remains us yields the 23 bp drop in the us 10 year yield over the past two sessions saw the dollar fall from almost jpy139 90 to about jpy135 55 the greenback closed below the 20 day moving average jpy138 80 for the first time since the end of may the dollar approached the 50 retracement of the advance that began on june 16 near jpy131 50 the momentum indicators have turned down but in any event they had peaked in early june foreign investors appear to have bought a record amount of japanese bonds in the first half of july 27 6 bln part of this may be short covering after speculation that the boj would tweak policy british pound sterling rose by about 1 3 to snap a three week slide it is only the second weekly advance since the end of may it reflected the broad pullback in the dollar but at the end of last week the uk s flash composite held up better than the eurozone or the us at 52 8 indeed it was even better than expected 52 4 also the uk reported its first increase in retail sales excluding gasoline since last october still most of sterling s gains took place in the first two sessions of last week it rose from 1 1855 to almost 1 20 on a closing basis by tuesday and it did not finish the week far from that the momentum indicators are moving higher but sterling is encountering resistance on a closing basis around the 20 day moving average that will begin the new week near 1 2010 on an intraday basis sterling reached almost 1 2065 ahead of the weekend its highest level since july 5 a break above there would target 1 2115 and then maybe 1 22 a base has formed at around 1 19 canadian dollar the canadian dollar rose by about 1 25 against the us dollar last week it was the weakest of the majors edging out sterling for the title it snapped a three week slide and recouped it all in full with the greenback finishing the week below cad1 2890 in fact on the back of the poor us flash pmi the us dollar fell to the lows of the month near cad1 2825 the cad1 2785 1 2810 area may offer solid support the momentum indicators are trending lower and neither the macd nor the slow stochastic confirmed the new us dollar high set on july 14 the five day moving average has fallen below the 20 day moving average for the first time since mid june however the pull of risk appetites should not be underestimated despite the poor us pmi and strong canadian may retail sales 2 2 vs 1 6 expected the greenback still closed the pre weekend session higher as us equities fell australian dollar the aussie gained 2 2 last week it is the biggest weekly advance of the year however it stalled near the 50 retracement objective of the drop from the june 3 high 0 7285 found around 0 6980 the next retracement 61 8 is close to 0 7055 the momentum indicators are moving higher after all the australian dollar has risen in nine of the past 12 sessions and the 5 day moving average has crossed over the 20 day moving average for the first time since mid june and for the past six sessions it has taken out the previous day s high in addition to the aussie stalling at a key chart area the other note of caution comes from the bollinger band which came in near 0 6970 ahead of the weekend mexican peso the peso struggled a bit against the dollar until the end of the week mexico reported slightly higher than expected mid july cpi which seemed to underscore expectations for a 75 bp hike by banxico which meets on august 11 the exchange rate often seems more sensitive to the risk environment s p 500 than interest rates us yields but the pre weekend peso gain of 0 5 despite the 1 3 decline in the s p 500 was notable still the gain left the peso virtually flat on the week and the greenback held support just below mxn20 50 the dollar has not closed below the 20 day moving average this month it is near mxn20 47 the momentum indicators are falling but if the dollar holds support the slow stochastic could turn next week mexico reports june trade and employment data but the highlight on july 29 is q2 gdp its growth is outpacing the us this year mexico s economy expanded by 1 0 quarter over quarter in q1 and is expected to have grown by 0 8 in q2 chinese yuan last week the dollar was virtually flat against the chinese yuan slipping less than 0 1 since the middle of june it has been alternating between gains and losses quietly the dollar has strung together the longest monthly advance against the yuan since 2018 the dollar has gained roughly 0 7 against the yuan this month which would be the fifth consecutive monthly appreciation going into the last week of the month the dollar traded above cny6 77 for the first time since may china s property quagmire is receiving new attention domestically and seemingly by international investors the csi 300 was the only major equity market to have fallen 0 25 last week ahead of the weekend the nasdaq golden dragon index cap weighted index of companies with common shares in the us but which do most of their business in china fell 4 5 ensuring a loss for the fourth consecutive week recall it had rallied by a third between mid may and the end of june over these past four weeks it has fallen by almost 12 meanwhile the us 10 year yield has nearly converged with china s the prc

e_y_e bank of america nyse bac is about to suffer from a major lost opportunity thanks to the recent federal reserve stress tests it shouldn t have come as a surprise the handwriting should have been on the wall for anybody who noticed the cet1 common equity tier number in its q4 2021 end of the year report the fifth line of the first slide reported a standardized cet1 ratio of 10 6 it struck me at the time that this was pretty close to the 10 5 the fed was going to require on the stress tests i checked other banks and bac compared unfavorably with its peers everybody loved bac and saw that it was going to book big time with rising interest rates bank of america was well aware of this advantage and its earnings call slides included a line saying how much their income would benefit per 100 basis point lateral increase in interest rates under ceo brian moynihan bank of america had turned itself around after the 2008 2009 disaster and gone from strength to strength it had taken care of both customers and employees during the pandemic and lockdown and still made good money now that they were getting that rise in interest rates they should race ahead of all other diversified banks the only thing to worry about with bac was that it had the most exposure to consumer banking among its peers and as a consequence held more of the kind of loans that would be heavily discounted by the fed in the upcoming stress test i wrote about the difference between investment banks and diversified banks with large consumer exposure in this article on goldman sachs gs the short version is that investment banks are structured so as to do better on stress tests my assumption at the beginning of the year was that ceo brian moynihan had this all worked out surely he had a strategy in place to take advantage of rising rates while managing loans so as to improve its cet1 ratio enough to get out of the danger zone that isn t what happened here s the way the fed described the worst case scenario used in the stress tests taken into account for the stress tests 2022 s hypothetical scenario included a severe global recession with substantial stress in commercial real estate and corporate debt markets the unemployment rate rises by 5 3 4 percentage points to a peak of 10 and gdp declines commensurately asset prices decline sharply with a nearly 40 decline in commercial real estate prices and a 55 decline in stock prices and here are the stress test results for the four major banks which have already led jpmorgan jpm and citi c to halt buybacks bank q4 21 actual test result minimum bank of america 10 6 7 8 7 6 jpmorgan 13 1 10 6 9 8 citi 12 2 9 5 8 6 wells fargo wfc 11 4 8 7 8 6 click to enlarge jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon was apoplectic and didn t hold back when asked a question about the tests at jpm s july 14 earnings call we don t agree with the stress test dimon said it s inconsistent it s not transparent it s too volatile it s basically capricious arbitrary it was one of those you want to know what i really think remarks having earlier said he saw a hurricane coming he went on to say that jpm would still make money in a worst case scenario but would suspend share buybacks he added that jpmorgan was pulling back on risk weighted assets citing mortgages which require capital set aside it s not good for the united states economy and in particular it s bad for lower income mortgages dimon continued you haven t fixed the mortgage business and then we re making it worse it s not good for the united states economy and in particular it s bad for lower income mortgages dimon said he then explained that jpm would continue originating mortgages but immediately offload them although other banks might recede from home loans entirely it s a terrible way to run a financial system dimon said it just causes huge confusion about what you should be doing with your capital bank of america of course commits a far larger percentage of its capital to mortgages than jpmorgan at the bank of america q2 earnings call brian moynihan and his cfo seemed determined to talk around the subject of the stress tests and their consequences for bac including buybacks here s moynihan talking about capital after mentioning customers and the 5 increase in dividend third we re going to be building capital given the new higher amounts received during the stress test it will make our balance sheet even stronger along the way we believe our expected earnings generation over the next 18 months will provide an ample amount of capital which allows us to support customer growth pay dividends and use the rest to allocate between buying back shares and growing into our new capital requirement what struck me about this paragraph was how carefully it was worded it had many words but little content the balance sheet would be even stronger the quiet center of it was that earnings generation over the next 18 months would be allocated after customer growth and dividends to buying back shares and growing into the new capital requirement the timing is vague the policy seems to be that bank of america would grow itself into better shape that would enable it to do better in future stress tests only then would it talk about things like buybacks erika najarian of ubs was unwilling to leave it at that and asked the question again of cfo alastair borthwick erika najarian got it and my second question is a follow up on capital i guess the first is are you working to actively reduce the stress capital buffer and maybe remind us where you think the pain points were for this year s test that you think you could address for next year and second should we what is the pacing of buybacks like from here as you potentially as you or not potentially as you build towards that january 1 2024 new hire minimum alastair borthwick on the second question that s going to be dictated by our lobs use of the balance sheet our 1 goal is to keep them in the market winning every day and let the capital support that that s what we do because what they re doing is providing good returns and stuff so that requires us to well it will be driven by frankly loan growth more than anything else in the near term because the markets business will bounce around but won t move much that s a stumbling evasion of specificity followed by a quick change of subject the subtext hovers over both conversations buybacks have been one of the major attractions for bac shareholders for the past half dozen years organic growth has been hard to come by and in its absence bank of america has manufactured growth in all per share numbers by aggressive buybacks now that buybacks have been pulled away how should shareholders look at bac that s clearly not a question that bank of america wanted to engage let s look at the numbers the following table contains the numbers that matter they are not the usual operating numbers those look fine through mid year 2022 there s a good positive case to make about every part of the bank of america business and trust me the ceo and cfo went over it in mind numbing detail line by line if you don t trust me read it for yourselves i wrote this recent article comparing bac to jpm and detailing bac s operating success the problem is that the q2 2022 results amounted to a detailed picture of a frozen moment in time with the assumption that subsequent numbers will be similar unfortunately quite a lot of uncertainty and dread hangs over the future let s leave that to unfold on its own and instead take a look at buybacks in some detail date 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 6 mo 22 shares outstanding m 10287 9669 8836 8651 8077 8036 shares retired 234m 618m 833m 185m 574m 40m net income 18b 28b 27b 18b 32b 13 3b book value per share 23 8 25 1 27 3 28 7 30 4 29 9 spent on buybacks 12 8b 20 1b 28 1b 7 8b 25 1b 3 6b click to enlarge i would love to do a piece of nifty arithmetic to get the average price paid per share but there is a catch to doing that the number of shares retired does not equal the number of shares bought because bac uses a significant portion of shares repurchased to offset shares paid out as compensation there is thus no very good way of getting the exact average price of shares repurchased accurately as a result you cannot calculate the price paid per share by simply dividing the amount spent on buybacks by the number of shares retired what seems clear is that even after adding a substantial number of shares for stock compensation to the 2021 number for shares retired bac paid over 40 per share repurchased in 2021 the stock price during 2021 confirms that this is roughly correct what also is clear is that the same dollar amount of share repurchases would have bought back 20 25 more shares if done in 2022 the shares bought back in 2021 were also bought at a price above the price at which bank of america is currently trading this is certainly unfortunate for bac shareholders there are two periods in which bac shares could have been bought cheaply 2020 and the first six month of 2022 in 2020 all banks were constrained from doing buybacks for much of the year and the result is clear in the small dollar number of 7 8 billion in the bottom row above you can t very well blame either the bank of america ceo or the fed for that the dollar amount for 2022 seems almost certain to be much smaller than the number for 2020 despite the fact that no crisis is currently unfolding as far as we can see worse yet the responses of both ceo and cfo in the above quotes indicate that reduced buybacks may continue for as much as another 18 months which leader should shareholders hold responsible the real question is which leader to hold accountable jamie dimon s candidate is jay powell he sees powell as having panicked about a deep recession and taken excessive preemptive action harming the banks and their shareholders as well as having counterproductive impact on the us economy he was clearly stunned by the failure of the fed to take into account what he often calls jpmorgan s fortress balance sheet in the case of bank of america however the question is how they got caught off guard despite the fact that their cet1 ratio was the closest to the newly required 10 5 who dropped the ball it certainly feels as though the top leadership at bank of america failed to take the fed seriously or else expected that their good operating results would place them above the requirement if they did so assume they were clearly wrong their meager 5 increase in dividend was far from making up for the loss of buybacks as for the apparent decision to go full out for growth that may just work out if everything goes right but it comes with risks to be proven right in the long run requires the assumption that a recession does not happen in the meantime what bank of america fails to acknowledge is the importance of buybacks to a core premise of its shareholders in an industry for which organic growth in revenue and earnings has been hard to come by the manufactured growth provided by share repurchases is very important from the shareholder point of view bac seemed to be well aware of this when the fed initially permitted buybacks consider the fact that 2021 buybacks of roughly 7 of bac shares produced a 7 jump in shareholder value the 2019 buybacks added 8 1 2 those buybacks further made it possible to increase the dividend 7 and 8 1 2 respectively with the same amount of cash going out the door from the shareholder perspective the solid operating performance is fine and the higher nii net interest income from higher rates is also a good thing but there is a fair chance that higher rates will recede within a couple of years and banks may find themselves back in a miserable low rate regime which requires them to find a bunch of alternative ways to earn money i m sure customers won t be delighted by a return to nitpicking fees and service charges the fed is unlikely to acknowledge going off the deep end with the stress tests and who knows they may know something the rest of us don t if nothing else jay powell knows what he is going to do the ceo at bank of america however needs to acknowledge that the loss of buybacks is a very big deal for bac investors and provide an account of how the bank got into a position which caused an interruption of buybacks as a shareholder i would personally like to hear something less evasive about both past and future at the next quarterly earnings call what were they thinking bac is also in the doghouse with both quant rankings and factor grades here are the seeking alpha factor grades for bank of america these letter grades tell the story valuation has improved a little as the stock crashed while momentum and revisions as a pair went from bad to worse growth tanked profitability stayed poor at d quant ratings if anything are worse the most telling was bac s ranking in its own industry group it was ranked number 35 out of 56 in the diversified bank industry all three of its peers jpmorgan citigroup and wells fargo were ranked higher ranking below citi and wfc is quite a comedown for a bank recently seen as number one in the industry both seeking alpha writers and wall street analysts rate bank of america a buy the quant ranking rates it a hold meanwhile i am more or less locked into my position because it was bought at a great price when bank of america was still putting the last crisis behind it selling would mean paying a large chunk of my capital to the irs i m disappointed but still willing to give ceo brian moynihan the benefit of the doubt and wait to see if he comes clean about cet1 the stress tests and bac s future my ranking matches my own situation i rate it a hold

is anything going right in europe germany reported a monthly trade deficit in may for the first time since 1991 following the reunification of east and west germany as a direct result of soaring imported energy costs energy shortages across the eurozone may result in rationing later this year exacerbating the current economic slowdown the ecb raised s t interest rates 50bps this week to zero this was their first raise in 11 years as they attempt to slow inflation which is an average of 9 5 across the eurozone the russian ukraine war drags on feeding the existential fear of freezing to death in the dark this winter you can read the rest of this doomberg twitter thread here the euro currency fell below par with the usd last week for the first time in 20 years as the usd continued its 18 month rally against virtually all currencies the euro was 84 when it was introduced in 2001 and rallied to its all time high of 1 60 in the summer of 2008 it has trended lower since 2008 with that downtrend accelerating over the past year as markets expected the fed to tighten monetary policy much more aggressively than the ecb the russian invasion of ukraine hastened the flow of capital away from europe to the safety of the usa the euro rallied 3 this week from last week s 20 year low this could be a result of profit taking on long usd positions boa fund manager survey sees long usd as the most crowded trade and thoughts that peak fed is behind us what is the fed going to do very bright analysts with years of experience have decidedly different answers to this question some folks believe that a recession is already underway and will quickly get dramatically worse causing the fed to back off their tightening program in contrast other folks believe that a new era of persistently higher supply shortage inflation has begun after decades of relatively low inflation which means the fed will be raising rates far higher and for far longer than the market is currently pricing my answer i think the fed is determined to get inflation down at all costs which may take them longer and require them to raise rates more than the market expects i can imagine a steeply inverted yield curve with long rates lower than short rates as the market prices in the future impact of higher s t rates the fed s credibility is lost if inflation remains high and inflation expectations remain unanchored don t fight the fed what is the macro message across asset classes over the past few weeks since the mid june fomc meeting bonds and short rates have had a good rally stock indices have bounced commodity markets have been weak and the usd has rallied to new 20 year highs but has given back 50 of those gains in recent days based on this macro picture my guess is that the market sees a recession coming and the fed backing off the fomc meets this coming week and the market expects another 75bps increase stock indices the djia bounced 8 from the mid june lows to this week s highs market sentiment was extremely negative at the lows and hasn t improved much since then last week i wrote that the stock market had a damned if you do damned if you don t problem if a recession is looming then the fed would be less aggressive good news but if a recession is looming earnings will take a hit terrible news stock market sentiment is extremely negative are falling gasoline prices good news for the stock market yes if you see cheaper gas as a sign of cooling inflation the fed won t need to be so aggressive no if you see cheaper gas as a sign of demand destruction consumers are cutting back on their spending and in an economy that is 70 driven by consumer spending that s not good i believe the bounce from the june lows has been another bear market rally i agree with michael harnett cio at bank of america when he writes it s unlikely that wall street will unwind the financial excesses of the last 13 years with a six month garden variety bear market concerning that 13 year time frame i have often wondered what will happen to the passive investing cohort if when the major indices fall more and stay down longer than they ever imagined their thesis the stock market always goes up over time so keep buying at regular intervals don t try to time the market buy the whole market don t try to pick stocks be prepared for occasional corrections and see them as good opportunities to lower your average costs be patient and you will be handsomely rewarded over the long term i don t believe they have begun to sell yet but they will at some point in the cycle credit markets if the fed is determined to get inflation down and if that takes longer than the market expects short rates will rise bond prices will fall and quality spreads will widen the june 2023 eurodollar has rallied 100 points since the last fomc meeting the market is pricing s t rates to be 100bps lower than what was priced a month ago eurodollar futures will fall if the fed surprises the market and keeps pushing rates higher if the us economy does not go into recession the fed will push rates much higher than the market is currently pricing this is a chart of the 10 year t note futures contract prices have risen 5 full points since last month s fomc meeting as yields have fallen if the fed surprises the market and takes rates higher for longer prices will fall if a recession hits harder and faster than expected prices will rise baring some exogenous events like over leveraged china having a severe financial meltdown i think the only thing that would cause the fed to back off would be a sustained sharp rise in the unemployment rate currencies for the past 40 years i ve said that capital comes to america for safety and opportunity i ve also repeatedly said that currency trends go way further than seems to make any sense before turning on a dime and going the other way i acknowledge that the usd looks over valued on several metrics primarily trade imbalances but if the fed is determined to cool inflation while europe is lurching into an existential crisis and japan maintains a zero interest rate policy the usd will go higher against virtually all currencies commodities the goldman sachs commodity index has closed lower down 20 for seven consecutive weeks weaker fossil fuel prices have contributed to this decline but industrial metals and ag markets have also tumbled the economist magazine cover in may the coming food catastrophe signalled the top of the wheat market see the may 21 2022 td notes commodities especially energy were the most crowded long trade earlier this year the bullish narrative was a compelling supply shortage story exacerbated by the russian invasion there has been severe liquidation of speculative bullish positions in the commodities market despite the malthusian warnings that future supply shortages will be acute and prices will soar from current bargain levels the malthusian theory has been wrong for over 200 years in commodity markets the best cure for high prices is high prices high prices bring forth supply from innovation and substitution instead of millions of people dying of starvation due to the world s rising population food innovations have delivered an adequate supply of food to a higher percentage of the world s population than ever before that doesn t mean that commodity prices won t spike on supply shortages they will and that spike will bring forth more supply from innovation and substitution if fossil fuel prices spike over the next few years that will be a powerful accelerant for innovators to deliver alternative energy sources like nuclear for instance gold gold hit a 15 month low this week down 400 19 from the all time highs 2 080 made following the russian invasion the ultra strong usd and rising interest rates are a significant headwind for gold net speculative long positions on comex appear to be around a 3 year low the managed money category is net short 19 000 contracts and the gold etf market has seen net selling for the past few months my long time friend and excellent technical analyst ross clark chartsandmarkets com wrote a report this week seeing major oversold extremes in the xau hui and newmont and capitulation in gold futures with gold in a downtrend stories will inevitably surface as people try to explain why gold is falling for instance there has been a story that ukraine has been selling gold maybe they have i don t know but the best story is that uganda has discovered 320 000 tonnes of gold throughout the country to put that discovery in perspective the world currently mines 3 000 tonnes of gold annually this massive discovery has depressed the gold price so the story goes because there will soon be a flood of supply hitting the market while the uganda news was greeted with skepticism it got me thinking that perhaps africa will be the source of supply for the mountains of minerals that the world will need in the future my short term trading i ve been in summer vacation mode for the past two weeks i bought gold tuesday and was quickly stopped for a slight loss i shorted the s p wednesday and thursday and was stopped promptly for small losses i missed being short friday when the market broke i m flat at the end of the week and my p l is down 0 2 on my radar i think the s p rally off the june lows has been a bear market rally and i ll be looking for price action to allow me to trade from the short side i ll look for opportunities to buy the usd against cad and eur the fomc meets tuesday wednesday so i ll be

the concept of hybrid war is not new rather its tenets include all shades of kinetic and non kinetic warfare however what is new is its scientific application artistically the artistic mannerism of hybrid war deals mainly with intangible elements psycho social mind making negative perception development and management the primary objective of the executioner remains to create uncertainty and dissatisfaction about the future of the state among the majority of the population whereas the scientific application of the elements of hybrid war deals with tangible impact on people through economic coercion cyber crimes physical impact and even territorial capture perhaps this hybridity makes hybrid warfare the favourite tool of application by all strategists and practitioners moreover the intangible applications are relatively less risky and do not lead to activation of any international law or violation of major treaties or agreements at least for now the perpetrators of hybrid war aim to create a synergetic effect of their effort on the target state utilising all available avenues tangible and intangible tangible elements of warfare which are far more scientific now due to the tech revolution in military warfare and sophistication in weapon inventories include physical impact through military hardware where the enemy is visible however the intangible elements of warfare which fall in the domain of artistic applications and where the enemy is invisible and operates from within are far more damaging and effective this domain of hybrid war has an exceptionally large canvass for instance economic warfare may include disruption in stock exchanges and creating volatility in the currency market both aimed at purposely scaring investors away to weaken a state according to colin s gray since the character of warfare in a period is shaped even driven much more by the political social and strategic contexts than it is by changes integral to military science the perpetrators of hybrid war seek to alter the character of the target state for which they are willing to go to any length the perpetrators of hybrid war aim to create a synergetic effect of their effort on the target state utilising all available avenues tangible and intangible though hybridity in threats against an adversary is not a new strategy in non kinetic warfare it has certainly paralysed international law in its application to avert the threat particularly against relatively smaller and weaker states perhaps this is one reason that europe is faced with another war at the moment which clearly reflects the inability of international laws to avert kinetic and non kinetic threats of different nature and character however in vladimir baytuk s 2017 view the most probable driver of the emergence of hybrid threats is grounded in the evolving nature of global order of which the social political and economic components have changed dramatically since the end of the cold war perhaps andrew mumford s description of a hybrid adversary is the most comprehensive according to him a hybrid adversary is one that uses a combination of political military economic social and intelligence methods of influence as well as conventional irregular terrorist and criminal methods of warfare a glimpse of the artistic application of intangible elements of hybrid warfare was witnessed during 2005 20 by pakistan at the hands of an indian sponsored campaign as discovered by european watchdog eu disinfolab although pakistan had been highlighting india s efforts to soften its inner ring at the international forums these concerns were not given any weightage until the indian chronicles appeared on the other hand the scientific application of kinetic elements is in full swing in europe where an iron curtain is being drawn between russia and ukraine as the war between the two neighbouring states is entering the sixth month while protracted wars are counterproductive highly destructive and expensive the end of this war is not in sight interestingly the art of executing hybrid war is to evade international obligations and help perpetrators gainfully employ the intangible elements of warfare the purpose remains to weaken the target state from within and make people feel insecure uncertain and lose confidence in the government and its institutions whereas the scientific execution of hybrid war elements is aimed at the physical destruction of the target state through the strategic application of sophisticated weaponry and technological means the international system is fast evolving with new political alignments while the united states wants to extend its superpower status through hard power china is striving to achieve the same through the elements of soft power china is depending on the art of war whereas the us is deploying scientific elements the question remains as to where europe and russia stand at the moment perhaps the answer would come when the iron curtain is finally drawn between russia and ukraine unfortunate though that may be the writer is the author of the book nuclear deterrence and conflict management between india and pakistan he is presently working as the director of the centre for aerospace and security studies cass

menafn asia times a techinsights report stating that a bitcoin mining integrated circuit ic sold by minerva appears to be manufactured in smic 7 nm technology node has triggered an outburst of commentary about the failure of american sanctions to stop the advance of chinese semiconductor technology techinsights is a canadian provider of semiconductor related analysis and intellectual property services to technology companies and other subscribers it is known for its reverse engineering capability referred to as china based by bloomberg minerva semiconductor is registered in canada but the three directors listed in its registration are chinese and the address given for one of them is in china s henan province the about us section on the company s website is blank minerva semiconductor claims that its minerva7 is one of the best valued chips for mining bitcoin and that it utilizes mature foundry technology to ensure chip yield quality and reliability semiconductor manufacturing international corp or smic is china s largest semiconductor foundry contract manufacturer and a prominent target of us technology sanctions aimed at curbing china s access to advanced chips and the capacity to produce them the report describes smic s efforts to put 7 nm process technology into production as a qualified success after noting similarities with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company s tsmc 7 nm process it goes on to say that smic s system on chip soc device seems to be a low volume steppingstone that has the logic but not the memory aspects of a standard tsmc or samsung product this is possible because bitcoin miners have limited ram requirements the report said for reference an soc is an ic that incorporates a processing unit logic memory and other components creating a specialized computer or other type of electronic system in a single device techinsights also points out that smic s use of deep ultra violet duv lithography has resulted in a more complex and costly process that probably has lower yields than the extreme ultra violet euv lithography based processes now used by tsmc and samsung but smic has no choice it must use duv because the us commerce department put in on its entity list in december 2020 stating at the time that items uniquely required to produce semiconductors at advanced technology nodes 10 nanometers or below will be subject to a presumption of denial to prevent such key enabling technology from supporting china s military civil fusion efforts the us is urging lithography tool makers to stop selling to china image facebook the entity list restricts trade with foreign entities persons corporations governments without a license from the commerce department in practice this has meant that sales of euv lithography equipment to smic and other chinese semiconductor makers are banned sales of other types of equipment quite a lot of it according to media reports has been permitted the production of euv equipment is monopolized by asml of the netherlands but it incorporates a light source made by an american company cymer which asml acquired in 2013 the dutch government has to date supported the sanctions us sanctions may prevent smic from upgrading from duv to euv but they have not stopped it from developing process technology at 10 nm and below as a result the us government is now seeking to ban sales of duv lithography equipment to smic read us pressing even tougher chip bans on china the techinsights report has generated headlines but its basic message that smic has crossed the line drawn by the us government has been known for more than a year on april 5 2021 computenorth an american supplier of cryptocurrency blockchain and other distributed computing services based in minnesota reported that previously available exclusively to private industrial clients the minerva mv7 pro is now becoming available on a global scale as one of the latest and most popular high performance bitcoin miners on the market today the mv7 utilizes the latest smic 7nm chip and while its outlook appears promising there is still much to be revealed regarding the miner and its longer term performance 7 nm is the actual limit of duv lithography the 5 nm and 3 nm processes developed by tsmc and samsung will not work without euv it is quite likely that the us government has until recently not tried or not been able to impose a ban on the sale of duv equipment to china because it would have forced asml to abandon a large and fast growing market it would also have hurt second source supplier nikon and had a severe knock on impact on makers of other semiconductor production equipment including american market leaders applied materials lam research and kla while us sanctions have targeted the leading edge smic has built a substantial business serving the bulk of the semiconductor market founded in 2000 it now ranks fifth in the world in terms of semiconductor foundry revenues after tsmc samsung foundry umc and global foundries a smic stand at an exhibition in shanghai china on october 26 2017 photo afp smic is the smallest of the middle ranking foundries data from gartner shows that in 2021 industry leader tsmc was 10 times larger than smic samsung foundry 1 6 times larger and global foundries 21 larger other foundries in taiwan china and elsewhere are much smaller than smic smic fabricates a wide range of products for its customers including power management ics microprocessors image sensors radio frequency and other devices used in wireless communications it also makes touch controller ics in 2021 64 of its sales were made in china 22 in north america and 14 in eurasia smic operates 200mm and 300mm wafer fabs factories in shanghai beijing tianjin and shenzhen and has three new 300mm fabs under construction semiconductor foundry services generate more than 90 of smic s revenues with the rest coming from mask making testing and other related services headquartered in shanghai smic is traded on the shanghai stock exchange star market and the stock exchange of hong kong its largest shareholder is china s state owned assets supervision and administration commission sasac which has a 16 stake in the company the minerva news has had no significant impact on the share price so far meanwhile it appears that the americans are

every economist is saying that the us is in a recession or will face one shortly however donald trump the former us president is of some other views he believes that the current economic crisis is much worse than anticipated and the us will face depression not a recession if this happens the entire world will be in turmoil so trump says that the us needs to get going or there will be a serious problem what is depression and how is it different from a recession a significant and protracted decline in economic activity is referred to as a depression in economics it is often characterized as a serious recession that lasts three years or more or that results in a real gross domestic product gdp loss of at least 10 in a given year depressions tend to be accompanied by high unemployment and low inflation and are often less common than lighter recessions the latter lasts only for a few months and the economic decline isn t as significant as a depression donald trump on the economic crisis in the us donald trump was conducting a saving america rally where he talked about the economic crisis in the us and the current policies of joe biden it s been almost an entire century since the united states has not seen a depression the last time it happened was in 1929 however the current policies and the inflation rate is pushing us in that direction trump also talked about stagflation and how wages are collapsing so if the us doesn t get going there will be a major problem when we talk about depression the recession seems so minuscule and insignificant now you might think that trump is not an expert so why take his word for it right well i also think the same but even robert kiyosaki warned about the united states entering a depression phase he also warned about the stock and bond market crash alongside crypto if inflation continues depression will be inevitable the most important thing to have during a depression is cash there will be a lot of investment opportunities which will make many investors rich what are your thoughts on donald trump saying that the us will face depression let us know in the comments below also if you found our content informative do like and share it with your friends also read cbdcs are worse than cash and bank accounts says blockstream ceo
this month has dragged on and seems to be lasting forever one reason could be that it is my last full month as a keyboard warrior toiling as the voice of reason as i try to make sense of the nonsense in the financial markets the second and more likely is that the us fomc policy meetings falls at the end of the month instead of its usual mid month slot but as the last week of july arrives so does the fomc policy meeting with the results due out in the early hours of thursday morning singapore time for what its worth i am in team taylor and going for 75 basis points with 100 being a bridge to far last friday s price action may have softened the ardour of the 100 basis point hikes on the committee as well equity markets finished sharply lower ostensibly because of soft social media earnings but given wall street s schizophrenic nature of late it was just as likely to be recession fears booking some short term profits and cutting exposure ahead of the weekend and any potential risks that emerged over it currency markets had a noisy day but finished not far from unchanged across the dm and em space so i don t think friday s equity sell off was a structural move friday s s p global manufacturing and services pmis for europe and the us were disappointing to say the least coming in softer across the board eurozone bond yields moved sharply lower as the market falls over itself to price in a recession there even italian btps rallied that seems to have flowed into the us bond market as well with the us yield also moving sharply lower across the 5 to 30 year tenors and even 2 years closed under 3 0 the r word remains on everyone s lips even gold managed to string two consecutive positive days together while oil markets were broadly unchanged agricultural commodities fell on friday after russia and ukraine signed a turkey brokered deal to allow ukrainian grain exports to resume from black sea ports such as odessa naturally russia decided to rain cruise missiles down on odessa over the weekend including one that hit a grain silo that has seen wheat futures rise by 2 0 this morning and has led to some us dollar strength and extended the risk off tone to equity markets various news outlets are also running a story about china s increasingly strident warnings behind the scenes to us officials around nancy pelosi s intended visit to taiwan sometime in the next few

some china property and taiwan risk eastern europe risk and the us president who has covid and good luck picking the bones out of this week it s the show with everything but yul brunner i ll be in bali next week for four days and mightily glad i am watching the dust settle from the distance closer to home we see singapore core inflation for june 4 20 exp yoy and headline inflation 6 20 exp yoy released at 1300 sgt today having already made an unscheduled monetary tightening this month higher than expected inflation data this afternoon will lock and load the monetary authority of singapore to tighten again at their scheduled october meeting i am in singapore this week and although coe s have hit record high prices in july i am still seeing a lot of brand new mercedes and range rovers being driven around i also paid just over seven dollars for a quite small but pleasing hipster latte in singapore this morning my feeling is that inflation will come in on the high side this afternoon which may give local equities some headwinds this week while supporting the singapore dollar on a similar note australia releases its q2 cpi on wednesday and we can expect volatility over the number as the street uses it to reprice the trajectory of the reserve bank of australia tightening cycle the australian dollar s value is a function of international investors macro outlook for the world economy risk on risk off for those of us in pilot fish part of the financial markets a high cpi print could also be a headwind for australian equities though although they have been mostly content to follow wall street like a doting puppy of late it is a slow week for china data with just industrial profits on wednesday however we do see official pmis released this weekend on sunday and the caixin pmi next monday the focus is likely to remain on china s covid 19 trajectory and the china property market woes evergrande is approaching an end of month deadline around debt restructuring and if no progress is made this could start grabbing more headlines as the week advances the bear market rally in equities faces more than a few hurdles this week as outlined above currency markets technical picture look a bit clearer and the us dollar correction lower would appear to still have legs there are rising and falling wedge breakouts everywhere the dollar index is testing the base of its rising wedge usd jpy has broken lower out of its gbp usd aud usd and nzd usd have all broken higher out of falling wedges usd jpy has the potential to be the most emotional especially if the evolution of the week sees us yields move sharply lower again long usd jpy is a very crowded trade and a thinning of the herd is long overdue one could also argue that both bitcoin and gold are trying to form bases as well but let s not get too far ahead of ourselves they remain the ugliest horses in the glue factory however this week plays out i suspect today will be the most sedate day of the week to come enjoy the peace and quiet while you can asian equity markets mostly softer wall street unwound some of its gains on friday as investors lightened positions ahead of the weekend ahead of heavyweight us earnings this week and recession nerves the s p 500 finished 0 93 lower the nasdaq slumped by 1 87 and the dow jones eased by 0 43 in asia us futures are mixed s p 500 and dow futures edging 0 15 lower with nasdaq futures gaining 0 15 asian markets have been mostly content to follow wall street once again although without the tail chasing volatility and are cautiously lower today the exception is south korea s kospi which has moved 0 40 higher today elsewhere japan s nikkei 225 is down 0 80 news that china is setting up an investment fund to prop up embattled china property developers has had little to no impact on markets today the shanghai composite is down 0 55 the csi 300 is 0 65 lower while the hang seng has fallen by 0 85 in regional markets singapore has gained 0 40 while taipei

lower european markets finished modestly higher on friday but the move lower by wall street and the cruise missile attack on odessa over the weekend just after the grain export deal was signed is likely to spook european markets once again wall street has so many variables this week i am not even going to hazard a guess as to what mode the fomo gnomes will show up in today us dollar moves higher in asia the us dollar has moved slightly higher in asia today versus both the dm and asia fx space most likely due to the russian attack on odessa over the weekend friday saw a noisy session with large intra day trading ranges versus the major currencies as the dust settled though the us dollar finished only modestly lower the dollar index was almost unchanged at 106 55 on friday edging higher to 108 65 in sedate asian trading the bottom of its rising wedge is at 106 30 today and a sustained failure suggests a much deeper correction to 104 00 and potentially to its 102 50 long term breakout point resistance remains at 107 40 and 108 00 eur usd traded another wide range on friday but closed just 0 15 lower at 1 0215 easing to 1 0205 in asia it has resistance at 1 0275 which allows for a test of the 1 0360 1 0400 resistance zone only a sustained rise above would suggest a longer term low is in place eur usd has support at 1 0130 and 1 0100 gbp usd closed almost unchanged overnight at 1 2010 on friday falling to 1 1990 in asia gbp usd has broken out of its falling wedge but need to take our heavyweight resistance around 1 2060 to confirm a low is in place it has support at 1 1900 and 1 1800 with resistance at 1 2060 and 1 2200 lower us yields across the curve saw the japanese yen emerge a winner overnight as the us japan rate differential narrowed with the street still long to the eyeballs of usd jpy usd jpy finished 0 92 lower at 136 10 overnight rising slightly to 136 20 in asia its has broken out of its rising wedge support at 135 50 initially initial resistance is distance at 139 00 followed by 139 40 the us japan rate differential continues to hold usd jpy in its thrall and if us yields move sharply lower this week the technical picture suggests usd jpy could fall back to 132 00 aud usd and nzd usd fell slightly overnight to 0 6925 and 0 6250 easing to 0 6905 and 0 6235 in asia likely due to the russia missile attack on odessa both currencies remain well above their upside breakout points and only a move back below either 0 6700 or 0 6100 changes the bullish technical outlook usd asia finished almost unchanged on friday with the usd between 0 10 and 0 20 versus the thb twd myr and cny today both the inr and krw have strengthened slightly and in usd idrs case it looks like bank indonesia is on top at 15 000 00 today i expect volatility in asian currencies to increase as the week goes on and we get more inputs from tier 1 data the us fomc and us earnings overall asian currencies remain under pressure versus the greenback and i believe we will need to see a sustained move lower by the us 2 year yield to change that dynamic a hawkish fomc likely sees selling pressure return to asia fx oil prices ease in asia brent crude and wti had another choppy intra day session on friday but like currency markets closed almost unchanged as the dust settled on the day futures markets remain deeply in backwardation suggesting that in the real world prompt supplies are as tight as ever however rising recession fears globally do suggest that gains are likely to be limited in the shorter term geopolitics aside oil futures biggest problem is that the mind boggling intra day volatility seen of late is likely to reduce risk positioning and thus trading liquidity a negative feedback loop likely to exacerbate prices moves brent crude closed 0 25 lower at 103 60 on friday falling by 1 10 to 102 50 a barrel in asia today wti closed 1 45 lower at 95 00 on friday losing another 1 0 to 94 05 a barrel in asia today brent crude has well denoted resistance at 108 00 a barrel on the charts and then 111 00 it has support at 101 75 and 101 00 a barrel wti looks the more vulnerable moving below its 200 day moving average dma at 94 75 today and taking out support at 94 30 a barrel traced a double bottom 94 30 its overnight low and its 200 day moving average dma that now opens a retest of the july lows at 90 60 a barrel resistance is distant at 100 00 a barrel brent s outperformance likely reflects its use as the international benchmark for global trade in oil where physical supplies remain tight wti on the other hand is a domestic benchmark meaning that us recession nerves seem to be more heavily weighing on its price brent crude continues to hold comfortably above its 200 dma at 97 65 a barrel and until that comprehensively breaks i am not yet pencilling in the demise of high oil prices although i have long said i believe a medium term high is in place the more analysts there were calling for 200 and 300 a barrel crude the more confident i became gold s is trying to form a base gold closed higher for the second session in a row on friday quite the achievement given its woeful performance of late gold closed 0 50 higher at 1727 50 an ounce on friday edging slightly lower in moribund asian trading to 1728 75 two positive sessions do not mean gold is out of the woods but the technical picture does suggest it is trying to form a base having bounced of long term support near 1680 00 an ounce last week it faces a myriad of data and event risk this week but the chart does suggest buying the dips toward 1700 00 with a tight stop wouldn t be the dumbest call of your career gold needs to overcome heavy resistance at the 1745 00 an ounce triple top before the gold bugs can really start to get excited it has support at 1680 00 and then the longer term support around 1675 00 an ounce zone a sustained failure of 1675 00 will signal a much deeper move lower targeting the 1450 00 to 1500 00 an ounce regions

this post was updated 5 15 p m august 16 to correct property owner information along the flint river the chestatee river is there somewhere it shows on the map winding through the hills just south of dahlonega in north georgia chestatee is on road signs along us 19 but the river is hard to see from a public road and you can t hear its rushing water it s no wonder the river is elusive foreboding signs are all around the river no trespassing no fishing no river access no parking no turnaround private road welcome to the land of no the state has forever been a champion of property owners and the might of landowners is showing up around the rivers and streams sections of waterways have been walled off from kayakers tubers and anglers because public access is denied in long stretches of shoreline it might seem absurd to be in the middle of the wilderness and see a no fishing sign nailed to a tree leaning out over the river 20 feet above the water the georgia wildlife federation the flint riverkeeper and the altamaha riverkeeper are pushing back on no they wrote a public letter which is making the rounds to state agencies and legislators decrying the increasing lack of public access to waterways in the state from the letter in recent years a growing number of landowners and those leasing fishing rights from them are seeking to limit the public s access to our rivers and streams as anglers no fishing signs have popped up all over georgia next to our free flowing rivers whose populations of fish have been managed and protected by dedicated public servants those dedicated public servants salaries and resources are paid by those that hunt and fish not by those that own land our access to these rivers is via boat ramps that are more often than not paid for by hunters and anglers the issue is especially frothy on the flint river where anglers hunt the internationally famous shoal bass in an area known as yellow jacket shoals one sign popped up along the banks saying fishing is by permit only or not at all mike worley the president and ceo of the georgia wildlife federation said he was getting calls from anglers caught off guard by no fishing signs on the flint they said they ve been able to fish this stretch of the river for years and all of a sudden there are no fishing signs worley said we wrote the letter saying that it s time for us to really take a stand that these stretches of river can t be closed to fishermen worley said property owners contend they own the bottom of the river from the shore to the centerline of the river the state statute he said maintains that if a river is determined to be navigable the private landowner only controls to the low watermark or to that water at his ankles which is where the fish typically are not the georgia department of natural resources enforcement is siding with the anglers the department s lt judd smith said dnr would not be writing any citations for fishing on the flint it is considered a navigable waterway and even if property owners show a deed that extends their property line into the water they cannot restrict fishing or floating smith said even if a property owner has deed to both sides of the flint they cannot restrict fishing the landowner certainly is within their rights to say no trespassing you can t get out and go on to their land if they say you can t worley said but if law enforcement folks won t write a ticket it s hard to make an argument that they have the right to say that you can t fish there of course self appointed guardians of the riverbed could take the law into their own hands and one did with almost disastrous results in 2020 samuel brewton iii fired a gun at a family on a canoe ride on the flint he was found guilty of four counts of aggravated assault and is serving 10 years in prison and was fined 10 000 the brewton family is a major landowner near yellow jacket shoals and brewton iii considered the canoers trespassers gordon rogers executive director of the flint riverkeeper worries that the debate over who owns what on the flint is not over in our view the situation with fishing rights is not settled law rogers said you will hear some people say that it s settled law in terms of how the rights are determined based on the advice of counsel this area of the law is far from settled a court fight is brewing especially since property owners on the flint have sold leases to fishing guides to what they assume is their property out on the water the fishing guides of course charge for excursions it s in the public interest for the issue to be resolved because the economic impact of outdoor recreation is significant georgia ranks eighth among states in value added to a state s economy by boating or fishing according to the bureau of economic analysis from the u s department of commerce the study says the value added by the outdoor recreation economy is 10 8 billion while disputes on the flint might be settled because of dnr s pronouncement that it would not issue citations it is far more muddled in north georgia those waterways such as the toccoa chestatee and soque are considered non navigable unlike the flint which is considered navigable that is a crucial distinction the dnr s smith said a property owner on the chestatee can post a no fishing sign on their side of the river and have it enforced with a deed that extends to the middle of the river if the property owner has deed to both sides of the river say for a mile they can post no fishing anglers can then be cited for breaking the law if they drop a line in the water smith said what is important smith said is that property owners cannot stop a kayaker from floating through even if they own both sides of the water if the property owner on one side of the river says no fishing they can enter into an agreement with the owner on the other side to restrict fishing in that stretch of the river smith said but they cannot tell kayakers they cannot float through one of the problems with the no surrounding the waterway vistas is that it is difficult to find riverside property owners to talk to about it they are often behind locked gates or they hang menacing signs warning beware of dogs they often live down gravel roads with signs warning private road and no trespass but just go on what they consider their property and you can find them or they find you support news you trust donate in may the youtube fishing sensation john dalton who has 97 000 subscribers fished the chestatee he was floating along casting for fish and a voice came from over his shoulder that he was not allowed to fish on one side of the water 4 37 mark dalton s gopro camera then caught view of a sign hammered to a tree hanging out over the water that read no fishing there was an aggravated exchange between the man who claimed property ownership and dalton before the angler moved on many other anglers could be caught up in that situation unaware of the dnr interpretation that floating through is ok stacy jarrard the sheriff of lumpkin county said he cannot recall a property owner calling his office about an angler on private property this year if the sheriff is called the office refers the property owner to dnr some property owners feed the fish and help grow the fish population worley said he knows of landowners on georgia streams that do private stockings of fish and manage that fishery he does not want this issue to become so contentious that those property owners are alienated if you look at our mission statement it is promoting hunters and anglers and their relationships with private landowners worley said this is a really important issue for us fees and taxes paid by anglers build boat ramps and stock streams with fish those assets are not collected through ad valorem taxes paid by property owners worley said but by the users there are some waterways like the soque river in habersham county that are not floatable during certain times of the year if a kayaker runs into a low water area and has to get out and walk they could be trespassing a property owner along the soque blackhawk fly fishing reached by phone said they own both sides of the river and it s non navigable and people cannot float through their property jon ron has been a toccoa river outfitter since 2007 in fannin county juanita edwards who owns the business with her husband ron said if property owners on the flint succeed with restrictions the same thing could happen on the toccoa and waterways in north georgia there s not a way to be on this river without floating through some private property juanita edwards said she recalled a property owner on one stretch on the upper toccoa who stretched a cable and signage across the water because he owned both sides of the river he had guys on four wheelers out there patrolling the river she said worley and the georgia wildlife federation do not want to be caught in the middle of a dispute between landowners anglers and boaters we work with private landowners to make sure that they can manage their lands for wildlife and we do some advisement with them he said but one of our primary roles is also to monitor and make sure that the interests of hunters anglers and the public are served at the capitol correction an earlier version of this story should have said samuel brewton iii is related to the family that owns property along the flint river

plunged all the way down to 31 percent at this point even the tech giants are extremely concerned about what is coming for years nothing could seem to quash the relentless optimism of the big tech companies and their stocks soared to absolutely absurd heights but now everything has changed as we head into the second half of this year the following comes from the washington post big tech is bracing for an economic recession and an uncertain future that in turn is triggering more economic angst the biggest tech firms most of whom report quarterly earnings next week have offered recent hints they are hunkering down news of layoffs and hiring slowdowns have become commonplace across silicon valley start ups are saying capital is drying up workers are being put on notice that businesses are changing i don t remember ever seeing such pessimism from silicon valley incredibly even the biden administration is admitting that the economy is slowing down but janet yellen insists that what we are witnessing is quite appropriate for a healthy economy treasury secretary janet yellen acknowledged sunday that the u s is experiencing an economic slowdown but downplayed the potential for a recession arguing that the country is in a period of transition following rapid economic growth the economy is slowing down yellen said on nbc news meet the press adding that a correction is appropriate for a healthy economy you can believe her if you want but she also told us that inflation would be transitory and we can all see how that prediction turned out even though we are still only in the early stages of this new recession lines are already getting really long at food banks all over the nation the cost of living continues to soar to unprecedented heights and this is hitting the poor harder than anyone in the months ahead we should expect to see a tsunami of layoffs stunning declines in housing prices hordes of small businesses going under and a tremendous spike in the number of bankruptcies needless to say all of this will not be good for the financial markets either the stage is clearly set for the sort of historic economic meltdown that i have been warning about for a long time and the pain that our society will experience will be extremely severe i hope that you are using this summer to get prepared for the difficult times that are ahead of us the remainder of 2022 is not going to be pleasant and 2023 is going to be even worse

north american markets to the cloud provider in a phased approach starting with us options market nasdaq mrx over the last 10 years nasdaq has been moving its surrounding systems that support trading into a public cloud environment but the trading systems themselves and the matching engines had been on premise aws has committed to create a private local zone within nasdaq s primary carteret data centre in new jersey and nasdaq mrx is due to migrate to the cloud in the fourth quarter of this year adena friedman nasdaq we are on track with mrx and what we ve been learning is really helping us make sure we re optimizing for power in the context of bringing the aws infrastructure into the data centre while we build it out friedman said over the next two years we are going to be expanding the data centre with equinix and expand our power as we work with aws equinix and aws will be doubling both the size and the power of the data center which is due to finish in 2024 and will make it easier for nasdaq s clients to migrate to the cloud in the new aws local zone mrx will migrate to aws outposts and the new fusion platform we ve moved mrx onto fusion and tested that in an on premise environment with clients as a baseline friedman added we will start testing with our clients in the new environment in the fall to make sure that we are delivering the same performance friedman said saas revenue now comprises 35 of total company annual recurring revenue which is a new high the market infrastructure technology business generated 56m in net revenues during the second quarter as the business has increased ability to work with clients on site specifically nasdaq completed phase one deliveries for all four of the largest implementations which are due by the end of the quarter new relationships announced during the quarter included brazilian brokerage xp launching a trading platform for digital assets using nasdaq technology deployed as a saas solution in the cloud in addition climate impact x cix a singapore marketplace and exchange for carbon credits will use cloud based saas technology from nasdaq to power its spot trading platform which is due to launch in early 2023 for financial institutions and institutional investors friedman continued that the overall sentiment from clients at nasdaq s recent annual technology of the future conference was that they saw the advantages of cloud deployments as they contemplate shifts in their operating models and look for new ways to differentiate their offerings she added that most new clients are signing saas based contracts which are more scalable over the long term although a lot of clients are still on premises we are really encouraged by the saas orientation of the new sales said friedman as we move forward and sign more clients in a saas format we are going to have fewer change requests but more stable and more sticky revenues financial performance friedman said markets investors and corporate clients all experienced increased levels of volatility during the second quarter but nasdaq s strategic vision and ability to execute remains clear she added the strength and quality of our businesses puts us in an excellent position to navigate these dynamics nasdaq reported record net revenue of 893m in the second quarter of this year a 6 increase to the prior year period which friedman said demonstrates the group s ability to capture new opportunities in different operating environments she highlighted the index business which had revenue growth of 17m or 16 versus the prior year period this was driven by positive net flows of 71bn over the last 12 months including 25bn in the challenging market experienced in the first half of this year market services segment had net revenues of 310m in the second quarter which friedman said was due to maximizing opportunities presented by robust levels of activity through strong market share and consistent pricing strategies the sheer volume traded on nasdaq exchanges grew by 22 compared to the prior year quarter she added at the end of june nasdaq closing cross set a record for the number of shares traded during the 2022 russell us indexes reconstitution as 3 3 billion shares representing nearly 64bn were executed in two seconds across nasdaq listed securities a 40 increase in shares crossed from last year s event the new closing cross

volatile market periods on record said friedman in the nordic and baltic equities markets the value of shares traded for the first half of 2022 was the second highest since 2008 friedman said that in the second half of 2022 nasdaq will be focused on three pillars of liquidity modernizing marketplaces through technology integrity through its anti financial crime solution and transparency transparency involves executing on the opportunity to provide esg solutions specifically providing advisory services to corporates along with data aggregation and reporting capabilities so they can communicate their esg and climate strategies and progress to investors in june nasdaq closed its acquisition of metrio which expands its corporate reporting esg solution esg advisory is actually the highest demand part of the business but more and more it s moving into reporting said friedman we re seeing more companies onboarding onto onereport and metrio for collecting and reporting esg data out to the rating agencies and that s going to be the long term growth driver for us in addition nasdaq owns puro earth a carbon removal marketplace in europe which is a small part of group revenues today we see puro earth as a 10 to five year plan to build out a really successful marketplace there friedman said

wise art to nft a major picasso art case for two violins including the original art piece nft and art design by pedro sandoval see video here geneva madrid and new york july 25 2022 wisekey international holding ltd wisekey six wihn nasdaq wkey a leading global cybersecurity ai blockchain and iot company today announced that its wise art 2 1 nft marketplace will create an nft for a major cubist art piece by picasso art the magic violin as a phygital package including the original artwork and a hologram version of the nft which will be broadcasted in two different museums simultaneously using the latest hologram technology picasso who was greatly influenced by japanese art in the early 20th century was passionate about cutting out shapes of cardboard and any other material like metal wood and paper which then he could shape and split into geometrical forms flattening 3ds into two dimensional renderings artists around picasso cut glued and assembled everyday life materials which they found in their studios like newspapers wallpaper scraps music scores the shapes of the cut outs were simple geometrical shapes their use was critical to the evolution of cubism it allowed color to be reintroduced in order to suggest a certain depth by superimposing different planes it answered a profound need to explode the accepted canons of art to appropriate the concrete realities of an industrialized world the use of pasted paper can be divided into three distinct periods the first to which the magic violin belongs employs a framework either painted or drawn which sets up a dialogue with the pasted pieces of newspaper colored paper or as in this case music scores the second period between february 1913 and the early spring of that year saw the use of the real object as a form of expression clearing the way for what was to be called synthetic cubism in the third period between march 1914 and the beginning of summer picasso experimented with the effect of materials in his video pedro sandoval romanticises a true story where two violins were stolen from le douanier rousseau another french artist known for his naïve renderings of nature in paris the case holding the two violins was left empty picasso who greatly admired the saddened artist replaced the violins with a cut out shape of a violin and placed it in the empty case for his friend the case with the cardboard violin is now the property of a spanish collector marco salazar ruiz grandson the art piece was recently exhibited as follows in 2020 at the museum of the royal conservatory of music in madrid founded by queen maría cristina in 1830 in 2021 at the san clemente cultural center in toledo in the times of alfonso vii in 1085 in 2022 in the city of san clemente in cuenca by the

in five cases of breast cancer are considered her2 positive 3 her2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor growth promoting protein expressed on the surface of many types of tumors including breast gastric lung and colorectal cancers and is one of many biomarkers expressed in breast cancer tumors 4 her2 expression is currently defined as either positive or negative and is determined by an ihc test which estimates the amount of her2 protein on a cancer cell and or an ish test which counts the copies of the her2 gene in cancer cells 4 5 her2 positive cancers are defined as ihc 3 ihc 2 ish 4 her2 negative cancers are currently defined as ihc 0 ihc 1 or ihc 2 ish 4 approximately half of all patients with breast cancer have tumors with low her2 expression with a her2 ihc score of 1 or a her2 ihc score of 2 in combination with a negative ish test an expression level not currently eligible for her2 targeted therapy 3 6 7 8 low her2 expression occurs in both hr positive and hr negative disease 9 her2 testing is routinely used to determine appropriate treatment options for patients with metastatic breast cancer targeting the lower range of expression in the her2 spectrum may offer another approach to delay disease progression and extend survival in patients with metastatic breast cancer 10 currently patients with low her2 expression with hr positive tumors have limited treatment options following progression on endocrine hormone therapy 11 few targeted options are available for those who are hr negative 12 about enhertu enhertu trastuzumab deruxtecan fam trastuzumab

ultomiris ravulizumab has been recommended for marketing authorisation in the european union eu as an add on to standard therapy for the treatment of adult patients with generalised myasthenia gravis gmg who are anti acetylcholine receptor achr antibody positive if authorised ultomiris would be the first and only approved long acting c5 complement inhibitor for the treatment of achr antibody positive gmg in the eu the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp of the european medicines agency based its positive opinion on results from the champion mg phase iii trial in this trial ultomiris was superior to placebo in the primary endpoint of change from baseline in the myasthenia gravis activities of daily living profile mg adl total score at week 26 a patient reported scale

the treatment of adult patients with gmg who are achr antibody positive ultomiris was approved in the us for adults with gmg who are achr antibody positive in april 2022 and regulatory reviews are ongoing in additional countries including japan notes gmg gmg is a rare autoimmune disorder characterised by loss of muscle function and severe muscle weakness 2 eighty percent of people with gmg are achr antibody positive meaning they produce specific antibodies anti achr that bind to signal receptors at the neuromuscular junction nmj the connection point between nerve cells and the muscles they control 2 4 5 10 11 this binding activates the complement system which is essential to the body s defence against infection causing the immune system to attack the nmj 2 this leads to inflammation and a breakdown in communication between the brain and the muscles 2 champion mg the global phase iii randomised double blind placebo controlled multicentre 26 week trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of ultomiris in adults with gmg the trial enrolled 175 patients across north america europe asia pacific and japan participants were required to have a confirmed myasthenia gravis diagnosis at least

a delaware judge agreed to fast track the case with an october trial date instead of february that musk wanted twitter inc scored an early win against elon musk in its fight to make him complete his 44 billion buyout as a delaware judge agreed to fast track the case with an october trial date chancery court chief judge kathaleen st j mccormick on tuesday scheduled the trial for five days in the fall instead of two weeks in february as the billionaire requested twitter argued it was suffering under the tesla inc founder s withdrawal from the deal and disparagement of the social media company the ruling marks the first victory for twitter in a case in which many legal experts say musk will be the underdog in a hearing in wilmington the judge made clear she saw little merit in musk s scheduling arguments saying his lawyers underestimate the ability of this court to quickly process complex disputes in merger and acquisition cases mccormick found that the battle over the teetering transaction was creating a cloud of uncertainty over twitter the reality is continued delays threaten imminent harm to the company she said the judge had no questions for twitter s lawyer after his argument but did stop musk s attorney when he called the sept 19 trial start twitter proposed preposterous she cited a past case that moved to trial within three months and rejected the musk lawyer s argument that she herself took a year to get another case to trial noting the constraints of the pandemic at the time mccormick told the parties to propose specific october dates for the non jury trial and wrapped up the hearing held remotely to accommodate her own case of covid in just over an hour and a half twitter jumps twitter shares jumped as much as 5 4 after the ruling they were trading at 39 32 up 2 4 at 3 16 p m in new york from the day musk tweeted that the deal was on hold in mid may the stock had fallen as much as 22 it hasn t traded near the deal price of 54 20 a share since the first two weeks after the acquisition was announced lawyers for san francisco based twitter had said they needed only four days to prove the world s richest person must honor his agreement twitter filed suit last week to force musk to consummate the transaction in tuesday s hearing a lawyer for twitter argued that musk was contractually obligated to use his best efforts to close deal instead he is doing the exact opposite attorney william savitt told the judge he s engaging in sabotage under the buyout agreement musk is obligated to finalize the deal within two days of all the closing conditions being met savitt said those conditions will be met in early september he said mr musk has no intention of keeping any of his promises the lawyer said warp speed musk s legal team has said twitter was unfairly pushing for a warp speed trial musk said twitter violated the terms of the buyout deal by not turning over detailed information about so called spam bot accounts within its system the case requires a forensic review and analysis of large swaths of data about the bots along with other legal issues musk s lawyers said in the filing andrew rossman a lawyer for musk argued at the hearing that there was no need to rush a trial to meet an october deadline specified in the deal the important date is when the financing commitments for the purchase expire near the end of april of next year he told the judge a february trial would give the court enough time to decide the case and leave room for an appeal rossman said the idea of running this case in 60 days was extraordinary he said of twitter s proposed schedule it s a preposterous time frame rossman dismissed twitter s assertion that musk is trying to run out the clock so the financing commitments lapse his client continued to use his best efforts to do the deal by lining up financing and having his lawyers stay in communication with twitter on the details right up to the day the company filed suit he said mr musk has no motivation to harm twitter given that he s its second largest shareholder rossman said fast court in the end he failed to persuade mccormick to deny twitter an expedited schedule in interrupting his argument the judge pointed to a 2001 merger fight between chicken processors tyson foods inc and ibp inc that went to trial within three months the chancery judge in that case ordered tyson to proceed with the 4 7 billion buyout of its rival after it sought to cancel the deal mccormick rejected rossman s citation of a case she presided over herself private equity firm kohlberg s effort to walk away from a 550 million acquisition of cake supplier decopac holdings from snow phipps group llc that took a year to get to trial questions arose about the buyout just as the pandemic was gaining traction she noted in what could be an ominous foreshadowing for musk mccormick ordered kohlberg to close the deal chancery judges in delaware the corporate home to more than half of u s public companies are known for being able to parse legal thickets of complex merger and acquisition disputes more quickly than many other us courts unlike in some states where it can take several years to get a case to trial delaware chancery court generally moves quicker with cases often argued within five or six months of being filed the case is twitter v musk 22 0613 delaware chancery court wilmington

pleased to report the first set of results since my appointment as permanent ceo the excellent performance delivered in the first half is testament to the strength of our strategy yet again our focus on recruiting stem specialists in markets with high demand and limited supply has underpinned our continued success the execution of this strategy has been made possible by the hard work and dedication of our people across 45 locations in 14 countries our consultants have worked tirelessly throughout the last six months to place a record 10 400 stem specialists delivering on our purpose of bringing skilled people together to build the future alongside the strong sales performance key highlights in the period include the work we ve undertaken to improve our employer value proposition the launch of a new global brand identity and significant strides made against our esg objectives each is explored in more detail below growth against an uncertain economic backdrop while there has clearly been heightened macro economic uncertainty in the last six months demand from our clients for the skills our candidates possess has continued to grow strongly while supply remains tight this supply constraint is acute entrenched and increasing yoy across our core markets this dynamic represents a huge opportunity for sthree and our creative approach to talent acquisition over the last two years we have proven beyond doubt that our focus on stem and flexible talent has been in greater demand than more generalist recruitment strategies as demonstrated by our performance throughout the pandemic and the speed of our subsequent recovery in 2020 the year which was most affected by the pandemic crisis our net fees only declined by 8 yoy in the following year the resilience of our business model coupled with the accelerating demand for stem talent needed to overcome the challenges brought on by the pandemic helped us to deliver an exceptionally fast recovery with net fees growing by 19 yoy this resilience together with the forward visibility of our growing contractor order book allows us to retain a confident outlook going into the second half despite the uncertain economic backdrop record h1 net fees and good profit growth net fee growth has been strong throughout the first half driven by continued high demand from clients for candidates with stem skills this increase has been seen across the breadth of the group with all our top five largest markets delivering double digit growth similarly our top three stem disciplines technology life sciences and engineering have all generated yoy growth greater than 15 as announced in our half year trading update this performance was ahead of expectations leading to an upgrade to expectations for full year profitability it has been a record six months for net fees particularly pleasing is the fact that q2 was the first period where we were able to show true like for like growth against the previous year as in the second quarter of 2021 we had largely recovered from the impact of the pandemic we can now say with confidence that the growth we are delivering is more than merely a post covid rebound our focus on contract has seen this area grow faster than permanent growing by 30 yoy in constant currency and now representing 77 hy 2021 74 of our net fee generation in the period again this was driven by good performances across the business with double digit growth in contract net fees delivered by all regions and sectors demonstrating a widespread excellent execution of our strategy permanent also delivered a good performance up 11 yoy in constant currency despite making a conscious decision to focus headcount growth into contract teams reported operating profit for the period was gbp44 6 million up 61 yoy in constant currency hy 2021 gbp28 2 million this was driven primarily by net fee growth but also benefited from increased productivity per head which was up 14 yoy our operating profit conversion ratio was very high in the period at 22 hy 2021 17 in line with previous guidance on headcount and other investments that will flow through in the second half we expect this to decline in the short term before rising again as we begin to see the longer term benefit from those investments while we expect productivity to revert to more normal levels over time as headcount grows we are confident it will remain above pre pandemic levels demand for stem skills continues to grow at pace demand for candidates with stem skills has continued to grow underpinned by the urgent need to tackle global challenges whether it is increasing the renewable energy supply supporting the increasing digitalisation of its business or strengthening supply chains we have the expert

net fees were up 25 yoy primarily attributable to our strategic focus on contract business which now accounts for 77 of the group net fees and delivered growth of 30 yoy we are well positioned for the second half of the year as we continue to build and benefit from a strong contractor book our contractor order book increased by 35 yoy reflecting the ongoing high demand for skilled contractors across all our markets permanent net fees were up 11 yoy primarily driven by growing demand for technology talent in the emea excluding dach region the group is well diversified in line with our

reported operating profit was gbp44 6 million hy 2021 gbp28 2 million up 61 yoy a very strong conversion ratio was recorded in the half and although this is anticipated to decline in the second half as a result of the investments that we have planned it demonstrates the ability of the business to deliver a high conversion ratio the investments are designed to allow us to sustainably deliver these levels of margins from 2024 onwards total group period end headcount was up 13 yoy with average headcount up 10 yoy we continued to see our productivity per head grow up 14 yoy but as previously

of this exercise we remain committed to our ambition to sustainably deliver an operating profit conversion ratio in excess of 21 we will focus on growing market share on a net fee basis rather than revenue and will reflect our intent to be an employer of choice via enps benchmarking while linking our societal goals to our path to net zero carbon emissions our free cash conversion metric will no longer be reported as a key ambition as it no longer reflects our current business model the updated ambitions for 2024 are therefore as follows to grow our net fees faster than our peer group across

contract represented 77 of the group net fees in the half year hy 2021 74 and the group contract margin increased slightly to 21 7 hy 2021 21 3 operating expenses increased by 16 yoy on a reported

2022 the yoy net currency movements versus sterling resulted in a modest net headwind to the reported performance of the group reducing net fees by approximately gbp2 5 million and operating profit by

options in place and the expected future settlement of certain tracker shares the dilutive effect on eps from tracker shares will vary in future periods depending on the profitability of the

together with its balance sheet position the board aims to offer shareholders long term ordinary dividend growth within a targeted dividend cover range of 2 5x to 3 0x through the cycle the board

started the period with net cash of gbp57 5 million and closed the period with net cash of gbp48 4 million this strong cash balance positions us well for the group wide strategic investments in our people talent acquisition and digital infrastructure which is weighted towards the second half of the year and will require significant expenditure over the coming years accessible funding on 31 may 2021 the group had total accessible liquidity of gbp103 4 million made up of gbp48 4 million in net cash hy 2021 gbp47 5 million a gbp50 0 million revolving credit facility and a gbp5 0 million overdraft the net cash position reflected the cash generated by the group s significantly improved yoy trading performance offset by the increased working capital requirements the group also maintains a gbp20 0 million accordion facility as well as a substantial working capital position reflecting net cash due to sthree for placements already undertaken during the current period the group did not draw down any of the above credit facilities hy 2021 gbpnil on 21 july 2022 management successfully negotiated a new gbp50 0 million three year revolving credit facility to refinance the existing gbp50 0 million facility which was due to mature in may 2023 with key terms and conditions remaining largely similar to the previous facility since this is a new credit facility it was treated as an extinguishment of the original facility and all associated costs and legal fees incurred were recognised immediately in the income statement the new facility is subject to financial covenants and any funds borrowed under the new facility will bear a minimum annual interest rate of 1 2 above the benchmark sterling overnight index average sonia the group continues to retain a strong financial position and has sufficient cash reserves to meet its obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of this interim financial report the board therefore

act 2006 the interim financial report of the group was approved by the board for issue on 22 july 2022 going concern the financial information contained in this interim financial report has been prepared on the going concern basis the directors have at the time of approving the half year financial report a reasonable expectation that the group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements in the assessment of the going concern basis of preparation the directors considered the future performance of the group including its cashflows and liquidity position the directors also assessed the group s financial position including accessible

momentum of 2021 continued into the first half of 2022 for the six months ended 31 may 2022 the group delivered exceptionally strong results across its core markets and sectors driven by the continued execution of the well established strategy and reflecting ongoing strength in new placement activity this is a considerable achievement given the ongoing volatility of the external markets and is testament to the continued strength of demand for the exceptional candidates we work with and their stem skills in addition the group made significant progress in the previously guided investment in its people talent acquisition and infrastructure to drive long term sustainable growth the group has prepared a base case forecast reflecting the trading performance in the first half of the year and expectations for market developments over the period to 30 november 2023 the base case scenario was sensitised to reflect a severe but plausible downside scenario including the recent geo political crisis in europe its possible unfavourable impact on the demand for stem experts inflation rates and interest rates and other principal risks on the group s performance in the severe but plausible downside scenario there remains a strong significant liquidity position and significant headroom against banking covenants more to follow dow jones newswires july 25 2022 02 00 et 06 00 gmt dj sthree half year results 9 in light of the war in ukraine which commenced on 24 february 2022 the group has considered whether any adjustments are required to reported amounts in the financial statements the group does not have any operations in ukraine or russia nor it is directly affected by trading restrictions or sanctions whilst we are conscious of the broader uncertainties arising from the war in ukraine and its potential macro economic consequences our direct exposure is minimal there is no impact on the group s ability to continue as a going concern because of this event and the management continues to monitor the above risks in order to be able to react agilely to changes in the market accounting policies the accounting policies used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements are consistent with those applied in the previous financial year and corresponding interim reporting period except for the adoption of new and amended standards effective as of 1 december 2021 as set out below new and amended standards effective in 2022 and adopted by the group the following amendment to the accounting standards issued by the iasb and endorsed by the uk and eu

amended standards amendments to ifrs 7 ifrs 9 ifrs 16 and ias 39 interest rate benchmark reform phase 2 the replacement of interbank offered rates ibors with alternative reference rates arrs began

accordance with the amendments to ifrs 9 financial instruments published in 2019 phase 1 and 2020 phase 2 the adoption of these amendments and the transition to arrs have an immaterial financial impact the implications on the trading results of our segments of ibor reform have also been assessed and the expected impact is immaterial new and amended standards that are applicable to the group

class operational platform through data technology and infrastructure the board approved of the group wide infrastructure investment programme due to start in h2 2022 accordingly the management took this opportunity to review the entire book of legacy development costs and assets under construction capitalised in previous periods hence the decision was taken to expense nearly gbp1 7 million worth

group was entitled to the grant until the end of 2021 impact of covid 19 the covid 19 health crisis had implications on certain items of income in the group condensed consolidated financial statements affecting the profit before tax for the prior period these items were not treated as exceptional government assistance income in the prior period the group took advantage of job retention schemes launched by the national government of france whereby it was reimbursed for a portion of salaries of furloughed personnel a benefit of gbp0 2 million was recognised and presented as a deduction in reporting the related staff expense no such benefits were received in the current period 4 income tax expense income tax for the half year is accrued based on the directors best estimate of the average annual effective tax rate etr for the financial year the tax charge for the half year amounted to gbp12 3 million hy 2021 gbp8 6 million at an etr of 27 8 hy 2021 30 9 on continuing operations the group s etr primarily varies with the mix of taxable profits by territory non deductibility of the accounting charge for ltip s and other one off tax items the etr was higher in the prior period mainly due to an increase in the uncertain tax provision in 2021 relating to transfer pricing risks in the prior year the group held a provision of gbp1 4 million in respect of an appeal to the general court gc of the european court of justice on state aid on 8 june 2022 the gc dismissed the appeal the group has decided not to appeal this decision as the gbp1 4 million liability has already been settled pending resolution of the case there is no additional financial impact a deferred tax asset of gbp4 2 million as at 30 november 2021 deferred tax asset of gbp4 5 million is in the financial statements for the six months ended 31 may 2022 this comprised deferred tax assets of gbp4 2 million as at 30 november 2021 gbp4 6 million and deferred tax liabilities of gbpnil as at 30 november 2021 gbp0 1 million the deferred tax assets arise on accelerated depreciation share based payments and provisions the movement in the period is primarily as a result of reclassing the uncertain tax provisions from deferred tax to current tax at the reporting date the group had unused tax losses of gbp35 4 million as at 30 november 2021 gbp34 1 million available for offset against future profits no deferred tax asset was recognised against these losses 5 discontinued operations in the financial year ending 30 november 2020 the group liquidated the australian subsidiary sthree

april 2022 was assessed to be 83 3 falling slightly short of the 85 0 requirement this situation arose due to the increasing profitability of sthree austria gmbh which at that time was not a guarantor but subsequently acceded as a guarantor since the facility has been undrawn throughout the current and prior period the financial impact of the technical breach was limited to an increase in the commitment fee base margin from 45 5 to 70 0 basis points subsequent to that and in light of immaterial size of the breach on 27 april 2022 the lenders agreed to unconditionally waive the event of default with immediate effect on 21 july 2022 the management successfully negotiated a new credit facility that extends to june 2025 with options to extend it until 2027 with key terms and conditions remaining largely similar to the previous facility since this is a new credit facility it was treated as an extinguishment of the original facility and all associated costs and legal fees incurred

first and only biologic recommended for eu approval in patients with severe asthma with no phenotype or biomarker limitations astrazeneca s tezspire tezepelumab has been recommended for marketing authorisation in the european union eu as an add on therapy in patients 12 years and older with severe asthma who are inadequately controlled with high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp of the european medicines agency based its positive opinion on results from the pathfinder clinical trial programme the marketing authorisation application included results from the pivotal navigator phase iii trial in which tezspire demonstrated superiority across every primary and key secondary endpoint in patients with severe asthma compared to placebo when added to standard therapy 1 tezspire is the first and only biologic for severe asthma that acts at the top of the inflammatory cascade by blocking thymic stromal lymphopoietin tslp an epithelial cytokine 1 4 tezspire consistently and significantly reduced asthma exacerbations across phase ii and iii clinical trials which included a broad population of severe asthma patients irrespective of key biomarkers including blood eosinophil counts allergic status and fractional exhaled nitric oxide feno 1 2 dr stephanie korn senior physician in pneumology and respiratory medicine at ikf pneumologie mainz and thoraxklinik heidelberg germany and investigator for the navigator trial said due to the complexity of severe asthma about 60 of patients have multiple drivers of inflammation tezspire is a first in class biologic acting at the top of the inflammation cascade and a much needed potential treatment for patients who continue to struggle with severe uncontrolled asthma mene pangalos executive vice president biopharmaceuticals r d astrazeneca said despite recent advances in treatment many asthma patients continue to experience debilitating symptoms an increased risk of hospitalisation and even death the only biologic recommended for eu approval in severe asthma patients with no phenotype or biomarker limitation tezspire has consistently and significantly reduced exacerbations in clinical trials and has the potential to transform care for a broad population of severe asthma patients results from the navigator phase iii trial were published in the new england journal of medicine in may 2021 there were no clinically meaningful differences in safety results between the tezspire and placebo groups in the navigator trial 1 in clinical trials the most common adverse events in patients who received tezspire were pharyngitis rash arthralgia and injection site reactions 5 tezspire was approved as an add on maintenance treatment of adult and paediatric patients aged 12 years and older with severe asthma in the us in december 2021 and is under regulatory review in japan and many other countries around the world 6 notes severe asthma asthma is a heterogeneous disease affecting approximately 14 million people living with the disease in the european union and an estimated 339 million people worldwide 7 8 up to 10 of asthma patients have severe asthma 9 10 despite the use of inhaled asthma controller medicine currently available biologic therapies and oral corticosteroids ocs many severe asthma patients remain uncontrolled 9 11 due to the complexity of severe asthma many patients have unclear or multiple drivers of inflammation and may not qualify for or respond well to a current biologic medicine 10 13 severe uncontrolled asthma is debilitating with patients experiencing frequent exacerbations significant limitations on lung function and a reduced quality of life 9 10 14 patients with severe asthma are at an increased risk of mortality and compared to patients with persistent asthma have twice the risk of asthma related hospitalisations 15 17 there is also a significant socio economic burden with these patients accounting for approximately 50 of asthma related costs 18 clinical trials in addition to the phase iib pathway trial the pathfinder programme included two phase iii trials navigator1 19 and source 20 21 the programme also includes additional mechanistic and long term safety trials 22 23 navigator is a phase iii randomised double blinded placebo controlled trial in adults 18 80 years old and adolescents 12 17 years old with severe uncontrolled asthma who were receiving standard of care soc soc was treatment with medium or high dose inhaled corticosteroids plus at least one additional controller medication with or without daily ocs treatment the trial population included approximately equal proportions of patients with high 300 cells per microlitre and low 300 cells per microlitre blood eosinophil counts the trial comprised a five to six week screening period a 52 week treatment period and a 12 week post treatment follow up period all patients received their prescribed controller medications without change throughout the trial 1 the primary efficacy endpoint was the annualised asthma exacerbation rate aaer during the 52 week treatment period key secondary endpoints included the effect of tezspire on lung function asthma control and health related quality of life 1 as part of prespecified analyses the aaer over 52 weeks was also assessed in patients grouped by baseline blood eosinophil count feno level and serum specific immunoglobin e ige status perennial aeroallergen sensitivity positive or negative 1 these are inflammatory biomarkers used by clinicians to inform treatment options and involve tests analysing a patient s blood eosinophils ige and exhaled air feno there were no clinically meaningful differences in safety results between the tezspire and placebo groups in the navigator trial 1 the most frequently reported adverse events for tezspire were nasopharyngitis upper respiratory tract infection and headache 1 navigator is the first phase iii trial to show benefit in severe asthma irrespective of eosinophils by targeting tslp 1 these results support the fda breakthrough therapy designation granted to tezspire in september 2018 for patients with severe asthma without an eosinophilic phenotype in july 2021 tezspire was the first and only biologic to be granted priority review in the us for the treatment of asthma by the fda patients who participated in our phase iii trials were eligible to continue in destination a phase iii extension trial assessing long term safety and efficacy 22 tezspire tezspire tezepelumab is being developed by astrazeneca in collaboration with amgen as a first in class human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of tslp a key epithelial cytokine that sits at the top of multiple inflammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of allergic eosinophilic and other types of airway inflammation associated with severe asthma including airway hyperresponsiveness 2 3 tslp is released in response to multiple triggers associated with asthma exacerbations including allergens viruses and other airborne particles 2 3 expression of tslp is increased in the airways of patients with asthma and has been correlated with disease severity 2 4 blocking tslp may prevent the release of pro inflammatory cytokines by immune cells resulting in the prevention of asthma exacerbations and improved asthma control 1 2 4 tezspire acts at the top of the inflammation cascade and has the potential to help address a broad

by marc l verville july 23 2022 next tuesday the city council will vote on placing phil brock s transfer tax initiative on the november ballot the council must vote yes to give the voters the choice the recent disheartening budget discussions outlined a lack of funds for basic resident services such as libraries and parks which are still largely off limits to the residents because of funding constraints apparently there is not even enough money to maintain fields for our children to play unless parents can afford to pay for access brock s measure acknowledges that the city s financial situation is not yet back to pre covid status it also acknowledges that the situation is temporary which is why it includes a sunset clause it would provide a bridge while the recovery continues to address the issues of safety and resident access to critical services brock s initiative would generate funds to expand the fire department s community response unit that has made a notable difference in management of the critical homeless situation the critical point is that while no one wants to pay more taxes brock s measure is temporary as it should be given the fact that under the existing city tax structure the annual general fund revenues are projected to exceed the pre covid amount in about 23 months within 5 years from that point the city projects that the annual general fund revenues will be about 65 million per year higher than they were pre covid under the city s existing tax structure this does not even account for the anticipated impact of a revitalized downtown and promenade which will add another 25 to 40 million per year in general fund revenues from improved sales taxes on top of these basic city projections there will also be major new hotels opening in the interim adding more transient occupancy tax revenue confusion and misdirection endemic to himmelrich s proposal against this financial backdrop mayor sue himmelrich s privately funded ballot initiative inexplicably proposes to hit residents with one of the highest transfer taxes in the state if the mayor believes her own finance department s projections and the overall city outlook why is it now necessary to also directly tax the residents in perpetuity one answer may be ms himmelrich s admission in a neighborhood group meeting that wasteful city spending was a problem before she was seated on the council and that she could not make headway with the issue so that suffices for a perpetual resident tax but the financial illiteracy gets worse since affordable housing generates virtually no property tax revenue under state law it is only a net driver of escalating city municipal costs by dedicating funding only to affordable housing construction in perpetuity without also providing funds for infrastructure and services the setup will only destabilize the city s future finances generating the need for yet more direct taxation confusion and misdirection are endemic to this entire initiative first ms himmelrich s marketing materials improperly emphasized her mayor title even though it had nothing to do with the city government the misdirection extended to the title of the initiative including the term homeless prevention another entirely marketing driven term misleadingly applied the fine print says that this has nothing to do with the homeless crisis we are currently trying to address then there is the question of what ms himmelrich s proposal does with the money that is as confusing as the justifications for starters there are no stated outcomes to the spending no defined scale no success criteria the only stated and quantified objective is collecting more money from the residents forever the 10 million annual school district gift was not even requested by the school district then 50 percent of the remaining balance after paying up to 6 percent of the receipts for an entirely new and growing bureaucracy is directed to affordable housing construction that does not benefit existing santa monica residents and finally homeless prevention has nothing to do with the homeless crisis so what are the issues supposedly addressed by this initiative affordable housing there s still no consensus on what santa monica requires the affordable housing volumes that have been mandated to santa monica by the state are the result of an entirely arbitrary process that was heavily directed by special interest lobbying housing affordability is a regional issue but while santa monica has one of the densest affordable housing requirements los angeles has created its affordable housing overlay in the san fernando valley it also ignores the fact that roughly 10 percent of santa monica s multi family stock is affordable housing that has been built since the 1980s within the city s current financial structure there is no reason that would not continue homeless prevention is actually two issues rent assistance linked to rent burdening and rent burdening linked to homelessness in ms himmelrich and her husband michael soloff s transfer tax presentation roadshow they describe the problem as dire their support consists of a hud website dashboard that notes its statistics are from 2014 to 2018 over four years old the website portal posits that cost burdening greater than 30 percent of income impacts 9 585 renter households in the city or roughly a third of santa monica s total renter households while the hud tables are labeled for santa monica it s pretty clear that los angeles county income data is being used as there does not appear to be a santa monica area median income ami the himmelrich initiative s section ii findings and purpose only references the los angeles county ami data being used to calculate the burdening this is also what our own rent control board rcb uses in their 2021 annual report affordability analysis the rcb report notes that according to the u s census bureau the median household income for santa monica is higher than the los angeles ami how much higher almost 25 percent higher at 98 300 what is rent burdened at 80 000 is not rent burdened at 98 300 the 18 300 difference equates to 458 per month in additional income available for rent we can corroborate other data points on the issue the rcb s 2021 annual report references the housing is key state program that awards covid 19 rent relief to date 2 337 santa monica households have received awards this is only 24 percent of the claimed 9 585 rent burdened households the award number as of april 5 was 1 878 households so with only 459 added in the last 3 5 months the program seems to be winding down other reference points in the rcb report show that 434 means tested fee waivers were granted in santa monica in 2021 less than 2 percent of total controlled units finally pre 1999 controlled units and market rate controlled units leased in the last 6 years make up 69 percent of all rent controlled units both the recent market rate controlled units and the market rate non controlled units have been leased out on a means tested basis by housing providers so that rents max out at 30 percent of income the data does not support the assertion of massive rent burdening the casual approach to problem quantification as the basis for public policy is simply unacceptable rent burdening is a risk factor in homelessness linkage of rent burdening to homelessness risk has been endlessly repeated for dramatic effect the research does not support this contention either rent burdening was not even listed as a risk factor for first time homelessness in the comprehensive california policy lab analysis predicting and preventing homelessness in los angeles issued in september 2019 the report noted that the majority of single adults who will experience first time homelessness or a return to homelessness are already clients of mainstream county agencies which presents opportunities for intervention these clients are very vulnerable and are interacting with multiple systems such as the mental health and criminal justice systems this profile does not describe a third of santa monica s renter households like most policy initiatives in the city no city specific analysis was performed to define the problem and validate the thesis the actual level of research done for this perpetual proposal was revealed in a neighborhood group discussion with ms himmelrich on the tax initiative she disputed my assertion that the tax would disproportionately impact the residents by claiming that she had personally reviewed county transaction data i supported my conclusion based on the review of the prior 12 months of broker transaction records my conclusions were later confirmed with an admission that ms himmelrich had looked at only 2 months of sales records this theme of superficial problem definition and analysis permeates the entire himmelrich transfer tax initiative it demonstrates clear disdain for the voters and the residents it is marketed solely with virtue signaling to justify the objective of endlessly collecting more money from residents not addressing their core concerns the fact that it is permanent and shielded from future councils is unacceptable as such this initiative has no merit and is destructive what little real research that was done was simply polling research what really mattered was to determine the marketing approach to voters it s clear that ms himmelrich considers polling research to be the only research required for policy formulation it is self evident that basing public policy entirely on polling can only make for disastrous policy santa monica has suffered through enough bad policy we do not need any more the council must vote to present the voters with the more reasonable financial bridge alternative initiative presented by councilmember brock which is intended to address real resident concerns on a temporary basis in the meantime they city needs to get serious about getting its financial house in order
