try to just make sure you make the right one all right right okay let me say from the start for this law the american people one and the special interest lost american people one and the special interests lost we have not wavered we ve not flinched and we ve not given in instead we re delivering results for the american people we didn t tear down we build up we didn t look back we look forward and today today offers further proof that the soul america s vibrant the future of america is bright and the promise of america is real and just beginning it s about showing the american and the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the all the talk of its demise not just for the privileged few but for all of us my fellow americans that s the choice we face we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build future where everybody has an even shot that s the america i believe in that s what i believe in and today today we ve come step closer to making that america real advertisement what s in the new climate and health care law share copy link copy president joe biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he signed tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for some 13 million people who are purchasing their own health care policies through the affordable care act biggest u s investment by far in climate change the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water how to pay for all of this one of the biggest revenue raisers in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year yet money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade sinema was instrumental in doing away with other tax proposals and shaping the final plan extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which recently put out a new report on long term projections what s left behind the package nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned remains a sizable undertaking and along with covid 19 relief and the gop 2017 tax cuts is among the more substantial bills from congress in years while congress did pass and biden signed into law a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that was part of the white house s initial vision the democrats other big priorities have slipped away gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs also allowed to expire is the enhanced child care credit that was providing 300 a month during the pandemic ___associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report

try to just make sure you make the right one all right right okay let me say from the start for this law the american people one and the special interest lost american people one and the special interests lost we have not wavered we ve not flinched and we ve not given in instead we re delivering results for the american people we didn t tear down we build up we didn t look back we look forward and today today offers further proof that the soul america s vibrant the future of america is bright and the promise of america is real and just beginning it s about showing the american and the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the all the talk of its demise not just for the privileged few but for all of us my fellow americans that s the choice we face we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build future where everybody has an even shot that s the america i believe in that s what i believe in and today today we ve come step closer to making that america real advertisement what s in the new climate and health care law share copy link copy president joe biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he signed tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for some 13 million people who are purchasing their own health care policies through the affordable care act biggest u s investment by far in climate change the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water how to pay for all of this one of the biggest revenue raisers in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year yet money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade sinema was instrumental in doing away with other tax proposals and shaping the final plan extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which recently put out a new report on long term projections what s left behind the package nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned remains a sizable undertaking and along with covid 19 relief and the gop 2017 tax cuts is among the more substantial bills from congress in years while congress did pass and biden signed into law a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that was part of the white house s initial vision the democrats other big priorities have slipped away gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs also allowed to expire is the enhanced child care credit that was providing 300 a month during the pandemic ___associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report

jobs according to the bureau of labor statistics many of those who resigned cited low pay lack of advancement and feeling disrespected at work as the top reasons behind why they decided to leave their jobs and seek out new employment a pew research center survey found as the great resignation continues in 2022 job scams are on the rise in june the federal trade commission ftc issued a consumer

even on social media according to the ftc fbi and the financial industry regulatory authority finra but despite offering job seekers the promise of new employment the ftc says all these scammers really want is money and people s personal information many people would like to work from home and generate income scammers know this so they place ads often online claiming that they have jobs where you can make thousands of dollars a month working from home with little time and effort the ftc writes but instead of making money you end up paying for starter kits training or certifications that are useless if someone offers you a job and they claim that you can make a lot of money in a short period of time and with little work that s a scam job scam warning signs when looking for a new job there are several red flags to look out for these include payment requirements in order to get a job on the spot interviews without any prior contact from the company and lack of preparation by a hiring manager finra writes on its website other warning signs include the following requests for personal information such as your social security number credit card information or bank account number odd or poorly written text such as typos or unusual wording in the job listing or in other forms of communication pressure to commit to a job quickly or make equipment purchases language that suggests a job is guaranteed or waiting for you or that personal funds are required for purchases interviews arranged for previously undisclosed jobs you should not have to pay an employer or an employment firm to get a job nor should you be asked to provide payment for any materials unless you have been hired and clearly agree to pay for something associated with the job such as supplies or equipment finra said how to protect yourself from a job scam the ftc fbi and finra all share tips on how to protect yourself from falling victim to a job scam these include the following don t pay for

send you a check and then tell you to send part of the money or buy gift cards with it that s a fake check scam and when the check bounces the bank will want you to repay the amount of the fake check the ftc says finra says you should immediately hang up on an interviewer if they ask you to provide personal or financial information or to pay a fee that you did not expect you should also avoid responding to similar written requests about payment if anything about the way the job interview or hiring process seems suspicious contact the organization directly on your own to confirm the

today president joe biden signed into law the inflation reduction act of 2022 the act although the proposal further restricting the availability of long term capital gain treatment with respect to carried interests ultimately was dropped from the final version of the bill the act contains several key tax changes of note corporate amt one of the major headline grabbing provisions of the act is a 15 percent minimum tax on the adjusted financial statement income of certain corporations the corporate amt less a foreign tax credit the corporate amt does not apply to a corporation if its regular income tax exceeds the 15 percent minimum tax the corporations subject to the corporate amt include any corporation other than an s corporation a regulated investment company or a real estate investment trust the average annual adjusted financial statement income of which over a three year period exceeds 1 billion the corporate amt also extends to corporations with a three year average annual adjusted financial statement income of 100 million or more if they are part of a foreign parented multinational group with an average adjusted financial statement income exceeding 1 billion there are special rules relating to corporations that experience changes in ownership there also are rules pursuant to which the adjusted financial statement income of entities under common control may be aggregated due to a last minute modification to the act however portfolio companies owned by private equity firms generally would not become subject to the corporate amt by reason of their potential aggregation with their sister companies a corporation s adjusted financial statement income is its net income or loss as set forth on its applicable financial statement with certain adjustments such as a reduction for depreciation tax deductions while disregarding the amount of depreciation expense with respect to such property an applicable financial statement generally is a financial statement certified as being prepared in accordance with gaap and which is the corporation s 10 k filed with the us securities and exchange commission or if none its audited financial statement or if none then its financial statement filed with any other us federal tax agency in certain circumstances a financial statement made on the basis of international financial reporting standards or a financial statement filed with certain regulatory or governmental bodies will be a corporation s applicable financial statement for a tax exempt organization adjusted financial statement income takes into account only the income of an unrelated trade or business of the organization or income derived from debt financed property to the extent treated as unrelated business taxable income adjusted financial statement income is reduced by the lesser of a the aggregate amount of financial statement net operating loss carryovers or b 80 percent of adjusted financial statement income computed without regard to such a deduction the corporate amt is to take effect with respect to taxable years beginning after december 31 2022 the act authorizes the us department of the treasury to promulgate regulations to carry out the purposes of the corporate amt and such regulations will be necessary to provide more clarity on what is likely to be a complex new regime that deviates in important respects from the traditional conception of corporate taxable income excise tax on repurchases of corporate stock the other major revenue raising provision of the act is a new 1 percent excise tax on the fair market value of the stock repurchased by a covered corporation defined as a us corporation the stock of which is traded on an established securities market also included within the scope of the tax are acquisitions of the stock of a covered corporation by a specified affiliate of such a corporation which is a corporation or partnership more than 50 percent of which is owned directly or indirectly by the covered corporation the taxable amount is reduced by the fair market value of stock issued by the covered corporation during the taxable year including stock issued or provided to employees of the covered corporation or certain affiliates of such a corporation the excise tax is not deductible the excise tax also applies to the acquisition of the stock of a foreign corporation the stock of which is traded on an established securities market by us domestic specified affiliates of that foreign corporation with the specified affiliate being treated as a covered corporation for purposes of the tax in addition the excise tax applies to repurchases of stock by certain corporations and their specified affiliates that inverted from us to foreign status after september 20 2021 some exceptions to the tax apply including in the case of a tax free reorganizations b contributions of repurchased stock or stock of an equivalent value to an employer sponsored retirement plan or employee stock ownership plan c aggregate stock repurchases during a year of no more than 1 million d repurchases by dealers in securities in the ordinary course of business under regulations prescribed by the us department of the treasury e repurchases by regulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts and f repurchases treated as dividends the tax applies to repurchases occurring after december 31 2022 the us treasury department is delegated extensive rulemaking authority to issue regulations under this new excise tax including anti abuse regulations and guidance on special classes of stock and preferred stock clean energy tax credits the act also makes a number of changes to various tax credits pertaining to clean and renewable energy including extending and modifying the production tax credit the energy tax credit and the carbon oxide sequestration credit increasing the energy tax credit for solar and wind facilities placed in service in connection with low income communities establishing a new credit for nuclear power production a new credit for sustainable aviation fuel and a new credit for the production of clean hydrogen extending incentives for second generation biofuel biodiesel renewable diesel and alternative fuels extending and modifying the nonbusiness energy property credit the residential clean energy credit the new energy efficient home credit and the alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit modifying the energy efficient commercial buildings deduction establishing a new credit for qualified commercial clean vehicles extending the advanced energy project credit establishing a new credit for advanced manufacturing production a new credit for clean electricity production a new credit for clean electricity investment a new credit for clean fuel production in addition to the above changes the act substantially modifies the credit for new qualified plug in electric drive motor vehicles which will become the clean vehicle credit and establishes a new credit for previously owned clean vehicles the clean vehicle credit which extends to both plug in electric vehicles with a battery capacity of at least 7 kilowatt hours and to fuel cell vehicles eliminates the phase out of the current credit that is triggered once a vehicle manufacturer has sold 200 000 qualifying vehicles however the clean vehicle credit comes with multiple new restrictions on its availability including component sourcing requirements relating to the use of critical minerals and battery components within the vehicle and a requirement that final assembly occur within north america the act limits the availability of the clean vehicle credit to a single vehicle per year and only then to individuals whose current year and preceding year modified adjusted gross income is no more than 300 000 for married taxpayers 225 000 for head of household filers or 150 000 for other filers furthermore credits will be allowed only for vehicles with a manufacturer s suggested retail price of no more than 80 000 for vans suvs or pickup trucks and 55 000 for other vehicles such as sedans starting in 2024 purchasers can elect to transfer the tax credit to the dealer from which they are buying an eligible vehicle as long as the dealer satisfies certain registration disclosure and other requirements although most of the provisions of the clean vehicle credit begin applying in 2023 the requirement that the final assembly of a vehicle occur within north america takes effect immediately upon the enactment of the act and the component sourcing requirements take effect upon the promulgation of proposed guidance by the us department of the treasury which per the act must occur no later than december 31 2022 there is however a safe harbor rule by which a taxpayer may elect to use the provisions of the existing qualified plug in electric drive motor vehicle credit if that person purchased or entered into a written binding contract to purchase a qualified plug in electric vehicle between january 1 2022 and the date of the act s enactment but the vehicle was placed in service after the enactment of the act the clean vehicle credit will not apply to vehicles acquired after december 31 2032 furthermore in a significant development the act allows certain taxpayers including specified categories of tax exempt entities to elect to receive certain clean energy credits in excess of tax liability as direct pay credits the act also allows non tax exempt taxpayers a one time transfer of certain clean energy credits to other taxpayers additionally the act increases the amount of the research credit that qualified small businesses can elect to treat as a credit against payroll tax by allowing an additional credit of up to 250 000 against the medicare hospital insurance tax for years beginning after december 31 2022 additional tax provisions the act reinstates the superfund excise tax on crude oil received at a us refinery and petroleum products entered into the united states for consumption use or warehousing the excise tax rate will be 16 4 cents per barrel adjusted annually for inflation up from the rate of 9 7 cents per barrel that was in effect before the previous iteration of the tax expired at the end of 1995 the act also extends the limitation on excess business losses of non corporate taxpayers by two years disallowing them through 2028 additional funding for the irs the act appropriates nearly 80 billion over the next decade to fund the operations of the internal revenue service this amount includes approximately 3 billion for taxpayer services approximately 45 billion for tax enforcement activities approximately 25 billion for operations support and nearly 5 billion for the modernization of the irs s business systems

try to just make sure you make the right one all right right okay let me say from the start for this law the american people one and the special interest lost american people one and the special interests lost we have not wavered we ve not flinched and we ve not given in instead we re delivering results for the american people we didn t tear down we build up we didn t look back we look forward and today today offers further proof that the soul america s vibrant the future of america is bright and the promise of america is real and just beginning it s about showing the american and the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the all the talk of its demise not just for the privileged few but for all of us my fellow americans that s the choice we face we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build future where everybody has an even shot that s the america i believe in that s what i believe in and today today we ve come step closer to making that america real advertisement what s in the new climate and health care law share copy link copy president joe biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he signed tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for some 13 million people who are purchasing their own health care policies through the affordable care act biggest u s investment by far in climate change the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water how to pay for all of this one of the biggest revenue raisers in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year yet money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade sinema was instrumental in doing away with other tax proposals and shaping the final plan extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which recently put out a new report on long term projections what s left behind the package nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned remains a sizable undertaking and along with covid 19 relief and the gop 2017 tax cuts is among the more substantial bills from congress in years while congress did pass and biden signed into law a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that was part of the white house s initial vision the democrats other big priorities have slipped away gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs also allowed to expire is the enhanced child care credit that was providing 300 a month during the pandemic ___associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report

millions of americans fall victim to job scams each year here are verified ways to keep you and your money safe when looking for a new job in 2021 a record number of americans voluntarily quit their jobs according to the bureau of labor statistics many of those who resigned cited low pay lack of advancement and feeling disrespected at work as the top reasons behind why they decided to leave their jobs and seek out new employment a pew research center survey found as the great resignation continues in 2022 job scams are on the rise in june the federal trade commission ftc issued a consumer alert warning job seekers about phony job postings here are some tips on how to protect yourself from falling victim to a scam when looking for a new job the sources what we found scammers typically advertise jobs in some of the same ways legitimate employers do they may create fake job listings in online ads on job sites like indeed or linkedin on college employment websites through email and even on social media according to the ftc fbi and the financial industry regulatory authority finra but despite offering job seekers the promise of new employment the ftc says all these scammers really want is money and people s personal information many people would like to work from home and generate income scammers know this so they place ads often online claiming that they have jobs where you can make thousands of dollars a month working from home with little time and effort the ftc writes but instead of making money you end up paying for starter kits training or certifications that are useless if someone offers you a job and they claim that you can make a lot of money in a short period of time and with little work that s a scam job scam warning signs when looking for a new job there are several red flags to look out for these include payment requirements in order to get a job on the spot interviews without any prior contact from the company and lack of preparation by a hiring manager finra writes on its website other warning signs include the following requests for personal information such as your social security number credit card information or bank account number odd or poorly written text such as typos or unusual wording in the job listing or in other forms of communication pressure to commit to a job quickly or make equipment purchases language that suggests a job is guaranteed or waiting for you or that personal funds are required for purchases interviews arranged for previously undisclosed jobs you should not have to pay an employer or an employment firm to get a job nor should you be asked to provide payment for any materials unless you have been hired and clearly agree to pay for something associated with the job such as supplies or equipment finra said how to protect yourself from a job scam the ftc fbi and finra all share tips on how to protect yourself from falling victim to a job scam these include the following don t pay for the promise of a job legitimate employers including the federal government will never ask you to pay to get a job anyone who does is a scammer according to the ftc legitimate employers including the federal government will never ask you to pay to get a job anyone who does is a scammer according to the ftc don t respond to unsolicited requests for an online interview if you are not certain you applied for the job don t engage in a session if you are not certain you applied for the job don t engage in a session do an online search look up the name of the company or the person who is interested in hiring you plus the words scam review or complaint by doing so you might find out they ve scammed other people in the past look up the name of the company or the person who is interested

employee or has been hired to represent the company verify that the company has really scheduled an interview on the date for which you received a request you should also make sure the person leading the interview or engaging in follow up conversations is a current company employee or has been hired to represent the company never bank on a cleared check no legitimate potential employer will ever send you a check and then tell you to send part of the money or buy gift cards with it that s a fake check scam and when the check bounces the bank will want you to repay the amount of the fake check the ftc says finra says you should immediately hang up on an interviewer if they ask you to provide personal or financial information or to pay a fee that you did not expect you should also avoid responding to similar written requests about payment if anything about the way the job interview or hiring process seems suspicious contact the organization directly on your own to confirm the legitimacy of the position before taking any further action finra said

i f there s a primary vital sign for colleges a crude point of reference for outside observers like the pulse of an emergency room patient it s student enrollment a college with thousands of students is usually a sign of healthy fiscal and reputational footing colleges with 1 000 students or fewer may be headed for intensive care or worse small comes with inherent challenges smaller institutions can t take advantage of the economies of scale that bigger ones can and they are overly dependent on each and every student s tuition dollars with so little margin for error sliding enrollment or poor spending decisions can spiral toward insolvency or even closure enrollment at many of these colleges of 1 000 students or fewer was already flagging over recent years a result of increased competition for the waning number of college bound high school graduates covid 19 dealt them another shock to the system in 2010 there were 395 private nonprofit four year colleges with 1 000 students or fewer according to a chronicle analysis of enrollment data from the u s department of education advertisement in 2020 the most recent year for which federal data was available there were 435 there s no invisible line of peril a college crosses by having 1 000 students or fewer and no alarm system that alerts accreditors and reporters but institutions with such small enrollments tend to be among the most financially vulnerable experts say if you were challenged before covid and you haven t figured out how to strengthen your position in the market you re going to be challenged even more said nanci tessier a principal of art science group a consulting company that works with colleges leaders at small colleges say they ve spent the last year overhauling their academic programs bolstering their enrollment offices and expanding their online learning options to appeal to more nontraditional students advertisement mark roosevelt knows something about running small colleges today he s president of st john s college in santa fe n m which along with its campus in annapolis md enrolls about 1 000 students over all before coming to st john s in 2015 he led antioch college a small liberal arts institution in yellow springs ohio that had closed in 2008 because of financial difficulties only to be reopened in 2011 with roosevelt in charge antioch had 116 students in 2020 according to federal data recruiting students to a small and faltering institution can be hard because students and families sense your precariousness he says so precariousness sort of yields further precariousness advertisement f inancially covid 19 should have been much worse for all colleges but the federal government doled out 77 billion in aid through the higher education emergency relief fund and the stock market performed unexpectedly well during the pandemic fattening endowments those two factors insulated many colleges with 1 000 students or fewer let s call them microcolleges from layoffs and other cutbacks but the federal money is gone the endowment gold rush is over and new economic storm clouds are gathering inflation has raised the cost of operating a college says robert kelchen a professor of higher education at the university of tennessee at knoxville and an expert on college finances the more a small college has to pay for food for its dining hall for example or energy to cool and heat its buildings the more difficult it is to afford things like dorm upkeep or bonuses for faculty in addition to new economic pressures the forces that made it challenging to serve the smallest student bodies before the pandemic didn t go anywhere and some got worse half of the federal emergency aid money was earmarked for students but what small colleges did with the other half could help determine how they fare over the next few years advertisement did they use it to make up for things where they have had shortfalls in the past asks marjorie hass president of the council of independent colleges a membership organization for small private colleges or did they use it as an investment in things that would help them draw and increase revenue in the future the number of high school graduates is expected to plunge starting in 2025 because of low birth rates and college enrollment over all doesn t appear to be recovering from covid 19 data compiled by the national student clearinghouse research center shows that college enrollment of the high school class of 2020 declined by nearly 7 percent compared with the class of 2019 despite a similar cohort size having fewer students creates an acute challenge for small private colleges based on inevitable math says rick staisloff a principal of the rpk group a company that consults with colleges a tiny liberal arts college doesn t have the huge overhead costs of a large university but it probably doesn t have the multiple income streams such as research dollars or athletic income either microcolleges run on tuition dollars it may cost less to educate fewer students but a college can t scrimp on essential functions it needs people to teach the classes it needs someone to handle the finances it needs a registrar advertisement it s more costly on a per student basis to provide quality higher education at a small college staisloff says and the fewer students a college has and the more financial aid it hands out to attract those students in a competitive environment the fewer tuition dollars it has to pay those costs some institutions have started to raise tuition considered anathema because of the financial pressures it puts on families but they re not able to increase tuition anywhere near the rate of inflation kelchen says some financial pundits fear inflation is pushing the economy toward another recession if we re not already in one not every college with fewer than 1 000 students will survive the coming years unscathed the list of such colleges compiled by the chronicle using data from 2020 the most recent available includes several institutions that have since closed e g the san francisco art institute and several others that nearly closed e g hampshire college most if not all of those that close each year come from the microcollege ranks but colleges are stubborn and resilient institutions and there s unlikely to be an outsized wave of closings says kelchen devoted alumni have stepped in to save several small institutions in recent years including hampshire and sweet briar colleges but it s equally unlikely that the steady trickle of closings about a dozen every year according to data kelchen tracks will stop i n the beginning of american higher education every college was tiny the country was small and education beyond the bare rudiments was reserved for the sons of the elite the first graduating class at harvard college in 1642 consisted of nine men advertisement even as the nation grew higher education remained a small scale activity still based around a few hundred tiny seminaries agricultural schools and teachers colleges in 1869 only about 63 000 students or about 1 percent of the american population between the ages of 18 and 24 attended college according to federal data but over the course of the 20th century american higher education expanded with the country s middle class prosperity and its technology driven needs the university of florida for example enrolled 102 students in its first year 1906 it now enrolls more than 52 000 students while the university of central florida its sister campus founded in 1963 in the boomtown of orlando enrolls more than 66 000 about 20 million americans now attend college each year an increasing number at institutions with vast online operations that enroll more than 100 000 students like liberty university delcan co danielle del plato for the chronicle but the small campus where you know everyone and everyone knows you has never gone away small colleges offer an intimate educational setting and some students seek out their traditional red brick grassy quad residential settings with small classes and a lot of contact with faculty members some types of education mandate a smaller size music education depends heavily on personal lessons for example so conservatories are often small religious colleges are often tied to a particular denomination or sect limiting their scale all of those types of institutions show up among the 435 microcolleges in the department of education data competing for students in years to come could be especially tough for the smallest colleges says nanci tessier of the art science group the traditional age first time full time student on whom so many small liberal arts colleges rely often look for a big college experience she says a broad choice of academic and social experiences to explore a large institution with hundreds of academic options thousands of fellow students and a wide variety of social groups and experiences often appeals more to a 17 year old than a small college with limited offerings advertisement some students prioritize a more intimate college experience but small colleges don t have the corner on that market anymore tessier said big universities have redesigned their freshman experience to offer more personal attention and smaller classes so that students feel they can have a big expansive undergraduate experience and it s going to be small and personal she said because i ll have smaller classes or i ll get to know my faculty or whatnot distinctiveness can pay off for institutions as well as their students students spend their college years at st john s college s two campuses focusing on foundational texts of western civilization reading canonical staples like wordsworth s epic poem the prelude and discussing them in small seminars the great books curriculum stands in stark contrast to the overtly career focused education offered by many colleges now but it appeals to a particular type of student says roosevelt president of the santa fe campus st john s receives relatively few applications each year about 1 500 for both campuses for the fall of 2022 as of july compared with many of its peers but it admits as many as 80 percent of those who apply and as many as 40 percent of those admitted attend both high compared with peer institutions because we re so rigorous very few people apply who aren t serious about coming he said overall enrollment fell 9 percent in santa fe between the fall of 2015 and the fall of 2020 according to federal data but remained roughly flat in annapolis current total enrollment has climbed to 1 011 while roosevelt is conscious of the need to keep the college s enrollment up he isn t interested in growing just for the sake of growth st john s education model is based on students meeting in seminars of fewer than 20 students scaling up isn t an option even if leaders were interested both of our campuses are around 400 students and that s how they work well he says that s how they feel right advertisement the college s annual operating budget is around 50 million and its endowment is around 300 million with two bequests set to increase it by an additional 90 million in coming years he says while its endowment insulates it from the worst financial shocks he says the tiny number of applicants each year means we re very attentive to the potential of the demographic cliff to hit us given st john s unique model it s unlikely to add say a nursing program but the pandemic did provide a serendipitous benefit leaders of the college used some of its aid money to help move classes online never a priority before given the college s emphasis on in person seminars graduate enrollment has since nearly doubled from 48 students in 2019 to 84 in 2021 i f st john s distinctive ethos makes it a bit of a unicorn beloit college has more in common with many colleges its size located in a rural small town setting beloit wis which sits on the state s border with illinois the institution has offered a more traditional residential liberal arts education with small classes and a lot of personal attention for its roughly 1 000 students for eric boynton the provost and dean being small is key to success we seem to be able to support our students extremely well with the size of the staff we have he says that seems to be a sweet spot for us but beloit has suffered in recent years enrollment plunged from 1 358 in the fall of 2015 to 978 in the fall of 2020 according to federal data a drop of 28 percent through eliminating or restructuring about 25 staff positions some faculty buyouts and reducing the number of adjunct instructors the college lowered the number of employees by about 18 percent by 2018 rather than turn away from the liberal arts top administrators and faculty met in 2019 to rethink the college s approach to the curriculum the college bolstered its advising linking admitted high school students to specific faculty members for mentorship within 72 hours of applicants committing to the institution it also reorganized its academic offerings into eight career channels such as business and entrepreneurship or justice and rights that connect students with outside the classroom activities and alumni mentors as well as specific coursework the college also added a handful of new programs including data science and business economics about 11 million in grant and donor dollars helped pay for the reorganization and the college engaged a marketing firm to help spread the word about the new beloit advertisement covid 19 added more uncertainty to beloit s future but enrollment has stabilized around 1 000 students and the entering class in the fall of 2021 was 12 percent ahead of goals lake erie college a waterside campus in the cleveland suburbs has been through its share of small college woes it saw its overall enrollment drop from 1 243 in the fall of 2015 according to federal data to 949 in the fall of 2020 a decrease of 24 percent undergraduate enrollment continued to slide throughout the pandemic but new graduate programs including a new master s degree in professional studies have buoyed overall enrollment lake erie s equestrian teams and the equestrian studies program that backs them represent the kind of niche appeal that may offer the best insurance the smallest colleges have against the most unpredictable forces of the post pandemic landscape yet equine studies and equestrian teams aren t silver bullets that will fix any college s enrollment problems any more than any other particular solution horses are expensive to maintain says pamela a hess a veterinarian and dean of lake erie s school of equine studies the budget for the equestrian teams which use about 50 horses is in the mid six figures she says and lake erie now competes for students and riders with several other colleges with equestrian programs including otterbein university outside nearby columbus ohio advertisement but hess adds the students who come to lake erie to ride or major in equestrian studies really want to be there they are typically well prepared for college and many come from families of means these are the students all colleges want to have in their classes she says and when the numbers of students are small small things can make a difference lake erie s equestrian team won its regional championship in 2020 and the college s program is expecting 34 new riders this fall from all over the country a much larger class than the college has had in recent years

participants remarked that when rates hit a sufficiently restrictive level the panel should keep rates there for some time to ensure that inflation was firmly on a path back to 2 members saw signs their actions were already having an impact on the economy especially sectors that are interest sensitive but most of the effects were not yet felt but participants expressed concern the committee could tighten the stance of policy by more than necessary to restore price stability and urged the panel maintain a data dependent approach to judging the pace and magnitude of policy firming over coming quarters the fomc minutes suggest the fed believes ongoing increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will continue to be appropriate given inflation is well above their objective mardarovici said since the fomc views their current fed fund range as neutral it is likely the committee will have to move to the restrictive range to meet their objectives she said despite this she said the fed is likely to slow the pace of rate increases to account for lags associated with monetary policy the minutes suggest the fed will remain on a tightening path but there are signs some officials are getting a little nervous that they could end up going too hard and may need to reverse course eventually said james knightley ing chief international economist he noted there is no real forward looking guidance dissimilar from june minutes when the fed suggested july would be either a 50 or 75 basis point rate hike there s another jobs report and consumer price index report along with the fed s jackson hole conference starting next week which will give the fed plenty of chance to try to shape expectations knightley said it is still all to play for with the market continuing to hedge its bets pricing 63bp of hikes at the september fomc meeting he said he believes there will be a 50 basis point hike at both the september and november meetings followed by a 25 basis point hike in december but if another 350 000 jobs print for august or cpi failed to show any moderation from the 8 5 headline and 5 9 core then we would likely switch to a 75bp call for september strong backdrop still for munis credit strength and low default rates state government issuers fiscal strength and low new issue supply met by improving demand could lead to a positive outlook for municipal bonds ahead according to a new report from lord abbett co these factors could provide a strong backdrop for municipals in the near future despite recent market volatility stemming from headwinds such as rising interest rates slowing u s economic growth and the uncertainty over the persistence of inflation which weighed on investors concerns prompting historically large outflows from municipal bond funds the report from the jersey city n j based asset manager said credit stability and historically low defaults are two of the chief factors fueling the potential for a positive municipal landscape according to the firm although investors remain heavily focused on recession risk in the u s especially given the recent advance gross domestic product report showing a decline of 0 9 in the second quarter municipal bond markets might have already started pricing in the potential impact of federal reserve rate hikes lord abbett said higher absolute yields even before reflecting munis tax exempt status are also contributing to increased interest in the asset class after a very challenging first and second quarter of this year while economic weakness can impact municipal bond credit strength defaults within the asset class have been historically very low it continued the supply demand imbalance is also credit market strength as demand potentially continues to improve supply remains low due to a substantial lag in new issue municipal bonds the report said the lower supply of new issue municipal bonds in the first half of 2022 may provide a tailwind for valuations in the coming months lord abbett said said record outflows from municipal bond funds this year through the last week in june have exceeded the total outflows in each of the last 10 years periods of substantial outflows have often been followed by attractive returns going forward as higher absolute yields and potentially even more compelling tax equivalent yields entice renewed investor interest lord abbett s report said that combined with the lower overall supply issued so far in 2022 may provide a tailwind for valuations judging by the key factors lending strength to the municipal market there is a potentially rosy forecast ahead for the industry the firm said muni credit strength has translated into historically very low to nearly negligible default rates for investment grade bonds compared to other segments of the fixed income market it said although slowing economic growth amid persistent inflation can impact municipal bond issuers state government issuers have been bolstering reserves to strengthen their financial health while other sectors within the asset class have also benefited from fiscal stimulus and the strong economy we think these key trends are likely to provide an appealing backdrop for municipal bonds and potentially an attractive entry point for investors seeking tax free income available at today s higher yields the firm added mass esg deal is oversubscribed

san francisco and suzhou china aug 17 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the first healthy volunteer has been successfully dosed in the phase 1 study of ibi311 a recombinant anti insulin like growth factor 1 receptor igf 1r monoclonal antibody this study ctr20221581 is the single dose escalation phase i study in healthy volunteers aiming to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibi311 in healthy chinese subjects after a single dose thus support the clinical development of ibi311 in active thyroid associated ophthalmopathy tao ibi311 is a monoclonal antibody targeting igf 1r developed by innovent for the treatment of active tao by blocking the binding of igf 1 and igf 2 to igf 1r ibi311 inhibits igf 1r signaling pathway activation and reduces the expression of downstream inflammatory factors thereby inhibiting the adipocytosis of orbital fibroblasts ofs and the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycans due to the activation of ofs as well as the inflammatory response thus reduces disease activity and improve proptosis diplopia ocular congestion and edema in patients with active tao currently no targeted drugs for tao have been approved in china while in overseas teprotumumab is the first and currently only igf 1r mab approved by the fda for the treatment of tao professor huifang zhou from department of ophthalmology of shanghai ninth people s hospital shanghai jiaotong university school of medicine principal investigator of this study stated tao is one of the most common orbital diseases in adults and is an organ specific autoimmune disease closely related to thyroid disease although not fatal it severely affects the visual function and appearance of patients there are currently no targeted drug approved for the treatment of tao in china teprotumumab igf 1r antibody was approved by the fda in 2020 providing a new option for tao treatment and was recommended as second line treatment by the european group on graves orbitopathy eugogo we expect that ibi311 igf 1r antibody will show good efficacy and safety in the population with tao so that chinese patients can benefit from it as soon as possible dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated at present there is a huge unmet medical need for tao because no drug is approved for tao in china ibi311 is a recombinant anti igf 1r monoclonal antibody developed by innovent for the treatment of tao and is also a molecule innovent actively advance into the clinic in the field of ophthalmology with extremely high drug like property the good safety and biological activity has been preliminarily demonstrated in preclinical studies including in vivo and vitro studies the ongoing phase i study also the first in human trial of ibi311 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibi311 in chinese healthy volunteers and provide the basis for further clinical development we will accelerate the clinical development of ibi311 in chinese subjects with tao in order to obtain regulatory approval as soon as possible in china which will not only relieve patients pain but also greatly reduce patients economic burden we will truly uphold our mission of to develop and commercialize high quality biopharmaceuticals that are affordable to ordinary people about thyroid associated ophthalmopathy tao tao is an autoimmune disease involving ocular tissues and is usually associated with graves disease gd tao occurs in approximately 25 50 of gd patients and can also be seen in other thyroid diseases even in euthyroidism the annual incidence of tao is estimated to be 16 100 000 in women and 2 9 100 000 in men according to disease severity it can be divided into mild moderate and severe tao although tao appears to affect women more often severe cases occur more frequently in men patients aged 30 50 years are most commonly affected and severe cases occur more frequently in patients over 50 years at present the pathogenesis of tao is not fully understood but several studies have shown that ofs present in muscle fibers orbital fibrous connective tissue space are key factors leading to orbital soft tissue enlargement in tao the natural history of tao is divided into active and inactive phases the most common symptoms are dry eye ocular gritty photophobia lacrimation diplopia and pressure behind the eye while typical signs include upper eyelid retraction eyelid edema periorbital and conjunctival edema and proptosis tao is usually mild to moderate and about 3 5 of patients with tao are severe manifesting as severe pain vision threatening corneal ulcers or compressive optic neuropathy in addition to potential effect on vision tao can have an extremely severe impact on the patient s appearance social functionality and quality of life the european graves orbital disease study group eugogo guidelines have included the anti igf 1r antibody teprotumumab as second line therapy for moderately to severely active tao for active tao in china the currently first line treatment is intravenous glucocorticoid which has unsatisfactory improvement in proptosis and the risk of hormone related systemic side effects and second line treatment includes other immunomodulators which also have issues of unclear improvement of proptosis and other treatment related risks for inactive tao surgery is often used to intervene the treatment there is a large unmet clinical need in china about ibi311 ibi311 is a recombinant anti igf 1r antibody developed by innovent for the treatment of active tao igf 1r is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a role in development metabolism and immune regulation and is overexpressed in ofs b and t cells of thyroid ophthalmopathy in graves disease ibi311 can bind to igf 1r block igf 1r signaling pathway activation mediated by igf 1 and other related ligands or agonistic antibodies reduce the expression of downstream inflammatory factors thereby inhibiting the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycan caused by ofs activation as well as related inflammatory reactions including tissue congestion and edema inhibit adipocyte cellularization of ofs thereby reducing the disease activity of patients with active thyroid ophthalmopathy and improving proptosis diplopia ocular congestion and edema and other symptoms

a closer look at their recent report to shareholders along with other investing actions they have taken seems to draw similarities in mindset with u s shale producers in terms of holding to previously announced capital restraint the kingdom of saudi arabia ksa has also received calls from the u s government to increase its output ksa has notionally agreed but with relatively token amounts that do not address the u s government s goal of reducing oil prices saudi aramco armco reported q 2 2022 earnings this week and set tongues wagging with the sheer amount of cash being generated in its daily operations net income of 48 4 bn free cash flow of 34 6 bn for the quarter and 65 bn for the first half substantially eclipsed year ago numbers of 22 6 bn and 40 9 bn for the same period all of this was driven by price realizations for crude topping the 113 00 bbl mark for the quarter exceeding year ago prices 67 90 by 66 what was noteworthy and documented in a recent wall street journal article was the company s capital allocation budget toward increasing production remained largely unchanged at the lower end of its previously announced range of 40 50 bn for 2022 the journal article went on to note to be fair 40 billion is a lot much more than in 2021 but aramco is very flush it earned more than 65 billion in free cash flow in the first half of this year that spending also includes diversifying into natural gas wind solar and blue hydrogen and while capital discipline is laudable surely if management really believes that oil demand is growing for the next decade it should at the very least accelerate plans to expand its maximum sustainable oil capacity to 13 0 million barrels a day currently set for 2027 where the saudi mindset appears to depart from their oil producing cousins on the other side of the planet is what is to be done with the excess cash now being realized while u s shale producers are raining wealth on their shareholders in the form of stock buybacks and special dividends ksa 94 owner of aramco has focused on paying down debt and diversifying its energy portfolio in some ways mimicking the actions of the mega oil producers like exxonmobil nyse xom chevron nyse cvx and bp nyse bp by delving into alternative energy forms the supermajors tired of being clubbed by the climate alarmists and having totally bought into the paris accord net zero by 2030 dictums have been diverting capital away from legacy sources and toward cleaner energy forms that raise their esg scores author of the end of fossil fuel insanity terry etam summarized their plight in an article carried in the boe report discussing the coming gap between supply and demand there is little producers can do to help out their inventory oil and gas reserves is in incredibly high demand and is being bid up in price what would help alleviate this situation is to find and develop more reserves but the world s cultural elite the group that dominates western political schools of thought has scientifically linked any weather event anything at all with climate change which is linked to fossil fuel combustion which is therefore bad and the mere suggestion of increasing production is unacceptable in this regard the supermajors have been greenwashing their portfolios in some cases and beginning to transition them in others here they depart from the saudis who intend to straddle the gap between petroleum and green energy into the foreseeable future in spite of a publically asserted view by aramco ceo amin nasser that oil demand will grow for the rest of this decade ksa appears to be in no hurry to accelerate the timetable for achieving the 13 mm bopd upper threshold set for 2027 instead ksa has embarked on an ambitious decade long quest to diversify its economy away from its sole reliance on oil and gas choosing a multi pronged approach that includes hydrogen wind and solar one area where they are focusing their efforts is in the production of hydrogen h2 a financial times ft article notes that the saudis plan to dominate the production of h2 a few years hence with its abundant supplies of gas nearby the city of neom a blue h2 plant is being built with 110 bn of capital this plant is planned to take 2 2 bn cubic feet of gas daily from the supergiant jafurrah gas field for processing blue h2 it is forecast to come on line in 2026 another massive hydrogen project will produce green h 2 with power supplied by a 99 turbine wind farm sp global discusses this in an article focusing on acwa power s 240k mt ton per year green hydrogen project that will make 1 2 mm mt of ammonia it also is expected to start production in 2026 finally solar is thought to have unlimited potential in the kingdom it makes sense as the sun shines brightly there more than 300 days per year accordingly ksa is fielding a number of new solar farm projects getting underway the sovereign wealth fund of the kingdom just this year let two awards for a total of 1 gw ipp one went to acwa power for a 700 mw farm at al rass and a second smaller 300 mw farm at saad the kingdom has a goal of installing 54 gw of solar generation by 2030 solar is also finding industrial uses as the glass point complex takes shape this 1 5 gw project the biggest solar farm in the world will power an aluminum smelting plant designed to use the solar mirrors on water filled pipes to produce solar steam this will save approximately 600k tons of carbon annually your takeaway it is fairly clear from the decisions that ksa is making about the capital allocation for renewable forms of energy that their feet are firmly planted in both camps the higher price regime that has settled on the oil market since 2021 has provided the cash to fund the projects we have discussed that will fuel the saudi vision 2030 initiative advertisement at the same time like their shale counterparts in the u s they are committed to an orderly development of their legacy oil reserves in a way that will preserve value as far into the future as possible that s just good stewardship what this means is that in spite of entreaties by world leaders including the american president to produce more oil to lower prices oil producers in the u s and in saudi arabia are seemingly determined to hold the line on capital spending this will have the effect of keeping supplies tight and prices higher than they otherwise would be by david messler for oilpricce com more top reads from oilprice com
ceci maher hearst file photo toni boucher hearst file photo wilton what will connecticut s 26th senate district look like in five years and how will state statutes affect local housing plans state senate candidates ceci maher a democrat and republican toni boucher may differ on their answers to that question but both have taken aim at one constant they believe needs amending connecticut general statute 8 30g maher and boucher vying for the seat to represent wilton westport weston redding and parts of ridgefield darien new canaan and stamford said some aspects of the statute are outdated and need to be reviewed they have a few ideas on how towns should approach housing advertisement article continues below this ad the statute allows developers to circumvent local zoning laws in certain municipalities if at least 10 percent of its housing stock isn t considered affordable the municipality must prove the public health or safety risks outweighs the need for affordable housing if denied what change are they pushing for boucher said she isn t advocating for the eradication of 8 30g but said it needs to be reformed she said she wants to make it easier for towns to obtain moratoriums to avoid limiting local officials in what they can do she wants more diverse forms of low income housing such as accessory dwelling units to be considered for part of a town s plan boucher said she does not want the state to decide what gets developed within a half mile of train stations advertisement article continues below this ad maher wants to eliminate the 10 percent goal from the bill and shift the discussion from obtaining moratoriums to planning for sound affordable housing that will benefit residents she wants to create more density in connecticut communities and make them more vibrant without losing their individuality i think we can change the conversation from the state being a negative force and recognizing that we are all in this together maher said counting affordable and the threshold boucher who has served on the state s housing committee said she believes 8 30g is hampering the ability for some communities to grow independent of state interference advertisement article continues below this ad i see its laudable intention but yet its actual implementation might undo some of the advantages that these small communities have for attracting people boucher said high rise developments being built en masse in towns such as trumbull boucher said led to undesirable congestion and has left some local governments at wit s end she also opposed the fair share bill or house bill 5204 which would have taken a regional approach to affordable housing that boucher said removed more control from towns the bill didn t make it out of the house boucher said the formula for counting affordable housing stock should be developed more and incorporate other low income housing and accessory dwelling units that could bump town numbers she said this will help make it easier for towns to get moratoriums advertisement article continues below this ad they did make some adjustment to give you a moratorium for a number of years if you made huge changes in development in other words added more affordable housing stock boucher said of 8 30g what s alarming right now is that there s no further reform of that bill it s gotten worse and more onerous maher disagrees with boucher s focus and wants to move the discussion of affordable housing forward without fixating on the 10 percent affordable housing number and moratoriums it s clear that the 10 percent number which was set out as a goal has become not a carrot but a stick and it s just not serving anyone well maher said she wishes to work alongside towns in a state municipal partnership without that 10 percent number and refrain from imposing restrictive rules on town housing authorities advertisement article continues below this ad maher said some towns likely will never reach 10 percent and local officials are too focused on qualifying for moratoriums to temporarily restrict enforcement of 8 30g than building the needed housing i know that when it was put into place 30 years ago it was to create the direction of affordable housing with the understanding that if affordable housing was created the towns could get a moratorium maher said now i believe this process is dysfunctional in that the focus is more on the moratorium than it is on creating affordable housing maher said the end goal should be adding housing for seniors empty nesters and young professionals to be able to live in the communities of their choice how do we course correct when the moratorium has become the end result rather than affordable housing maher asked saying the answer to that question is one of her main focuses advertisement article continues below this ad what will more density look like maher said she disagrees with some of the arguments made by boucher and other republicans including that too much development can strain other town infrastructure what i m looking at in terms of seniors and people coming back to our communities we re not looking at a burden on transportation and schools we re looking at having the people we want to be able to live in our communities able to live here maher said maher a longtime wilton resident who grew up in stamford said she has overseen the development of the district s towns and cities she said it s unlikely towns like wilton and westport will become too much like cities advertisement article continues below this ad in all the years that i ve lived in fairfield county i have never seen any of these towns turn into another town maher said stamford is distinct so is norwalk and the concern that people have about towns becoming something other than what they are i don t see it boucher said she was worried an influx of higher density could lead to regionalizing schools and warned against the state attaining carte blanche to fully dictate what is developed within one half mile of train stations she said she spoke to many families who moved here during the pandemic looking for open space these newer residents weren t looking for high density areas when moving into the connecticut suburbs she said it s a real turn off to a lot of the new people here and they re very angry about it boucher said they feel that they no longer have rights to their property that they bought or around their property and the towns themselves have their hands tied

why is the u s air force sending billions of dollars worth of top tier f 35 and f 22 stealth fighters to alaska with the arrival of the 54th f 35 at eielson air force base in april alaska became home to the world s largest concentration of fifth generation fighter jets after a two year buildup of the 354th fighter wing there are now two squadrons of f 35s at eielson in central alaska they join two squadrons of f 22s already stationed at joint base elmendorf richardson farther south alaska s sprawling training ranges and its ease of access to europe and asia make it ideal for exercises but working there is a constant test for pilots and crews two officers with the 354th wing said this month we have a motto that we re ready to go at 50 below and it does get that cold sometimes col david berkland the wing commander said during an air force association event on august 10 today s a beautiful 78 degree day but if you come back in february you ll see that it s a fairly ominous environment to maintain and support and operate airplanes berkland added the air force has long had the us military s largest presence in the arctic the first f 22 arrived at elmendorf richardson in august 2007 and it and other service branches have hastened to expand their footprints there as climate change makes the region more accessible despite changes to the climate the arctic can still be inhospitable just getting to your plane requires bundling up said lt col ryan worrell commander of the 356th fighter squadron which is part of the 354th wing you re going to wear silk weight thermals you re going to wear fleece thermals worrell said during the event then you re going to put your flight suit on and then your g suit and then you re going to put snow pants over your g suit and then you re going to put a snow jacket on and then put your jsf jacket on and then you re going to put on mukluks which are boots rated for temperatures down to 50 degrees at that point you re so hot you just want to get out of the building worrell added we ll walk to the jets in 30 40 just because it s easier to stay cool than it is to try and ride in the step van you ll get in the jet and the goal is just not to sweat until you get out there and flying other airmen also deal with those conditions berkland said all of our mission important people that are out there on the flightline operating clearing the snow and ice around the clock they have to operate in those environments they have to maintain vehicles in that environment in those conditions so it is a challenge eielson is home to arctic survival school called cool school which for years has trained airmen to survive long enough to be rescued before our pilots can fly here in the winter months berkland said they have to go through arctic survival school that is conducted here at eielson which is fantastic training very sobering or chilling maybe would be the word because you re out there for a couple of nights and surviving down to 50 there have also been some f 35 specific adaptations for the region in 2019 before the first f 35 arrived at eielson airmen tested a new arctic survival kit for the jet the f 35 seat kit doesn t fit the sleeping bag that our f 16s can fit berkland said adding that the replacement was made thinner to fit and is almost like a full body poncho it does keep you warm enough to actually survive that kind of critical 12 hours that we assess we need to conduct a rescue berkland said pilots at eielson have made other adaptations as well the f 35 has touchscreens in place of many buttons and switches that other jets have in their cockpits so pilots will fly with gloves that are cut off on the thumb and the two fingers because you re constantly up on the glass and that touchscreen capability is where basically all of your functions reside berkland said alongside the weather related challenges airmen in alaska are kind of at the end of the logistics train for most of our parts and supplies worrell said parts may be ready at time of need but not necessarily as a bench stock worrell said pointing to f 35 pilots custom helmets getting a new helmet may take five or six days versus just having a couple extras so there are a couple of initiatives we re working particularly flight equipment to make sure that we have a bench stock available worrell said worrell and berkland emphasized that being in alaska adds a layer of difficulty to operations requiring airmen to be conscientious and to think ahead when on the ground and in the air our team has a sense of discipline and a culture of discipline berkland said because frankly there are no shortcuts other than discipline up here if you don t follow the tech order if you don t do all the little things right if you delay maintenance actions you are going to pay for it when it s 50 below and dark out all day our night one team throughout the f 35 buildup airmen at eielson have taken advantage of alaska s unique training environment the nearby joint pacific alaska range complex is the size of indiana and its threat replication capabilities are being upgraded the most recent iteration of the red flag alaska exercise took place around jparc and wrapped up on august 12 after weeks of drills focused on air to air combat you can ask any of these red flag alaska participants what they think of the jparc and they ll tell you that it s the best training airspace in the world berkland said eielson s f 35s also use the jparc for quarterly training with f 22s we call the bros down the street and say hey let s get the team together that s going to be our night one team worrell said referring to jets that would operate on the first night of a conflict those jets can train together in a single sortie which worrell called a big advantage of being here the 354th wing also exercises across the pacific training for agile combat employment and on related skill sets at austere locations around the region berkland said training across the pacific expanse tests the f 35 s ability to be a command and control node marshaling and distributing information among other aircraft agile combat employment drills are also a test of logistical capabilities worrell said our priority now is to basically shift ourselves into full operational capability to conduct agile combat deployment operations at austere locations in the pacific berkland said that means that we need to be able to run hub and spoke operations with our full complement of fifth gen combat airpower so that s really our focus worrell and berkland emphasized the advantages the fifth generation f 35 has over fourth generation jets like the f 16 pointing to its ability to fuse sensor data which berkland said enables a degree of situational awareness that fourth generation jets don t have and its stealth which allows it to penetrate the anti access area denial capability that adversaries have developed those adversaries continue to improve their weaponry berkland said one of the biggest challenges that i see looking toward the future is continuing to rapidly evolve the f 35 capabilities to stay in front of what competitors are doing
try to just make sure you make the right one all right right okay let me say from the start for this law the american people one and the special interest lost american people one and the special interests lost we have not wavered we ve not flinched and we ve not given in instead we re delivering results for the american people we didn t tear down we build up we didn t look back we look forward and today today offers further proof that the soul america s vibrant the future of america is bright and the promise of america is real and just beginning it s about showing the american and the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the all the talk of its demise not just for the privileged few but for all of us my fellow americans that s the choice we face we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build future where everybody has an even shot that s the america i believe in that s what i believe in and today today we ve come step closer to making that america real advertisement what s in the new climate and health care law share copy link copy president joe biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he signed tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for some 13 million people who are purchasing their own health care policies through the affordable care act biggest u s investment by far in climate change the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water how to pay for all of this one of the biggest revenue raisers in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year yet money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade sinema was instrumental in doing away with other tax proposals and shaping the final plan extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which recently put out a new report on long term projections what s left behind the package nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned remains a sizable undertaking and along with covid 19 relief and the gop 2017 tax cuts is among the more substantial bills from congress in years while congress did pass and biden signed into law a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that was part of the white house s initial vision the democrats other big priorities have slipped away gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs also allowed to expire is the enhanced child care credit that was providing 300 a month during the pandemic ___associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report
millions of americans fall victim to job scams each year here are verified ways to keep you and your money safe when looking for a new job in 2021 a record number of americans voluntarily quit their

alert warning job seekers about phony job postings here are some tips on how to protect yourself from falling victim to a scam when looking for a new job the sources what we found scammers typically advertise jobs in some of the same ways legitimate employers do they may create fake job listings in online ads on job sites like indeed or linkedin on college employment websites through email and even on social media according to the ftc fbi and the financial industry regulatory authority finra but despite offering job seekers the promise of new employment the ftc says all these scammers really want is money and people s personal information many people would like to work from home and generate income scammers know this so they place ads often online claiming that they have jobs where you can make thousands of dollars a month working from home with little time and effort the ftc writes but instead of making money you end up paying for starter kits training or certifications that are useless if someone offers you a job and they claim that you can make a lot of money in a short period of time and with little work that s a scam job scam warning signs when looking for a new job there are several red flags to look out for these include payment requirements in order to get a job on the spot interviews without any prior contact from the company and lack of preparation by a hiring manager finra writes on its website other warning signs include the following requests for personal information such as your social security number credit card information or bank account number odd or poorly written text such as typos or unusual wording in the job listing or in other forms of communication pressure to commit to a job quickly or make equipment purchases language that suggests a job is guaranteed or waiting for you or that personal funds are required for purchases interviews arranged for previously undisclosed jobs you should not have to pay an employer or an employment firm to get a job nor should you be asked to provide payment for any materials unless you have been hired and clearly agree to pay for something associated with the job such as supplies or equipment finra said how to protect yourself from a job scam the ftc fbi and finra all share tips on how to protect yourself from falling victim to a job scam these include the following don t pay for the promise of a job legitimate employers including the federal government will never ask you to pay to get a job anyone who does is a scammer according to the ftc legitimate employers including the federal government will never ask you to pay to get a job anyone who does is a scammer according to the ftc don t respond to unsolicited requests for an online interview if you are not certain you applied for the job don t engage in a session if you are not certain you applied for the job don t engage in a session do an online search look up the name of the company or the person who is

send you a check and then tell you to send part of the money or buy gift cards with it that s a fake check scam and when the check bounces the bank will want you to repay the amount of the fake check the ftc says finra says you should immediately hang up on an interviewer if they ask you to provide personal or financial information or to pay a fee that you did not expect you should also avoid responding to similar written requests about payment if anything about the way the job interview or hiring process seems suspicious contact the organization directly on your own to confirm the

san francisco and suzhou china aug 17 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the first healthy volunteer has been successfully dosed in the phase 1 study of ibi311 a recombinant anti insulin like growth factor 1 receptor igf 1r monoclonal antibody this study ctr20221581 is the single dose escalation phase i study in healthy volunteers aiming to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibi311 in healthy chinese subjects after a single dose thus support the clinical development of ibi311 in active thyroid associated ophthalmopathy tao ibi311 is a monoclonal antibody targeting igf 1r developed by innovent for the treatment of active tao by blocking the binding of igf 1 and igf 2 to igf 1r ibi311 inhibits igf 1r signaling pathway activation and reduces the expression of downstream inflammatory factors thereby inhibiting the adipocytosis of orbital fibroblasts ofs and the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycans due to the activation of ofs as well as the inflammatory response thus reduces disease activity and improve proptosis diplopia ocular congestion and edema in patients with active tao currently no targeted drugs for tao have been approved in china while in overseas teprotumumab is the first and currently only igf 1r mab approved by the fda for the treatment of tao professor huifang zhou from department of ophthalmology of shanghai ninth people s hospital shanghai jiaotong university school of medicine principal investigator of this study stated tao is one of the most common orbital diseases in adults and is an organ specific autoimmune disease closely related to thyroid disease although not fatal it severely affects the visual function and appearance of patients there are currently no targeted drug approved for the treatment of tao in china teprotumumab igf 1r antibody was approved by the fda in 2020 providing a new option for tao treatment and was recommended as second line treatment by the european group on graves orbitopathy eugogo we expect that ibi311 igf 1r antibody will show good efficacy and safety in the population with tao so that chinese patients can benefit from it as soon as possible dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated at present there is a huge unmet medical need for tao because no drug is approved for tao in china ibi311 is a recombinant anti igf 1r monoclonal antibody developed by innovent for the treatment of tao and is also a molecule innovent actively advance into the clinic in the field of ophthalmology with extremely high drug like property the good safety and biological activity has been preliminarily demonstrated in preclinical studies including in vivo and vitro studies the ongoing phase i study also the first in human trial of ibi311 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibi311 in chinese healthy volunteers and provide the basis for further clinical development we will accelerate the clinical development of ibi311 in chinese subjects with tao in order to obtain regulatory approval as soon as possible in china which will not only relieve patients pain but also greatly reduce patients economic burden we will truly uphold our mission of to develop and commercialize high quality biopharmaceuticals that are affordable to ordinary people about thyroid associated ophthalmopathy tao tao is an autoimmune disease involving ocular tissues and is usually associated with graves disease gd tao occurs in approximately 25 50 of gd patients and can also be seen in other thyroid diseases even in euthyroidism the annual incidence of tao is estimated to be 16 100 000 in women and 2 9 100 000 in men according to disease severity it can be divided into mild moderate and severe tao although tao appears to affect women more often severe cases occur more frequently in men patients aged 30 50 years are most commonly affected and severe cases occur more frequently in patients over 50 years at present the pathogenesis of tao is not fully understood but several studies have shown that ofs present in muscle fibers orbital fibrous connective tissue space are key factors leading to orbital soft tissue enlargement in tao the natural history of tao is divided into active and inactive phases the most common symptoms are dry eye ocular gritty photophobia lacrimation diplopia and pressure behind the eye while typical signs include upper eyelid retraction eyelid edema periorbital and conjunctival edema and proptosis tao is usually mild to moderate and about 3 5 of patients with tao are severe manifesting as severe pain vision threatening corneal ulcers or compressive optic neuropathy in addition to potential effect on vision tao can have an extremely severe impact on the patient s appearance social functionality and quality of life the european graves orbital disease study group eugogo guidelines have included the anti igf 1r antibody teprotumumab as second line therapy for moderately to severely active tao for active tao in china the currently first line treatment is intravenous glucocorticoid which has unsatisfactory improvement in proptosis and the risk of hormone related systemic side effects and second line treatment includes other immunomodulators which also have issues of unclear improvement of proptosis and other treatment related risks for inactive tao surgery is often used to intervene the treatment there is a large unmet clinical need in china about ibi311 ibi311 is a recombinant anti igf 1r antibody developed by innovent for the treatment of active tao igf 1r is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a role in development metabolism and immune regulation and is overexpressed in ofs b and t cells of thyroid ophthalmopathy in graves disease ibi311 can bind to igf 1r block igf 1r signaling pathway activation mediated by igf 1 and other related ligands or agonistic antibodies reduce the expression of downstream inflammatory factors thereby inhibiting the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycan caused by ofs activation as well as related inflammatory reactions including tissue congestion and edema inhibit

jobs according to the bureau of labor statistics many of those who resigned cited low pay lack of advancement and feeling disrespected at work as the top reasons behind why they decided to leave their jobs and seek out new employment a pew research center survey found as the great resignation continues in 2022 job scams are on the rise in june the federal trade commission ftc issued a consumer alert warning job seekers about phony job postings here are some tips on how to protect yourself from falling victim to a scam when looking for a new job the sources what we found scammers typically advertise jobs in some of the same ways legitimate employers do they may create fake job listings in online ads on job sites like indeed or linkedin on college employment websites through email and even on social media according to the ftc fbi and the financial industry regulatory authority finra but despite offering job seekers the promise of new employment the ftc says all these scammers really want is money and people s personal information many people would like to work from home and generate income scammers know this so they place ads often online claiming that they have jobs where you can make thousands of dollars a month working from home with little time and effort the ftc writes but instead of making money you end up paying for starter kits training or certifications that are useless if someone offers you a job and they claim that you can make a lot of money in a short period of time and with little work that s a scam job scam warning signs when looking for a new job there are several red flags to look out for these include payment requirements in order to get a job on the spot interviews without any prior contact from the company and lack of preparation by a hiring manager finra writes on its website other warning signs include the following requests for personal information such as your social security number credit card information or bank account number odd or poorly written text such as typos or unusual wording in the job listing or in other forms of communication pressure to commit to a job quickly or make equipment purchases language that suggests a job is guaranteed or waiting for you or that personal funds are required for purchases interviews arranged for previously undisclosed jobs you should not have to pay an employer or an employment firm to get a job nor should you be asked to provide payment for any materials unless you have been hired and clearly agree to pay for something associated with the job such as supplies or equipment finra said how to protect yourself from a job scam the ftc fbi and finra all share tips on how to protect yourself from falling victim to a job scam these include the following don t pay for the promise of a job legitimate employers including the federal government will never ask you to pay to get a job anyone who does is a scammer according to the ftc legitimate employers including the federal government will never ask you to pay to get a job anyone who does is a scammer according to the ftc don t respond to unsolicited requests for an online interview if you are not certain you applied for the job don t engage in a session if you are not certain you applied for the job don t engage in a session do an online search look up the name of the company or the person who is

send you a check and then tell you to send part of the money or buy gift cards with it that s a fake check scam and when the check bounces the bank will want you to repay the amount of the fake check the ftc says finra says you should immediately hang up on an interviewer if they ask you to provide personal or financial information or to pay a fee that you did not expect you should also avoid responding to similar written requests about payment if anything about the way the job interview or hiring process seems suspicious contact the organization directly on your own to confirm the legitimacy of the position before taking any further action finra said

san francisco and suzhou china aug 17 2022 prnewswire innovent biologics inc innovent hkex 01801 a world class biopharmaceutical company that develops manufactures and commercializes high quality medicines for the treatment of oncology metabolic autoimmune ophthalmology and other major diseases announces that the first healthy volunteer has been successfully dosed in the phase 1 study of ibi311 a recombinant anti insulin like growth factor 1 receptor igf 1r monoclonal antibody this study ctr20221581 is the single dose escalation phase i study in healthy volunteers aiming to evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibi311 in healthy chinese subjects after a single dose thus support the clinical development of ibi311 in active thyroid associated ophthalmopathy tao ibi311 is a monoclonal antibody targeting igf 1r developed by innovent for the treatment of active tao by blocking the binding of igf 1 and igf 2 to igf 1r ibi311 inhibits igf 1r signaling pathway activation and reduces the expression of downstream inflammatory factors thereby inhibiting the adipocytosis of orbital fibroblasts ofs and the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycans due to the activation of ofs as well as the inflammatory response thus reduces disease activity and improve proptosis diplopia ocular congestion and edema in patients with active tao currently no targeted drugs for tao have been approved in china while in overseas teprotumumab is the first and currently only igf 1r mab approved by the fda for the treatment of tao professor huifang zhou from department of ophthalmology of shanghai ninth people s hospital shanghai jiaotong university school of medicine principal investigator of this study stated tao is one of the most common orbital diseases in adults and is an organ specific autoimmune disease closely related to thyroid disease although not fatal it severely affects the visual function and appearance of patients there are currently no targeted drug approved for the treatment of tao in china teprotumumab igf 1r antibody was approved by the fda in 2020 providing a new option for tao treatment and was recommended as second line treatment by the european group on graves orbitopathy eugogo we expect that ibi311 igf 1r antibody will show good efficacy and safety in the population with tao so that chinese patients can benefit from it as soon as possible dr lei qian vice president of clinical development of innovent stated at present there is a huge unmet medical need for tao because no drug is approved for tao in china ibi311 is a recombinant anti igf 1r monoclonal antibody developed by innovent for the treatment of tao and is also a molecule innovent actively advance into the clinic in the field of ophthalmology with extremely high drug like property the good safety and biological activity has been preliminarily demonstrated in preclinical studies including in vivo and vitro studies the ongoing phase i study also the first in human trial of ibi311 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibi311 in chinese healthy volunteers and provide the basis for further clinical development we will accelerate the clinical development of ibi311 in chinese subjects with tao in order to obtain regulatory approval as soon as possible in china which will not only relieve patients pain but also greatly reduce patients economic burden we will truly uphold our mission of to develop and commercialize high quality biopharmaceuticals that are affordable to ordinary people about thyroid associated ophthalmopathy tao tao is an autoimmune disease involving ocular tissues and is usually associated with graves disease gd tao occurs in approximately 25 50 of gd patients and can also be seen in other thyroid diseases even in euthyroidism the annual incidence of tao is estimated to be 16 100 000 in women and 2 9 100 000 in men according to disease severity it can be divided into mild moderate and severe tao although tao appears to affect women more often severe cases occur more frequently in men patients aged 30 50 years are most commonly affected and severe cases occur more frequently in patients over 50 years at present the pathogenesis of tao is not fully understood but several studies have shown that ofs present in muscle fibers orbital fibrous connective tissue space are key factors leading to orbital soft tissue enlargement in tao the natural history of tao is divided into active and inactive phases the most common symptoms are dry eye ocular gritty photophobia lacrimation diplopia and pressure behind the eye while typical signs include upper eyelid retraction eyelid edema periorbital and conjunctival edema and proptosis tao is usually mild to moderate and about 3 5 of patients with tao are severe manifesting as severe pain vision threatening corneal ulcers or compressive optic neuropathy in addition to potential effect on vision tao can have an extremely severe impact on the patient s appearance social functionality and quality of life the european graves orbital disease study group eugogo guidelines have included the anti igf 1r antibody teprotumumab as second line therapy for moderately to severely active tao for active tao in china the currently first line treatment is intravenous glucocorticoid which has unsatisfactory improvement in proptosis and the risk of hormone related systemic side effects and second line treatment includes other immunomodulators which also have issues of unclear improvement of proptosis and other treatment related risks for inactive tao surgery is often used to intervene the treatment there is a large unmet clinical need in china about ibi311 ibi311 is a recombinant anti igf 1r antibody developed by innovent for the treatment of active tao igf 1r is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor that plays a role in development metabolism and immune regulation and is overexpressed in ofs b and t cells of thyroid ophthalmopathy in graves disease ibi311 can bind to igf 1r block igf 1r signaling pathway activation mediated by igf 1 and other related ligands or agonistic antibodies reduce the expression of downstream inflammatory factors thereby inhibiting the synthesis of hyaluronic acid and other glycosaminoglycan caused by ofs activation as well as related inflammatory reactions including tissue congestion and edema inhibit adipocyte cellularization of ofs thereby reducing the disease activity of patients with active thyroid ophthalmopathy and improving proptosis diplopia ocular congestion and edema and other symptoms

fed says more us rate hikes coming pace will slow at some point us federal reserve chairman jerome powell speaks during a news conference in washington dc on may 4 2022 the federal reserve on wednesday raised the benchmark lending rate by a half percentage point in its ongoing effort to contain the highest inflation in four decades washington united states us central bankers remain committed to raising interest rates further to quell rising prices but agreed it would be appropriate to slow the pace of the hikes at some point the federal reserve said wednesday the central bank has raised the benchmark borrowing rate four times this year including two massive three quarter point increases in june and july as it tries to cool demand to lower prices that have surged at the fastest pace in more than 40 years the aggressive moves took on more urgency after us annual inflation spiked to 9 1 in june in the minutes of the july policy meeting which produced a second massive rate increase of 75 basis points fed officials said it will take some time to bring unacceptably high inflation back down near the 2 goal policymakers are trying to tread a narrow path and avoid pushing the world s largest economy into recession and many officials at the meeting cautioned that there is a risk the fed could go too far since the last fed meeting financial markets have been cheered by hopes that a slowing economy will allow the central bank to dial back or even halt the rate hikes especially after comments from fed chair jerome powell who signaled that the rapid increases eventually would give way to more normal steps but fed officials have tried to dispel some of that excess optimism stressing in recent speeches that the central bank is committed to pursuing its battle on inflation a message echoed in the minutes and economists see no suggestion of a pivot from the fed s policy setting federal open market committee fomc any time soon after the benchmark rate was slashed to zero at the start of the coronavirus pandemic it now sits in a range of 2 25 to 2 5 even if the fomc decides to scale back its rate hike to 50bps on september 21 we look for another 125bps increase in the fed funds rate by year end said kathy bostjancic of oxford economics and the central bankers said even when the rates hit a sufficiently restrictive level they may keep them there for some time to ensure that inflation falls signs of easing there have been some positive signs in the economic data as consumer inflation slowed in july to 8 5 and soaring gas prices exacerbated by the war in ukraine have fallen in recent weeks fomc members noted the recent decline as well as some signs that supply constraints have eased which also should work to bring down prices however they said falling oil prices cannot be relied on to lower overall inflation and instead slowing demand will be a key factor in curbing price pressures the minutes said some officials warned against complacency still the rapid aggressive moves by the central bank have started to have an impact and while officials say the us economy should continue to expand in the second half of the year many expected that growth in economic activity would be at a below trend pace the minutes said while the labor market remains strong many noted some tentative signs that job conditions have started to soften last month the world s largest economy still had nearly two job openings for every unemployed person in the labor force meanwhile american consumers have continued to spend despite high prices drawing on a stockpile of savings though data indicate a shift towards services and away from cars and other big ticket items while rising mortgage rates have started to slow activity in the housing sector

the ceo of bank of america said the recent debate over whether the u s economy is technically in a recession or not is missing the point condemning the biden administration for arguing over semantics and failing to comprehend the real pressures people felt brian moynihan head of the bank one of the world s largest financial institutions spoke as stocks fell sharply on wednesday as drops by big technology companies wiped out the s p 500 s gains for the week in more bad financial news it emerged that the number of people with at least 1 million in their fidelity 401 k accounts plunged 29 percent in the second quarter and the number of ira millionaires in fidelity fell 17 percent from a year earlier moynihan emphasized in an interview with the associated press that the white house s attempts to argue that the u s was not technically in a recession was not helpful recession is a word whether we are in a recession or not is really not the important thing he said it s what it feels like for the people going through this brian moynihan ceo of bank of america is photographed at the bank of america tower in manhattan on wednesday joe biden seen at the white house on tuesday has questioned the idea that the u s is in a recession despite the economic data the issue of whether the u s economy is in recession has become politicized heading into the 2022 mid term elections while inflation is at a level not seen since the early 1980s and u s consumer confidence is falling other measures of the economy such as the monthly jobs report are still strong in response to high consumer and wholesale prices the federal reserve has been raising interest rates aggressively in hopes of taming inflation while not causing too much economic damage moynihan who has been bofa s ceo since 2010 would not say the u s economy is in recession saying that declaration will have to come from a bunch of people in cambridge massachusetts a reference the national bureau of economic research the nonpartisan organization that determines when recessions begin and end however moynihan cited two major issues negatively impacting average americans gas prices and rent as reasons to be concerned moynihan said that recent quibbling over whether the u s economy is technically in a recession or not is missing the point the national average for a gallon of gasoline ballooned to just over 5 in june before falling back below 4 last week moynihan appeared more concerned about the rising cost of rents which tend not to fluctuate like gas prices gas prices are coming back down but rents are going up 10 12 15 percent and rent can end up taking 40 percent of these households income moynihan said rent accounts for about one third of the government s consumer price index which showed a year over year increase of 8 5 percent in july we are worried about for the u s broad based consumer is the increased rents as we go into the natural turn of rents typically in the fall with school year he added the average u s consumer entered this period of high inflation and economic turbulence in healthy financial shape the u s government spent trillions of dollars to extend unemployment benefits and other forms of pandemic relief in response americans were paying down debts faster than historic norms and had higher than normal levels of savings those economic programs largely ended last year a trader is seen on wall street on tuesday as markets digest the latest financial news moynihan said he still believes as he s said in previous interviews that overall the american consumer is still in good shape and able withstand the economic turbulence he says americans who have a fixed rate mortgage largely have locked in low borrowing costs and that credit card balances while climbing are still lower as a percentage of household income we see no deterioration in consumer behavior from the beginning of the year until now he said he did say there s been some slowdown in the amount of money americans are saving which is likely due to rising costs moynihan said companies are still raising wages as well which is helping americans cope bank of america itself has raised wages to help its 200 000 plus employees counter rising costs the company gave raises to employees making less than 100 000 of as much as 7 depending on longevity that does not include the company s typical merit raise cycle as well the raises are helping people deal with this he said moynihan spoke as fidelity one of the largest asset management companies in the world said that funds in u s retirement accounts had fallen sharply the dow jones s p 500 and nasdaq all closed down on wednesday the number of people with at least 1 million in their fidelity 401 k accounts fell 29 percent in the second quarter to 294 000 the s p 500 posted its lowest closing price so far this year on june 16 when the index was down about 24 percent from its peak on january 3 the population of ira millionaires took a sharp tumble as well down 17 percent from a year earlier to 284 900 according to figures from fidelity that cover the more than 35 million 401 k ira and 403 b retirement accounts at the company those numbers have improved a lot since then with stocks bouncing back from june 30 to august 16 the s p 500 is up about 14 percent and returns on the fidelity contrafund growth company and low priced stock funds have turned positive the overall average 401k account balance stood at 103 800 as of june 30 bloomberg reported down almost 20 percent from a year ago and almost 15 percent from 2022 s first quarter most fidelity savers didn t make any changes to their accounts in the second quarter among those who did the biggest shift was into more conservative investments on wednesday stocks on wall street closed broadly lower as drops by big technology companies wiped out the s p 500 s gains for the week the benchmark index fell 0 7 percent snapping a three day winning streak the dow jones industrial average fell 0 5 percent and the tech heavy nasdaq slid 1 3 percent traders focused on a mix of retail updates that indicate inflation pressure continues to affect businesses and consumers but also shows that spending remains strong a government report showed retail sales were flat last month and target shares slumped after the retail chain reported a nearly 90 percent skid in quarterly profits you saw target coming out and being softer than we thought so maybe it spooked investors a little bit said sylvia jablonski chief investment officer at defiance etfs it s a small correction from the bear market rally the s p 500 slipped 31 16 points to 4 274 04 the loss pulled the index 0 1 percent lower so far this week pedestrians walk past the new york stock exchange on july 8 stocks fell on wednesday on the main markets the dow dropped 171 69 points to 33 980 32 while the nasdaq fell 164 43 points to 12 938 12 trading has been choppy throughout the week as the benchmark s p 500 comes off a four week winning streak pricey technology companies communication stocks and retailers had some of the biggest losses only energy stocks notched gains as the price of u s crude oil rose bond yields rose significantly the yield on the 10 year treasury rose to 2 89 percent from 2 81 percent late tuesday wall street has been closely reviewing the latest economic data and corporate updates to get a better sense of how inflation is affecting businesses and consumers and whether the hottest inflation in 40 years is peaking or beginning to cool investors are also monitoring inflation to determine how much further central banks have to go in their fight against higher prices sales at u s retailers were unchanged last month according to the commerce department and economists had expected a slight increase in july part of the weakness came from a 1 8 percent drop in gas sales reflecting lower prices at the pump meanwhile target fell 2 7 percent after reporting a nearly 90 percent plunge in second quarter profits as it was forced to slash prices to clear unwanted inventories the retailer warned earlier this summer that it was canceling orders from suppliers and aggressively cutting prices because of a pronounced spending shift by americans as the pandemic eased children s clothing and accessories chain children s place fell 11 percent after reporting a surprise second quarter loss as it faced supply chain problems and pressure from inflation britain s inflation rate rose to a new 40 year high of 10 1 percent in july a faster pace than in the u s and europe as climbing food prices in the united kingdom tightened a cost of living squeeze fueled by the soaring cost of energy the federal reserve has been raising interest rates in order to slow the economy and temper inflation but investors remain concerned that it could hit the brakes too hard and send the economy into a recession the fed in july raised its benchmark interest rate by three quarters of a point for a second straight time the central bank s minutes from last month s meeting of policymakers didn t offer any new insight into the fed s struggle to quell inflation the minutes released wednesday afternoon showed that fed policymakers expected the economy to expand in the second half of 2022 though many suggested that growth would weaken as higher rates take hold slower growth they noted could set the stage for inflation to gradually fall to the central bank s 2 percent annual goal though it remained far above that target but the policymakers made clear that for now they intend to continue raising rates enough to slow the economy
the float of haleon on the london market after the consumer healthcare concern was split from glaxosmithkline gsk was meant to be a great lift off for the ftse 100 among other things it would have been a sharp reminder to masayoshi son and softbank that the city would be a safe space to refloat arm holdings to achieve the kind of price its smart chip technology deserves instead the haleon float has subsided in spite of its shiny collection of consumer healthcare brands strong cash flows and the encouraging valuations of other similar branded firms including procter gamble and reckitt benckiser flop the float of haleon on the london stock exchange was supposed to promote the city as a safe space for firms initial public offerings haleon chairman dave lewis who turned the market tide at tesco and chief executive brian mcnamara have a mammoth task if they are to change investor opinion the valuation placed on haleon in july was 40billion including 10billion of debt loaded on to its balance sheet in trading this week haleon was valued at 24 1billion that is less than half the 50billion price put on the enterprise when unilever made its bid in january of this year whoever prematurely leaked details of unilever s offer effectively killing it after investors such as terry smith opposed the deal deprived gsk and minority haleon owner pfizer of a windfall given the current bargain basement price of haleon it might be thought that unilever would come racing back but boss alan jope was so stung by rejection that it left the dove to ben jerry s owner with very little wriggle room even if takeover panel rules were allowed to run their course haleon and gsk have both been stung by legal uncertainties mentioned in the float prospectus surrounding the manufacture sales and marketing of the ulcer and indigestion compound zantac both companies forcefully have rejected claims that zantac causes cancer quoting extensive studies by us and european drug regulators claimants suffered a setback in the illinois courts this week when joseph bayer dropped a claim that he developed oesophageal cancer from zantac use for personal health reasons zantac developed by gsk has been sold by various pharma giants over the years including pfizer and sanofi as well as generic manufacturers gsk asserted it did nothing to settle the case bloomberg reports that generic firms including israel s teva dr reddy s laboratories and others agreed to pay the plaintiff 500 000 415 000 to stop the matter going to trial but this is just the start with more than 2 000 lawsuits consolidated into one case to be heard on september 20 unless a settlement is reached the legal burden is likely to remain a shadow over haleon the ipo flop unfortunately feeds into a narrative encouraged by stock market duds such as deliveroo and the hut group that the london stock exchange is not fit for purpose when it comes to initial public offerings that is not a good post brexit message inflation tips if you thought it was just ordinary citizens who are suffering from the leap in british consumer prices to 10 1 per cent think again what about the poor helpless chief executives of global companies don t worry the brilliant minds at mckinsey have come out with a cut out and keep guide on how to cope suppliers need to redesign products and services to deliver better value chief executives need to take control of logistics previously the task of managers lower down the food chain reform procurement to cut costs and in tight labour markets focus on lifestyle needs to retain workers not just on pay mckinsey recommends prices are set to strengthen customer relations that may mean designing products with lower margins time investors recognised that companies are not just about earnings and dividends reality tv on the same track our biggest terrestrial broadcaster was punished by the market because chief executive carolyn mccall invested in streaming service itvx but data from regulator ofcom shows that 16 to 24 year olds prefer streaming and watch seven times less broadcast tv than the over 65s if there is to be a future for the uk s flagship commercial broadcaster beyond creation and production it needs to invest for the long term analysts need to wake up and look at the data

the first two paragraphs of the article described the inflation reduction act as a bill that took significant steps toward fulfilling his goal to modernize the american economy and laid out aspects such as lowering prescription drug costs for senior citizens and expanding low carbon electricity sources but starting at the third paragraph the proverbial glass became half empty what it does not do however is provide workers with many of the other sweeping economic changes that mr biden pledged would help americans earn more and enjoy the comforts of a middle class life after describing other legislative successes that biden has achieved such as the economic recovery package the infrastructure bill and funding for semiconductor development in the united states the article quickly pivoted by declaring but there is little dispute that mr biden has been unable to persuade lawmakers to go along with one of his biggest economic goals investing in workers families students and other people the article then listed further elements of biden s agenda from earlier bill negotiations which did not make it into this specific bill after more than a year of negotiations to accommodate the demands of all 50 democratic senators stating that these omissions add up to what liberal economists call a missed opportunity to help americans work more and earn more and to make the economy run more efficiently it was not until the 17th paragraph that the article returned to what was actually in the new law describing taxes on large corporations and stock buybacks then in the 24th and 25th paragraphs the article covered vital subjects addressed in the legislation such as cutting emissions extending health insurance subsidies and reducing the federal deficit the article didn t even fully credit the health components of the bill as an accomplishment instead saying that it was administration officials who considered them crucial to millions of workers then it slammed the supposed inadequacy of the climate focused components of the bill but the climate provision is also instructive for what mr biden has been unable to deliver the stark reality of the times hatchet job is revealed by comparing the piece article to an unlikely counterpart the top news article on the bill signing from the conservative leaning wall street journal part of the murdoch media empire while the journal noted in its own third paragraph that the law falls short of the ambitious vision mr biden laid out previously it still pivoted to focus on the president s accomplishments but it nonetheless marks a hard fought win for the president who less than a month ago was facing the prospect that a signature piece of his governing agenda was dead in the senate the journal s article focused heavily on democratic plans to promote the new package in the coming midterm elections as well as more detailed statistics on both the tax increases and incentives contained in the law the journal also noted that senior citizens on medicare will have their insulin prices capped at 35 per month something the times failed to mention it was only in the second last paragraph that the journal rehashed the compromises that had occurred in the bill s legislative history noting it was the product of a year of halting negotiations on capitol hill that had pared it down from biden s original proposals the difference can be seen by comparing the above the fold sections of each of the two papers front pages the times as shown above merely presented its gloomy headline and sub headline pairing the journal on the other hand featured a large photo of biden and key congressional democrats as the centerpiece of the page s top half with the headline biden signs sweeping climate healthcare bill into law
try to just make sure you make the right one all right right okay let me say from the start for this law the american people one and the special interest lost american people one and the special interests lost we have not wavered we ve not flinched and we ve not given in instead we re delivering results for the american people we didn t tear down we build up we didn t look back we look forward and today today offers further proof that the soul america s vibrant the future of america is bright and the promise of america is real and just beginning it s about showing the american and the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the all the talk of its demise not just for the privileged few but for all of us my fellow americans that s the choice we face we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build future where everybody has an even shot that s the america i believe in that s what i believe in and today today we ve come step closer to making that america real advertisement what s in the new climate and health care law share copy link copy president joe biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he signed tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for some 13 million people who are purchasing their own health care policies through the affordable care act biggest u s investment by far in climate change the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water how to pay for all of this one of the biggest revenue raisers in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year yet money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade sinema was instrumental in doing away with other tax proposals and shaping the final plan extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which recently put out a new report on long term projections what s left behind the package nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned remains a sizable undertaking and along with covid 19 relief and the gop 2017 tax cuts is among the more substantial bills from congress in years while congress did pass and biden signed into law a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that was part of the white house s initial vision the democrats other big priorities have slipped away gone for now are

the federal reserve released the minutes from its meeting in july at 2 00 p m today the reaction of the market was more skepticism about the fed s commitment to keep raising rates to fight inflation the fed hiked its target for the overnight federal funds borrowing rate three quarters of a percentage point at the july meeting but the markets interpreted the fed chairman s comments as indicating that perhaps the fed believed it was close to a rate that would successfully stifle inflation in particular a perhaps off the cuff reference by chairman jerome powell that the current 2 25 percent to 2 50 percent range was near neutral seemed to buoy hopes that the fed would back off of hikes and begin cutting rates again next year stocks have rallied recession fears have faded somewhat and both bond and derivative markets imply rate cuts next year this is the opposite of the tightening of financial conditions that the fed has been seeking to bring about through its interest rate hikes credit spreads have narrowed even mortgage rates the most direct pass through from fed policy rates to the real economy have tumbled after peaking at 5 81 percent the average 30 year mortgage fixed rate has fallen to 5 22 percent one of the first rules of investing is supposed to be don t fight the fed for the past month however fighting the fed s tightening has worked out just fine as we ve explained the market is really expressing doubts about the credibility of the fed s commitment to bringing down the rate of inflation to two percent investors putting their money into trades that loosen financial conditions by making riskier activity less pricey and therefore tend toward a higher level of economic activity and more inflation do not really think they are fighting the fed they think the fed simply is not going to fight them the fed will lose resolve sometime next year perhaps because unemployment ticks up a bit from the record low 3 5 percent hit in july and begin cutting rates the fed minutes released on wednesday did little to shake the market from this view the minutes told us that the fed does think it will keep tightening rates but that it would become appropriate at some point to slow the pace of policy rate increases while assessing the effects of cumulative policy adjustments on economic activity and inflation the dovish interpretation of this is that the fed already seems to be losing its nerve even though employment is still soaring unemployment is falling and the inflation rate had at the time of the meeting hit the highest point in over 40 years what s going to happen when unemployment starts moving up jobs growth slows to a trickle and the economy contracts for a third or fourth or fifth consecutive quarter how would the fed justify backing off on inflation in many ways it has already laid the groundwork many fed speakers have said there is little the fed can do to directly fight inflation caused by problems of supply they ve pointed to the war in ukraine as a source of inflation unlikely to be influenced by monetary policy it s easy enough to imagine fed officials noticing unemployment rising without having much of an influence on inflation and deciding that perhaps we just have to live with higher inflation for the duration there are lots of analysts and investors already talking about the fed deciding to settle into three percent inflation until global supply constraints have eased there s good reason to believe that unemployment may have to go much higher than fed official expect in order to tame inflation according to the version of economic theory widely subscribed to within the federal reserve and the economics profession there is a natural rate of unemployment this is often called nairu which stands for the non accelerating inflation rate of unemployment it is the rate of unemployment at which inflation does not accelerate when unemployment goes below nairu or the natural rate inflation picks up one problem of course is that the natural rate cannot be directly observed and it likely changes over time economists can make guesses at it but no one really knows what the natural rate is for a long time economists thought nairu might be between four and five percent or even higher in the trump years however we dropped far below that with no sign of inflation accelerating so economists had to lower their estimates of what the natural rate might be the economic projections of fed officials tell us that they think the long run unemployment rate will be four percent and that this is consistent with long run inflation at two percent so it s safe to say that the fed thinks the natural rate is four percent at a minimum this means that the fed probably thinks the unemployment rate needs to go above four percent to tame inflation indeed the minutes show unemployment at 4 1 percent at the end of 2024 and inflation at 2 2 percent that may be overly optimistic if four percent is the natural rate the decelerating inflation rate of unemployment is likely higher than one tenth of a point above that what s more there are reasons to suspect that the natural rate is higher than the fed projections show a recent note from analysts at bank of america argued that all the geographic and economic dislocations from the pandemic have pushed up the natural rate of unemployment an essay by olivier blanchard of the peterson institute for international economics and harvard s alex domash and lawrence h summers argued that the natural rate is probably as high as 4 9 percent that likely means the fed needs to push unemployment above five percent to tame inflation the market does not believe the fed will do anything like this next week when fed officials gather for their annual boondoggle in jackson wyoming we will look for clues about whether they think they have the monetary policy fortitude to actually restore price stability larry kudlow of fox business had us on his 4 00 p m show on wednesday to talk about jerome powell s credibility problem he appeared to largely agree with our point that the fed has not yet established itself as a reliable narrator of its own plans be sure to check it out we were on toward the end of the program but we recommend watching the whole thing because the earlier segments largely about the problems with the fraudulently named inflation reduction act were the best we ve seen on the subject

pakistan s external debt has skyrocketed to almost rs60 trillion sending a wave of concern across financial and economic circles the situation at the internal financial front is not rosy either with the domestic loan hitting the rs31 trillion mark given the current financial mess it seems that the imf tranche will only end up adding more to the pile of unbearable debts which might take years to repay if the country continues to borrow loans at the current pace it might find itself in a serious situation previously faced by some latin american countries which borrowed billions of dollars and pushed their homelands towards a financial meltdown a few decades back the ruling classes of mexico brazil and argentina borrowed over 700 billion alone creating a number of hardships for their people pakistan could face a similar situation with declining exports and rising imports the country will have to borrow more money there is no hope for a drastic improvement in the economy because all rulers have followed the dictation of the imf and other international financial institutions since the 1980s raising energy prices and interest rates currently we need at least 7 billion annually to serve external debts and another 7 billion to overcome the annual fiscal deficit this means that pakistan s external debt could witness a phenomenal surge in coming years some estimates suggest that the country s external debt could be as high as 400 billion in the next two decades this situation has prompted many politicians business leaders and financial experts to urge stakeholders to come up with a comprehensive plan to revive the economy and avoid an economic disaster prime minister shehbaz sharif has also underscored the need to evolve a consensus over economic issues urging all parties to agree on a charter of economy the prime minister did not elaborate what he meant by the charter of economy does it mean that a certain course of action should be taken to revitalize the economy does he want all stakeholders to find a panacea that could cure all economic ills is he wishing to see an economic model that is supported by all political parties and could be beneficial for the country if that is the case there is no need to evolve a consensus over the question of revitalizing the economy because when it comes to economic policies all political parties want to follow the same economic model that was trusted upon this country in the 1980s from general zia to benazir bhutto nawaz sharif to general musharraf and imran khan to shehbaz sharif all politicians favour policies of liberalization deregulation and privatization have our leaders ever spoken against private capital could our politicians say publicly that they do not want to privatize state run concerns despite the overwhelming evidence that such privatization has played havoc with the lives of millions of people besides causing deindustrialization in the country and heavy losses to the national exchequer our leaders never declared that the state would not dole out relief packages to stock exchanges and large businesses and never pondered over the economic hardships caused by the policies of privatization have they ever visited the workers who lost their jobs in the process of privatization which plunged their families in financial crisis with some of them even committing suicide after losing employment so when it comes to the economic policies of the country the strategy of all political parties is the same unfortunately state institutions are sympathetic towards the ideas of privatization liberalization and regulation from the media to the judiciary and the intellectual elite to the political class all seem to favour neoliberal policies all of them want to extend unwavering support to this anti people agenda all of them have tried to appease private capital by selling state owned commercial entities at throwaway prices all of them repeat the mantra of overstaffing in government run industries and commercial entities to justify the privatization of these public entities all have resorted to false propaganda of loss making entities without pointing out the factors behind such losses if the prime minister and members of the ruling alliance really want a charter of economy they should first explain how their economic policies are different from those of imran khan in what way is miftah ismail s pro liberal agenda different from pro rich and market oriented policies of shaukat tarin hafeez shaikh or even moeen qureshi and shaukat aziz the pti government burdened people with inflation and now the shehbaz government is increasing this burden the pti tried to privatize state run entities and the current government of khadim e ala is also planning to auction state owned industries and business entities the prime minister and his economic team will also have to get rid of this business school philosophy which asserts that states cannot do business they should study the economies of the countries that have planned and command economies for instance the ussr lost around 27 million people during the second world war besides witnessing the destruction of hundreds of cities and towns and over 32 000 industrial units but despite all this the ussr was the second best industrial country in the world in 1956 a notch behind the us china also witnessed phenomenal economic growth under a planned economic model with economic growth during the time of mao almost hitting five percent on average and life expectancy rising from 37 in 1949 to almost 62 during the 1970s literacy and other social indicators also improved central and eastern european countries also developed under the command economy with almost all countries in the two regions demonstrating miracles in the health education housing and industrial sectors this was despite the fact that china and poland were among the states that witnessed the highest number of killings after the ussr during world war ii the sanctions imposed on the socialist camp should also be taken into consideration while reviewing the economic performance of these states the prime minister and his team of experts should also explain the real causes behind the losses of public entities is it merely a coincidence that after the policies of liberalization in the 1980s all state entities started incurring losses pakistan international airlines pia that helped build two prestigious airlines is not on the verge of destruction because of overstaffing but due to the sale of its lucrative routes to a foreign company pakistan railways is incurring losses because its freight was doled out to a logistic company that has not only added to the railways problems but also caused the import bill to skyrocket the production of pakistan steel mills has come to a halt because its expansion programme of producing two million ton steel was not implemented by dictator zia the ruling elite must answer why their own businesses touch the heights of success when they employ their business skills but when the same skills are applied to national entities they start incurring unsustainable losses if the charter of economy is to be evolved the conflict of interest issue should be addressed it should be investigated why some banks were handed over to private capital for peanuts and why ipps are showered billions of rupees by every successive government the writer is a freelance journalist who can be reached at egalitarianism444 gmail com

2022 and for the first six months ended june 30 2022 although overall asset growth has been flat during the first half of 2022 we have been able to grow the loan portfolio through the redeployment of

the three months ended june 30 2022 this decrease of 0 4 million for the three months ended june 30 2022 was primarily due to lower loan origination levels for one to four family loans during the

fees total other expenses decreased from 2 5 million at june 30 2021 to 2 2 million for the three months ended june 30 2022 the decrease was primarily due to a 0 2 million decline in compensation

necessary reserves on non performing loans as of june 30 2022 were approximately 41 000 lower than they were as of june 30 2021 mostly due to the improvement of several credits and because the few

try to just make sure you make the right one all right right okay let me say from the start for this law the american people one and the special interest lost american people one and the special interests lost we have not wavered we ve not flinched and we ve not given in instead we re delivering results for the american people we didn t tear down we build up we didn t look back we look forward and today today offers further proof that the soul america s vibrant the future of america is bright and the promise of america is real and just beginning it s about showing the american and the american people that democracy still works in america notwithstanding all the all the talk of its demise not just for the privileged few but for all of us my fellow americans that s the choice we face we can protect the already powerful or show the courage to build future where everybody has an even shot that s the america i believe in that s what i believe in and today today we ve come step closer to making that america real advertisement what s in the new climate and health care law share copy link copy president joe biden arrived at the white house promising to build back america and legislation he signed tuesday delivers a slimmer though not insignificant version of that once sweeping idea approved by the divided congress the bill brings the biggest investment ever in the u s to fight climate change also in the legislation is a 2 000 cap on out of pocket prescription drug costs for medicare recipients as well as a new 15 corporate minimum tax to ensure big businesses pay their share and billions will be left over to pay down federal deficits all told the democrats inflation reduction act may not do much to immediately tame inflationary price hikes but the package an election year turnaround after loftier versions collapsed will touch countless american lives and secure longtime party goals democrats alone supported the package as republicans lined up against it republicans deride the 730 page bill as big government overreach and point particular criticism at its 80 billion investment in the irs to hire new employees and go after tax scofflaws voters will be left to sort it out in the november elections when control of congress will be decided not as robust as biden s initial ideas to rebuild america s public infrastructure and family support systems here s what s in the estimated 740 billion package made up of 440 billion in new spending and 300 billion toward easing deficits lower prescription drug costs launching a long sought goal the bill would allow the medicare program to negotiate some prescription drug prices with pharmaceutical companies saving the federal government some 288 billion over the 10 year budget window the result is expected to lower costs for older adults on medications including a 2 000 out of pocket cap for older adults buying prescriptions from pharmacies the revenue raised would also be used to provide free vaccinations for seniors who now are among the few not guaranteed free access according to a summary document seniors would also have insulin prices capped at 35 a month help paying for health insurance the bill would extend the subsidies provided during the covid 19 pandemic to help some americans who buy health insurance on their own under earlier pandemic relief the extra help was set to expire this year but the bill would allow the assistance to keep going for three more years lowering insurance premiums for some 13 million people who are purchasing their own health care policies through the affordable care act biggest u s investment by far in climate change the bill would infuse nearly 375 billion over the decade in climate change fighting strategies that democrats believe could put the country on a path to cut greenhouse gas emissions 40 by 2030 and would represent the single biggest climate investment in u s history by far for consumers that means tax rebates to buy electric vehicles 4 000 for used vehicle purchase and up to 7 500 for new ones eligible to households with incomes of 300 000 or less for couples or single people with income of 150 000 or less not all electric vehicles will fully qualify for the tax credits thanks to requirements that component parts be manufactured and assembled in the u s and pricier cars costing more than 55 000 and suvs and trucks priced above 80 000 are excluded there s also tax breaks for consumers to go green one is a 10 year consumer tax credit for renewable energy investments in wind and solar for businesses the bill has 60 billion for a clean energy manufacturing tax credit and 30 billion for a production tax credit for wind and solar seen as ways to boost and support the industries that can help curb the country s dependence on fossil fuels the bill also gives tax credits for nuclear power and carbon capture technology that oil companies such as exxon mobil have invested millions of dollars to advance the bill would impose a new fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas drilling while giving fossil fuel companies access to more leases on federal lands and waters a late addition pushed by sen kyrsten sinema d ariz and other democrats in arizona nevada and colorado would designate 4 billion to combat a mega drought in the west including conservation efforts in the colorado river basin which nearly 40 million americans rely on for drinking water how to pay for all of this one of the biggest revenue raisers in the bill is a new 15 minimum tax on corporations that earn more than 1 billion in annual profits it s a way to clamp down on some 200 u s companies that avoid paying the standard 21 corporate tax rate including some that end up paying no taxes at all the new corporate minimum tax would kick in after the 2022 tax year and raise more than 258 billion over the decade there will also be a new 1 excise tax imposed on stock buybacks raising some 74 billion over the decade savings from allowing medicare s negotiations with the drug companies is expected to bring in 288 billion over 10 years according to the non partisan congressional budget office the bill sticks with biden s original pledge not to raise taxes on families or businesses making less than 400 000 a year yet money is also raised by boosting the irs to go after tax cheats the bill proposes an 80 billion investment in taxpayer services enforcement and modernization which is projected to raise 203 billion in new revenue a net gain of 124 billion over the decade sinema was instrumental in doing away with other tax proposals and shaping the final plan extra money to pay down deficits with some 740 billion in new revenue and around 440 billion in new investments the bill promises to put the difference of about 300 billion toward deficit reduction federal deficits spiked during the covid 19 pandemic when federal spending soared and tax revenues fell as the nation s economy churned through shutdowns closed offices and other massive changes the nation has seen deficits rise and fall in recent years but overall federal budgeting is on an unsustainable path according to the congressional budget office which recently put out a new report on long term projections what s left behind the package nowhere near the sweeping build back better program biden once envisioned remains a sizable undertaking and along with covid 19 relief and the gop 2017 tax cuts is among the more substantial bills from congress in years while congress did pass and biden signed into law a 1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill for highways broadband and other investments that was part of the white house s initial vision the democrats other big priorities have slipped away gone for now are plans for free pre kindergarten and community college as well as the nation s first paid family leave program that would have provided up to 4 000 a month for births deaths and other pivotal needs also allowed to expire is the enhanced child care credit that was providing 300 a month during the pandemic ___associated press writer matthew daly contributed to this report
